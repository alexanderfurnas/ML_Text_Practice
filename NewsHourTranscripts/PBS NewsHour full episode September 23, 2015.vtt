WEBVTT

00:06.673 --> 00:09.743
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is
away.

00:09.743 --> 00:14.948
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Pope
Francis' first full day in
Washington. Thousands turn out

00:14.948 --> 00:19.653
to try to get a glimpse as he
tours the nation's capital.

00:19.653 --> 00:23.190
And on the eve of the pontiff's
address to Congress, Gwen's
interview with the chaplain

00:23.190 --> 00:25.692
of the House of Representatives.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.061
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY, Chaplain
of the House of Representatives:
I think it's been noticeable

00:28.061 --> 00:33.800
with Pope Francis that, when he
says things, it's like people
are like, for the first time

00:33.800 --> 00:38.705
say, geez, I can understand this
guy. I understand what he's
saying.

00:38.705 --> 00:43.844
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday: Migrants continue to
flood into Greece, as

00:43.844 --> 00:49.383
European leaders meet in
Brussels to try to agree on a
unified response.

00:49.383 --> 00:55.489
And remembering the plays and
phrases, of baseball great Yogi
Berra.

00:55.489 --> 01:01.728
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS "NewsHour."

01:01.728 --> 01:06.099
(BREAK)

01:06.099 --> 01:14.775
JUDY WOODRUFF: Washington went
from a full-time focus on
politics and government today to

01:14.775 --> 01:19.112
a full-time focus
on Pope Francis.

01:19.112 --> 01:22.082
William Brangham reports on this
first full day of the pope's
first visit to the United

01:22.082 --> 01:25.686
States.

01:25.686 --> 01:32.793
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The South Lawn
of the White House was a sea of
expectant faces this morning,

01:32.793 --> 01:38.865
as more than 11,000 turned out
to witness the sights and the
sounds of a full White

01:38.865 --> 01:43.403
House welcome.

01:43.403 --> 01:47.541
The pomp and circumstance
contrasted with the pontiff's
own modest arrival in a small

01:47.541 --> 01:53.347
gray Fiat. He was greeted by the
president and first lady and by
the cheering throng.

01:53.347 --> 02:01.955
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Holy Father, on
behalf of Michelle and myself,

02:01.955 --> 02:02.789
welcome to the White House.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.624
(APPLAUSE)

02:04.624 --> 02:09.763
BARACK OBAMA: I should explain
that our backyard is not
typically this crowded.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.765
(LAUGHTER)

02:11.765 --> 02:19.873
BARACK OBAMA: But the size and
the spirit of today's gathering
is just a small reflection

02:19.873 --> 02:26.013
of the deep devotion of some
70 million American Catholics.

02:26.013 --> 02:30.050
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Obama used the occasion to
commend Pope Francis for his
calls

02:30.050 --> 02:34.488
to action on several fronts, in
the president's words -- quote
-- "shaking us out of
complacency."

02:34.488 --> 02:39.693
BARACK OBAMA: You remind us that
the lord's most powerful message
is mercy. That means

02:39.693 --> 02:48.301
welcoming the stranger with
empathy and a truly open heart,
from the refugee who flees

02:48.301 --> 02:53.807
war-torn lands, to the immigrant
who leaves home in search of a
better life.

02:53.807 --> 02:59.613
And, Holy Father, you remind us
that we have a sacred obligation
to protect our planet,

02:59.613 --> 03:01.381
God's magnificent gift to us.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.450
(APPLAUSE)

03:03.450 --> 03:07.654
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
also thanked the pope for
assisting the diplomatic thaw

03:07.654 --> 03:12.592
between the U.S. and Cuba.
Francis then delivered his own
message in a soft voice and
halting

03:12.592 --> 03:16.997
English, most notably on the
challenge of a warming planet.

03:16.997 --> 03:25.072
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church: Accepting the urgency,
it seems clear to me also that

03:25.072 --> 03:33.680
climate change is a problem
which can no longer be left to a
future generation.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.149
(APPLAUSE)

03:36.149 --> 03:45.926
POPE FRANCIS: When it comes to
the care of our common home, we
are living at a critical

03:45.926 --> 03:48.395
moment of history.

03:48.395 --> 03:52.466
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That appeal
seemed sure to please the
political left, but the pope

03:52.466 --> 03:55.735
took a conservative tack, too,
reaffirming that Roman Catholics
want their belief in

03:55.735 --> 03:58.839
traditional marriage respected.

03:58.839 --> 04:07.214
POPE FRANCIS: With countless
other people of goodwill, they
are likewise concerned that

04:07.214 --> 04:15.789
efforts to build a just and
wisely ordered society respect
their deepest concerns and

04:15.789 --> 04:19.426
the right to religious liberty.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.895
(APPLAUSE)

04:21.895 --> 04:30.537
POPE FRANCIS: That freedom
reminds one of America's most
precious possessions.

04:30.537 --> 04:36.276
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The pope and
president then moved inside for
a closed door 40-minute meeting

04:36.276 --> 04:42.582
in the Oval Office. And from
there, Francis moved on to a
parade in his honor. In his

04:42.582 --> 04:45.519
signature Popemobile, he
traveled along the National Mall
and was greeted by thousands

04:45.519 --> 04:48.021
of screaming supporters.

04:48.021 --> 04:53.960
At one point, a young girl ran
through security barricades, the
motorcade stopped, and, at

04:53.960 --> 04:59.199
the pope's urging, Secret
Service agents brought the child
to him. After that, it was on to

04:59.199 --> 05:08.408
St. Matthew's Cathedral to
meet with American bishops.

05:08.408 --> 05:12.979
Francis led a prayer service,
and under a mosaic of Saint
Matthew, he spoke in Italian

05:12.979 --> 05:17.517
of the need for the American
church to emerge from its
long-running sexual abuse
scandal.

05:17.517 --> 05:21.755
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): I realize how much
the pain of recent years has
weighed

05:21.755 --> 05:26.393
upon you, and I have supported
your generous commitment to
bring healing to victims, in

05:26.393 --> 05:30.597
the knowledge that, in healing,
we too are healed and to work to
ensure that such crimes

05:30.597 --> 05:33.166
will never be repeated.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.470
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All this was
preamble for the main event of
the papal day, a canonization

05:37.470 --> 05:42.075
mass held at the National Shrine
of the Immaculate Conception.

05:42.075 --> 05:46.546
Some 25,000 people poured onto
the grounds to hear the pope's
words:

05:46.546 --> 05:52.219
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): We are heirs to a
bold missionary spirit of so
many

05:52.219 --> 05:56.790
men and women who preferred not
to be shut up within structures
which give us a false

05:56.790 --> 06:01.995
sense of security, within habits
which make us feel safe, while
at our door people are

06:01.995 --> 06:06.066
starving. We are indebted to a
tradition, a chain of witnesses
who have made it possible

06:06.066 --> 06:09.803
for the good news of the Gospel
to be in every generation.

06:09.803 --> 06:13.640
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As part of the
service, the pope conferred
sainthood on Junipero Serra,

06:13.640 --> 06:18.712
a Franciscan friar from Spain
who brought Catholicism to
California in the 1700s. It

06:18.712 --> 06:22.515
marked the first canonization
held on U.S. soil.

06:22.515 --> 06:27.320
But the move has not been met
with universal praise. American
Indian groups and others

06:27.320 --> 06:32.025
argue that Serra helped wipe out
indigenous populations and
enslaved converts.

06:32.025 --> 06:36.129
The mass capped off the pope's
first full day in Washington.
Tomorrow, he will address

06:36.129 --> 06:39.733
a joint meeting of Congress
before going on to New York and
Philadelphia.

06:39.733 --> 06:44.271
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, for more, I
spoke with William a short time
ago during that mass

06:44.271 --> 06:48.074
at the National Shrine of
the Immaculate Conception.

06:48.074 --> 06:53.580
So, William, you have watched
the pope arrive for this mass.
What have you seen?

06:53.580 --> 06:57.784
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hi, Judy.

06:57.784 --> 07:00.887
It's just been a tremendous
response that the pope has been
getting here. We have been

07:00.887 --> 07:05.091
at the National Shrine for the
last several hours. Incredible
security to get through

07:05.091 --> 07:09.462
here. And most of the families
that we met have been waiting
here since 9:00, 10:00,

07:09.462 --> 07:12.799
11:00 this morning to get in,
but everyone seemed to be in
very good spirits. They were

07:12.799 --> 07:15.935
thrilled to see the
pope up close.

07:15.935 --> 07:20.740
And when he came in at about
5:00 tonight, he drove his
Popemobile right through the

07:20.740 --> 07:25.245
middle of the crowd. And it was
an interesting reaction. The
group that are in the seated

07:25.245 --> 07:31.184
section, sort of closer to the
Basilica itself, offered very
polite, muted applause for him.

07:31.184 --> 07:37.023
The crowd in the standing-room
area went absolutely wild for
him, just enthusiastic,
erupting,

07:37.023 --> 07:40.860
cheering, waving, and just a
really tremendous reaction.

07:40.860 --> 07:46.733
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it seems
that he's the one who's enjoying
this a lot as well. I saw

07:46.733 --> 07:51.971
him this morning reaching out,
shaking hands, a big smile on
his face. Then, this afternoon,

07:51.971 --> 07:57.077
he asked the security people to
bring children over to him, so
he could kiss them while he

07:57.077 --> 08:00.013
was in the Popemobile,
downtown Washington.

08:00.013 --> 08:03.116
It's very much a
two-way street here.

08:03.116 --> 08:07.620
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I think that's
right. I mean, I think he
obviously feeds off of the

08:07.620 --> 08:12.425
reaction. He's known as this
pope who just wants to have
impromptu meetings with people

08:12.425 --> 08:17.197
and very much loves the
serendipity of those moments.
Obviously, that poses great
complications

08:17.197 --> 08:19.699
for people who are trying to
protect him and to keep him on
schedule. But we saw a little

08:19.699 --> 08:22.202
bit of that as he came through.

08:22.202 --> 08:27.574
I mean, I think, obviously, this
is a 78-year-old man. He's a
little tired. He wasn't -- I
think,

08:27.574 --> 08:32.011
by the end of the day today, he
was a little bit tired. It felt
like most of his mass tonight

08:32.011 --> 08:37.350
also was a very subdued affair.
But, clearly, he's getting some
energy from the crowds here.

08:37.350 --> 08:43.123
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, finally,
William, about this canonization
of a Spanish missionary

08:43.123 --> 08:48.795
in California. It's something
that's been pretty
controversial. Tell us about
this.

08:48.795 --> 08:52.232
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, Junipero
Serra is the man who's now the
most recent Catholic

08:52.232 --> 08:56.369
saint added to the
pantheon of saints.

08:56.369 --> 09:01.007
And he is beloved by Catholics
for being an incredible
evangelist. He came up from
Mexico

09:01.007 --> 09:07.247
and California in the 1700s and
converted and evangelized to a
lot of indigenous people

09:07.247 --> 09:13.186
who were living there at the
time. Now, of course, conversion
and evangelization is one

09:13.186 --> 09:15.688
thing when you're looking at it
from the Catholic perspective.

09:15.688 --> 09:19.659
When you're looking at it from
the Native American perspective,
that can seem like a

09:19.659 --> 09:26.566
very different interaction. And
he had been criticized by
indigenous groups for Serra's

09:26.566 --> 09:30.603
very rough treatment of these
people. So, the pope has endured
some controversy. And

09:30.603 --> 09:35.975
in the past, the pope has
apologized for the sins of
colonization, as he says it.

09:35.975 --> 09:38.745
But he still believes that
Serra's mission is a powerful
one and one he wants to hold

09:38.745 --> 09:41.614
up to the entire Catholic world.

09:41.614 --> 09:45.885
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
William Brangham following Pope
Francis as he conducts a mass

09:45.885 --> 09:47.720
here in Washington,
thank you, William.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.557
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Thank you, Judy.

09:50.557 --> 09:55.995
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day's
other news, the head of the
German automaker Volkswagen

09:55.995 --> 10:01.835
is out, amid a scandal over
rigging diesel cars to pass
pollution tests. CEO Martin
Winterkorn

10:01.835 --> 10:05.004
announced today
he's stepping down.

10:05.004 --> 10:10.276
He denied any personal
wrongdoing, but in a statement,
said -- quote -- "Volkswagen

10:10.276 --> 10:16.149
needs a fresh start. I am
clearing the way for this fresh
start with my resignation."

10:16.149 --> 10:20.286
Germany's economy minister
warned today against assuming
the scandal will do lasting harm

10:20.286 --> 10:25.258
to V.W. or to the
German economy.

10:25.258 --> 10:31.030
In Egypt, two imprisoned
Al-Jazeera journalists received
presidential pardons in a case
that's

10:31.030 --> 10:37.604
drawn international attention.
Hours later, Canadian Mohamed
Fahmy and Egyptian national

10:37.604 --> 10:42.876
Baher Mohamed, joined by their
wives, were released in Cairo.
They had been arrested

10:42.876 --> 10:48.715
in December 2013 and convicted
of reporting what the government
called false news.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.850
MOHAMED FAHMY, Journalist: Where
are we going to start? I don't
know. What are we going

10:50.850 --> 10:54.687
to do? We're going to travel the
world. We're going to celebrate.
We're going to party and,

10:54.687 --> 11:00.193
you know, we just really hope
that this is -- our families
have suffered so much since

11:00.193 --> 11:03.429
the beginning of this trial, and
we're very happy that President
Sisi took this action

11:03.429 --> 11:05.665
and released us.

11:05.665 --> 11:11.004
JUDY WOODRUFF: A third
Al-Jazeera journalist had
already been deported.

11:11.004 --> 11:17.110
The coup in the West African
nation of Burkina Faso is
apparently over, after just one
week.

11:17.110 --> 11:21.814
The interim president of the
country announced today he's
returned to power. He had the
backing

11:21.814 --> 11:26.219
of the military, which opposed
the coup by members of the
presidential guard. Burkina

11:26.219 --> 11:31.057
Faso is supposed to hold
elections next month.

11:31.057 --> 11:36.262
Chinese President Xi Jinping
turned his attention to doing
business today on the first leg
of

11:36.262 --> 11:42.702
his visit to the U.S. It is Xi's
tour of a Boeing plant near
Seattle, and it coincided

11:42.702 --> 11:47.774
with news that Chinese firms
will buy 300 aircraft. And he
spoke of broader cooperation

11:47.774 --> 11:50.643
with the U.S.

11:50.643 --> 11:57.250
XI JINPING, Chinese President
(through translator): In the
last 36 years, since China and
the

11:57.250 --> 12:01.654
United States established
diplomatic relations, our
relationship has been forging
forward.

12:01.654 --> 12:06.459
I intend to have in-depth
exchange of views with President
Obama and other American leaders

12:06.459 --> 12:09.329
to make sure that this
relationship will deliver more
tangible benefits to people in
our two

12:09.329 --> 12:12.098
countries and elsewhere
in the world.

12:12.098 --> 12:16.502
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a Seattle
speech last night, Xi also said
that the U.S. and China can work

12:16.502 --> 12:19.272
together to address
cyber-crimes.

12:19.272 --> 12:27.213
U.S. officials have strongly
suggested China was behind a
huge breach of federal personnel

12:27.213 --> 12:33.953
records. Now it turns out the
hackers stole 5.6 million
fingerprint images. That number,

12:33.953 --> 12:38.825
from the Office of Personnel
Management, is five times more
than first reported. The images

12:38.825 --> 12:44.397
were part of applications for
federal security clearances.

12:44.397 --> 12:49.602
President Obama is voicing
doubts that a U.N. summit in
Paris this year will do enough
to

12:49.602 --> 12:55.808
cut carbon emissions. In
"Rolling Stone" magazine's
latest cover story, he says --
quote -- "Whatever

12:55.808 --> 13:00.980
various country targets are,
it's still going to fall short
of what the science requires."

13:00.980 --> 13:05.785
Even so, the president says he
hopes for aggressive enough
targets.

13:05.785 --> 13:11.958
Wall Street had another down
day, driven by falling oil
prices and weak factory data.

13:11.958 --> 13:18.898
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 50 points to below 16280.
The Nasdaq fell four points.

13:18.898 --> 13:23.202
And the S&P 500
also dropped four.

13:23.202 --> 13:29.475
And today marked the high point
of the hajj, the annual
pilgrimage of Muslims to Mecca.

13:29.475 --> 13:34.414
Some two million people made
their way to Mount Arafat
outside the city for a day of

13:34.414 --> 13:41.254
prayer and repentance. Many held
umbrellas to shield against the
sun.

13:41.254 --> 13:45.425
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
an emergency meeting of Europe's
leaders to address the

13:45.425 --> 13:52.198
refugee crisis; can the U.S.
government avoid a shutdown next
week?; plus, the priest who

13:52.198 --> 14:00.239
oversees one-half of Congress on
the pope's speech at the
Capitol, and much more.

14:00.239 --> 14:15.121
More than 2, 5,000 refugees
arrived on the Greek island of
Lesbos today, representing

14:15.121 --> 14:21.027
a sharp spike in arrivals on the
island. In Brussels, European
Union leaders held tense

14:21.027 --> 14:25.331
discussions. They are split on
the continent's response to the
unfolding crisis.

14:25.331 --> 14:28.034
Hari Sreenivasan has more.

14:28.034 --> 14:31.771
HARI SREENIVASAN: Those tense
discussions have centered on how
many refugees will be

14:31.771 --> 14:36.909
resettled across the 28
countries of the European Union,
and who will pay for them.

14:36.909 --> 14:41.214
But, as ministers talked in
Brussels, the arrivals of
refugees and migrants continued

14:41.214 --> 14:45.518
in Athens, which is where
special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant is tonight.

14:45.518 --> 14:50.857
MALCOLM BRABANT: The typical day
on the migrant trail: the
arrival at Athens' main port of

14:50.857 --> 14:57.864
a ferry from Lesbos, the island
where most asylum seekers enter
Greece.

14:57.864 --> 15:03.903
Just one ship disgorges some
2,000 people. Sometimes, there
are three ferries a day,

15:03.903 --> 15:10.910
a fraction of the problem being
discussed by European leaders
who met in Brussels today.

15:10.910 --> 15:14.947
Many have not eaten during the
15-hour voyage, and storm a
feeding station set up by a
group

15:14.947 --> 15:21.654
of Muslims from
Northern England.

15:21.654 --> 15:26.492
This crisis is undermining the
two-decade experiment of a
united Europe, as prime
ministers

15:26.492 --> 15:31.330
and presidents fight over how to
respond to the influx.
Meanwhile, ordinary citizens are

15:31.330 --> 15:36.135
doing what they can, in this
case trying to provide more than
1,000 meals a day.

15:36.135 --> 15:40.940
MAN: Obviously, life -- life as
they know it doesn't exist
anymore. If I knew what Europe

15:40.940 --> 15:45.378
could do, I wouldn't be here.
All I know is these people, they
are homeless. They're foodless.

15:45.378 --> 15:49.949
Whatever we can do to help them.

15:49.949 --> 15:54.487
MALCOLM BRABANT: Similar chaotic
scenes play out in Athens'
Victoria Square, where hungry

15:54.487 --> 16:01.894
migrant children fight to grab a
milk carton from a charity
bundle delivered by a Greek.

16:01.894 --> 16:06.065
This square is a staging post
for those at the wrong end of
the refugee class system

16:06.065 --> 16:12.104
devised by Europe. Priority has
been given to Syrians, Eritreans
and Iraqis, but many

16:12.104 --> 16:16.876
of those in Victoria are from
Central Asia, and the Afghans
especially wonder why the

16:16.876 --> 16:20.780
continuing conflict in their
country is not considered as
perilous.

16:20.780 --> 16:24.984
MAN: You know better. In
Afghanistan, there's a war,
Taliban, Da'esh, because people
don't

16:24.984 --> 16:27.687
war. People want peace.

16:27.687 --> 16:33.793
MALCOLM BRABANT: But, in
Brussels, the argument is over
the present and a plan to
distribute

16:33.793 --> 16:39.732
120,000 refugees by quotas
across the 28 members of the
European Union.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.435
European Council
President Donald Tusk:

16:42.435 --> 16:46.639
DONALD TUSK, European Council
President: We have now reached a
critical point where we

16:46.639 --> 16:57.717
need to end this cycle of mutual
recriminations and
misunderstandings. Today, our
debate must

16:57.717 --> 17:04.457
be based on facts, not
illusions and to emotions.

17:04.457 --> 17:09.495
MALCOLM BRABANT: Heads of states
convened this evening to discuss
financial assistance

17:09.495 --> 17:13.599
to help with the refugees both
in Europe and in the Middle
East. But the main debate was

17:13.599 --> 17:19.839
on the quota deal, voted through
by a majority of European
interior ministers yesterday.

17:19.839 --> 17:24.744
It came over the loud objections
of four countries: Czech
Republic, Romania, Hungary and
Slovakia,

17:24.744 --> 17:27.980
whose foreign minister
blasted the plan.

17:27.980 --> 17:32.184
ROBERT FICO, Slovakian Prime
Minister (through translator):
Slovakia will file a legal
complaint

17:32.184 --> 17:37.290
against mandatory redistribution
of refugees. We will not
implement these decisions of the

17:37.290 --> 17:40.693
interior ministers, because the
quotas are meaningless. The
system will not work and

17:40.693 --> 17:44.463
Slovakia will not be
forced to adopt quotas.

17:44.463 --> 17:49.902
MALCOLM BRABANT: The European
Union plan to resettle 120,000
migrants has been criticized

17:49.902 --> 17:56.275
by the U.N. Refugee Agency, the
UNHCR. A spokeswoman said the
relocation plan was just not
sufficient

17:56.275 --> 18:02.415
to resolve the crisis. She
complained that it was only
120,000 spread over two years.

18:02.415 --> 18:08.421
And considering that, as of
today, 480,000 people had
arrived in Europe by boat, the

18:08.421 --> 18:11.357
numbers were clearly not
sufficient. She said the E.U.
states would have to revise
those

18:11.357 --> 18:16.963
figures upwards and
resettle more.

18:16.963 --> 18:21.667
In order to pacify reluctant
European nations, the commission
president is reportedly
promising

18:21.667 --> 18:26.872
measures to speed up the
deportation of failed asylum
seekers. So many of these people
in

18:26.872 --> 18:30.710
Victoria Square could have paid
a fortune and risked their lives
for nothing.

18:30.710 --> 18:34.647
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Athens.

18:34.647 --> 18:40.119
HARI SREENIVASAN: We take a
closer look at Europe's approach
to the crisis with William

18:40.119 --> 18:44.957
Swing, director-general of the
International Organization for
Migration and former U.S.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.361
diplomat, and David O'Sullivan,
the European Union's ambassador
to Washington.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.130
Ambassador O'Sullivan, I
want to start with you.

18:51.130 --> 18:56.302
What's happening in Europe right
now seems a tension between
sovereignty and solidarity.

18:56.302 --> 19:01.574
You have got countries like
Hungary, Romania, the Czech
Republic and Slovakia saying
that

19:01.574 --> 19:07.279
this idea to distribute 120,000
migrants across their countries
undermines their independence.

19:07.279 --> 19:10.416
DAVID O'SULLIVAN, European Union
Ambassador to the United States:
Well, we are having

19:10.416 --> 19:15.521
a healthy discussion, as we
often do in Europe, about how to
deal with this particular
crisis.

19:15.521 --> 19:19.558
This is a global crisis. Europe
and a number of our member
states find themselves at the

19:19.558 --> 19:25.531
sharp end of one aspect of it,
which is the sudden increase in
asylum seekers arriving

19:25.531 --> 19:30.636
initially through the
Mediterranean and now by land.
We are having to cope with this,

19:30.636 --> 19:33.105
find ways of taking the pressure
off those front-line member
states. There was an important

19:33.105 --> 19:35.374
decision taken yesterday.

19:35.374 --> 19:40.880
Of course, this is not easy for
some of our member states. But I
would like to emphasize

19:40.880 --> 19:45.251
what Europe has been doing in
terms of addressing the problem
in the Mediterranean with search

19:45.251 --> 19:52.691
and rescue, nearly 122,000 lives
saved, with a naval effort to
try and break the smugglers

19:52.691 --> 19:55.861
who are exploiting the people,
assistance to Italy and Greece
to help them cope with

19:55.861 --> 19:57.730
this.

19:57.730 --> 20:01.700
And, of course, we should not
lose sight of the fact that the
real problem lies elsewhere.

20:01.700 --> 20:06.472
It lies in Syria and, of course,
it lies in the many millions of
people, instead of just

20:06.472 --> 20:10.876
hundreds of thousands, who are
displaced living both in Syria
and in the neighboring countries

20:10.876 --> 20:15.881
who have had to shoulder an
enormous burden. Europe is one
of the largest donors to those

20:15.881 --> 20:18.918
countries to try and help them,
but we need to do more, all of
us.

20:18.918 --> 20:23.389
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ambassador
Swing, what happens to people
when they are sent to countries

20:23.389 --> 20:27.526
that have clearly said they
don't want these people there?

20:27.526 --> 20:30.362
WILLIAM SWING, Director-General,
International Organization for
Migration: Well, as Ambassador

20:30.362 --> 20:34.133
O'Sullivan was mentioning, this
is an evolutionary process.

20:34.133 --> 20:38.704
I think we are encouraged by the
evolution of Europe's policy,
particularly since April

20:38.704 --> 20:45.478
of last year, when the emphasis
became that of saving life, the
increase of the number

20:45.478 --> 20:49.748
of ships out trying to do search
and rescue, and then the big
decision yesterday on the

20:49.748 --> 20:53.886
100 and -- bringing the number
of relocations up to 160,000.

20:53.886 --> 20:59.492
It's a long way to go. And this
is really the short-term aspect
of the policy. Europe

20:59.492 --> 21:03.629
is still trying to pursue a very
elusive objective of a common
migration and asylum policy, so

21:03.629 --> 21:06.799
a good deal way to go there.

21:06.799 --> 21:11.904
But we also need to keep it in
perspective. We're at 480,000
now, I think, who have come

21:11.904 --> 21:18.844
into Europe, into the E.U. But
we also need to remember that
countries like Ethiopia,

21:18.844 --> 21:25.618
700,000 refugees, Kenya 400,000,
Sudan 200,000. And little
Lebanon, with five million
inhabitants,

21:25.618 --> 21:28.454
has more than a million
they're hosting.

21:28.454 --> 21:33.259
So, we need to keep it in
perspective. It's really not so
much a problem to be solved,

21:33.259 --> 21:39.031
as a human reality that has to
be managed by sensible people.
And we're very pleased

21:39.031 --> 21:44.170
to see that so many of the
European Union states did agree
now to the formula of 120,000

21:44.170 --> 21:46.338
-- 160,000.

21:46.338 --> 21:51.644
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ambassador
O'Sullivan, as you mentioned
earlier and as Ambassador Swing

21:51.644 --> 21:56.448
just mentioned, what about the
rest of those populations? I
mean, 120,000 sounds like a

21:56.448 --> 22:00.686
big number, but 80 percent to 90
percent of even just the Syrian
refugees are sitting

22:00.686 --> 22:06.192
in Turkey, in Jordan, in
Lebanon. Right now, when they
look at their TVs and they see
this

22:06.192 --> 22:10.596
opportunity to come to Europe,
this might be the time for them.

22:10.596 --> 22:14.867
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: Well, I think
that, indeed, the situation of
those displace people is

22:14.867 --> 22:17.770
-- has to be our top priority.

22:17.770 --> 22:22.208
But the fact is that the
international agencies, UNHCR
and the World Food Program in
particular,

22:22.208 --> 22:27.313
have basically run out of money.
The European Union has announced
today its intention to

22:27.313 --> 22:32.017
increase even beyond the four
billion that we have been giving
until now. And the United

22:32.017 --> 22:36.755
States is also a major donor in
the area. We need to do more.
We're calling on the
international

22:36.755 --> 22:41.594
community to step up and give
more money to the Food Program,
to the UNHCR.

22:41.594 --> 22:45.664
We have created a trust fund for
Syria which we hope other
countries will contribute to.

22:45.664 --> 22:52.338
We put $1.8 billion into a trust
fund for Africa to help with the
countries that Ambassador

22:52.338 --> 22:57.810
Swing was talking about, because
sub-Saharan Africa is also a
potential crisis point.

22:57.810 --> 23:04.416
So, yes, this is a global
crisis. And Europe is
experiencing the consequences of
it in

23:04.416 --> 23:09.989
one way, but we shouldn't lose
sight of the fact that we really
do need to create conditions

23:09.989 --> 23:16.061
to help Lebanon, Jordan and
Turkey in particular give the
people who are there decent
food,

23:16.061 --> 23:20.032
shelter, medical care and so
forth, while we try to solve the
political problem in Syria,

23:20.032 --> 23:24.270
which would hopefully enable as
many people as possible to come
home.

23:24.270 --> 23:27.506
HARI SREENIVASAN: And,
Ambassador O'Sullivan, staying
with you just for a second, is
this

23:27.506 --> 23:32.845
threatening the very notion of
the Schengen area, the 22
countries that now allow free

23:32.845 --> 23:35.948
travel between them, when you
see one country deciding to put
up barbed wire fence, another

23:35.948 --> 23:37.983
country starting to ask
for passport controls?

23:37.983 --> 23:41.654
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: No,
it's not at all.

23:41.654 --> 23:45.557
The free movement within Europe
is one of our great
achievements. Of course, in a
moment

23:45.557 --> 23:50.896
of crisis and a moment of great
difficulty, coping with large
numbers of asylum seekers,

23:50.896 --> 23:54.667
temporary controls can be
reintroduced, but the commission
today called for these to be

23:54.667 --> 23:59.705
progressively dismantled as we
try to put in place the means to
help member states deal

23:59.705 --> 24:03.809
with this situation, including
helping them process all of the
applications, because these

24:03.809 --> 24:09.181
people, once they look for
asylum, there is a quite complex
legal process which has to

24:09.181 --> 24:11.884
be followed, which is
quite labor-intensive.

24:11.884 --> 24:17.189
And we are proposing to help the
member states who are challenged
in this way to process

24:17.189 --> 24:20.592
these people correctly and to
make sure that they are kept in
the best conditions possible

24:20.592 --> 24:23.195
during that.

24:23.195 --> 24:26.932
HARI SREENIVASAN: Ambassador
Swing, what about the notion
that many of these countries
have

24:26.932 --> 24:31.570
is, listen, security concerns,
economic concerns, political
concerns before letting
thousands

24:31.570 --> 24:34.506
or hundreds of thousands
of people in?

24:34.506 --> 24:40.546
WILLIAM SWING: There is no
question that a lot of the
policies today are being driven

24:40.546 --> 24:46.385
by an unprecedented anti-migrant
sentiment afoot in the world,
not just in Europe, but

24:46.385 --> 24:49.555
in other countries.

24:49.555 --> 24:56.829
It's driven by the fears of the
2008-2009 economic downturn,
when perhaps one's going

24:56.829 --> 25:02.101
to lose one's job. It's driven
by the 9/11 -- the post-9/11
security syndrome, where

25:02.101 --> 25:05.504
people are afraid, obviously,
of terrorists coming in.

25:05.504 --> 25:09.775
It's also driven by a sense of
the loss of personal or national
identity. And I think,

25:09.775 --> 25:14.847
with all of these, there are
ways to address this. These are
stereotypes that don't really

25:14.847 --> 25:22.321
meet the reality that,
historically, migration has
always been overwhelmingly
positive. And

25:22.321 --> 25:27.493
we need to get back to a
positive narrative in the
public, rather than the toxic
narrative

25:27.493 --> 25:30.295
that we have now.

25:30.295 --> 25:37.669
And to do this, we're going to
have to help everyone to learn
to manage inexorably growing

25:37.669 --> 25:42.508
cultural, ethnic, religious
diversity within our countries.

25:42.508 --> 25:44.676
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Ambassador Swing and Ambassador
O'Sullivan, thanks so much

25:44.676 --> 25:50.249
for joining us.

25:50.249 --> 26:00.826
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congress is
exactly one week away from
another funding deadline and
another

26:00.826 --> 26:04.229
possible government shutdown.

26:04.229 --> 26:08.834
But with the pope's visit this
week, lawmakers will not get
back to the contentious issue

26:08.834 --> 26:13.372
of funding Planned Parenthood
until late tomorrow. How that is
resolved will determined whether

26:13.372 --> 26:15.974
a shutdown takes place.

26:15.974 --> 26:19.845
For the very latest, I'm joined
by our political director, Lisa
Desjardins.

26:19.845 --> 26:23.949
So, Lisa, given this debate
about Planned Parenthood that's
been going on for weeks

26:23.949 --> 26:26.919
and weeks, where does
everything stand right now?

26:26.919 --> 26:29.721
LISA DESJARDINS: I think, for
all of the heated debate and
important topics here, right
now,

26:29.721 --> 26:32.124
Judy, it comes down
to the calendar.

26:32.124 --> 26:36.061
So, let me take people through
where we are right now. First of
all, the deadline that

26:36.061 --> 26:40.799
matters is September 30. That is
the deadline by which Congress
needs to fund most of
government.

26:40.799 --> 26:45.103
Now, of course, here we are.
Tomorrow, we have that vote you
mentioned in the Senate.

26:45.103 --> 26:49.508
That is a vote in which the
Senate will vote on a bill that
would defund Planned Parenthood,

26:49.508 --> 26:51.910
but fund everything else in
government. It's expected to
fail.

26:51.910 --> 26:54.847
So, what then?

26:54.847 --> 26:56.615
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because they need
60 votes, the way the Senate
works, and they can't get

26:56.615 --> 26:58.484
the 60.

26:58.484 --> 27:00.586
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.
Republicans don't have 60 votes.
So, even though most

27:00.586 --> 27:05.090
Republicans will vote for that,
it's not expected to get the 60
votes that is needed.

27:05.090 --> 27:08.994
So, that will leave an opening.
How does Congress fund
government? And that will leave
these

27:08.994 --> 27:12.664
three days, next Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday, in order for
Congress to figure that out,

27:12.664 --> 27:16.902
not a lot of time and not a lot
of space in order to do that.

27:16.902 --> 27:19.838
JUDY WOODRUFF: But now the real
threat, as you and I were
talking earlier, is in the

27:19.838 --> 27:23.742
House, where you have this very
determined group of Republicans
saying, no matter what,

27:23.742 --> 27:25.577
they're not going to vote
to fund Planned Parenthood.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.079
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

27:27.079 --> 27:31.683
The House Freedom Caucus, about
30 members, has said no way will
they vote for anything

27:31.683 --> 27:36.655
that funds Planned Parenthood,
which is what may be ending --
may come out of the Senate.

27:36.655 --> 27:40.659
It may be one of the only
options from the Senate. They
say they won't vote for it. That

27:40.659 --> 27:43.295
means that Speaker Boehner
probably doesn't have enough
Republican votes to pass it with

27:43.295 --> 27:46.098
just Republicans.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.867
Beyond that caucus, there's
other Republicans who are on the
fence as well. They see this

27:48.867 --> 27:53.171
as a moral vote. So, you do the
math, as our viewers are
probably doing right now, it's

27:53.171 --> 27:57.142
obvious that Republicans will
need Democrats in order to fund
government at this point.

27:57.142 --> 28:00.212
And it's not clear exactly
what the plan is.

28:00.212 --> 28:04.182
That's why the concern now.
There's not a clear plan for how
they get out of this.

28:04.182 --> 28:07.486
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two quick
questions. Speaker Boehner, is
it known where he stands on
whether

28:07.486 --> 28:10.756
a government shutdown is
the right thing to do?

28:10.756 --> 28:13.292
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, Speaker
Boehner and everyone around him
has said, clearly, no,

28:13.292 --> 28:16.361
we do not want a
government shutdown.

28:16.361 --> 28:22.067
That's been his mantra. However,
how he avoids one is another
question. I just got off the

28:22.067 --> 28:25.137
phone with a veteran member of
Congress who said no one in
leadership in the House or

28:25.137 --> 28:30.909
Senate wants a shutdown.
However, his words, accidents do
happen.

28:30.909 --> 28:35.948
And that's how they look at
2013. The dynamics then, Judy,
very similar to now. There was

28:35.948 --> 28:39.251
a caucus I called the no way
caucus. It dug in, wouldn't a
support a funding bill that

28:39.251 --> 28:42.387
funded then the
Affordable Care Act.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.891
That same caucus now saying it
won't support anything that
funds Planned Parenthood.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.760
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally,
on the Democrats, if they are
called on to make the difference

28:48.760 --> 28:49.661
here, what are they going to do?

28:49.661 --> 28:51.363
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

28:51.363 --> 28:55.133
The Democrats, in a way, Nancy
Pelosi, are a little in the
catbird's seat, because Speaker

28:55.133 --> 28:59.037
Boehner may need them to keep
government running, doesn't want
the blowback that they received

28:59.037 --> 29:02.174
last time from the shutdown.

29:02.174 --> 29:06.311
Democrats are interested in a
few things. They would like to
see the Export-Import Bank

29:06.311 --> 29:09.948
reestablished, reauthorized. I
don't know if they will get it,
but that's something

29:09.948 --> 29:13.485
that they would like on the
table as these discussions go
forward.

29:13.485 --> 29:16.722
But, again, no one really knows,
Judy, what's going to happen.
Very possible they do another

29:16.722 --> 29:20.058
short-term, but very possible
accidents can happen.

29:20.058 --> 29:21.426
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's why you and
others are going to be watching
it so closely.

29:21.426 --> 29:22.361
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.
It's fascinating.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.196
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa
Desjardins, thank you.

29:24.196 --> 29:29.301
LISA DESJARDINS: Sure.

29:29.301 --> 29:35.173
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:35.173 --> 29:39.845
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
new book explores whether
Putin's actions in Ukraine are
setting

29:39.845 --> 29:46.451
up a new Cold War; and
remembering Yogi Berra for what
he did and said.

29:46.451 --> 29:52.491
But, first, tomorrow Pope
Francis heads to Capitol Hill,
where he will address a joint

29:52.491 --> 29:57.562
meeting of Congress. The pontiff
will speak from the same podium
where the House chaplain,

29:57.562 --> 30:02.367
Father Patrick Conroy, delivers
the opening prayer every
morning.

30:02.367 --> 30:07.639
Conroy is a Catholic priest and
a Jesuit who has served as the
chaplain for both Georgetown

30:07.639 --> 30:11.643
University and Seattle
University, and most recently
taught high school students,
before

30:11.643 --> 30:15.213
coming to Washington, D.C.

30:15.213 --> 30:19.418
Gwen sat down with Father Pat,
as he is affectionately known,
to talk about the pope's visit
to Capitol

30:19.418 --> 30:22.788
Hill and the interesting
flock he tends.

30:22.788 --> 30:25.457
GWEN IFILL: Father Pat, thank
you so much for joining us.

30:25.457 --> 30:32.864
So, here you are on Capitol
Hill. The pope, the big boss, is
arriving. Is that exciting?

30:32.864 --> 30:35.133
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY, Chaplain
of the House of Representatives:
Well, I imagine the pope's

30:35.133 --> 30:42.207
coming is exciting for any
Catholic. His coming is exciting
for me, although I'm not all
that

30:42.207 --> 30:47.379
anxious about it, because I know
that I'm going to get to meet
him.

30:47.379 --> 30:55.220
And it will be the first time
that I have will met a pope in
my lifetime. And so it's

30:55.220 --> 31:02.327
a great blessing to me and kind
of, you know, how did this
happen that I actually get to

31:02.327 --> 31:05.163
greet him here at the Capitol.

31:05.163 --> 31:09.334
GWEN IFILL: As the Catholic
chaplain of the House of
Representatives, the opportunity

31:09.334 --> 31:14.673
to greet Pope Francis, does it
carry a special weight? Does it
make you a much more popular

31:14.673 --> 31:15.874
guy than you were a
couple of weeks ago?

31:15.874 --> 31:16.775
(LAUGHTER)

31:16.775 --> 31:18.577
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY:
Wouldn't that be nice?

31:18.577 --> 31:20.045
(LAUGHTER)

31:20.045 --> 31:26.518
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY: I don't
know that it makes me more
popular.

31:26.518 --> 31:32.824
Most of the questions that -- at
least around here, that came my
way was when he was elected.

31:32.824 --> 31:39.264
You know, this guy's a Jesuit.
What I would like to point out
is, all Jesuits at some

31:39.264 --> 31:44.569
point in their training have to
teach high school students. And
I think it's been noticeable

31:44.569 --> 31:50.475
with Pope Francis that, when he
says things, it's like people
are like, for the first time

31:50.475 --> 31:55.947
say, geez, I can understand this
guy. I understand what he's
saying.

31:55.947 --> 32:00.886
And because of that, a lot of
people think he's been saying a
lot of new things. And,

32:00.886 --> 32:05.023
of course, what a lot of the
commentators would tell, if you
have been following it

32:05.023 --> 32:08.794
at all, is that he hasn't been
saying a lot of new things.

32:08.794 --> 32:11.229
GWEN IFILL: But there's
been different emphasis.

32:11.229 --> 32:14.399
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY: There
has been that. There's no doubt
about that.

32:14.399 --> 32:20.438
But when he talks about -- for
example, he talks about the
economy needs to be in service

32:20.438 --> 32:26.578
to people, you know, not to
stock options, not to
corporation earnings, but needs
to

32:26.578 --> 32:30.115
be in service to people, that is
longstanding Catholic teaching.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.817
GWEN IFILL: You make
an interesting point.

32:31.817 --> 32:34.286
Doctrinally, he's the same
as any previous pope.

32:34.286 --> 32:35.821
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY: Yes.

32:35.821 --> 32:39.090
GWEN IFILL: He's the pope, after
all. But people are reading him
differently. They're

32:39.090 --> 32:43.295
reading him as more accessible,
as more concerned about social
justice.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.763
Is that a correct reading?

32:44.763 --> 32:47.465
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY: Yes.

32:47.465 --> 32:56.241
The perceiving part is actually
true. The previous popes were
also concerned about social

32:56.241 --> 33:05.550
justice. It was just that their
way of communicating it was
usually in more church talk and
church

33:05.550 --> 33:12.591
language and reference to church
documents, which most people
know nothing about.

33:12.591 --> 33:20.365
And so, when Pope Francis talks,
he's talking about the poor as
he personally has known

33:20.365 --> 33:25.170
them throughout his entire
ministry in Latin America.

33:25.170 --> 33:28.540
GWEN IFILL: As a spiritual
resource for a Congress which
doesn't always get along...

33:28.540 --> 33:30.342
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY: Always?

33:30.342 --> 33:31.676
GWEN IFILL: Always,
ever get along.

33:31.676 --> 33:33.311
(LAUGHTER)

33:33.311 --> 33:37.349
GWEN IFILL: Does that make your
job really difficult or do you
just see through it?

33:37.349 --> 33:42.487
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY: Well,
no, that's what the job is, I
guess, you know?

33:42.487 --> 33:49.995
In an odd way, most of my Jesuit
life has prepared me to be here.
As a campus minister,

33:49.995 --> 33:57.335
I was working with student
populations that were arguably
plurality, if not majority
Catholic.

33:57.335 --> 34:03.208
But I was working with all
students. So my coming here and
working with a diverse
population

34:03.208 --> 34:08.680
is what I have been doing most
of my ministerial life anyway.
And so that hasn't been hard.

34:08.680 --> 34:11.249
GWEN IFILL: Except this
community is severely polarized.

34:11.249 --> 34:15.520
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY:
Well, that's true.

34:15.520 --> 34:19.224
Here's the thing that would have
been difficult. And I have found
this difficult when I have

34:19.224 --> 34:27.732
slipped into it, is thinking
that my ministry was to fix or
heal that polarization.

34:27.732 --> 34:30.435
GWEN IFILL: It's not?

34:30.435 --> 34:35.106
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY: Well,
certainly, one hopes that my
presence and influence could

34:35.106 --> 34:37.375
do that.

34:37.375 --> 34:44.816
But if I were thinking that
that's what my job were, I would
be in therapy, deep therapy,

34:44.816 --> 34:55.026
now and maybe not even here. But
when I understand or when -- the
way I have chosen to see this

34:55.026 --> 35:02.701
is that my job is to pray every
day for a miracle, to ask God to
work a miracle here.

35:02.701 --> 35:07.572
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's put this
in the context of the pope's
visit.

35:07.572 --> 35:11.443
The pope's visit, does it
provide an opportunity for that
miracle, or access to that
miracle,

35:11.443 --> 35:13.478
some sort of unity?

35:13.478 --> 35:20.185
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY: Pope
Francis is a remarkably
attractive individual. And I
have

35:20.185 --> 35:26.658
had, actually, a number of
non-Catholic and even
non-Christian people say this to
me.

35:26.658 --> 35:33.431
He makes me want to be a better
person, or he makes me want to
be a better Christian,

35:33.431 --> 35:39.871
or he makes me want to be a
better Jew or some -- so, there
is something about the pope's

35:39.871 --> 35:44.876
authenticity that people
seem to be responding to.

35:44.876 --> 35:48.980
This isn't message. This
is, like, authenticity.

35:48.980 --> 35:53.985
GWEN IFILL: A prayer for
authenticity, I like that whole
idea, Father Pat Conroy.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.520
Thank you very much
for talking to us.

35:55.520 --> 36:00.291
REV. PATRICK J. CONROY:
You're welcome.

36:00.291 --> 36:12.704
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: another
addition to the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

36:12.704 --> 36:19.244
In march of 2014, Russia annexed
the Ukrainian territory of
Crimea. In the last
year-and-a-half,

36:19.244 --> 36:25.517
Russia also has encouraged and
supported militarily separatists
in Eastern Ukraine.

36:25.517 --> 36:30.155
The motivations behind these
actions, as well as the response
of the West, particularly

36:30.155 --> 36:35.660
the United States, is the focus
of a new book by veteran
diplomatic correspondent Marvin

36:35.660 --> 36:40.098
Kalb, "Imperial Gamble: Putin,
Ukraine and the New Cold War."

36:40.098 --> 36:41.866
He spoke with Margaret Warner.

36:41.866 --> 36:43.968
MARGARET WARNER:
Marvin Kalb, welcome.

36:43.968 --> 36:45.437
MARVIN KALB, Author, "Imperial
Gamble: Putin, Ukraine and the
New Cold War": Thank you.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.406
MARGARET WARNER: Now, in this
book, you say Putin has won his
gamble. You also recently

36:48.406 --> 36:50.108
wrote, Putin has won Ukraine.

36:50.108 --> 36:53.678
Is that where we are?

36:53.678 --> 36:58.550
MARVIN KALB: I think that what
he has done from the very
beginning was have a far more

36:58.550 --> 37:03.054
limited goal in mind than what a
number of people felt at the
very beginning, when this

37:03.054 --> 37:05.256
all started.

37:05.256 --> 37:11.663
He never wanted all of Ukraine.
He wanted for historical
purposes to take Crimea. He

37:11.663 --> 37:19.771
did. Then he wanted a part of
Ukraine that he could always use
to advance Russian interests.

37:19.771 --> 37:24.843
And he is now at a point where
nobody in the West is shouting,
hey, stop. Give us back

37:24.843 --> 37:29.747
Crimea. It's all accepted.
And so he has won.

37:29.747 --> 37:34.853
MARGARET WARNER: And you write
that the U.S. and the West
grossly miscalculated, have even

37:34.853 --> 37:40.058
been shocked that he made this
play for Crimea, violated
international borders.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.594
MARVIN KALB: There is no
question he violated the
borders. There is no question
he's used

37:42.594 --> 37:45.497
to getting his way.

37:45.497 --> 37:52.837
We had in the West a very
romantic vision of Russia back
in 1991, when the Soviet Union

37:52.837 --> 38:01.312
died and whatever is Russia
began to emerge. And we began to
think of it as a democracy.

38:01.312 --> 38:04.382
We're going to bring it into the
West. All is going to be
wonderful.

38:04.382 --> 38:06.985
That was never in the cards.

38:06.985 --> 38:11.523
MARGARET WARNER: So what was at
the root of this for Vladimir
Putin himself, in his spirit

38:11.523 --> 38:14.292
and in his world view?

38:14.292 --> 38:20.965
MARVIN KALB: Vladimir Putin is a
Russian czar. He's kind of a mix
of Peter the Great and

38:20.965 --> 38:28.439
Stalin. He's got both in his
veins. And he looks out first
and foremost for the national

38:28.439 --> 38:36.047
security interests of Russia. He
accepts that, in Eastern Europe,
that is a Russian backyard,

38:36.047 --> 38:41.686
that is a Russian sphere of
influence. Ukraine lives most
uncomfortably and unhappily in

38:41.686 --> 38:45.190
a Russian backyard.

38:45.190 --> 38:51.462
If anything good is going to
emerge out of this, it's going
to be the result of an
acceptable

38:51.462 --> 38:56.801
modus vivendi between Ukraine
and Russia. The two of them will
have to get together

38:56.801 --> 39:03.808
at some point. It is going to be
a result that many people in the
West will not like,

39:03.808 --> 39:08.446
because Russia, as the bigger
power, is going to get the
better of the deal. So, a lot of

39:08.446 --> 39:12.650
people will say, that's
appeasement. That's this -- that
-- it's reality.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.819
MARGARET WARNER: Sounds it like
you're speaking to the West and
to the United States when

39:14.819 --> 39:15.720
you say things like that.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.056
MARVIN KALB: Very much so.

39:18.056 --> 39:23.094
MARGARET WARNER: And that the
U.S. should, what, step back and
let Ukraine fend for itself

39:23.094 --> 39:26.331
with Russia now, settle
it among themselves?

39:26.331 --> 39:32.003
MARVIN KALB: Every nation at the
end of the day must fend for
itself.

39:32.003 --> 39:39.944
Sometimes, it needs help. And
Ukraine deserves all the help in
the world. I'm very sympathetic.

39:39.944 --> 39:43.915
But I'm also a realist. I think
President Obama would love to
help. I think Chancellor

39:43.915 --> 39:47.685
Merkel of Germany
would love to help.

39:47.685 --> 39:55.193
But there are realities
governing what they can do. And
Ukraine cannot live with the
false

39:55.193 --> 39:59.797
image that somehow or another
the West will come and rescue
her. It's not going to happen.

39:59.797 --> 40:02.800
MARGARET WARNER: Go back to
Vladimir Putin. There was one
interesting point I thought

40:02.800 --> 40:04.469
you made in the book,
is that he is...

40:04.469 --> 40:05.370
MARVIN KALB: Just one?

40:05.370 --> 40:05.970
MARGARET WARNER: Many.

40:05.970 --> 40:07.739
(LAUGHTER)

40:07.739 --> 40:12.577
MARGARET WARNER: The key is
really, he didn't just spring
out of nowhere, but he's very

40:12.577 --> 40:17.315
much in the tradition of many
Russian leaders, not just Peter
the Great and Stalin. What

40:17.315 --> 40:19.917
do you mean by that?

40:19.917 --> 40:26.124
MARVIN KALB: He was the man in
the Kremlin at the moment. He
feels a personal responsibility

40:26.124 --> 40:33.164
to reconstitute Russia in his
image, which is that of a czar,
which is that of a nation

40:33.164 --> 40:37.368
that has an empire.

40:37.368 --> 40:42.273
Russia can never be an empire
unless it is in control of
Ukraine.

40:42.273 --> 40:45.143
MARGARET WARNER: And that has to
do with the very close
historical ties between the
two...

40:45.143 --> 40:46.244
MARVIN KALB: Exactly.

40:46.244 --> 40:48.746
MARGARET WARNER: ... which we in
the West also didn't really
grasp.

40:48.746 --> 40:52.317
MARVIN KALB: Well, we have got
to understand, for example,
Russia is an orthodox Christian

40:52.317 --> 40:57.155
nation. So is Ukraine.

40:57.155 --> 41:04.896
That happened in 988 in Crimea,
a place called Kievan Rus, which
was the Russia around Kiev

41:04.896 --> 41:08.700
at that time. It's 1,000 years
ago, but, to a Russian, it's
yesterday.

41:08.700 --> 41:11.069
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

41:11.069 --> 41:13.838
Let me ask you finally about a
phrase that you use in your
subtitle, and you call it

41:13.838 --> 41:15.073
"The New Col~ War."

41:15.073 --> 41:16.774
MARVIN KALB: Yes.

41:16.774 --> 41:19.477
MARGARET WARNER: In terms of the
broader relationship between the
West and Russia, is it really

41:19.477 --> 41:21.879
that dire?

41:21.879 --> 41:25.750
MARVIN KALB: It is not the same
as a cold war, and I didn't in
the subtitle have the

41:25.750 --> 41:29.120
ability to stretch it out.

41:29.120 --> 41:35.893
But I was trying in the book to
say that we are dealing with a
return to what might be

41:35.893 --> 41:42.967
a far more normal relationship
between the West and Russia.
Russia is what it is that

41:42.967 --> 41:50.475
we see. It's not dressed up in
its birthday costume. It is what
it is. It regards its

41:50.475 --> 41:56.147
national interests as important
enough to fight for.

41:56.147 --> 42:01.319
And the difference on the whole
Ukraine situation is that the
Russians are prepared to fight

42:01.319 --> 42:05.256
for their position on
Ukraine, and the West is not.

42:05.256 --> 42:10.128
MARGARET WARNER: So, finally
ending back up with Putin yet
again, if this scenario you

42:10.128 --> 42:13.898
stretched out, which would be
Ukraine and Russia getting
together and finding this modus

42:13.898 --> 42:18.136
vivendi, if that doesn't happen
any time soon, what should we --
what do you expect next

42:18.136 --> 42:19.203
from Putin?

42:19.203 --> 42:23.040
MARVIN KALB: That's
a rough question.

42:23.040 --> 42:29.247
He is so totally unpredictable.
The answer -- and it's not
ducking -- the answer is that

42:29.247 --> 42:32.784
which satisfies the immediate
national security interests of
Russia.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.852
MARGARET WARNER: As he sees it?

42:34.852 --> 42:41.793
MARVIN KALB: As he sees it. And
he is a despot, and he's a very
good despot. And he will see

42:41.793 --> 42:49.734
things in a narrow way. What is
good for Russia? That is what he
will do. If that's represented

42:49.734 --> 42:56.207
by a move toward the Baltic,
that would be very dangerous,
but he would do it, on the

42:56.207 --> 43:02.113
assumption that he would ask
himself the question: I am
prepared to fight for Estonia.
Is the

43:02.113 --> 43:05.716
United States? Is Germany?
Is Britain, France?

43:05.716 --> 43:09.420
And the answer in his mind would
be no. That doesn't mean he's
going to do that.

43:09.420 --> 43:11.489
MARGARET WARNER: But it's all
thoughts in his head perhaps.

43:11.489 --> 43:13.591
MARVIN KALB: It's very
much up in the air.

43:13.591 --> 43:15.693
MARGARET WARNER: Marvin Kalb,
author of "Imperial Gamble,"
thank you so much.

43:15.693 --> 43:21.132
MARVIN KALB: Thank you.

43:21.132 --> 43:32.410
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
the passing of a baseball great
and beloved American character,

43:32.410 --> 43:37.014
Yogi Berra, who died
yesterday at the age of 90.

43:37.014 --> 43:43.921
Yogi, as he was universally
known, first joined the New York
Yankees as a catcher in 1946,

43:43.921 --> 43:50.194
where he became a linchpin on 10
World Series-winning teams.
Later, as team manager, he led
both

43:50.194 --> 43:54.832
the Yankees and the New York
Mets to league championships. He
was also famous for his

43:54.832 --> 43:58.803
knack for the oddly
turned phrase.

43:58.803 --> 44:03.207
For more on his life and legacy,
I am joined by one of Berra's
biographers, Allen Barra,

44:03.207 --> 44:06.043
author of "Yogi Berra:
Eternal Yankee."

44:06.043 --> 44:09.046
Allen Barra, welcome.

44:09.046 --> 44:14.685
Let's talk first about Yogi
Berra the baseball player. What
made him a standout?

44:14.685 --> 44:18.356
ALLEN BARRA, Author, "Yogi
Berra: Eternal Yankee": Well,
it's hard to say.

44:18.356 --> 44:24.962
Yogi was tremendously talented,
but he certainly didn't look it.
He was stumpy. He was 5'8'',

44:24.962 --> 44:29.867
didn't look like he had an
athlete's body. The first time
Ted Williams, you know, who

44:29.867 --> 44:37.241
was the John Wayne of baseball,
towering, imposing figure,
6'4'', stands up to the plate

44:37.241 --> 44:42.113
and looks down, and there is
this little, ungainly guy, none
of the equipment fit -- the

44:42.113 --> 44:47.251
chest protector, shin
guards, nothing fits.

44:47.251 --> 44:51.455
Yogi looks up at him and says,
"How you doing?" And Ted just
says to himself, "Who are they

44:51.455 --> 44:52.823
trying to fool with
this blank-blank guy?"

44:52.823 --> 44:53.524
(LAUGHTER)

44:53.524 --> 44:55.459
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he led...

44:55.459 --> 44:58.896
ALLEN BARRA: And Ted Williams
turned out to be one of the
biggest fans. He loved Yogi.

44:58.896 --> 45:02.833
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he led the
Yankees in, I read, runs batted
in for seve~ consecutive

45:02.833 --> 45:05.136
seasons?

45:05.136 --> 45:12.376
ALLEN BARRA: Yogi was a 14-time
All-Star. He was a terrific
hitter who never struck

45:12.376 --> 45:18.115
out. He had an incredible
batting eye. His hand-eye
coordination was outstanding.
And

45:18.115 --> 45:23.754
in that little 5'8'' body, he
was compact and powerful, and
almost impossible to strike

45:23.754 --> 45:25.656
out.

45:25.656 --> 45:29.927
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you told us
that -- you said to us today,
you said he was the most

45:29.927 --> 45:35.833
beloved American athlete, with
the possible exception of Babe
Ruth. What made him so beloved?

45:35.833 --> 45:42.840
ALLEN BARRA: Yogi was loyal. He
was friendly. He was a great
American winner.

45:42.840 --> 45:48.379
I mean, any coach or player you
talk about who won a lot of
championships, won a lot

45:48.379 --> 45:55.653
of games, Yogi's got to be on
that list. As you said, 14
pennants, 10 World Series. And

45:55.653 --> 46:01.659
yet the thing that separates
Yogi, I think, from all other
great American winners in
sports,

46:01.659 --> 46:06.964
Yogi always seemed to be
playing. He seemed to love
playing the game.

46:06.964 --> 46:12.370
There is probably no one that
had -- enjoyed the game more,
had more relish out of playing

46:12.370 --> 46:19.276
it. And I think that got passed
on to everybody. His opponents
loved him. His manager loved

46:19.276 --> 46:24.248
him. Sportswriters loved him
because he was great copy. He
would say almost anything,

46:24.248 --> 46:28.552
and they could -- and if it
wasn't altogether usable, let's
say they could just rewrite

46:28.552 --> 46:29.353
it until it was.

46:29.353 --> 46:30.988
(LAUGHTER)

46:30.988 --> 46:35.393
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where did that
come from, the Yogisms? "If you
come to a fork in the road,

46:35.393 --> 46:39.230
take it." Where do
those lines come from?

46:39.230 --> 46:42.500
ALLEN BARRA: There's two kind of
Yogisms, basically. There's --
well, I would say three

46:42.500 --> 46:44.535
kinds.

46:44.535 --> 46:50.074
There's the Yogisms, the things
that he said that he didn't say.
And then there's the
malapropisms,

46:50.074 --> 46:55.813
like when the -- Yogi Berra Day
in Saint Louis in 1947, he says:
"I would like to thank everyone

46:55.813 --> 46:57.982
for making this day necessary."
That was just a slip-up.

46:57.982 --> 46:59.817
(LAUGHTER)

46:59.817 --> 47:03.921
ALLEN BARRA: Then there are the
Yogisms that make a lot of sense
if you think about it.

47:03.921 --> 47:09.093
Now, you just cited one, one of
the -- I think one of the best,
one of my favorites. He said,

47:09.093 --> 47:13.164
"When you come to the fork
in the road, take it."

47:13.164 --> 47:17.635
What did he mean? He was telling
a reporter how to get to his
house. He was in a cul-de-sac.

47:17.635 --> 47:22.573
He meant, no matter which way
you go, you're going to be
there.

47:22.573 --> 47:29.213
That was just a great way of
saying it. I think almost
anything Yogi said like that,

47:29.213 --> 47:32.583
he would say it in fewer words
and get to the point quicker
than just about anything

47:32.583 --> 47:36.220
who -- anyone who voiced
a similar sentiment.

47:36.220 --> 47:41.192
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, I read that
the cartoon character Yogi Bear,
who came out...

47:41.192 --> 47:42.927
ALLEN BARRA: Yes.

47:42.927 --> 47:45.730
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... I guess in
the late '50s, was named after
Yogi Berra, but Yogi Berra

47:45.730 --> 47:47.398
didn't like that.

47:47.398 --> 47:50.868
ALLEN BARRA: I asked
him about that once.

47:50.868 --> 47:55.339
And he said -- he says, "I'm not
saying I don't like the bear."
He said, "The bear's

47:55.339 --> 47:59.076
OK." But he didn't like the idea
that people would think of him
as a cartoon character.

47:59.076 --> 48:03.881
He wanted to be taken seriously.

48:03.881 --> 48:07.551
Most of the things that he said
that people laughed at were just
things that were said

48:07.551 --> 48:13.858
in the clubhouse, said to
reporters. He wanted to talk to
people. He wasn't like a lot of

48:13.858 --> 48:18.529
athletes today that were afraid
to talk to reporters and didn't
know what was going to

48:18.529 --> 48:21.899
come of that, how they
were going to be quoted.

48:21.899 --> 48:27.505
Yogi would take his chances. He
would talk about just about
anything. And you have to

48:27.505 --> 48:31.742
remember, too, since the Yankees
won almost every year back then,
they were usually in

48:31.742 --> 48:35.813
a good mood, and Yogi was in
a good mood to talk. So...

48:35.813 --> 48:39.683
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he was
somebody I think everybody
thought they knew.

48:39.683 --> 48:43.721
Allen Barra, biography of
Yogi Berra, we thank you.

48:43.721 --> 48:51.462
ALLEN BARRA: Yes.

48:51.462 --> 48:59.303
JUDY WOODRUFF: Every summer,
middle and high school teachers
from around the country travel

48:59.303 --> 49:04.742
here to Washington, D.C., for
the Student Reporting Labs
teacher boot camp, in order

49:04.742 --> 49:08.579
to better understand what
teaching broadcast journalism
will look like in their
classrooms.

49:08.579 --> 49:12.917
The educators shoot and
edit character profiles.

49:12.917 --> 49:18.589
Tonight, we discover a young man
who fights the demons in life
through meditation and

49:18.589 --> 49:25.362
the kind of high-flying
acrobatics seen in video games.
It's an art form known as
tricking.

49:25.362 --> 49:30.401
The video was shot and edited by
teachers from Miami, Detroit and
Aurora, Colorado.

49:30.401 --> 49:35.005
WILLIAM-THOMAS CONEYS, Mixed
Martial Artist/Trainer:
Tricking, to me, it's a lot of
things. Mainly,

49:35.005 --> 49:37.074
it's a lifesaver.

49:37.074 --> 49:43.013
I was picked on as a kid from
elementary up until the middle
of high school. I really

49:43.013 --> 49:49.653
didn't have too many friends.
Around the age of 15, 16, I lost
my grandfather and my brother

49:49.653 --> 49:58.295
two months apart in the same
year. And that sent me into a
very, very sad, like, dark

49:58.295 --> 50:03.300
place for me. I just wouldn't
talk to anybody. I was fed up
with a lot of things.

50:03.300 --> 50:08.038
A couple of months afterwards,
my mom put me into martial arts
classes because she wanted

50:08.038 --> 50:28.459
me to be somewhere where I could
express that freely without
hurting myself or getting into

50:28.459 --> 50:43.374
trouble.

50:43.374 --> 50:52.082
Tricking is an artistic movement
that spawned from the roots in
martial arts, takes its

50:52.082 --> 50:59.189
form from gymnastics, dance,
martial arts, and just about
anything that you really can

50:59.189 --> 51:05.896
think of. We have taken video
game moves and turned them into
tricks.

51:05.896 --> 51:21.712
I'm an athlete. And just,
physically from what we do, it's
demanding, you know? And

51:21.712 --> 51:31.555
when it comes to tricking by
itself, it's an art form,
because it has structure, but

51:31.555 --> 51:37.795
no structure. When you trick,
you paint the images in your
head, sometimes before,
sometimes

51:37.795 --> 51:41.265
after, sometimes while you're
in the middle in the air.

51:41.265 --> 51:47.871
The biggest injury I had was
when I crashed on my neck, and I
got up, thought I was fine,

51:47.871 --> 51:54.311
walked about 10 feet, and then I
was out cold. The doctor said
that, had I been any higher

51:54.311 --> 52:01.018
in the air, I probably could
have paralyzed myself from the
neck down.

52:01.018 --> 52:08.092
You know, for me, tricking, it's
a part of who I am as a person
now. You know, not a

52:08.092 --> 52:14.631
day goes by where I don't think
-- where I don't think about
tricking. Like, I know at

52:14.631 --> 52:18.769
a certain point, I'm probably
going to have to sit down,
someday. But, until then, I will

52:18.769 --> 52:21.372
be tricking.

52:21.372 --> 52:28.045
And even then, when I do have to
stop, I will be teaching others
how to trick or at least

52:28.045 --> 52:33.817
being able to give my knowledge
on it to them. You know,
tricking, for me, it's not just

52:33.817 --> 52:40.357
something that I do. It's a way
of life. And I have come close
to giving up on it a lot,

52:40.357 --> 52:44.294
just with injuries and other
stuff that. But, at the end of
the day, I always go back to

52:44.294 --> 52:49.233
it, because that's the one thing
that keeps me going throughout
everything.

52:49.233 --> 52:53.237
You know, bad days, good days,
sad times, happy times, I can
always count on tricking

52:53.237 --> 53:00.411
to give me that edge of peace.

53:00.411 --> 53:12.923
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: once a scientist, always
a scientist. And Pope

53:12.923 --> 53:17.928
Francis was once a chemist. His
recent statements on climate
change have been applauded by
many

53:17.928 --> 53:22.866
fellow scientists, but for
others, the pope's policy stops
short of addressing one major

53:22.866 --> 53:27.137
contributor to global
warming: population growth.

53:27.137 --> 53:32.743
You can read our full story on
Pope Francis' climate legacy on
our home page.

53:32.743 --> 53:39.683
And we have a review of the new
movie "Stonewall" from a man who
participated in the 1969 riots

53:39.683 --> 53:45.255
that set off a wave of LGBT
activism. He says the film gets
it all wrong. Read his take

53:45.255 --> 53:47.257
on our Arts page.

53:47.257 --> 53:52.796
All that and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:52.796 --> 53:55.999
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. On Thursday -- that's
tomorrow. We will be back.

53:55.999 --> 53:58.469
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:58.469 --> 54:01.238
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening. For all of us
at the "PBS NewsHour," thank

54:01.238 --> 54:01.505
you, and good night.
