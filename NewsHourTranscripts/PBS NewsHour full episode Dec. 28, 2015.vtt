perspective right now things in
the city
here actually pretty quiet
there's so

09:52.025 --> 09:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much going on right now from the
cute
Qtel recreational center where
two men

09:57.297 --> 10:02.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were shot down to the Justice
Center
which houses are courthouse and
jail I

10:02.635 --> 10:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean prosecutor McGinty said in
his
comments today that the evidence
the

10:06.806 --> 10:11.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
video evidence proved
indisputably in
his mind that a crime had not
been

10:11.878 --> 10:13.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committed

10:13.179 --> 10:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obviously the family doesn't
seem to to
see it the same way

10:16.549 --> 10:24.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yeah you're right I i think that
it's I
think that the family is is is
still

10:25.024 --> 10:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grief-stricken and and still
upset and
and and and frankly I don't
think

10:29.629 --> 10:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's much that anybody could
say they
would convince the family that
that this

10:33.600 --> 10:35.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was the right decision to make

10:35.268 --> 10:39.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean on that video I know
there was
some kind what some question
about how

10:39.405 --> 10:44.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
long the officers actually had
to warn
to mir to put the gun down
before they

10:44.978 --> 10:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
open fire has that been a that
been part
of the discussion you've been
hearing in

10:48.515 --> 10:55.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cleveland I i think there's a
lot of
dispute over the the warning
that the

10:55.321 --> 10:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police department said that
officer
lowman had given to to mir

10:59.092 --> 11:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know I think people have
sort of
done their own accounting to see
if it's

11:03.730 --> 11:08.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
possible to give so many
warnings as
they were speeding up to the
scene there

11:08.067 --> 11:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where where the young boy was
shot so
you know i hesitate to speculate
because

11:12.472 --> 11:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it it's it's difficult to say
exactly
what happened because there's no
audio

11:17.043 --> 11:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the video I i think thats a
missing
component that I think would
have helped

11:22.148 --> 11:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clarify a lot of the things that
are
still lingering questions the
prosecutor

11:28.655 --> 11:31.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mcginty has also been criticized
throughout the process of this
grand

11:31.758 --> 11:36.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jury for putting out dribs and
drabs of
the evidence that seemed to
bolster the

11:36.362 --> 11:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case not to indict the officers
do you
think that today's decision is
going to

11:41.501 --> 11:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quell any of those criticisms
know why I
think he's gonna carry this
criticism

11:46.806 --> 11:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with him i mean he's you know
he's got
an election coming up and I
think you

11:52.345 --> 11:57.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know i i think i think he's he
he's
going to he's gonna feel this
for a long

11:57.183 --> 12:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time and and you know I think
the
decision for him to put out the

12:02.355 --> 12:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information in in bits and
pieces I
think was a response to how the
ferguson

12:09.896 --> 12:16.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grand jury was handled in and I
believe
that I mean it's unusual you
know it's

12:16.202 --> 12:19.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not something you see everyday
in in
criminal in the criminal justice
system

12:19.839 --> 12:25.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and and I think part of the
reason is is
the sort of response you're
seeing today

12:25.678 --> 12:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know we're not seeing a lot
of of
uproar right now and and and i
think

12:32.719 --> 12:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that it it sort of help these
people
into what you know a lot of
people

12:36.923 --> 12:40.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already knew the decision was
gonna be
alright Christmas key thank you
very

12:40.493 --> 12:42.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
much for joining us

12:42.829 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and now let's go back to Chicago
where
the conduct of its Police
Department

12:46.366 --> 12:51.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remains front-and-center any
Russo of
the local PBS station WTTW in
the news

12:51.504 --> 12:53.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
program Chicago tonight

12:53.239 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spoke with us earlier this
evening ed
thanks for joining us again can
you just

12:58.144 --> 13:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give us a sense this has been a
lot of
protest we've been seeing in
Chicago and

13:02.715 --> 13:07.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now another tragic shooting
happening
over the weekend what's the
community

13:07.153 --> 13:12.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reaction bit like William so far
there
haven't been any kind of
demonstrations

13:12.558 --> 13:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the kind that we've seen in
the
wake of the laQuan McDonald
video so far

13:17.497 --> 13:22.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it has been very peaceful the
only a
show of force show of support
that has

13:22.201 --> 13:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened so far has been a
community
gathering outside the house
where this

13:26.239 --> 13:30.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
latest shooting took place among
the
community leaders and activists
there

13:30.209 --> 13:36.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were the was the reverend jesse
jackson
senior so right now it's the
it's it's

13:36.582 --> 13:39.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been pretty calm in the wake of
that but
that doesn't mean that there
isn't a lot

13:39.719 --> 13:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of anger and frustration in the
community with this latest
shooting I

13:44.691 --> 13:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean obviously there was the the
one the
tragedy of what seemed to be a
bystander

13:49.429 --> 13:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being killed by police bullets
but then
apparently the the shooting of
this

13:54.000 --> 13:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young man who reportedly had
some mental
problems and I understand that
in the

13:57.704 --> 14:01.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wake of this this most recent
event
there's been talk of changing
police

14:01.541 --> 14:06.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
procedures as to how police deal
with
someone with mental problems
what has

14:06.979 --> 14:09.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been that discussion

14:09.549 --> 14:14.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well that's right as as in the
wake of
this shooting the police
department

14:14.887 --> 14:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
admitted that one of the victims
was
accidentally shot now the
circumstances

14:19.225 --> 14:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surrounding the shooting of
nineteen
year old antonio degree or are
still

14:23.763 --> 14:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of murky but immediately

14:25.665 --> 14:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the mayor ordered a review of
the crisis
intervention team training that
is that

14:31.270 --> 14:36.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surrounds how police officers
deal with
calls surrounding mental health
crisis

14:37.009 --> 14:40.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues whether this young man
was
suffering from some sort of
mental

14:40.546 --> 14:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illness his father reported that
he was
irate his mother said that he
had some

14:46.385 --> 14:52.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lingering issues from his youth
when he
was in in in foster care I
believe for a

14:52.425 --> 14:56.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while but whether that was the
case in
this situation still is now

14:56.262 --> 15:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not clear nevertheless the mayor
has
called for a review of these
procedures

15:00.733 --> 15:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in handling these kinds of calls
and was
there any sense as to whether
the police

15:05.204 --> 15:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been told that this might be
someone
with emotional problems with
this simply

15:09.342 --> 15:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a domestic disturbance complaint

15:11.911 --> 15:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well what we've heard so far is
that
what they were responding to a
call of a

15:17.483 --> 15:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
domestic disturbance and that's
that's
what we've gotten so far when
they

15:23.489 --> 15:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
arrived we are told that these
this
young man allegedly came down
the stairs

15:29.195 --> 15:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from a second-floor apartment in
he was
holding a baseball bat and
presumably

15:33.800 --> 15:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the officers felt threatened and
presumably that is why they
opened fire

15:39.105 --> 15:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least one officer opened fire
from
what we've been told so far but
we still

15:43.676 --> 15:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't have any clear answers

15:46.212 --> 15:50.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
obviously this is you mentioned
comes
after a long protest in Chicago
over

15:50.449 --> 15:54.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other police actions since then
you've
got a new police chief you've
got the

15:54.987 --> 15:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new head of a Police Review
Board but
they're still calls for the
mayor to

15:58.624 --> 16:02.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
step down or those continuing
even after
this weekend

16:02.261 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well they have and there were a
number
of petitions asking for his
resignation

16:07.099 --> 16:14.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we do not have a recall
petitions
available here in Illinois yet
although

16:14.941 --> 16:20.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that that law has been proposed
in
Springfield but there still is a
lot of

16:20.479 --> 16:24.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frustration and anger at how the
mayor
and his administration have
handled

16:24.717 --> 16:29.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trista laQuan McDonald incident
and that
video and now the mayor is out
of the

16:29.722 --> 16:33.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country he's vacationing in cuba
we've
been told that he is cutting
that

16:33.726 --> 16:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vacation short that he will be
returning
to Chicago tomorrow although we
really

16:39.165 --> 16:42.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't know how long the vacation
was
supposed to last year when he
left

16:42.568 --> 16:47.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because City Hall has not given
us that
information but there is still a
lot of

16:47.240 --> 16:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frustration and it should be
pointed out
that the the head of the police

16:51.644 --> 16:55.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
department right now is only the
interim
superintendent and that the head
of that

16:55.448 --> 16:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police Review Board is also only
there
in an interim capacity so these

16:59.752 --> 17:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals are tasked with with
with
heading these organizations at a
very

17:05.558 --> 17:08.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rough time whether they will
remain in
those positions

17:08.628 --> 17:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remains to be seen but yes there
there
remains a lot of frustration
alright and

17:12.832 --> 17:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heroes of WTTW thanks so much
thank you

17:22.875 --> 17:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heroes of WTTW thanks so much
thank you

17:31.117 --> 17:37.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
44 today from violent weather
that's
battered the South and Midwest
with

17:37.123 --> 17:41.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tornadoes and floods since
Wednesday
some of the worst game saturday
in texas

17:41.727 --> 17:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know barrages of deadly
storms where
there had been homes shattered
piles of

17:47.600 --> 17:52.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sticks stretched across the
North Texas
landscape today and survivors
were still

17:52.571 --> 17:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to tell you their losses
02 pigs
when it opened big big strong
tornado at

17:57.877 --> 18:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least nine tornadoes swept
through
communities around Dallas on
Saturday

18:01.614 --> 18:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they blasted some neighborhoods
with
winds of about 200 miles an hour
and

18:06.886 --> 18:12.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
damaged or destroyed nearly
1,500 homes

18:30.643 --> 18:32.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
foot of rain hit the east

probably did
not know what hit them until
they hit

18:59.171 --> 19:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the water in southern Illinois

rain-swollen
creek the same storm system that

19:09.515 --> 19:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generated that deadly weather
kept
moving today

19:12.585 --> 19:18.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eastward across the nation's
midsection

bob start with the tornado's if
you

19:43.816 --> 19:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would how unusual either in
terms of the
time of year or the number of
them are

19:49.388 --> 19:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their severity what are you
seeing well
it's not uncommon to get
tornadoes in

19:54.427 --> 19:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the south including texas also
the
winter time it's certainly
possible the

19:58.864 --> 20:02.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strength of the tornado that hit
in the
Dallas area on Saturday is
unusual it

20:02.935 --> 20:06.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the strongest tornado ever
to hit
Texas in December there have
been

20:06.672 --> 20:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tornadoes that struck in other
parts of
the South in December but that
was quite

20:10.476 --> 20:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unusual there was also some bad
luck
involved because it happened to
hit the

20:13.913 --> 20:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eastern part of the dallas-fort
worth
metro area obviously one of the
biggest

20:17.750 --> 20:20.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities in the country and
forecasters
have long been afraid of what
could

20:20.719 --> 20:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen if the tornado hit the
DFW area
head-on so this was more of a
glancing

20:25.257 --> 20:28.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blow but still obviously even
that was
was pretty callous and I we are
way

20:28.828 --> 20:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
better at any better at
predicting or
mapping these things absolutely
there at

20:34.366 --> 20:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this this was fairly well
forecast in
terms of tornado watches and
warnings

20:37.803 --> 20:42.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were out as the storms moved in
so we
certainly are better at
capturing

20:42.675 --> 20:45.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those and I think indicative of
that is
the fact that something like a
sales and

20:45.945 --> 20:49.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
structures were damaged or
destroyed but
the number of deaths was
relatively

20:49.648 --> 20:53.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smaller though you know any
deaths too
many now a lot of crazy weather
right

20:53.719 --> 20:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now records for warm weather the
warm
weather is said to come from a
variety

20:57.823 --> 21:02.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of factors right tell us what we
did
what we know about what's going
on with

21:02.928 --> 21:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a mix of things one picture
going on is
el nino which tends to
redistribute heat

21:08.801 --> 21:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the globe it actually
adds heat
in the atmosphere by spreading
warm

21:12.471 --> 21:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water over the eastern tropical
Pacific
Ocean and that he gets moved in
shuttled

21:16.775 --> 21:19.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the globe but there's
also kind
of a rearrangement of weather
patterns

21:19.979 --> 21:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sometimes that leads to warm
weather
especially in the Midwest and
Northeast

21:23.382 --> 21:27.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the wintertime and December
in
factoring strong el ninos is
known to

21:27.620 --> 21:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have this effect over a large
part of
the eastern USA so we certainly
saw them

21:31.390 --> 21:35.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
play out I'm not just over
Christmas but
the whole month of December has
been

21:35.227 --> 21:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amazingly mild Central Park has
yet to
get below 32 degrees it's it's
by far

21:40.866 --> 21:45.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the warmest December in most of
the Big
East Coast cities on record and
in some

21:45.604 --> 21:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases going back to the late
1800's so
amazingly my old moist air mass
and that

21:50.543 --> 21:55.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually also filled tornadoes
in Texas
and the flooding in the midwest
and what

21:55.281 --> 22:00.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do we know what the the
interaction the
impact between climate change
and el

22:00.219 --> 22:04.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nino when it comes to looking at
weather
patterns right now

22:04.823 --> 22:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well let me know doesn't seem to
be
affected greatly by climate
change in

22:08.294 --> 22:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terms of frequency or duration
or
intensity but one thing we know
is that

22:12.064 --> 22:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a warming atmosphere of the
peaks of
that warming tend to get
expressed

22:16.335 --> 22:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through el ninos el ninos tend
to warm
the global atmosphere for year
two and

22:21.240 --> 22:25.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lining the counterparties to
cool the
global atmosphere so when you
get a

22:25.744 --> 22:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warming atmosphere as we are
three house
gases you can expect the warmest
years

22:29.782 --> 22:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be the el nino years and we
have one
of the three strongest el ninos
in

22:33.719 --> 22:37.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades going on right now so if
their
perspective it's not a total
surprise

22:37.156 --> 22:42.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we're getting this warning
not only
the USDA records in Australia
and in

22:42.094 --> 22:46.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fact central England is having
its
warmest December in a setting
like 350

22:46.265 --> 22:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years so a pretty impressive and
just
briefly what are you looking for
in the

22:49.401 --> 22:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next couple of days continuing
severe
weather in parts of the country
will yes

22:54.006 --> 22:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the storm systems moving on
through into
the east

22:56.175 --> 22:59.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gonna be settling down I think
the next
few days and then we're going to
see a

22:59.411 --> 23:04.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit of a realignment with warmer
weather
milder whether I should say
across a lot

23:04.049 --> 23:05.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the west

23:05.684 --> 23:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up into Western Canada and
perhaps some
cold in the east through into
January

23:09.255 --> 23:13.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parts of January but only no
dust him to
force a lot of warmth across the
eastern

23:13.993 --> 23:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Canada eastern us' northeastern
us' so I
would be surprised if its
overall a

23:18.464 --> 23:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretty mild winter over North
America
that you know we always prone to
those

23:22.301 --> 23:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cold injuries and send the last
several
winners have had some pretty
sharp ones

23:25.904 --> 23:29.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you know in the north I'll
say you're
still trying to figure those out
so I

23:29.775 --> 23:33.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
mention of the weather

you so much thank you

foods

24:01.106 --> 24:06.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

that

25:14.780 --> 25:19.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sparked an idea this waitress

with these delicious looking

25:19.184 --> 25:23.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

gluten-free and she said how

you I was probably really angry
angry
you know and why can't I just
passed

25:31.096 --> 25:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this and that was the moment

gluten free waffles that had
just been
delivered from a local
restaurant so we

26:12.337 --> 26:17.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do is we take a sample and we
put it in
this little capsule and then
we're gonna

26:17.776 --> 26:22.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take the top action of closing
this will
grind the food someone just put
it in

26:22.915 --> 26:28.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sensory now and then we're
gonna
start it takes about two minutes

got a smiley face so what does
that mean

26:52.444 --> 26:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that means I feel a lot better
about you
to my office now could some
other part

26:59.485 --> 27:05.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this waffle have gluten and
yes yeah
that is absolutely a possibility
but

27:05.390 --> 27:09.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we are doing is giving you
that
extra piece of data to really
improve

27:09.628 --> 27:14.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your odds of staying your

trying to avoid certain foods
those
trying to avoid gluten is a big
market

27:19.104 --> 27:25.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about one in five Americans
these days
the regular from about a team of

27:25.077 --> 27:29.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engineers and scientists who are
part of
the company now called 6 sensor

shipping it out

27:32.818 --> 27:38.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
customers next summer will cost
about
$250 and each of the disposable
capsules

27:38.423 --> 27:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will be about four to five
dollars
depending on the quantity
ordered

27:42.361 --> 27:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
testing foods for gluten isn't
new of
course it's often done in
commercial

27:47.132 --> 27:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
labs and there are some home
testing
kits out there but many are time

27:50.869 --> 27:55.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consuming and require multiple
steps to
get the results that presented

son for this is a consumer
product it's

28:01.013 --> 28:04.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not a medical device that
because of
that has to be something that's
really

28:05.017 --> 28:10.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
easy to use it has to be fast
has to be
discreet the company is aiming
for 99.5

28:10.455 --> 28:14.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent accuracy and they're
comparing
their results with the results
of other

28:14.293 --> 28:18.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independent gluten testing labs
what
they have found so far is about
a

28:18.664 --> 28:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quarter of the food they've
tested
labeled gluten-free have in fact
had

28:22.901 --> 28:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some gluten in them yet says
that
doesn't surprise her I don't
know if

28:27.306 --> 28:31.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you've ever worked in the
kitchen but
it's chaos and so the idea of
getting

28:31.643 --> 28:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your order and making sure was
heard
correctly getting it to the show
you

28:35.113 --> 28:38.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know making sure everything was
prepared
in the right way getting the
dish and

28:38.083 --> 28:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
putting it back in front of that
consumer that has that real
sensitivity

28:40.852 --> 28:42.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's a lot that can go wrong

28:42.788 --> 28:47.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anemic early tests only for
gluten but
the company is planning to
eventually

28:47.826 --> 28:51.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tests for other allergens like
dairy and
peanuts

28:51.063 --> 28:56.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that's proving harder to do
it
hasn't be clear guidelines
regarding

28:56.101 --> 29:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what exactly what level do you
have to
detect in order to make sure
that people

29:01.273 --> 29:07.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not going to change the song
is the
company's lead scientist she
says unlike

29:07.746 --> 29:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for gluten the FDA doesn't have
a set
standard for what constitutes
dairy free

29:12.651 --> 29:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or peanut free big challenge for
us to
understand and potential work
with

29:17.389 --> 29:22.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulatory agencies to figure
out what
is the level we need to bring
down so

29:22.127 --> 29:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the second challenge I really
see is
that we need to be detecting
these

29:26.632 --> 29:30.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proteins are very very sensitive
levels
while six and two labs is
focused on

29:30.836 --> 29:35.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting their product to market
quickly
their competition is heating up
several

29:35.474 --> 29:39.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other companies are developing
different
food testing technologies
including the

29:39.578 --> 29:44.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use of smartphones all are
attempting to
capitalize on the growing number
of

29:44.082 --> 29:48.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans who were food focused
especially when it comes to
gluten it's

29:48.654 --> 29:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a trend that has more than a few
skeptics before the estimated
three

29:52.658 --> 29:57.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million Americans who suffer
from celiac
disease inflammation of the
intestines

29:57.429 --> 30:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's no disputing that is a
serious
health problem there some one
hundred

30:05.504 --> 30:11.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
milligrams is enough to
activated immune
response to put that into
perspective a

30:12.010 --> 30:15.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slice of bread has five thousand
milligrams so it really doesn't
take a

30:15.947 --> 30:20.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot dr. Nielsen Fernandez backer
is the
director of the celiac
management clinic

30:20.552 --> 30:25.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Stanford University Hospital
she says
that products like the nima
could be

30:25.157 --> 30:29.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helpful but they shouldn't be a
crutch
for patients I think it would be

30:30.028 --> 30:37.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
valuable but I think it's only
12 Mb
arsenault I hope it doesn't do
is that

30:37.035 --> 30:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it makes patients more complete
if you
have a piece of staking sample
one could

30:43.175 --> 30:48.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we be missing gluten and some
other side
the nima team is now developing
an app

30:48.714 --> 30:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that will allow users to share
information about the test
they've done

30:52.050 --> 30:54.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on foods and we're gluten-free
is

30:54.453 --> 30:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is truly gluten-free for Shrien
Yates
that kind of knowledge can make
or break

30:59.925 --> 31:06.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her meal out after getting the
smiley
face she was hoping for she
dived right

31:06.765 --> 31:12.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into her gluten-free empanadas

PBS Newshour I'm cat wise in San

holiday weekend enjoyed by all
we hope
including the candidates for the

31:31.623 --> 31:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
presidency like today after the
campaign
trail and for us a chance for an
end of

31:36.461 --> 31:39.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the year look at what's been a
most
surprising race for the white
house

31:39.898 --> 31:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where that we're joined by the
politics
Monday team of the cook
Political Report

31:44.669 --> 31:52.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tamara keys NPR handle on
Monday on
this christmas weekend we know
it has

31:52.043 --> 31:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been a crazy right unexpected in
many
ways but Amy you starting start
with

31:56.982 --> 32:00.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
republicans do you remember a
moment
along the way were you say to
yourself

32:00.152 --> 32:07.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is not what I but I think
it's when
Scott Walker dropped out of the
race

32:07.793 --> 32:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it made it really made
me
realize that everything I had
assumed

32:13.064 --> 32:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what this election was
going to
shape up to be was actually not
working

32:17.769 --> 32:21.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out that way I mean Scott Walker
on
paper looked like the perfect
bridge can

32:21.640 --> 32:29.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
write and drop out this early
and that
combined with bush's struggles
really

32:30.015 --> 32:34.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said to me that Boyd the biggest
surprise in this race is not the
rise of

32:34.753 --> 32:39.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the outsiders but the real
vacuum on the
establishment side and how
incredibly

32:39.758 --> 32:46.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inefficient and ineffective the
establishment has been in making

32:46.131 --> 32:51.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves important in this
race gender
or is your moment by moment
happened at

32:51.503 --> 32:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a ice cream stand and Burlington
Vermont
had to be right and it was after
Bernie

32:56.842 --> 33:00.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders had announced he was
running for
president but before he had had
any of

33:00.412 --> 33:04.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those really big well attended
rallies
and at the time the conventional
wisdom

33:04.516 --> 33:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was really bernie sanders is
running to
push his agenda and to push
Hillary

33:10.555 --> 33:14.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton to the left that was the
mantra
he's just running to to pull
Hillary to

33:14.693 --> 33:16.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the left

33:16.328 --> 33:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well i I was interviewing his
best
friend of this ice cream stand
in one of

33:19.064 --> 33:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his best friends and he said no
bernie
sanders is running for real

33:22.934 --> 33:28.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bernie sanders is in this to win
he is
not in it to to push to push a
message

33:28.707 --> 33:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and and it's really proven to be
true
he's out there he's pushing to
win just

33:33.645 --> 33:37.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one other moment was a town hall
meeting
Hillary Clinton had in Keene New

33:37.682 --> 33:40.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hampshire and she asked everyone
in the
room

33:40.719 --> 33:44.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room if you've had a connection
to
substance abuse raise your hand
and

33:44.656 --> 33:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
almost everyone in the room
raised their
hand and it was this really
remarkable

33:48.660 --> 33:53.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment and is a reflection this
is a
presidential campaign almost
every

33:53.598 --> 33:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate is talking about
addiction and
drug abuse and heroin and it's
because

33:57.903 --> 34:01.139 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
New Hampshire's
first-in-the-nation
primary statements are really
big issue

34:01.172 --> 34:03.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there and that moment really
encapsulated

34:03.375 --> 34:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're seeing you both in a way
particularly you said Amy not so
much

34:07.145 --> 34:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's the candidates but also
just wears
the power within the driving
this

34:13.218 --> 34:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign we we've been used to
over the
years the power of the elites
whether to

34:19.357 --> 34:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the media or in the donors for
the party
that could ultimately shape the
campaign

34:25.030 --> 34:29.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this case especially on the
republican side they've had
little to no

34:29.868 --> 34:33.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact no that doesn't mean as
we move
forward they won't but it's
clear the

34:33.939 --> 34:38.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
super PAC spending certainly
hasn't
helped Jeb Bush the attacks by
elite

34:38.710 --> 34:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative media haven't done
anything
to stop Donald Trump and when
you look

34:43.682 --> 34:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just at that overall pulling the
number
of people in the republican
primary say

34:48.253 --> 34:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we want somebody who has 0
experience in
governing is over 50% is there
anyone on

34:54.392 --> 34:55.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the republican side

34:56.027 --> 35:00.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scott Walker and her what
happened to
him on your side that doesn't
get much

35:00.899 --> 35:05.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention now that you keep
wondering
why not on the democratic side
covering

35:05.270 --> 35:10.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the democrats yeah there was a
time when
you really thought martin
O'Malley would

35:10.108 --> 35:16.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
catch fire and he he just never
had he's
he stayed in the load single
digits the

35:16.214 --> 35:20.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole time hes the maryland
governor
former maryland governor and and
he on

35:20.085 --> 35:29.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
paper looks like he has
incredibly low
name idea he still is is just
working

35:29.160 --> 35:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard and not really getting
anywhere and
and it's kind of surprising

35:34.799 --> 35:41.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passport now we're gonna look
ahead I
was less than a month away right
do you

35:41.606 --> 35:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still think as we sit here now
that
these first these first
primaries are

35:46.644 --> 35:54.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well how important are they
important
they are still very important

35:54.085 --> 35:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still think they are going to
winnow
the field down we're not gonna
have all

35:59.290 --> 36:05.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these 13 on the republican side
and we
may lose martin O'Malley to but
I think

36:05.463 --> 36:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the real question is going to
be what
does donald Trump do if he does
not win

36:12.971 --> 36:16.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of those early states are
assumptions about this race is
always

36:16.841 --> 36:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
centered around donald Trump
where is he
is the first is he going to be
running

36:22.814 --> 36:26.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as an independent candidate what
is his
message how the candidates
reacting to

36:26.551 --> 36:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him if he does not win in iowa
new
hampshire the entire premise of
his

36:32.090 --> 36:37.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign is now collapsed during
his
entire premise of his campaign
it I'm a

36:37.228 --> 36:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
winner and Euro losers I'm in
first
you're not what he decides to do
is also

36:42.834 --> 36:46.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have an impact going
happens to
the rest of these candidates are
you see

36:46.304 --> 36:54.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening my crystal ball on how
many of
these faces I think there will
be far

36:54.612 --> 37:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fewer faces after Iowa New
Hampshire and
I think also super tuesday is
very

37:00.852 --> 37:06.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heavily weighted to southern
states and
and I think that it is going to
change

37:06.558 --> 37:11.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the dynamic and it's hard to
campaign in
all those states takes money and
it

37:11.896 --> 37:16.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
takes hard money not just super
PAC
money and what we know from the
past

37:16.501 --> 37:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaigns and I know they have
been a
good guide in this election
because

37:19.037 --> 37:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything we seem to have
learned last
time isn't isn't happening this
force

37:22.407 --> 37:24.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you to say

37:24.075 --> 37:31.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where I was not so clear my
crystal ball
but here's what we know we know
that the

37:31.649 --> 37:37.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
events that start to happen when
the
voters start voting really
accelerates

37:37.088 --> 37:40.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the process all the polls that
we've had
up until all the assumptions
that we've

37:40.558 --> 37:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had up until now they can change
overnight when voters actually
start

37:44.762 --> 37:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
casting ballots ok we'll be back
next
week in New Year happy new year

replacements but
there's growing debate over how
many are

38:17.762 --> 38:19.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

therefore
by deter them from ever doing

43:10.655 --> 43:15.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you really could be talking
about four

45:52.783 --> 45:57.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the smaller attack subs don't
have the

and that

45:57.254 --> 46:01.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their cruise missiles don't have

46:26.450 --> 46:29.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

means it
would have been decommissioned
in the

46:29.887 --> 46:33.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next couple of years but now the

myself

46:59.183 --> 47:04.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

little bit

no one would sort of know what
the fate

difficult one

47:34.985 --> 47:38.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the reasons we train so
frequently
that evolution you saw we do
that time

47:38.556 --> 47:42.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and time again so it becomes
something
that we can execute immediately
and

47:42.626 --> 47:47.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quickly but after that would be
a very
