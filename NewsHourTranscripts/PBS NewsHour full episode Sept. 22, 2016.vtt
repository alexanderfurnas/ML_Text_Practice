JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.039 --> 00:06.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:09.710 --> 00:13.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I am urging each of you
members of our
community to come together in
peace.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Calls for calm in
Charlotte,
North Carolina, after another
night of violent

00:19.786 --> 00:23.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protests in response to a police
shooting
rocks the city.

00:23.757 --> 00:28.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Thursday, in our
two-part look at how the major
candidates

00:28.528 --> 00:34.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would actually govern, we begin
with a comprehensive
guide to the early days of a
potential Donald

00:34.134 --> 00:35.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump presidency.

00:35.903 --> 00:40.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Making Sense
of the way
marketers try to manipulate
customers making

00:40.274 --> 00:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
financial decisions before they
even face
them.

00:43.210 --> 00:46.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT CIALDINI, Author,
"Pre-Suasion: A Revolutionary
Way to Influence and Persuade":
What new psychology

00:46.046 --> 00:53.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggests, it's the factor that
is top of consciousness
at the moment before you make
that economic

00:53.120 --> 00:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decision that will win the day.

00:55.355 --> 01:03.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.163 --> 01:05.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.999 --> 01:15.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Soldiers are in
the streets
of North Carolina's largest city
tonight,

01:15.475 --> 01:17.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after two nights of violence.

01:17.311 --> 01:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the people of Charlotte are
waiting to
see what happens next, in the
streets, and

01:22.149 --> 01:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the investigation of the
fatal shooting
that started it all.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.220 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GOV.

01:27.254 --> 01:30.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAT MCCRORY (R), North Carolina:
I firmly
believe that we cannot tolerate
any types

01:30.123 --> 01:31.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of violence directed toward
citizens.

01:32.025 --> 01:37.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appeals for calm
came from
all quarters, from Governor Pat
McCrory on

01:37.097 --> 01:38.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

01:38.999 --> 01:43.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hours earlier, he declared a
state of emergency,
and sent National Guard troops
rolling into

01:43.303 --> 01:45.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the city.

01:45.038 --> 01:49.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That followed another night that
began with
peaceful demonstrations against
the police

01:49.643 --> 01:55.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killing of a black man on
Tuesday.

01:55.315 --> 01:58.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it quickly turned again to
violence.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Someone started shooting during
a march.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.321 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(GUNSHOTS)

02:01.355 --> 02:02.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Shots fired.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Shots fired.

02:04.191 --> 02:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A black protester
was critically
wounded, and many in the crowd
accused the

02:07.995 --> 02:09.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
police.

02:09.830 --> 02:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: When they shot the guy --
they started
screaming no justice no peace,
and then they

02:13.433 --> 02:15.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just shot him.

02:15.135 --> 02:22.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The crowd
retreated before
paint balls and tear gas, but
small groups

02:22.743 --> 02:27.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
smashed windows, looted stores
and set fires.

02:27.114 --> 02:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police denied they had shot the
protester,
but Chief Kerr Putney said today
it's being

02:32.853 --> 02:34.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigated.

02:34.621 --> 02:35.822 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
KERR PUTNEY,
Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North
Carolina, Police Chief: The
allegation was

02:35.856 --> 02:37.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made that one of our officers
might have been
involved.

02:37.524 --> 02:39.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I said before, guys, we are
here to seek
the truth.

02:39.993 --> 02:44.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're investigating that to
find the truth,
the absolute truth.

02:44.264 --> 02:49.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The city also
faced growing
pressure to release video of the
fatal shooting

02:49.536 --> 02:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that set the protests in motion.

02:52.305 --> 02:56.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials say Keith Lamont Scott
had a gun
and refused to put it down.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His family insists he was
unarmed.

02:59.913 --> 03:03.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chief Putney said today the
video raises more
questions.

03:03.116 --> 03:15.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERR PUTNEY: The video doesn't
give me absolute,
definitive visual evidence that
-- that would

03:15.228 --> 03:18.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
confirm that a person is
pointing a gun.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I didn't see that in the videos
that I reviewed.

03:21.435 --> 03:26.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The chief said
he's trying
to arrange to let the family see
the video,

03:26.406 --> 03:29.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he cited state law as a
reason not to
make it public.

03:29.910 --> 03:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the day went on, the local
district attorney
asked the state bureau of
investigation to

03:34.748 --> 03:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take over the case, while, in
Washington,
Attorney General Loretta Lynch
announced she's

03:40.087 --> 03:44.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sending in a team of
peacekeeping experts,
and she made an appeal of her
own.

03:44.858 --> 03:48.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: I urge
those responsible fore bring
violence to these

03:48.095 --> 03:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demonstrations to stop, because
you are drowning
out the voices of commitment and
change and

03:53.800 --> 03:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're ushering more tragedy and
grief in
our communities.

03:56.203 --> 04:00.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in
Charlotte, some of
the city's biggest employers,
from Bank of

04:00.607 --> 04:06.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America and Wells Fargo to Duke
Energy, told
workers to stay home.

04:06.079 --> 04:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, National Guard troops
fanned out,
with hundreds more officers also
expected

04:11.418 --> 04:13.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the streets tonight.

04:13.353 --> 04:18.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For some further insight into
what local officials
are doing this evening, I'm
joined by Trevor

04:18.358 --> 04:19.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Fuller.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the chair at large of the
Mecklenburg
County Board of Commissioners.

04:22.662 --> 04:27.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been out in the Charlotte
community today,
and I spoke with him a short
time ago.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chairman Fuller, thank you for
joining us.

04:29.703 --> 04:32.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How would you describe the
situation in Charlotte
right now?

04:32.672 --> 04:34.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TREVOR FULLER, Chairman,
Mecklenburg County
Board of Commissioners: Well,
there's no doubt

04:34.941 --> 04:36.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that it's very tense.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for having me, Judy.

04:38.745 --> 04:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a tense time in Mecklenburg
County, something
we haven't really seen in our
lifetimes.

04:46.953 --> 04:52.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we are trying our best to
keep things
under control as best we can.

04:52.592 --> 04:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are you
hearing from people
you talk to in the community?

04:55.896 --> 05:01.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we should say Mecklenburg
County essentially
encircles the city of Charlotte.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TREVOR FULLER: That's right.

05:03.270 --> 05:08.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Mecklenburg County, we have
over a million
people who live here,
approximately 800,000

05:08.308 --> 05:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of whom live in the city of
Charlotte.

05:11.511 --> 05:19.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're hearing is a high
degree of
unrest, uncertainty about what's
going to

05:19.419 --> 05:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happen tonight and the next
several days.

05:22.589 --> 05:30.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we're trying to do
is to manage
-- manage the flow of
information, to manage

05:30.263 --> 05:35.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our emotional state, and hoping
that we can
get some calm, so that we can
then have the

05:35.869 --> 05:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dialogue that we so desperately
need.

05:37.671 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think it
was the right
decision to bring in the
National Guard to

05:42.042 --> 05:45.445 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beef up, in effect, the police
tonight?

05:45.478 --> 05:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR FULLER: Well, it's clear
that we didn't
have enough resources last
night, and so I

05:52.686 --> 05:57.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felt it was necessary for us to
have some
additional resources available
to us.

05:57.791 --> 06:02.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if it's more than we need,
I think we're
better off having the greater
resources than

06:02.762 --> 06:04.531 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not.

06:04.564 --> 06:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What sort of job
do you believe
the leaders in the community
have done so

06:08.535 --> 06:10.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
far, the police chief, the
mayor, and others?

06:10.670 --> 06:18.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR FULLER: Well, I think
everyone is working
just as hard as they can to try
to deal with

06:19.012 --> 06:22.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the situation that really we
haven't dealt
with in our community.

06:22.616 --> 06:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had big events here, but
nothing quite
like this.

06:26.553 --> 06:33.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so I'm a little more
forgiving under circumstances
that people haven't dealt with
before.

06:33.727 --> 06:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're doing the best we
can, in particular
our chief of police, who is
trying hard under

06:40.166 --> 06:43.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very difficult circumstances to
maintain control.

06:43.570 --> 06:47.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean
when you say
this is something the community
has not dealt

06:47.140 --> 06:48.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with before?

06:48.942 --> 06:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR FULLER: Well, Charlotte
is a welcoming
place, and we like to deal with
our issues

06:53.380 --> 06:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by talking through them, by
developing plans
of action together.

06:59.119 --> 07:02.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are not a community that
has this kind
of disruption.

07:02.989 --> 07:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are a peaceful community, and
we believe
it's better when we are able to
talk with

07:08.094 --> 07:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other, even if we have
difficult conversations,
that it's better to talk through
these things

07:13.066 --> 07:17.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and develop a communal plan of
action.

07:17.337 --> 07:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so to have these kinds of
unrest and violence
in our community is something
that is just

07:24.611 --> 07:26.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not normal for us.

07:26.513 --> 07:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But do you see
the justification
that apparently many feel for
being angry,

07:33.853 --> 07:44.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that they feel something was
done in the
shooting of this man who they
say didn't deserve

07:44.197 --> 07:45.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be shot to death?

07:45.932 --> 07:51.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TREVOR FULLER: Yes, there is no
question that
I grieve for the family of Mr.
Scott.

07:51.404 --> 07:57.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I grieve for the people who are
in the streets
who are protesting.

07:57.844 --> 08:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I believe they are
protesting is
a sense of helplessness, a sense
of feeling

08:03.283 --> 08:07.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under siege, that the system
doesn't seem
to respond to them.

08:07.821 --> 08:13.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so that's why, in
Mecklenburg County,
I have been talking so much
about the challenge

08:13.860 --> 08:15.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of economic opportunity.

08:15.562 --> 08:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How can we make sure that
prosperity that's
in this county gets shared by
all?

08:20.567 --> 08:27.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have talked about universal
pre-K in Mecklenburg
County, the strength of our
educational system.

08:27.240 --> 08:35.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is no question that the
protests,
the unrest that we're seeing has
a source,

08:35.415 --> 08:37.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a legitimate source.

08:37.217 --> 08:43.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our challenge now is, how do we
get to the
root of that and solve it
without violence?

08:43.690 --> 08:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what do you
think the answer
to that is?

08:46.059 --> 08:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TREVOR FULLER: Well, the answer
is, first,
we have to regain calm.

08:50.764 --> 08:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to regain security,
because, my view
is, when emotions are high,
intelligence is

08:56.669 --> 08:58.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
low.

08:58.505 --> 09:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have got to get our
community in
a place of safety, so that we
can have these

09:04.210 --> 09:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversations that we need to
have, conversations
about who shares an economic
prosperity, conversations,

09:11.718 --> 09:14.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult conversations about
race.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's very difficult to have
those conversations
when people do not feel safe.

09:17.791 --> 09:20.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so we first have to
establish safety.

09:20.693 --> 09:25.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we need to not only
have the dialogue,
but also have a plan of action
and execute

09:25.698 --> 09:27.634 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on it.

09:27.667 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Trevor Fuller,
who is the Mecklenburg
County commission chair, we
thank you very

09:32.705 --> 09:33.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

09:33.706 --> 09:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

09:44.384 --> 09:48.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

fired.

09:56.062 --> 09:58.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The district attorney

deeply troubling.

09:58.431 --> 10:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE KUNZWEILER, Tulsa County
District Attorney:
We need to pray for wisdom and
guidance on

10:03.369 --> 10:08.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
each of our respective paths in
life.

10:08.708 --> 10:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each of us at the end of our
days will have
to account for our own actions.

10:12.979 --> 10:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: If convicted,

confirming one of
the largest breaches of online
data ever.

10:23.389 --> 10:29.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It says hackers stole personal
data from 500
million of its users' accounts.

10:29.128 --> 10:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Internet company blamed an
unspecified
state-sponsored actor.

10:33.366 --> 10:39.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said the break-in dates to
late 2014, but
was only recently found.

GWEN IFILL: Afghanistan signed a
draft peace
deal today with a notorious
Islamist warlord.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is believed
to be living
in Pakistan.

10:49.482 --> 10:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. designated him a global
terrorist
in 2003.

10:53.253 --> 10:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hekmatyar's representative
signed the accord
in Kabul.

10:56.823 --> 11:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It grants full political rights

AHMAD GILANI, Afghanistan High
Peace Council
(through translator): I am happy
and fully

11:05.164 --> 11:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confident that the finalizing of
this agreement
will be the start of permanent
peace and stability

11:11.237 --> 11:12.872 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Afghanistan.

11:12.906 --> 11:16.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On this, I congratulate the
people of Afghanistan.

11:16.075 --> 11:20.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This marks the

U.S. invasion in 2001.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Police in South
Africa clashed
with university students today
during growing

11:27.987 --> 11:30.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protests against rising tuition.

11:30.823 --> 11:35.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officers fired tear gas in
Johannesburg after
students started throwing rocks.
and they

11:35.628 --> 11:39.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
surrounded a student residence
where protesters
gathered.

11:39.232 --> 11:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The demonstrators say fee
increases will only
add to racial inequalities, with
many black

11:44.737 --> 11:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students unable to afford the

GWEN IFILL: Power is slowly
returning to Puerto
Rico tonight.

11:51.277 --> 11:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The island has been in the dark
for nearly
24 hours, after a fire at a
power plant caused

11:56.416 --> 11:58.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a widespread blackout.

11:58.184 --> 12:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's affected 3.5 million
people.

12:00.320 --> 12:05.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Wall Street,
stocks posted
more gains, amid relief that
interest rates

12:05.425 --> 12:07.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aren't rising just yet.

12:07.594 --> 12:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average

points to close at 18392.

12:13.266 --> 12:17.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
diminishing hopes for renewing
Syria's cease-fire;

12:45.365 --> 12:50.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the disconnect in the black
community between
civil rights achievements and
recent police

12:50.503 --> 12:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shootings; what Donald Trump
would do on day
one in the Oval Office;
marketing techniques

12:56.776 --> 13:04.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most of us aren't even aware of;
plus much
more.

13:04.050 --> 13:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Syrian army
announced late
today the beginning of a major
new offensive

13:13.059 --> 13:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the rebel-held eastern
sectors of
Aleppo.

13:16.562 --> 13:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This came after a defiant Bashar
al-Assad
blamed the United States for the
failure of

13:21.267 --> 13:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a cease-fire agreement struck
two weeks ago.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan reports.

13:25.905 --> 13:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A rain of fire
lit up Aleppo,
Syria, overnight.

13:32.345 --> 13:37.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was one of scores of
airstrikes, the most
in months, and it proved a
thundering, brutal

13:37.550 --> 13:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
answer to Secretary of State
John Kerry's
plea for the Syrian military and
its Russian

13:42.055 --> 13:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
allies to ground their jets.

13:44.924 --> 13:50.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Airstrikes resumed Monday, hours
after a U.S.-
and Russian-brokered cease-fire
expired.

13:50.496 --> 13:55.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an interview broadcast today,
Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad told the
Associated Press

13:55.268 --> 13:58.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the blame lies squarely with
Washington and
its allies.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BASHAR AL-ASSAD, President of
Syria (through
translator): We announced that
we are ready

14:00.106 --> 14:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be committed to any halt of
operations,
or if you want to call it,
cease-fire, but

14:07.780 --> 14:11.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's not about Syria or Russia.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about the United States and
the terrorist
groups that have been affiliated
to ISIS and

14:14.821 --> 14:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
al-Nusra and al-Qaida, and to
the United States
and to Turkey and to Saudi
Arabia.

14:18.658 --> 14:22.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House today rejected
that charge, but Assad went
further, insisting

14:23.029 --> 14:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. deliberately targeted
Syrian forces
in a weekend airstrike.

14:26.799 --> 14:30.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. military says that was
a mistake.

14:30.603 --> 14:35.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Assad denied
any Syrian
or Russian involvement in the
attack on a

14:35.675 --> 14:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
humanitarian aid convoy outside
Aleppo on
Monday.

14:39.979 --> 14:44.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, Secretary of
Defense Ashton
Carter and Marine General Joseph
Dunford went

14:44.517 --> 14:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before the Senate Armed Services
Committee,
and rejected Assad's denial.

14:48.521 --> 14:53.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The general also acknowledged a
rift with
the State Department over a
cease-fire provision

14:53.626 --> 14:56.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
calling for military
coordination with the
Russians in Syria.

GEN.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH DUNFORD, Joint Chiefs of
Staff Chairman:
Chairman, I do not believe it
would be a good

14:59.665 --> 15:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
idea to share intelligence with
Russians.

15:01.534 --> 15:04.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Committee
chair Republican
John McCain pressed Dunford on
whether the

15:04.937 --> 15:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama administration's Syria
policy, which
prioritizes fighting the Islamic
State and

15:09.942 --> 15:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other militant groups and not
Assad, is working.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN (R), Arizona: I'm
asking, is our
military strategy succeeding in
Syria?

15:17.416 --> 15:19.018 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

15:19.051 --> 15:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH DUNFORD: Our military
strategy is focused
on the counter-ISIL campaign.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In my judgment, we are
succeeding in that
campaign.

15:23.823 --> 15:25.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:25.691 --> 15:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCCAIN: So, as far as
you're concerned,
we ignore the 400,000 dead and
the six million

15:30.196 --> 15:32.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refugees that's caused by Bashar
Assad?

15:32.231 --> 15:36.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As that
hearing was under
way in Washington, Secretary of
State John

15:36.235 --> 15:39.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kerry was in New York, meeting
with the Russian
foreign minister and the
International Syria

15:39.972 --> 15:43.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Support Group in a bid to revive
the cease-fire.

15:43.910 --> 15:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prospects appeared doubtful, and
Moscow announced
it's sending its only aircraft
carrier to

15:48.648 --> 15:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Mediterranean Sea to begin
new air operations
in Syria.

15:53.119 --> 15:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And outside Damascus, the United
Nations resumed
deliveries of food and medicine,
sending a

15:57.890 --> 16:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
convoy into a suburb of the
Syrian capital.

16:00.893 --> 16:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

16:06.833 --> 16:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Charlotte and Tulsa
are the latest
communities grappling with an
ongoing, enormous

16:19.512 --> 16:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate over police shootings,
protest violence
and social justice.

16:24.317 --> 16:30.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's become a long list, New
York, Chicago,
Minneapolis, Oakland, Baton
Rouge, Ferguson.

16:30.456 --> 16:35.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each incident sparks a renewed
and wrenching
conversation within communities
of color.

16:35.962 --> 16:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore some of that now with
Rashad Robinson,
executive director of the racial
justice organization

16:41.234 --> 16:46.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Color of Change, Vanessa De
Luca, editor in
chief of "Essence,"a magazine
for and about

16:46.305 --> 16:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black women, and Andre Perry, an
author, activist
and educator.

16:51.277 --> 16:52.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you all.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This has been a week.

16:54.714 --> 16:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We reported about it last night
on the "NewsHour,"
where we were talking about this
brand-new

16:59.719 --> 17:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
museum that is opening in the
Mall, lots of
rejoicing, lots of excitement
about that,

17:05.591 --> 17:10.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
upbeat, and, at the same time,
the same conversations
turn to what's happening in
Charlotte, what's

17:10.997 --> 17:12.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happening in Tulsa.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rashad Robinson, there is a
dichotomy at work
here.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.269 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

17:16.302 --> 17:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RASHAD ROBINSON, Executive
Director, Color
of Change: I think there
absolutely is a dichotomy.

17:18.638 --> 17:24.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it speaks to this idea of
that not mistaking
presence for power, that just
because we are

17:24.977 --> 17:30.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seeing progress, progress for
black folks
in this country has never been
on a linear

17:30.082 --> 17:31.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sort of line.

17:31.384 --> 17:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen, you know, steps
ahead and then
steps backwards.

17:35.087 --> 17:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while we see huge steps
forward -- I got
to see a sneak peek of that
museum last night,

17:40.927 --> 17:42.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and it's beautiful.

17:42.929 --> 17:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It speaks to sort of all our
hopes and aspirations
and also shows all of the
struggles -- while,

17:49.035 --> 17:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the same time, the presence
of a black
president, the presence of black
billionaires

17:56.142 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't necessarily change the
rules, the
rules of policy, the rules of
culture, the

18:02.214 --> 18:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
written and unwritten rules that
govern us.

18:04.417 --> 18:10.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we're seeing so much of
that bubble
up, that that alone doesn't
change structural...

18:10.556 --> 18:12.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:12.425 --> 18:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me just
move on, because
we have a lot of people to --
lot of things

18:14.660 --> 18:15.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to talk about here.

18:15.661 --> 18:16.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vanessa De Luca, are we moving
forward?

18:16.996 --> 18:17.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Are we stalled?

18:17.997 --> 18:19.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are we moving backward?

18:19.799 --> 18:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VANESSA DE LUCA, Editor in
Chief, "Essence":
I mean, I think we're at a
tipping point,

18:23.736 --> 18:25.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

18:25.538 --> 18:30.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is so much to be
celebrated, certainly
with the museum, but if you look
at our day

18:30.142 --> 18:35.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to day, there is so much more
that needs to
be done in terms of
accountability, in terms

18:35.314 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of seeking justice, that we
can't ignore.

18:39.652 --> 18:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there needs to be -- we're
parallel-pathing
our way through this time in our
history.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we cannot afford to erase
anything.

18:51.597 --> 18:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, the museum is about
not erasing
our history, and certainly we
want to make

18:57.303 --> 19:01.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure, in all of our protests and
all of our
questions that are raised about
what's going

19:01.640 --> 19:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on in our community right now,
that that history
is also not erased.

19:04.977 --> 19:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Andre Perry, eight
years of a
black president, did it change
anything or

19:09.615 --> 19:11.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
did it set us back in some ways?

19:11.517 --> 19:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRE PERRY, Author/Activist:
No, it certainly,
in the sense that when he was
elected, the

19:16.322 --> 19:22.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day after, the country, at least
many people
of it, felt that they had to
take the country

19:22.094 --> 19:29.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back, it was a marker in which
we heard to
-- that people felt they had to
regain a foothold,

19:29.301 --> 19:31.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they lost their America.

19:31.737 --> 19:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we clearly understand that
having a black
president doesn't equate to
progress for black

19:37.343 --> 19:38.310 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just want to throw out just a
few statistics.

19:40.179 --> 19:46.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. is the only developed
country in
which maternal mortality is on
the rise.

19:46.852 --> 19:52.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three to four times the rate of
black women
die at the rate of white women.

19:52.058 --> 20:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Funding for schools has actually
widened between
rich and poor districts in at
least half of

20:00.900 --> 20:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the states in the country.

20:03.002 --> 20:09.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my state and home city of New
Orleans,
one in seven black people are on
prison and

20:09.909 --> 20:11.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
parole.

20:11.677 --> 20:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I would never quibble with
anyone if someone
said desegregation did me no
favors.

20:15.748 --> 20:19.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, except that,
when you listen
to Donald Trump, he's saying the
black community

20:19.385 --> 20:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is in its worst position ever,
ever, ever,
Rashad Robinson.

20:23.155 --> 20:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RASHAD ROBINSON: Well, we can
have a conversation
about the challenges without
including sort

20:29.161 --> 20:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Donald Trump, who is not
really talking
to black folks at all, but
talking to white

20:33.566 --> 20:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
folks in sort of this way of
trying to speak
down to and speak at black
Americans.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is a deep challenge.

20:41.240 --> 20:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I come from a family where I
have a father
in his Marine uniform who was
turned away

20:48.147 --> 20:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from using bathrooms in the
South while he
was stationed heading off to
Vietnam, a grandfather

20:54.820 --> 20:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who was a sharecropper and
couldn't read or
write.

20:57.590 --> 21:02.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there are deep ways in which
this country
experienced progress, but, once
again, it

21:02.461 --> 21:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speaks to ways in which that we
have to constantly
evaluate the rules, the rules
that govern

21:07.833 --> 21:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of our lives, and constantly
challenge
systems that hold people back.

21:14.173 --> 21:19.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when black people win, when
black people
succeed in this country, it's
oftentimes been

21:19.211 --> 21:21.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a symbol of everyone succeeding.

21:21.814 --> 21:28.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so, as there's been
challenges, black
folks have oftentimes been the
canary in the

21:28.154 --> 21:30.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mine.

21:30.055 --> 21:34.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what we're seeing in the
streets, this
struggles, the issues around
sort of generational

21:34.660 --> 21:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poverty, they're not just
impacting black
folks, but there is this idea
that we oftentimes

21:38.697 --> 21:43.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say is that, when America gets
the cold, black
people oftentimes get the flu.

21:44.003 --> 21:47.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Vanessa De Luca, on
the cover
of your magazine this month,
there is a striking

21:47.239 --> 21:51.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
photograph of Barack and
Michelle Obama which
looks kind of like a farewell
from the black

21:51.777 --> 21:54.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community to the first black
president and
first lady.

21:54.713 --> 22:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I wonder if -- do your
readers respond
to you with hope or kind of
despair?

22:00.452 --> 22:09.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VANESSA DE LUCA: Well,
certainly, there is
this kind of longing and wanting
for the Obama

22:09.295 --> 22:13.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration and the Obama era
to last longer,
without a doubt.

22:13.632 --> 22:19.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is hope that, in the
next -- whoever
that next administration is,
that they will

22:19.672 --> 22:26.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
be cognizant of what is
important to us, that
they will try to address some of
the issues.

22:26.579 --> 22:31.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will hear more about that
at the presidential
debate on Monday.

22:31.917 --> 22:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Really, what do they stand for
and what don't
they not stand for in terms of
what resonates

22:38.023 --> 22:40.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with our black community?

22:40.793 --> 22:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what I think people
are kind of
hopeful for.

22:43.562 --> 22:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just want to hear a word, and
a word that
makes sense for everything
that's going on

22:50.035 --> 22:53.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around us that speaks to how
we're going to
move forward.

22:53.172 --> 22:57.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Andre Perry, what's
a leader's
responsibility in this, whether
it's a president

22:57.610 --> 23:03.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a county commissioner like
who we talked
to earlier, Trevor Fuller, or --
and why should

23:03.415 --> 23:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it matter at all to the broader
community?

23:05.784 --> 23:09.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRE PERRY: Well, it's not too
much to demand
that we're not shot dead in the
street.

23:09.355 --> 23:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not too much for us to
demand that we
get clean water in Michigan.

23:13.892 --> 23:17.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the things that we are
asking for
are basic human rights.

23:17.630 --> 23:24.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when I look out at the
presidential
landscape, it's not our job just
to anoint

23:24.069 --> 23:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary or Trump, just because
one is a Democrat
or Republican.

23:28.741 --> 23:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We really have to charge them
with having
an explicit agenda for black
people.

23:34.380 --> 23:36.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it's not about hope for
me.

23:36.315 --> 23:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about who's going to
deliver the political
goods that we have yet to see
thus far, and

23:42.121 --> 23:45.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
certainly since the Obama
administration and
beyond.

23:45.924 --> 23:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me ask you
all to take
a huge step backward and talk
about perception.

23:50.863 --> 23:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw in the helicopter footage
of what happened
in Tulsa this week one of the
police officers

23:56.969 --> 24:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very far off the ground look at
the man, Terence
Crutcher, who was later killed
and call him

24:02.508 --> 24:04.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a bad dude.

24:04.310 --> 24:09.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clearly, there were some
preconceptions, Rashad
Robinson, some idea, even from a
distance,

24:09.348 --> 24:12.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this person must be a
criminal.

24:12.184 --> 24:16.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are perceptions as much a part
of the problem
here as reality?

24:16.722 --> 24:18.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RASHAD ROBINSON: It absolutely
is.

24:19.024 --> 24:23.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's absolutely about the
culture, the sort
of daily hostile environment.

24:23.295 --> 24:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's not just simply about
getting a job,
right, or being treated fairly
in a hospital,

24:28.334 --> 24:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it's about being able to
rent a room.

24:30.769 --> 24:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also want to put on the
table that it
just wasn't what the helicopter
-- what they

24:35.808 --> 24:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said in the helicopter about him
being a bad
guy, but it was after he was
shot and laying

24:40.679 --> 24:45.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the ground, and no one rushed
to give him
medical attention.

24:45.317 --> 24:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It speaks to this hostile world
that black
people have to live in, the lack
of humanity.

24:51.323 --> 24:56.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, first of all, the lack of
benefit of a
doubt of who he was, and then
the lack of

24:56.595 --> 25:03.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
humanity as he laid on the
ground bleeding,
and medical help to save his
life wasn't sort

25:03.102 --> 25:08.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a first thing that someone
wanted to do,
speaks to a way in which black
people have

25:08.907 --> 25:12.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to -- the things that black
people have to
contend with every day when we
show up to

25:12.711 --> 25:14.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a hospital, when we show up to a
courtroom.

25:14.413 --> 25:16.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VANESSA DE LUCA: Right.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you
Vanessa De Luca,
so maybe we can end on something
of a hopeful

25:18.851 --> 25:22.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
note, if there is such a thing,
which is,
what do we do about this, other
than have

25:22.821 --> 25:24.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
another national dialogue,
another conversation?

25:24.923 --> 25:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VANESSA DE LUCA: Well, I mean, I
think, certainly,
people need to use their vote as
their voice,

25:32.731 --> 25:35.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right, that we fought so hard
for that.

25:35.567 --> 25:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea that there are some
camps that
are saying that they're not
going to vote

25:40.873 --> 25:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at all is just unconscionable.

25:44.309 --> 25:49.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We fought too hard to get this
right, and
it really does have an impact.

25:49.248 --> 25:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know there is the popular vote
vs. the electoral
vote, but people actually need
to exercise

25:54.653 --> 25:59.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their right to vote and to make
sure they
are voting for people who are
serving their

25:59.258 --> 26:01.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
best interests.

26:01.093 --> 26:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would say let's still --
let's not pass
that off as something that is
just kind of

26:06.098 --> 26:12.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like a throwaway, but let's
really embrace
and not fritter away what so
many generations

26:12.404 --> 26:14.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fought so hard for us to be able
to do.

26:14.206 --> 26:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Vanessa De Luca,
editor in chief
of "Essence" magazine, Andre
Perry, a writer

26:18.177 --> 26:21.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from New Orleans, Rashad
Robinson of Color
of Change, thank you all.

26:21.947 --> 26:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RASHAD ROBINSON: Thank you.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VANESSA DE LUCA: Thank you.

26:25.384 --> 26:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDRE PERRY: You're welcome.

26:31.557 --> 26:37.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the race to
the White House,
the candidates are taking
different approaches

26:38.030 --> 26:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the final days leading up to
the first
debate.

26:41.500 --> 26:43.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

26:43.435 --> 26:48.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, Donald
Trump offered
his take on the unrest that has
gripped Charlotte

26:48.273 --> 26:50.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the past two nights.

26:50.075 --> 26:52.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The people who will suffer the
most as a result

26:52.878 --> 27:01.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of these riots are law-abiding
African-American
residents who live in these
communities where

27:01.119 --> 27:03.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the crime is so rampant.

27:03.222 --> 27:08.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Drugs are a very, very big
factor in what
you're watching on television at
night.

27:08.961 --> 27:13.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He said his tough law
and order
agenda, which now includes
backing stop and

27:14.032 --> 27:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frisk, a practice a federal
judge said discriminated
against minorities, would
benefit black Americans.

27:20.606 --> 27:26.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Our job is not to
make life
more comfortable for the violent
disrupter,

27:26.144 --> 27:31.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but to make life more
comfortable for the
African- American parent trying
to raise their

27:31.783 --> 27:33.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
kids in peace.

27:33.552 --> 27:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: World peace with was
the topic
of a letter from 75 retired
career diplomats

27:38.123 --> 27:42.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slamming Trump as entirely
unqualified to
serve as president.

27:43.028 --> 27:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the diplomats who signed
the letter
haven't been publicly associated
with politics.

27:47.666 --> 27:53.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a Politico analysis
of campaign
finance reports found that the
Trump campaign

27:53.772 --> 27:58.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has paid Trump's businesses $8.2
million.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's about 7 percent of the
campaign's total
spending.

28:02.047 --> 28:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton spent the day
behind closed
doors preparing for Monday
night's debate.

28:06.885 --> 28:10.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That left running mate Tim Kaine
as the campaign's
top messenger.

28:10.088 --> 28:11.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
Where we see challenges all over
the country,

28:13.792 --> 28:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenges of gulfs and gaps
that exist between
communities and law enforcement,
we have got

28:19.932 --> 28:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to put them on the table.

28:21.400 --> 28:26.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not easy, but we can do
that with
a calm and peaceful spirit.

28:26.305 --> 28:31.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton also reached
out to millennial
voters, appearing on the new
installment of

28:31.810 --> 28:38.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comic Zach Galifianakis' Web
series "Between
Two Ferns" that went online this
morning.

28:38.717 --> 28:41.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

28:41.420 --> 28:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's been no
shortage of
attention paid to who might win
the presidential

28:46.158 --> 28:51.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election this November, but what
promises
can they deliver once in office?

28:51.196 --> 28:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we examine what the
early days of
a Trump presidency might look
like, and whether

28:56.168 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the next Congress would be an
ally or a thorn
in his side.

28:59.905 --> 29:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we turn to Evan Osnos,
a staff writer
for "The New Yorker" magazine,
and Seung Min

29:05.410 --> 29:06.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kim.

29:06.411 --> 29:08.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's a congressional reporter
for Politico.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

29:09.881 --> 29:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Evan, I'm going to start with
you.

29:11.650 --> 29:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You did write a sort a story for
the latest
"New Yorker" about what Trump
would do in

29:15.020 --> 29:17.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his early days in office.

29:17.322 --> 29:18.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's go down the list.

29:19.024 --> 29:24.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You start with suggesting he
would renounce
this global agreement on climate
change.

29:24.730 --> 29:25.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How would that work?

29:25.731 --> 29:27.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What could he do?

29:27.532 --> 29:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS, "The New Yorker":
Well, the campaign
is preparing what's been
described as the

29:29.468 --> 29:34.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first day project, which would
be an effort
to try to do a large number of
things right

29:34.806 --> 29:38.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
away using the powers of the
executive office,
using the powers of the
presidency.

29:38.877 --> 29:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're planning on 25 things.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if they started, for
instance, one of
the ones that they are weighing
is to renounce

29:44.449 --> 29:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Paris climate change.

29:45.751 --> 29:47.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That -- the president has legal
authority
to do it.

29:48.020 --> 29:54.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's much the way that George W.
Bush when
he came into office in 2001 was
able to, for

29:54.693 --> 29:58.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
instance, remove the United
States from an
agreement on the International
Criminal Court.

29:58.196 --> 30:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is nothing that stops a
president from
doing that.

30:01.166 --> 30:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they could also do other
things.

30:03.035 --> 30:07.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, he could roll back
some environmental
regulations that have been
imposed by the

30:07.706 --> 30:14.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama administration, and he
could also redirect
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms

30:14.246 --> 30:20.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say you no longer need to
deliver background
-- to do background checks on
gun purchases

30:20.118 --> 30:21.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way that you were directed
to do so under
Obama.

30:21.953 --> 30:27.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So he could take
some substantive
steps in the early days that
wouldn't require

30:27.159 --> 30:28.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any congressional action.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Seung Min, let me return to you.

30:30.629 --> 30:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the assumption has been,
if Donald
Trump wins, he is probably going
to keep a

30:34.266 --> 30:37.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republican Senate and a
Republican House.

30:37.936 --> 30:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if he makes moves like this,
the presumption
is, there is not going to be
much pushback

30:42.541 --> 30:44.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the Hill.

30:44.042 --> 30:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEUNG MIN KIM, Politico: It
depends on the
form of his proposals make.

30:47.746 --> 30:51.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The executive order action part
of this is
really interesting, because what
you have

30:51.516 --> 30:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heard from Republicans and here
in Congress
for the last several years is,
they're basically

30:55.420 --> 31:00.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calling President Obama the
imperial president,
that he has acted too much on
his own without

31:00.525 --> 31:02.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the will of the Congress to
accomplish his
agenda.

31:02.994 --> 31:07.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a lot of these goals perhaps
on climate,
environmental issues, a
President Donald Trump

31:07.833 --> 31:11.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may share with Republicans in
Congress.

31:11.536 --> 31:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if they don't, it will be
interesting
to see what they -- what their
response is

31:15.373 --> 31:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to how a President Trump deals
with kind of
the executive powers -- or the
powers of the

31:20.445 --> 31:22.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
executive branch.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Evan, one other
thing we know,
one of the many things Donald
Trump has talked

31:25.016 --> 31:28.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about is suspending the Syrian
refugee program.

31:28.253 --> 31:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has been talking
about increasing
that number to over 100,000.

31:31.723 --> 31:33.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is it that Trump is looking
at doing?

31:33.525 --> 31:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS: Trump is -- Trump's
advisers have
told me that they're considering
on day one

31:36.928 --> 31:38.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suspending the program.

31:38.797 --> 31:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they can do that under
presidential authority,
because they can say that
refugees from a

31:42.300 --> 31:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific part of the world
represent a threat
to American security.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the sort of legal basis.

31:47.539 --> 31:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then more broadly, of
course, he's talking
about a major change in American
immigration.

31:51.076 --> 31:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he would also have the legal
power to
say we're going to vastly expand
and accelerate

31:55.247 --> 31:56.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the pace of deportations.

31:56.681 --> 31:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
the wall?

31:58.550 --> 32:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS: The wall, which has
been the central
promise of his candidacy, would
take a little

32:03.455 --> 32:05.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bit of footwork legislatively.

32:05.323 --> 32:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, you have -- if
it's estimated
to cost $25 billion, you're
either going to

32:09.594 --> 32:13.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to get somebody in Congress
to appropriate
that for you or, more likely,
whatever everybody

32:13.665 --> 32:18.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is telling me, after
negotiations, after the
horse-trading, he would probably
end up with

32:18.703 --> 32:23.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a small symbolic extension of
the border fence
which has already been in place
since 2006.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That has been in place since
2006.

32:25.644 --> 32:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newt Gingrich, who is Trump's
political adviser,
tells me, look, he has to do
something on

32:30.582 --> 32:32.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the wall for political reasons.

32:32.217 --> 32:33.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If he doesn't, he has no
credibility.

32:33.985 --> 32:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because it's been
one of the
central pieces of his -- of
everything that

32:36.855 --> 32:37.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he has talked about.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Seung Min, so what about from
Congress?

32:39.858 --> 32:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Donald Trump starts to
completely get rid
of the Syrian refugee intake, if
he starts

32:49.000 --> 32:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make moves on the wall and
immigration,
what's the reaction likely to be
on the Hill?

32:52.838 --> 32:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEUNG MIN KIM: The reaction is
going to be
-- it depends.

32:55.640 --> 33:00.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have seen obviously how
Donald Trump has
made waves in his campaign with
his positions

33:00.645 --> 33:02.647 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on immigration.

33:02.681 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, in terms of the broader
immigration proposals,
he is really going to need
Congress to appropriate

33:06.852 --> 33:11.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the money, if he does want to
ramp up the
pace of deportations to build
the wall.

33:11.923 --> 33:17.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have also seen -- you
have to remember
dynamics particularly in the
Senate next year.

33:17.095 --> 33:23.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under a Trump presidency,
clearly very, very
likely that Republicans will
have retained

33:23.235 --> 33:25.003 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
control.

33:25.036 --> 33:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, very unlikely that they
Will have
the 60 votes necessary to
advance basically

33:28.874 --> 33:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any legislation in the Senate.

33:31.009 --> 33:35.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Evan, let me turn
you quickly
to foreign policy, but to trade.

33:35.580 --> 33:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has talked a lot
about doing
away with TPP, the Trans-Pacific
Partnership

33:40.852 --> 33:43.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement, and that leads to
questions about
U.S. relations with China.

33:43.989 --> 33:45.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS: He could renounce
TPP.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He could renegotiate NAFTA.

33:47.993 --> 33:52.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, he could also
impose tariffs
on specific categories of goods
from China.

33:52.464 --> 33:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He can do that on day one.

33:53.899 --> 33:56.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He can direct the Commerce
Department to bring
cases under the WTO.

33:57.002 --> 34:01.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's interesting too -- and I
think people
don't -- underestimate this from
outside -- is

34:01.206 --> 34:05.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if the WTO said, well, your
actions are
illegal, he could actually
withdraw the United

34:05.944 --> 34:07.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
States from the WTO.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the World
Trade Organization.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS: The World Trade
Organization,
exactly, which has been the
basis of sort

34:10.749 --> 34:13.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the rules of fair trade for
decades.

34:13.485 --> 34:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they objected, he could say
we're pulling
out, the same way that George W.
Bush pulled

34:17.822 --> 34:19.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States out of the
anti-ballistic
missile treaty.

34:19.991 --> 34:25.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Seung Min,
if that's what
happens, what's the reaction on
the Hill?

34:25.063 --> 34:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEUNG MIN KIM: I think, on
trade, it's actually
a bit interesting.

34:27.699 --> 34:33.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump on trade,
specifically the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, has been the one
area where he

34:33.838 --> 34:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really has had an influence on
members of
Congress.

34:37.108 --> 34:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see the reaction from
Republican senators
who are up for reelection next
year, people

34:42.247 --> 34:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such as Ohio's Rob Portman,
who's a former
U.S. trade representative, and
Pennsylvania's

34:46.718 --> 34:50.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pat Toomey, who has voted for a
multitude
of free trade deals in Congress.

34:50.488 --> 34:52.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

34:52.290 --> 34:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEUNG MIN KIM: They're now all
running away
from the Trans-Pacific
Partnership, saying,

34:54.693 --> 35:00.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this has provisions in it that I
cannot support,
it's bad for Ohio, it's bad for
Pennsylvania.

35:00.065 --> 35:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you could actually see them,
obviously,
if those senators are reelected,
to go along

35:05.370 --> 35:08.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Donald Trump on ripping up
the TPP and
starting over.

35:08.807 --> 35:12.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you would actually have a
lot of support
from Democrats as well, because,
obviously,

35:12.344 --> 35:15.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backed by the unions, Democrats
have really
disliked the TPP.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just one final quick question to
you, Evan.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is on the Iran nuclear
deal.

35:20.085 --> 35:21.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would Donald Trump do, we
expect?

35:21.553 --> 35:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVAN OSNOS: Donald Trump has
said that he
would renegotiate the deal.

35:23.955 --> 35:29.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it's worth noting that if
he says -- if
he does that, that could
constitute a violation

35:29.494 --> 35:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the terms of the deal from
Iran's perspective,
which would then give Iran
permission to restart

35:34.766 --> 35:35.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
its nuclear plant.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There's a lot to
consider here.

35:38.003 --> 35:42.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much more to go, but this
certainly gives
us a sense of what the early
days could look

35:42.173 --> 35:43.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
like.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Evan Osnos and Seung Min Kim, we
thank you
both.

35:45.443 --> 35:47.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEUNG MIN KIM: Thanks for having
me.

35:47.445 --> 35:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow, we will
explore what
the early days of a Clinton
presidency might

35:51.616 --> 35:53.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
entail.

35:53.451 --> 35:58.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And now we continue
our coverage
of the issues of this campaign,
tonight, health

35:58.490 --> 36:04.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care, and specifically what's at
stake for
President Obama's signature
domestic achievement,

36:04.195 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Affordable Care Act, often
referred to
as Obamacare.

36:07.799 --> 36:12.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's turned into a significant
issue in some
states, like Arizona, where
polls show Hillary

36:12.303 --> 36:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton in a tight contest with
Donald Trump.

36:15.373 --> 36:20.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Sarah
Varney looks at
those concerns and the
candidates' plans.

36:20.378 --> 36:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This story was produced in
collaboration with
our partner Kaiser Health News.

36:24.582 --> 36:30.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Just weeks before
the presidential
election, Tempe, Arizona
resident Josephine

36:30.522 --> 36:35.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has spent nearly every morning
driving, waiting,
and back at home worrying.

36:35.593 --> 36:40.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once uninsured, she was recently
diagnosed
with breast cancer and gets
health coverage

36:40.532 --> 36:43.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through Obamacare.

36:43.301 --> 36:46.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 61-year-old, who goes by Jo,
says she
trusts just one candidate to
keep her covered.

36:46.971 --> 36:50.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I will continue to improve the
Affordable

36:51.009 --> 36:52.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

36:52.844 --> 37:01.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will work to get the costs
down, premiums,
co-pays, deductibles,
prescription drug costs.

37:01.686 --> 37:03.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

37:03.455 --> 37:07.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Hillary Clinton
has offered
detailed plans to preserve and
expand the

37:07.759 --> 37:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law, even pushing for a public
option, a type
of government-run insurance
plan.

37:12.831 --> 37:17.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also wants to expand tax
subsidies to
reduce health care costs and
allow people

37:17.469 --> 37:19.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
55 and older to buy into
Medicare.

37:19.938 --> 37:23.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We're going to repeal and
replace Obamacare

37:23.708 --> 37:24.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so quickly.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

37:26.444 --> 37:29.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Meanwhile, Donald
Trump wants
to replace the health law with a
handful of

37:29.280 --> 37:34.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smaller measures, like allowing
insurance
to be sold across state lines
and tax deductions

37:34.285 --> 37:36.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for premiums.

37:36.154 --> 37:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Health policy experts say these
approaches
would cover far fewer people
than the Affordable

37:39.657 --> 37:41.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act.

37:41.059 --> 37:43.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I hope you will consider
voting Donald
Trump for president.

37:43.228 --> 37:45.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a businessman who will
really shake things
up in Washington.

37:45.730 --> 37:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm just calling Democrats
like you to
ask if you're going to join me
in supporting

37:50.768 --> 37:52.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton this year in
Arizona.

37:52.570 --> 37:56.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: As both campaigns
ramp up their
ground game here, this longtime
red state

37:56.541 --> 37:58.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is in play.

37:58.409 --> 38:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Six years after the health law
was signed,
Arizona stands out as a good
example of what's

38:02.614 --> 38:04.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at stake this election.

38:04.149 --> 38:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This staunchly conservative
state expanded
Medicaid to low-income adults.

38:08.486 --> 38:13.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in the health insurance
marketplace, private
insurance companies are pulling
out, and Arizonans

38:13.358 --> 38:18.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are facing steep premium
increases, leaving
many to wonder, what's next for
the Affordable

38:18.196 --> 38:25.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Care Act?

38:25.136 --> 38:30.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At trivia night at Carly's
Bistro in downtown
Phoenix, which draws a younger
crowd, many

38:30.475 --> 38:34.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here have been able to get
health coverage
because of the law, and they say
they will

38:34.612 --> 38:36.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vote to protect it.

38:36.381 --> 38:41.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VANESSA CASTILLO, Arizona: Trump
would so
severely limit the care that
many people could

38:41.052 --> 38:46.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get that are in positions like
me that have
severe illnesses that would --
that affect

38:46.324 --> 38:47.392 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their lives.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But there's plenty
of criticism
too.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM BLANKENSHIP, Arizona: I
think there's
a lot of work that could be
done, but it's

38:51.930 --> 38:53.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still definitely better than how
it used to
be.

38:53.798 --> 38:57.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT ENGLISH, Arizona: My take
is really
less government is better.

38:57.402 --> 39:02.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems like everything that
the government
decides to manage, they don't
manage effectively

39:03.007 --> 39:04.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or efficiently.

39:05.009 --> 39:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: In Phoenix's
sprawling subdivisions,
some of that frustration arises
from the turbulent

39:09.981 --> 39:15.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individual insurance market in
Arizona, which
has caused headaches for Joanne
Ouellette

39:15.119 --> 39:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(ph) and her insurance broker,
Michael Malasnik.

39:16.921 --> 39:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL MALASNIK, Insurance
Broker: Joanne!

39:18.089 --> 39:19.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOANNE OUELLETTE:, Arizona.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hey, Mike.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How are you?

39:21.459 --> 39:23.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I wanted to know some
information about, what
am is going to do?

39:23.261 --> 39:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My insurance company with the
Affordable Care
Act, Aetna, I hear they're
pulling out of

39:29.667 --> 39:31.569 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Arizona.

39:31.603 --> 39:34.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: When the
marketplace for individual
insurance coverage in Arizona
first opened,

39:34.038 --> 39:36.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
eight companies vied for
consumers.

39:36.941 --> 39:42.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
After three years of low
enrollment and
higher-than-expected
medical claims, only one insurer
remains in

39:42.447 --> 39:44.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about half the counties.

39:44.215 --> 39:48.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Malasnik says he's already
getting calls for
the upcoming enrollment period.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MALASNIK: Frustration
and anger at
this point.

39:50.755 --> 39:54.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you also have a lot of
people that
are just getting worn down.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like, it's more of the same
to them.

39:56.761 --> 40:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: In her wood shop
in Mesa, the
exodus has raised questions for
Leah Sondergeld

40:01.766 --> 40:06.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
(ph) about adequate access to
medical care,
the potential for price-gouging,
and the durability

40:07.005 --> 40:08.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the marketplace.

40:08.806 --> 40:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEAH SONDERGELD, Arizona: This
is an example
of one of the forms to fill out
for Kate's

40:12.477 --> 40:14.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(ph) medication.

40:14.279 --> 40:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Sondergeld, who is
self-employed,
has been forced to switch plans
each year

40:17.115 --> 40:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as insurers have come and gone.

40:19.050 --> 40:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her eldest daughter, Kate, was
diagnosed with
epilepsy last year, and with
each switch comes

40:23.988 --> 40:25.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
frantic questions.

40:25.390 --> 40:28.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEAH SONDERGELD: What if they
won't cover
her current medication?

40:28.259 --> 40:31.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What if they won't keep her
neurologist?

40:31.863 --> 40:33.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are we going to do?

40:33.598 --> 40:37.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With one of the doctors, during
that first
transition with
UnitedHealthcare, she was

40:37.669 --> 40:39.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
four days without medications.

40:39.037 --> 40:41.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was four days -- I had to
watch her have
seizures.

40:41.105 --> 40:45.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: After a medical
leave, Kate
Sondergeld, age 25, is back to
her astronomy

40:45.677 --> 40:48.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
classes at the University of
Arizona in Tucson.

40:48.413 --> 40:51.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finding a medication that worked
was no small
matter.

40:51.382 --> 40:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATE SONDERGELD, Epileptic: My
first one,
I was severely allergic to.

40:54.752 --> 41:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had a bad reaction to it, and
then the second
one was kind of when things
started going

41:00.124 --> 41:01.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
downhill even more.

41:01.526 --> 41:03.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was blanking out.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have absent seizures.

41:05.229 --> 41:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Kate doesn't want
the health
law repealed.

41:09.734 --> 41:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She remembers when she was a
child and was
denied coverage because of a
preexisting condition.

41:15.707 --> 41:19.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her mother, Leah, says Congress
should prevent
insurers from quitting the
marketplace.

41:19.377 --> 41:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEAH SONDERGELD: I don't care
about what the
Republicans think.

41:23.281 --> 41:26.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't care what the Democrats
want to do
to change.

41:26.150 --> 41:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just tell Blue Cross/Blue
Shield, hey, guess
what?

41:29.187 --> 41:30.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to keep this
person.

41:31.022 --> 41:36.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The drop in
competition isn't
just in Arizona, says Caroline
Pearson from

41:36.961 --> 41:40.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Washington-based consulting
firm Avalere
Health.

41:40.198 --> 41:44.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pearson says more than a third
of regions
across the country may end up
with only one

41:44.469 --> 41:47.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insurer available, especially in
rural areas.

41:47.872 --> 41:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says Congress will need to
pass some fixes
to the law in 2017.

41:51.809 --> 41:55.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROLINE PEARSON, Avalere
Health: Improvements
to risk adjustment and
potentially other programs

41:55.813 --> 42:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to help stabilize the market,
and then some
very creative solutions to
figure out, how

42:01.085 --> 42:06.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do we actually get younger,
healthier people,
middle-income people into the
exchanges?

42:06.257 --> 42:09.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do we make these plans that
they want
to buy, that they think are
valuable?

42:09.494 --> 42:13.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Despite the
problems with the
law, those who need insurance
coverage like

42:13.765 --> 42:17.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jo are doing better because of
it.

42:17.335 --> 42:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After years without seeing a
doctor, Jo was
able to get a checkup, which led
to her cancer

42:22.306 --> 42:24.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
diagnosis and treatment.

42:24.242 --> 42:28.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Studies suggest that because of
the law, patients
are more likely to have a
regular doctor and

42:28.613 --> 42:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get preventive health care,
including vaccines
and cancer screenings.

42:32.817 --> 42:36.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're less likely to
postpone treatment
because they can't afford it.

42:36.053 --> 42:41.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I got a primary care
doctor, which
I hadn't had a primary care
doctor for a decade.

42:41.659 --> 42:47.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from the primary care, it
just went from
there, the tests and the
mammograms and the

42:47.098 --> 42:50.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ultrasounds and the MRIs and all
that stuff.

42:50.935 --> 42:55.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: Jo felt so
strongly about being
one of the 20 million people
who've gained

42:55.039 --> 42:58.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coverage since President Obama
signed the
health law, she wrote a letter
to the White

42:58.876 --> 42:59.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

42:59.877 --> 43:01.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: But then I got this in
the mail.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"Thank you for writing."

43:03.014 --> 43:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was encouraged to hear about
people who
had benefited from the
Affordable Care Act,

43:08.219 --> 43:09.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
signed Barack Obama.

43:09.954 --> 43:12.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: She said, without
the law's
consumer protections that
require insurers

43:12.990 --> 43:17.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cover people with preexisting
conditions,
she would be bankrupt or dead.

43:17.995 --> 43:24.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Trump volunteer Diana Brest
thinks the
law has caused more harm than
good and supports

43:24.168 --> 43:26.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump's vow to repeal it.

43:26.070 --> 43:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At 66 and on Medicare, she
blames the law
for driving up premiums for
others.

43:30.875 --> 43:33.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANA BREST, Arizona: Some
people said it
was going to help, but I knew
right away it

43:34.011 --> 43:35.112 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wasn't.

43:35.146 --> 43:38.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke to Donald Trump about
that two rallies
ago.

43:38.349 --> 43:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he indicated that he was
going to address
those that are having problems
with insurance.

43:44.555 --> 43:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know, knowing Donald
Trump, that he
will address it.

43:47.191 --> 43:50.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But the debate
over the health
law has often ignored a group
that has seen

43:50.561 --> 43:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widespread improvements from
Obamacare, low-income
adults, like 45-year-old Alfred
Mendoza of

43:56.934 --> 43:59.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Phoenix, who are now eligible
for Medicaid.

43:59.704 --> 44:03.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More people have gained coverage
in this way
than in all of the exchanges
combined.

44:03.674 --> 44:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new study suggests that people
living in
the 31 states that expanded
Medicaid, like

44:09.213 --> 44:11.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arizona, were more likely to
report being
in better health.

44:12.016 --> 44:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFRED MENDOZA, Arizona: My
gastroenterologist,
Dr. Shea (ph), she advised me to
go ahead

44:15.553 --> 44:16.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and get the C.T. scan.

44:16.554 --> 44:18.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we got the C.T. scan.

44:18.322 --> 44:22.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Mendoza, a truck
driver who
suffered a head injury from a
crash, went

44:22.193 --> 44:23.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
years without health insurance.

44:23.761 --> 44:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, with Medicaid, he's finally
getting treated.

44:26.430 --> 44:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFRED MENDOZA: I don't have the
funds, the
means to pay for a C.T. scan, to
an MRI.

44:31.602 --> 44:33.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a lot of money.

44:33.471 --> 44:37.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to go see a specialist, you
know, that's
a lot of money.

44:37.208 --> 44:40.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, for me, it's a 10.

44:40.278 --> 44:45.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: A flood of new
Medicaid patients
have been arriving at community
clinics around

44:45.750 --> 44:50.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arizona with a backlog of
untreated conditions,
like high blood pressure and
uncontrolled

44:50.721 --> 44:52.557 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
diabetes.

44:52.590 --> 44:56.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medical providers say getting
this population
healthier will take time, but
they're making

44:56.427 --> 44:58.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
progress.

44:58.262 --> 45:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in Phoenix, at Carly's
Bistro, the next
question will be how much any of
this will

45:04.168 --> 45:08.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weigh on a divided electorate as
voters head
to the polls.

45:08.172 --> 45:10.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Early voting in Arizona begins
October 12.

45:10.775 --> 45:19.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Kaiser Health News,
I'm Sarah Varney.

45:19.050 --> 45:27.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: the power of
persuasion
and how there are ways to
influence the thinking

45:27.325 --> 45:29.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of potential consumers.

45:29.193 --> 45:33.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Solman bring us his latest
Making Sense,
which airs Thursdays.

45:33.598 --> 45:40.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: I have heard it
said that the
most valuable thing in today's
world, postindustrial

45:40.438 --> 45:45.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world, is the human being's
attention and
how to get it.

45:45.276 --> 45:47.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that true?

45:47.211 --> 45:47.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT CIALDINI, Author,
"Pre-Suasion: A Revolutionary
Way to Influence and Persuade":
I believe

45:47.511 --> 45:49.380 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

45:49.413 --> 45:52.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Psychology
professor Robert Cialdini,
marketing maven, art enthusiast,
palm reader.

45:52.750 --> 45:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI, I used to be a
palm reader,
and I learned the trick that
they use to make

45:58.322 --> 46:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people say they're right almost
always.

46:01.525 --> 46:05.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, what was the
trick?

46:05.329 --> 46:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the '80s, Cialdini wrote an
attention-getting
classic, "Influence: The
Psychology of Persuasion,"

46:12.703 --> 46:17.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intended to arm consumers
against manipulative
marketers.

46:17.041 --> 46:22.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those who made the book
famous were the
persuaders themselves, who make
a living beckoning

46:22.513 --> 46:24.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
us every step we take.

46:24.382 --> 46:29.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: Those ads,
those signs, that's
old-school persuasion, directing
people's

46:29.320 --> 46:31.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
minds to the content.

46:31.222 --> 46:34.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In recent years,
however, Cialdini
has made a new discovery about
how to spin

46:35.026 --> 46:36.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
friends and influence people.

46:36.961 --> 46:41.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: What I'm
talking about is
pre-suasion, directing their
minds to the

46:41.832 --> 46:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moment before they experience
the content.

46:45.002 --> 46:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes, pre-suasion,
the title of
his new book.

46:48.572 --> 46:53.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: Pre-suasion is
the practice
of getting people sympathetic to
your message

46:53.611 --> 46:55.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before they experience it.

46:55.613 --> 46:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Before they even
hear it even.

46:57.481 --> 47:03.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: It is what you
say immediately
before you deliver your message
that leverages

47:03.287 --> 47:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your success tremendously.

47:04.722 --> 47:09.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or, if you are the
message, that
plays you like a puppet.

47:09.427 --> 47:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: The best
salesman I ever
saw told people, I left
something in the car.

47:14.565 --> 47:17.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can I get your key to let myself
back in?

47:17.768 --> 47:25.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have an acquaintance who
claims he got three
great jobs by saying something
before he began

47:25.810 --> 47:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the job interview in each
instance.

47:28.479 --> 47:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have a friend who's a
consultant who
says, he never gets pushback on
the price

47:34.151 --> 47:39.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he offers for his services if he
says one
thing first.

47:39.156 --> 47:44.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And pre-suasion
demonstrably
works, as we will try to
demonstrate throughout

47:44.295 --> 47:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this story, by prepping the mind
for the message
subliminally.

47:47.965 --> 47:50.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: There's this
interesting
study.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A guy goes to a shopping mall in
France.

47:52.970 --> 47:58.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he tries to get women's
phone numbers
as they pass various shops, so
he could call

47:58.209 --> 47:59.376 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a date.

47:59.410 --> 48:01.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
One of them is at a shoe store.

48:01.679 --> 48:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And another was a bakery.

48:03.781 --> 48:06.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in neither of those cases
was he very
successful.

48:06.550 --> 48:09.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He only got a number 13 percent
of the time.

48:09.754 --> 48:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there was one kind of shop
that doubled
his success rate when women were
passing it,

48:15.092 --> 48:16.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a flower shop.

48:16.794 --> 48:17.895 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

48:17.928 --> 48:20.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because flowers put women in the
mind-set
of romance.

48:20.865 --> 48:27.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not consciously,
pre-suasively
by exploiting a rule of thumb
passed down

48:27.471 --> 48:28.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to us by evolution.

48:28.973 --> 48:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: If we are
paying attention
to something, it's important.

48:32.943 --> 48:35.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's how we decide to pay
attention.

48:35.312 --> 48:40.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a communicator can reroute
our attention
to something that isn't
important, but make

48:40.951 --> 48:43.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it seem important as a
consequence.

48:43.354 --> 48:47.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As a consequence of
the very
fact that we're subconsciously
paying attention

48:47.725 --> 48:49.460 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to it.

48:49.493 --> 48:52.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: There is a
study that shows
that people who were asked their
political

48:52.930 --> 49:03.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opinions, when there was a
picture of the
American flag in the corner of
the questionnaire,

49:03.274 --> 49:10.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
reported more favorable
attitudes toward Republican
Party positions, because the
flag is typically

49:10.681 --> 49:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
associated in people's minds
with a Republican
belief set.

49:14.952 --> 49:17.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As are churches.

49:17.454 --> 49:22.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And studies show that
pre-suasive cues can
subconsciously affect actual
voting.

49:22.326 --> 49:26.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: If people vote
at a polling
place inside a church, they vote
more Republican.

49:26.897 --> 49:31.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they vote at a polling place
inside a school,
they vote more Democrat.

49:31.235 --> 49:36.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now, marketers, or
at least some
of them, have studied
pre-suasion's potency.

49:36.807 --> 49:43.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One online furniture store
tested images of
fluffy clouds vs. cold hard cash
on its home

49:43.147 --> 49:44.849 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
page.

49:44.882 --> 49:49.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: Those who saw
the background
depiction of clouds searched the
site for

49:49.720 --> 49:52.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more comfortable furniture.

49:52.590 --> 49:58.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those who went to the site that
had money
in the background became
cost-conscious and

49:58.329 --> 50:01.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
preferred to purchase less
expensive furniture.

50:01.298 --> 50:07.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Isn't it obvious
that our consciousness
is being affected by, what, our
perceptive

50:07.872 --> 50:09.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
apparatus?

50:09.607 --> 50:13.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: Almost no one
recognizes
that the clouds or the coins had
any impact

50:14.011 --> 50:19.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on their behavior, and yet it
did at significant
levels.

50:19.049 --> 50:24.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the cue that drives you in
the direction
of what seems more important now
because you're

50:24.488 --> 50:26.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
focused on it.

50:26.390 --> 50:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Which is why we
flashed the thinker
at the top of this story, to
pre-suade you

50:31.228 --> 50:35.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to ponder the puzzles we posed
at the outset,
but never answered.

50:35.833 --> 50:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was the trick of salesman,
the job seeker,
the pricey consultant?

50:39.403 --> 50:42.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ROBERT CIALDINI: In each
instance, they did
something first.

50:42.806 --> 50:46.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Starting with the
salesman who
claimed he'd forgotten something
in his car.

50:46.277 --> 50:50.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: He created a
sense of trust,
because who do you let back into
your house

50:50.881 --> 50:53.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by giving them your key, except
someone you
trust?

50:54.018 --> 50:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that made
people more likely
to buy what he was selling?

50:57.154 --> 51:02.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: Yes, because he
had created
a mind-set in them that they
were dealing

51:02.126 --> 51:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a trustworthy character.

51:03.961 --> 51:05.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the guy who got
the jobs?

51:05.930 --> 51:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: Before every
interview, he
asked the interviewers, why did
you bring

51:10.234 --> 51:11.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
me in today?

51:11.769 --> 51:16.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What was it about my
qualifications that made
you attracted to my candidacy?

51:16.540 --> 51:18.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what does that
do?

51:18.309 --> 51:22.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: It caused
people to start
focusing on the positive aspects
of his case

51:22.513 --> 51:24.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before they even began
discussing it.

51:24.782 --> 51:27.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the consultant
who never
got pushback on his fees?

51:27.351 --> 51:32.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: He would show
prospects his
proposal and his $75,000 fee.

51:32.890 --> 51:37.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he would say, as you can
tell, I won't
be able to charge you $1 million
for this.

51:37.328 --> 51:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And what does that
do?

51:38.996 --> 51:44.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: Compared to $1
million, $75,000
now seems trivial.

51:44.034 --> 51:48.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And why did
Cialdini urge us
to lead this story with puzzles?

51:48.138 --> 51:55.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: One way to get
pre-suasive
attention to your case is to
begin with a

51:55.446 --> 51:57.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mystery story.

51:57.348 --> 52:04.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mysteries cause people to want
to understand,
to get closure, which caused
them, I hope,

52:04.855 --> 52:08.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to want to stay with the
programming and listen
until the end.

52:08.359 --> 52:09.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, read my palm.

52:09.927 --> 52:12.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: Paul, I can see
that you
are a stubborn man.

52:12.663 --> 52:14.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: I'm somewhat
stubborn.

52:14.598 --> 52:17.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: What I have
done is to send
you down a memory track where
you would encounter

52:17.801 --> 52:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
times where you were stubborn.

52:19.236 --> 52:21.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you would look at me and
say, that's right.

52:21.405 --> 52:22.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's the
whole deal?

52:22.906 --> 52:24.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT CIALDINI: No.

52:24.742 --> 52:27.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suppose I looked at your palm
and saw the
same thing, but said, you're a
very flexible

52:27.244 --> 52:29.146 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man.

52:29.179 --> 52:32.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now I have sent you down a
memory track where
you would encounter times where
you were flexible,

52:32.149 --> 52:33.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you would say to me, that's
right.

52:34.018 --> 52:35.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's who I am.

52:35.819 --> 52:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, I might not
be quite that
histrionic, but I think I would
say, yes,

52:38.422 --> 52:40.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm flexible.

52:40.224 --> 52:43.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: And I have even
done that
with a person at a party, read
his palm, told

52:43.961 --> 52:48.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him he was stubborn at the
beginning, told
him that he was a flexible guy
at the end,

52:48.432 --> 52:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and he said "You're right" both
times.

52:50.534 --> 52:55.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, hey, Making
Sense is supposed
to be the "NewsHour"'s weekly
economics segment.

52:55.906 --> 53:02.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, economics, as it's taught
and practiced,
is based on the notion of
rational maximization.

53:02.279 --> 53:03.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT CIALDINI: Correct.

53:04.014 --> 53:06.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is not
rational maximization.

53:06.984 --> 53:08.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT CIALDINI: No.

53:08.786 --> 53:14.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What new psychology suggests,
it's the factor
that is top of consciousness at
the moment

53:14.758 --> 53:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before you make that economic
decision that
will win the day.

53:18.829 --> 53:24.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And so, from
Midtown Manhattan,
reporting stubbornly, yet
flexibly, this is

53:24.935 --> 53:26.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economics correspondent Paul
Solman.

53:27.004 --> 53:30.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now we know.

53:30.074 --> 53:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now, meet the
newest MacArthur genius grant
winners.

53:35.479 --> 53:38.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And how worried should we be
about terrorism?

53:38.282 --> 53:41.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:41.518 --> 53:44.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:44.455 --> 53:45.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:45.456 --> 53:47.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:47.324 --> 53:50.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening with Mark Shields and
David Brooks.

53:50.327 --> 54:01.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
