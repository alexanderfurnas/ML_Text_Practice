JOHN YANG: Good evening.

00:05.706 --> 00:06.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm John Yang.

00:06.707 --> 00:07.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.509 --> 00:12.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: This
executive order, just as the
first executive

00:12.913 --> 00:17.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order, is a lawful and proper
exercise of
presidential authority.

00:17.217 --> 00:22.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The Trump
administration unveils
a revised travel ban after the
first was blocked

00:22.556 --> 00:23.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the courts.

00:23.824 --> 00:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: Making Sense of President
Trump's wiretapping
claim.

00:27.828 --> 00:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's behind the charge that
President Obama
was listening in on Trump Tower?

00:33.200 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Jeffrey Brown sits down with
"Get Out"
director Jordan Peele to talk
why the hit

00:38.538 --> 00:42.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
horror film about race that is
striking a
chord with audiences.

00:42.276 --> 00:48.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE, Director, "Get
Out": For me
the social thriller is the
thriller in which

00:48.782 --> 00:53.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fears, the horrors, and the
thrills are
coming from society.

00:53.620 --> 00:57.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're coming from the way
humans interact.

00:57.724 --> 01:00.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:00.894 --> 01:05.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.365 --> 01:18.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Moments ago, House
Republicans
released their bill to meet a
key Trump campaign

01:18.578 --> 01:23.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
promise, to repeal and replace
the Affordable
Care Act, often called
Obamacare.

01:24.017 --> 01:28.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the key changes include
ending direct
government subsidies for low-
and middle-income

01:28.655 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans to buy coverage.

01:30.424 --> 01:34.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Instead, there will be
refundable tax credits
to do that.

01:34.695 --> 01:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ending penalties of the
individual mandate,
and a phase-out of the expansion
of Medicaid

01:39.399 --> 01:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 2020, but coverage would
continue for a
while for those already covered.

01:44.905 --> 01:48.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins just attended a
briefing in
the House Ways and Means
Committee.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She joins me now from Capitol
Hill.

01:51.144 --> 01:56.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, some of these proposals
are not popular
among conservative Republicans,
are they?

01:56.483 --> 01:59.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right,
in particular
the tax credits.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some Republicans say that's just
another way
to giving subsidies to Americans
for their

02:03.323 --> 02:04.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
health care.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the tax credits are a very
key component
here.

02:07.260 --> 02:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The way they would work, John,
is any individual
who makes $75,000 or less would
get some amount

02:13.667 --> 02:16.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of money to help them buy health
care, but
as a tax credit.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It would depend on how old you.

02:18.672 --> 02:22.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The largest tax credit would go
to those Americans
over 60.

02:22.175 --> 02:25.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would get $4,000 to help to
go to the
health care.

02:25.746 --> 02:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, on the other side,
Democrats say
this doesn't do enough to help
those populations

02:30.584 --> 02:33.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that can't afford health care
get where they
need to be.

02:33.387 --> 02:38.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And the governors,
even some Republican
governors, who have used the
Obamacare to

02:38.191 --> 02:41.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expand Medicaid, are they going
to be happy
with the phase-out of that
money?

02:41.862 --> 02:43.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For a couple of
years, they
will be happy.

02:43.897 --> 02:48.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then they will have some
problems in their
states potentially, depending on
how this

02:48.168 --> 02:50.037 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
works.

02:50.070 --> 02:54.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you were on the Medicaid
expansion, those
are basically what they call
able-bodied workers,

02:54.908 --> 03:00.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who are under the poverty
threshold,
about 138 percent of poverty,
people who really

03:00.147 --> 03:04.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
can't afford health care
essentially, but
don't fall into other categories
of Medicaid.

03:04.885 --> 03:08.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, you are able to
receive health
care through the Affordable Care
Act.

03:08.755 --> 03:13.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you will be able to receive
that for the
rest of your life if you are
enrolled now.

03:13.193 --> 03:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You will be grandfathered into
this system.

03:16.430 --> 03:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, after 2020, there will
be no people
in that category allowed to
join.

03:21.635 --> 03:26.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're talking basically
working-age adults
who do not earn much money.

03:26.339 --> 03:28.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can enroll now up until
2020.

03:28.075 --> 03:30.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will not be able to enroll
in Medicaid
after that.

03:30.343 --> 03:35.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All this, of course,
is if it passes
and if it passes in the current
form.

03:35.315 --> 03:40.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer at the White House
said the target
date for signing this bill would
be the Easter

03:40.687 --> 03:41.922 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
recess.

03:41.955 --> 03:42.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How likely is that?

03:42.956 --> 03:44.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How realistic is that, Lisa?

03:44.624 --> 03:47.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, we can
just look back
at the Affordable Care Act
itself.

03:47.861 --> 03:52.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It similarly had an early
summer, I believe,
goal date of being passed.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When was it actually signed into
law?

03:54.234 --> 03:55.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The next year, 2020 (sic).

03:55.869 --> 03:58.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that's an incredibly
ambitious goal, John.

03:58.505 --> 04:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next couple of days will
tell us a lot
about whether that is even
doable.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We expect committees to start
poring over
the details.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you said, John, there
are disagreements
not just from Democrats, but
from Republicans

04:08.648 --> 04:10.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about the details of this plan.

04:10.450 --> 04:14.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lisa Desjardins, who
is going to
be busy following all those
details as they

04:14.621 --> 04:19.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make their way through Capitol
Hill, Lisa,
thanks a lot.

04:19.159 --> 04:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other lead story:
The government
is girding tonight for a new
legal battle

04:23.130 --> 04:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on its second try at a travel
ban.

04:26.099 --> 04:30.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new order, issued today,
again targets
a group of mostly Muslim
nations.

04:30.437 --> 04:34.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it makes critical changes in
a bid to
try to avoid the issues that led
courts to

04:34.941 --> 04:36.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
block it.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown begins our
coverage.

04:38.378 --> 04:43.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: President Trump
signed the
original ban at the Pentagon
after just a

04:43.617 --> 04:45.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
week in office.

04:45.552 --> 04:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's signing was done in
private, with
only a single still photo
released.

04:49.789 --> 04:56.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It fell to Cabinet members to
make the announcement,
starting with Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson.

04:56.229 --> 04:60.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: President
Trump is exercising his rightful
authority

05:00.033 --> 05:02.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to keep our people safe.

05:02.135 --> 05:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As threats to our security
continue to evolve
and change, common sense
dictates that we

05:08.175 --> 05:14.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continually reevaluate and
reassess the systems
we rely upon to protect our
country.

05:14.314 --> 05:18.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Unlike the
original order,
this new one removes Iraq from
the original

05:18.985 --> 05:25.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
list of seven nations whose
citizens are barred
from entering the U.S., keeps
out Syrian refugees

05:25.725 --> 05:32.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for 120 days, instead of
indefinitely, and
drops any explicit exception for
Christian

05:32.332 --> 05:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and other religious minorities
in Muslim nations.

05:36.870 --> 05:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, it's made explicit
this time
that valid visa holders and
foreign nationals

05:41.775 --> 05:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with green cards securing their
residence
in the U.S. are not included in
the ban.

05:47.681 --> 05:52.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first order was effectively
halted by
federal courts within days of
being issued.

05:52.652 --> 05:58.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer said
today in an audio-only session
that it's now

05:58.091 --> 05:59.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being revoked.

05:59.826 --> 06:02.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
We continue to maintain that the
order was

06:02.729 --> 06:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fully lawful, but there were
some legal hurdles
that we'd have to potentially
cross in terms

06:06.566 --> 06:08.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of enjoinment and things like
that.

06:08.635 --> 06:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it was discussed with the
president Saturday,
and he made a decision that this
is how he

06:13.240 --> 06:15.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wanted to proceed.

06:15.108 --> 06:18.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Among other
things, federal
judges said the original order
cited no evidence

06:18.678 --> 06:20.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of an actual threat.

06:20.647 --> 06:27.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new directive says the FBI
is pursuing
300 terrorism-related
investigations of individuals

06:27.287 --> 06:32.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
admitted as refugees.

06:32.459 --> 06:37.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials also hope to avoid the
chaos at
airports when the original order
took effect,

06:37.197 --> 06:42.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as people in transit were
detained, delayed
and expelled without notice.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Homeland Security Secretary John
Kelly:

06:44.371 --> 06:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary:
We are going to work closely to
implement

06:46.706 --> 06:52.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and enforce it humanely,
respectfully, and
with professionalism, but we
will enforce

06:52.545 --> 06:54.180 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the law.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, there should be no
surprises, whether
it's in the media or on Capitol
Hill.

06:57.817 --> 07:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But opponents
showed no sign
of backing down.

07:01.655 --> 07:07.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington State Attorney
General Bob Ferguson,
who successfully challenged the
first order,

07:07.127 --> 07:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spoke this afternoon in Seattle.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB FERGUSON, Washington State
Attorney General:
The chaos it inflicted around
our country,

07:11.197 --> 07:12.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you all saw it.

07:12.198 --> 07:14.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It wasn't right.

07:14.034 --> 07:17.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I certainly hope they take way
numerous lessons
from this experience, but, if
they don't,

07:17.504 --> 07:21.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they can expect us to see us
challenging future
executive orders as well.

07:21.074 --> 07:25.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For now, pending
court action,
the new order is set to take
effect March

07:25.478 --> 07:26.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
16.

07:26.479 --> 07:29.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

07:29.282 --> 07:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In the day's other
news: The U.S.
Supreme Court said it won't hear
a case on

07:34.254 --> 07:37.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transgender bathroom use in
public schools
after all.

07:37.557 --> 07:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lower court had ruled in favor
of a Virginia
teenager who wanted access to
the boys' bathroom.

07:43.096 --> 07:48.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Since then, the Trump
administration rolled
back federal guidelines
supporting that stance.

07:48.702 --> 07:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today's action sends the case
back to the
lower court for further review.

07:53.006 --> 07:57.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a separate case, the high
court ruled that
ferreting out racial bias can
override the

07:57.844 --> 08:00.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sanctity of jury deliberations.

08:00.513 --> 08:06.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The justices ruled 5-3 for a man
convicted
on sex charges in Colorado.

08:06.086 --> 08:10.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He argued that a juror's
anti-Mexican comments
tainted his trial.

08:10.390 --> 08:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He can now seek a new trial.

08:13.059 --> 08:17.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
North Korea successfully
test-launched four
more missiles this morning,
raising new alarm.

08:17.497 --> 08:23.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were fired from northwest
of Pyongyang
and flew an average of 620
miles.

08:23.570 --> 08:25.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three of them landed in Japanese
waters.

08:25.972 --> 08:29.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Japan condemned the launches, as
did the South
Korean Foreign Ministry.

08:29.209 --> 08:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHO JUNE-HYUCK, South Korean
Foreign Ministry
Spokesman (through translator):
This provocation

08:33.046 --> 08:36.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clearly reveals the North Korean
regime's
reckless willingness to continue
its nuclear

08:36.916 --> 08:41.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and missile developments,
despite unified
warnings from the international
community.

08:41.421 --> 08:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea should realize that
its frenzied
obsession with only result in
self-isolation

08:45.925 --> 08:47.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and self-destruction.

08:47.827 --> 08:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The North Korean
missile tests
coincided with a joint
U.S.-South Korean military

08:52.031 --> 08:53.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drill.

08:53.833 --> 08:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Yemen, the U.S. kept up a new
air campaign
against al-Qaida militants over
the weekend.

08:58.772 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Witnesses say suspected U.S.
drones attacked
in two provinces, going after a
training camp

09:03.810 --> 09:05.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other targets.

09:05.512 --> 09:09.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Separately, the Pentagon
confirmed that a
U.S. airstrike last week in
Yemen killed a

09:09.616 --> 09:12.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
former Guantanamo Bay detainee.

09:12.619 --> 09:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A retired policeman in the
Philippines testified
today that President Rodrigo
Duterte was linked

09:18.992 --> 09:22.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to nearly 200 killings when he
was a mayor.

09:22.662 --> 09:27.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The victims allegedly included
political opponents,
and were carried out by a death
squad.

09:27.834 --> 09:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The retired officer appeared as
part of a
Senate investigation into
extrajudicial killings

09:32.739 --> 09:36.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Davao City, where Duterte was
mayor for
22 years.

09:36.276 --> 09:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARTURO LASCANAS, Retired Police
Officer (through
translator): I can't make myself
take to my

09:40.447 --> 09:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grave these dark and evil
secrets from my
life born out of my obedience to
Mayor Rodrigo

09:45.652 --> 09:49.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Duterte's orders and to his
campaign against
criminality and illegal drugs.

09:49.923 --> 09:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had blind obedience and
loyalty to the point
that I was indirectly involved
in killing

09:54.160 --> 09:55.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my two brothers.

09:55.929 --> 10:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Duterte brought his
anti-drug campaign
to the presidency eight months
ago.

10:00.333 --> 10:04.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since then, more than 8,000
people have been
killed nationwide.

10:04.737 --> 10:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, two the
secretary of
homeland security, John Kelly,
told CNN he'd

10:09.275 --> 10:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consider separating women and
children who
cross the Mexican border
illegally in order

10:15.014 --> 10:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to deter those crossings.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And in a speech, Housing
Secretary Ben Carson
caused a stir.

10:20.887 --> 10:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He praised immigrants' work
ethic and said
there were other immigrants who
came here

10:25.859 --> 10:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the bottom of slave ships.

10:28.094 --> 10:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A spokesman said Carson didn't
mean to equate
immigration and slavery.

10:33.766 --> 10:38.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Pentagon says it's
investigating reports
of U.S. Marines sharing nude
photographs of

10:38.571 --> 10:41.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
female Marines, veterans and
others.

10:41.608 --> 10:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the images were taken
without the
women's knowledge.

10:44.410 --> 10:48.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They appeared on a private
Facebook page called
Marines United.

10:48.748 --> 10:52.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It had some 30,000 members.

10:52.552 --> 10:57.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks were
broadly lower,
due in part to China trimming
its economic

10:57.190 --> 10:58.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
growth outlook.

10:58.558 --> 11:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 51 points
to close at 20954.

11:04.497 --> 11:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 21 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped nearly eight.

11:10.136 --> 11:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
is the revised
travel ban constitutional?;
behind President

11:16.476 --> 11:26.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump's accusation that
President Obama wiretapped
Trump Tower; and much more.

11:26.519 --> 11:34.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump's accusation that
President Obama wiretapped
Trump Tower; and much more.

11:34.260 --> 11:38.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we heard, today's revised
travel ban was
drafted by the Trump
administration to stand

11:38.498 --> 11:42.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in court after the first one
was rejected
by federal courts.

11:42.468 --> 11:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But critics still question its
constitutional,
amid a broader debate over
whether it will

11:46.973 --> 11:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really make the country safer.

11:48.741 --> 11:50.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here again, Jeffrey Brown.

11:50.476 --> 11:54.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for that, we
are joined
by Neal Katyal, a former acting
solicitor

11:54.714 --> 11:57.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
general under President Obama.

11:57.283 --> 12:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also served as a national
security adviser
for the Justice Department in
the Clinton

12:01.387 --> 12:03.189 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

12:03.222 --> 12:07.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Kansas Secretary of State
Kris Kobach,
he was a top adviser to
President Trump during

12:07.760 --> 12:11.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his 2016 campaign and through
the transition.

12:11.097 --> 12:12.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

12:12.098 --> 12:13.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me start with you, Kris
Kobach.

12:13.166 --> 12:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The first attempt failed in the
courts.

12:15.935 --> 12:20.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you see as the key
change that might
allow this one to pass?

12:20.440 --> 12:25.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mr. Kobach, can you hear me?

12:25.912 --> 12:31.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH (R), Kansas
Secretary of State:
Now I can hear you, yes.

12:31.050 --> 12:32.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

12:33.052 --> 12:34.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right.

12:34.053 --> 12:35.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sorry about the technical
problem.

12:35.288 --> 12:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My question was that the first
order didn't
pass muster.

12:38.024 --> 12:41.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the key change here that
you think
allows this one?

12:41.794 --> 12:47.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: Well, if you look
at the two
of them side by side, this one
is very different

12:48.001 --> 12:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the way it's packaged and put
together.

12:50.737 --> 12:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It reads like a legal brief,
rather than like
a traditional executive order.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's filled with case -- with
citations to
statutes.

12:57.677 --> 13:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is filled with factual
assertions that
the Ninth Circuit said it was
lacking.

13:03.216 --> 13:08.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so it also goes very
specifically point
by point through the things that
the Ninth

13:08.254 --> 13:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Circuit hypothesized could cause
a due process
issue.

13:11.524 --> 13:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it really -- it's tailor-made
to the Ninth
Circuit's decision.

13:15.161 --> 13:19.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think this order, if it
were challenged
in the Ninth Circuit, it would
be the most

13:19.532 --> 13:23.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
activist judicial venue for it,
I think it
will survive.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, if it survives
the Ninth Circuit,
it will survive anywhere else
too.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Neal Katyal, will
it survive?

13:28.608 --> 13:30.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you see?

13:30.043 --> 13:31.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEAL KATYAL, Former Acting U.S.
Solicitor
General: It won't survive.

13:31.878 --> 13:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Kris is just about as
right this time
as he was last time, on January
30, when he

13:34.380 --> 13:37.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said -- quote -- "Trump has
rock-solid legal
authority.

13:37.283 --> 13:38.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These cases are losers."

13:38.618 --> 13:39.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was wrong then.

13:39.619 --> 13:41.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is wrong now.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is right that this reads like
a legal brief,
but it reads like a bad legal
brief.

13:44.090 --> 13:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It ignores what Congress has
said in 1965
in its landmark act, which is,
you can't discriminate

13:49.929 --> 13:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on the basis of nationality.

13:52.398 --> 13:57.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to attack the Ninth Circuit
as being activist,
as he said, is, I think, really
the wrong

13:57.837 --> 13:59.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
way to go.

13:59.305 --> 14:02.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It echoes what President Trump
said about
so-called judges and so on.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every time they lose a case,
they disagree.

14:04.777 --> 14:09.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But these are rock-solid
American values that
the challengers are standing up
for.

14:09.282 --> 14:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the
challenges had been
on constitutional grounds.

14:12.218 --> 14:17.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, is it still a
Muslim ban, the
way it was before, given the
change in language?

14:17.290 --> 14:18.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEAL KATYAL: It is.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There are some changes.

14:20.093 --> 14:23.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this new executive order, it
does say:
We don't intend to discriminate
against Muslim.

14:23.296 --> 14:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Supreme Court has been
very clear
that just because a government
says that -- they

14:27.066 --> 14:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can always say, we don't intend
to discriminate
on the basis of religion.

14:30.269 --> 14:32.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to go back to look at
the history
of this.

14:32.638 --> 14:36.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it's a pretext for
discrimination,
as this sure looks like, then it
is going

14:36.476 --> 14:38.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to fall in the courts for that
reason.

14:38.277 --> 14:42.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, what about
that, Mr.
Kobach, the Muslim issue
specifically, and

14:42.849 --> 14:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then also that this new law,
this new order
still distinguishes by
nationality?

14:48.888 --> 14:53.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: Well, if you look
at the text
of the order, it's quite clear
that it has

14:53.359 --> 14:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nothing to do with religion.

14:55.161 --> 15:00.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indeed, it says that special
protection in
our refugee program is afforded
to those who

15:00.133 --> 15:06.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are members of minority
religions, including
in cases where the minority
religion is the

15:06.038 --> 15:07.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Muslim religion.

15:07.940 --> 15:12.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the selection of
the six countries,
you have got dozens of other
countries around

15:12.345 --> 15:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world that are majority
Muslim countries
that are not selected for
special treatment.

15:17.817 --> 15:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, furthermore, this new order
calls for
a review of all of the countries
on the planet

15:23.055 --> 15:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to see if they too should be
added to the
special list.

15:25.725 --> 15:29.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to characterize this as a
Muslim ban is
just simply false.

15:29.595 --> 15:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is based on facts about these
six countries
that make them hotbeds of
terrorism.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those facts are listed in
the order.

15:37.303 --> 15:42.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for Neal's point about
somehow this being
against what Congress has said,
I would direct

15:42.275 --> 15:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him to the United States Code
Title 8, Section
1182-F, which says the president
may, if he

15:48.114 --> 15:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finds the entry of certain
aliens detrimental
to the interests of the United
States, he

15:52.952 --> 15:57.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
may suspend or bar the entry of
those aliens.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's exactly what the
president did.

15:59.091 --> 16:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The statutory grounds for this
are very strong.

16:01.761 --> 16:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why the challenge had to
be based on
a due process constitutional
ground.

16:05.464 --> 16:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that's what we really
should be debating.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can they make a constitutional
challenge on
this one?

16:09.268 --> 16:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you,
Neal Katyal.

16:11.204 --> 16:16.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That, in part, goes to this
attempt time around
to fill in the security
justifications, right?

16:16.676 --> 16:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEAL KATYAL: So, two things.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, Kris isn't reading
to the whole
statute.

16:20.813 --> 16:26.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, there's a later
statute passed
in 1965, 13 years after the one
he read, and

16:26.085 --> 16:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this says -- quote -- "No person
shall receive
any preference or priority or be
discriminated

16:30.523 --> 16:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against in the issuance of an
immigrant visa
because of that person's
nationality."

16:34.794 --> 16:36.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's later.

16:36.729 --> 16:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other part of that law
that he read,
Section 1182, Congress later
implemented -- later

16:40.867 --> 16:44.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that, in order to ban
someone on the
basis of terrorism, you have to
have reasonable

16:44.871 --> 16:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
grounds on an individualized
basis.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not what the president
did.

16:49.175 --> 16:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you
briefly, though,
how much -- doesn't it come down
to how much

16:52.111 --> 16:56.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deference the executive is
granted when it
comes to national security and
immigration?

16:56.716 --> 16:58.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEAL KATYAL: Sure.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I used to stand up and
defend the United
States on national security
grounds all the

17:00.953 --> 17:02.788 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

17:02.822 --> 17:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This one is a very hard one to
defend, because
there isn't the evidence that
you need this

17:06.792 --> 17:08.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

17:08.561 --> 17:12.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indeed, the evidence Kris is
referring to
that was in the executive order
is from 1979

17:12.131 --> 17:13.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and 1984.

17:13.866 --> 17:19.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the idea that you need this
magically
now is, I think, a very hard
argument for

17:19.605 --> 17:23.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
courts to accept, particularly
given the history
of this particular ban.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This has been a Muslim ban from
the start.

17:25.077 --> 17:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Kris Kobach,
what's your response?

17:27.246 --> 17:34.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH: Well, the
description in the
executive order is not from 1979
or 1983.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It talks about conditions on the
ground in
those six countries right now.

17:37.857 --> 17:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would also add that, since
9/11, we have
had 53 terrorist from those six
countries

17:43.195 --> 17:48.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either arrested or convicted of
terrorism-related
crimes who have entered using
those visas

17:48.334 --> 17:49.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from those countries since then.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is a very present
threat right now.

17:52.972 --> 17:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, again, the statutory
grounds are very
strong.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think Neal has to admit that.

17:57.610 --> 18:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the debate about is, is
there a due process
violation?

18:00.880 --> 18:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Ninth Circuit kind of
had to bend
over backwards and imagine
hypothetical cases

18:04.884 --> 18:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where somebody might be denied
their day in
court.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this order says, look, you
are going to
get your day.

18:10.156 --> 18:12.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're in the United States
illegally,
you are still going to be able
to make your

18:13.025 --> 18:14.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
claims in front an immigration
judge.

18:14.961 --> 18:19.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's just going
to be a much
harder lift for the attorneys
trying to challenge

18:19.732 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

18:20.733 --> 18:21.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Will they challenge it?

18:21.734 --> 18:22.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm sure they will.

18:22.735 --> 18:23.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're out of time.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Neal, harder to challenge,
but the challenges
will come, in a word, right?

18:26.172 --> 18:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEAL KATYAL: And they're not
hard.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As President Trump says, see you
in court.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

18:29.809 --> 18:33.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neal Katyal, Kris Kobach, thank
you both very
much.

18:33.279 --> 18:40.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEAL KATYAL: Thank you.

18:40.553 --> 18:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now to President
Trump's shocking
series of tweets on Saturday and
what's behind

18:48.361 --> 18:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the unsupported allegations.

18:52.398 --> 18:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On today's morning shows,
administration officials
Kellyanne Conway and Sarah
Huckabee Sanders

18:57.703 --> 18:59.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pressed President Trump's case.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Senior
Trump Adviser:
Look, the president firmly
believes that the

19:02.108 --> 19:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama administration may have
tapped into
the phones at Trump Tower.

19:06.779 --> 19:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY, Senior Trump
Adviser: Let's
get to the bottom of it.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is the president's entire
point.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Like the president,
they offered
no evidence, but Conway said Mr.
Trump may

19:13.986 --> 19:17.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have information and
intelligence the rest
of us do not.

19:17.990 --> 19:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Senate today, Democratic
Leader Chuck
Schumer said the claim added to
the need for

19:23.229 --> 19:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an independent probe of alleged
ties between
Russia and the Trump campaign.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: The
events of this weekend, which
included another

19:31.971 --> 19:38.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troubling, baseless tweet from
the president,
highlight and in fact strengthen
the argument

19:38.210 --> 19:41.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a special prosecutor to
conduct the investigation.

19:41.881 --> 19:46.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president sparked
the firestorm
with a weekend tweet: "Just
found out that

19:46.952 --> 19:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama had my wires tapped in
Trump Tower just
before the victory."

19:51.590 --> 19:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A spokesman for former President
Obama swiftly
denied it, as did his former
director of national

19:57.830 --> 19:59.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intelligence, James Clapper.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CLAPPER, Former National
Intelligence
Director: There was no such
wiretap activity

20:01.534 --> 20:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mounted against the president,
the president-elect
at the time or, as a candidate
or against

20:07.373 --> 20:09.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his campaign.

20:09.241 --> 20:13.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump asked
Congress to investigate,
and Press Secretary Sean Spicer
said there

20:13.379 --> 20:15.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would be no further comment.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Spicer briefed reporters
off-camera.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
There's no question that
something happened.

20:21.020 --> 20:24.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The question is, is it
surveillance, is it
a wiretap or whatever?

20:24.957 --> 20:29.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there's been enough
reporting that strongly
suggests that something
occurred.

20:29.662 --> 20:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It appears to trace
back to Thursday
evening and conservative radio
host Mark Levin.

20:35.134 --> 20:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK LEVIN, Conservative Radio
Host: Barack
Obama and his surrogates, who
were supporting

20:38.437 --> 20:43.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and their party,
the Democrat
Party, who were using the
instrumentalities

20:43.409 --> 20:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the federal government,
intelligence activities,
to surveil members of the Trump
campaign!

20:49.748 --> 20:55.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That was picked up
Friday morning
by Breitbart News, formerly run
by Trump adviser

20:55.421 --> 20:57.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Steve Bannon.

20:57.323 --> 21:00.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump's tweet came
about 24 hours
later.

21:00.993 --> 21:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FBI Director James Comey
reportedly asked
the Justice Department to refute
the claim.

21:07.366 --> 21:11.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We dig in to the president's
claims now with
Congressman Adam Schiff, the top
Democrat

21:12.004 --> 21:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the House Intelligence
Committee, and Stewart
Baker, who was assistant
homeland security

21:16.976 --> 21:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretary for policy under
President George
W. Bush.

21:20.779 --> 21:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also was general counsel at
the National
Security Agency from 1992 to
1994.

21:26.719 --> 21:28.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, thank you for being
with us.

21:28.888 --> 21:29.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Schiff, my first question is
for you.

21:32.291 --> 21:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's your response to the
president's request
that the Intelligence Committee
take this

21:37.730 --> 21:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question, whether or not there
was any potentially
politically motivated
investigation, investigative

21:44.570 --> 21:50.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
branch powers were abused,
whether that happened,
into your investigation of ties
between Russia

21:50.776 --> 21:52.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the Trump campaign?

21:52.144 --> 21:55.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And have you spoken to Chairman
Nunes about
this yet?

21:55.281 --> 21:57.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

21:57.049 --> 21:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California: I
have not had
a chance to discuss it with the
chairman.

21:58.851 --> 22:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, look, I think this whole
allegation the
president has made is reckless,
and, given

22:03.689 --> 22:10.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it comes without any
substantiation whatsoever,
breathtakingly reckless.

22:10.262 --> 22:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We already know from Director
Clapper that,
under the agencies that he was
overseeing

22:15.634 --> 22:20.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the intelligence community,
there was no
FISA warrant directed at Mr.
Trump or his

22:20.773 --> 22:22.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

22:22.708 --> 22:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, we can bring him in
before our committee
and have him repeat in closed
session the

22:26.712 --> 22:28.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
same thing he said privately.

22:28.581 --> 22:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if the reports are correct
that Director
Comey has said the same thing
and asked the

22:33.219 --> 22:38.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Department of Justice to push
back on this,
then it's clear there was no
criminal wiretap.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is a simple matter to
resolve as
well.

22:41.260 --> 22:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the call for this to
be investigated
is much like the president's
call to investigate

22:45.931 --> 22:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his claim that millions of
undocumented immigrants
voted.

22:51.003 --> 22:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's patently absurd and it's
designed, I
think, to give some patina of
respectability

22:55.708 --> 22:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a claim that really has none
at all.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Baker,
breathtakingly reckless,
patently absurd?

23:00.980 --> 23:02.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What do you say?

23:02.881 --> 23:04.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART BAKER, Former General
Counsel, National
Security Agency: No, I don't
understand that.

23:04.683 --> 23:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know from multiple reports,
including The
New York Times, that there were
intercepts

23:09.688 --> 23:16.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there were FISA orders in
connection with
Russian efforts to influence the
campaign.

23:16.395 --> 23:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know from Mike Flynn's
resignation
that those intercepts covered
conversations

23:24.003 --> 23:27.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that members of the campaign
had.

23:27.273 --> 23:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think it's perfectly
reasonable to say,
let's investigate that.

23:32.311 --> 23:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have heard from former
Obama administration
officials are very limited
non-denial denials.

23:39.852 --> 23:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is to say, the president
says, I didn't
order anything.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, of course, he doesn't.

23:44.189 --> 23:47.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Justice Department and
the FISA court
could have.

23:47.059 --> 23:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have Jim Clapper saying, we
didn't target
the campaign or Mr. Trump.

23:54.433 --> 24:00.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of other people
that could have
been targeted that would look
pretty political

24:00.205 --> 24:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if it was done in bad faith.

24:03.642 --> 24:06.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's fair to ask the
question, what
are the facts?

24:06.945 --> 24:08.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what your committee
is for.

24:08.681 --> 24:12.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Schiff, you say
that there
was no surveillance whatsoever
that might

24:12.885 --> 24:18.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have captured some
communications between
people close to Mr. Trump?

24:18.691 --> 24:19.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: No, that's not what
I have said.

24:21.527 --> 24:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what Mr. Baker has
addressed is
really not what the president
tweeted, which

24:24.430 --> 24:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was that the president had
wiretapped his
campaign.

24:28.167 --> 24:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's entirely possible -- and I
can't comment
on what we have been hearing in
the committee

24:33.405 --> 24:40.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that, as part of our foreign
intelligence
gathering directed at foreign
spies, that

24:40.179 --> 24:46.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we may have intercepted
communications between
Russian or between Russians and
Americans.

24:46.352 --> 24:53.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, frankly, if that's the
case, then the
president has a big problem,
because why would

24:53.492 --> 24:58.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump campaign people be talking
to the Russians,
if that was the context in which
communications

24:58.964 --> 25:00.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were gathered?

25:00.766 --> 25:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm not saying that's the
case, but if
what Mr. Baker is referring to
is our efforts

25:05.504 --> 25:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to target Russian targets,
that's something
very different than what the
president alleged.

25:11.677 --> 25:15.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think for a president of
the United
States to make this kind of an
allegation

25:15.748 --> 25:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about his predecessor, I think,
in the eyes
of the rest of the world and our
own citizens,

25:21.553 --> 25:25.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really brings discredit on
himself and on
our very democracy.

25:25.691 --> 25:29.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Baker, is there
anything nefarious
about that, if they were
targeting Russians

25:29.862 --> 25:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they captured communications
with people
close to Trump in that process?

25:34.967 --> 25:38.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEWART BAKER: In my view, we
had to do that.

25:38.837 --> 25:41.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the Russians are messing with
our elections,
we cannot tolerate that.

25:41.940 --> 25:45.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to know and we need to
take action
against it.

25:45.377 --> 25:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, opening this
investigation
of one campaign, and in the
middle of an election,

25:55.954 --> 25:58.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has enormous political
consequences.

25:58.857 --> 26:07.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's fair to ask the
question, were those
political consequences part of
the determination

26:07.332 --> 26:09.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pursue this?

26:09.201 --> 26:12.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is something that ought
to be looked
at, along with the Russian
attempt to influence

26:12.704 --> 26:14.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election.

26:14.506 --> 26:16.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Schiff, is that a
legitimate
question for the committee to be
looking into?

26:16.508 --> 26:18.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF: Well, I think, if
you look at
the facts here, actually, much
of the criticism,

26:20.712 --> 26:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frankly, that I have leveled and
others is
that the Obama administration
did too little

26:25.150 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the course of the Russian
interference
in our election, not too much,
that the Obama

26:30.656 --> 26:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration, in fact, was so
wary about
being perceived as trying to put
its hand

26:35.260 --> 26:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the scales or interfere in
the election,
that they were reluctant to even
call out

26:40.165 --> 26:43.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia on what was so plain to
the intelligence
agencies.

26:43.635 --> 26:48.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indeed, Senator Feinstein and I
had to take
the step of doing that ourselves
before the

26:48.674 --> 26:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intelligence community was ready
or willing
to do that.

26:51.477 --> 26:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, quite the contrary,
if the Obama
administration erred here -- and
I think they

26:56.081 --> 27:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did -- it was in not calling
this out earlier,
not seeking sanctions along with
our allies

27:02.921 --> 27:04.823 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
earlier.

27:04.857 --> 27:08.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEWART BAKER: I think you can
believe that
the president, President Obama,
wasn't sufficiently

27:08.794 --> 27:13.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tough with the Russians and
still believe
that he was determined to be
aggressive with

27:13.098 --> 27:15.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Trump campaign.

27:15.667 --> 27:18.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He does take domestic politics
very personally.

27:18.737 --> 27:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, the FISA system
is set up to
provide protection for our civil
liberties

27:26.178 --> 27:32.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by ensuring that the decision to
use FISA
is at the highest levels of
government, which

27:32.885 --> 27:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it turns out, of course, are all
political
appointees.

27:35.821 --> 27:41.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And in the context of an
election investigation,
that's just not comforting.

27:41.226 --> 27:45.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that the president
is going
to be satisfied to hear, oh, no,
President

27:45.898 --> 27:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama didn't wiretap you, Sally
Yates did.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I'm afraid we're
going to have
to leave it there.

27:50.736 --> 27:53.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stewart Baker, Representative
Adam Schiff,
thank you very much for joining
us.

27:53.739 --> 28:00.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm sure we will be returning to
this topic
again.

28:00.746 --> 28:09.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STEWART BAKER: It was a
pleasure.

28:09.087 --> 28:12.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Stay with us.

28:12.658 --> 28:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": we
talk to Jordan
Peele, the director of a horror
film about

28:17.129 --> 28:22.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race; and students compete to
have their science
experiments sent to space.

28:22.367 --> 28:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, let's unpack the
politics behind
President Trump's new travel
ban, the allegations

28:28.206 --> 28:31.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of wiretapping and the White
House's agenda
for the week.

28:31.376 --> 28:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's time for Politics Monday
with Amy Walter
of The Cook Political Report and
Tamara Keith

28:36.348 --> 28:37.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of NPR.

28:37.482 --> 28:40.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tam, you were one of the radio
poolers this
weekend.

28:40.819 --> 28:44.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You went with Trump down to
Mar-a-Lago in
Florida.

28:44.423 --> 28:45.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, nice quiet weekend?

28:45.724 --> 28:47.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:47.492 --> 28:48.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Yes,
I think we were expecting it to
be a quiet

28:48.994 --> 28:50.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weekend.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There weren't a lot of aides
that came down
with him on Air Force One.

28:53.131 --> 28:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But by the end of the weekend,
there were
a lot of people at Mar-a-Lago
meeting with

28:57.903 --> 29:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Trump all of a sudden.

29:01.773 --> 29:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those tweets came out of the
darkness of morning
and changed the weekend for
sure.

29:07.779 --> 29:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What do you make of
it?

29:09.281 --> 29:11.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where did it come from, do you
think?

29:11.717 --> 29:14.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, it is
unclear.

29:14.519 --> 29:17.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you ask the White House, they
won't say
where it came from.

29:17.889 --> 29:23.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you put some dots together,
it looks like
it came from a Breitbart story
that rounded

29:23.595 --> 29:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up that Mark Levin talk show and
various other
news reports that are out there.

29:28.066 --> 29:30.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the White House keeps
pointing to reports.

29:30.636 --> 29:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I started asking at 7:00 a.m.

29:33.038 --> 29:34.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Saturday.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the questions continue,
where exactly
is the president getting this
from?

29:37.442 --> 29:38.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's the president of the United
States.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's possible he could be
getting intelligence
from somewhere.

29:42.581 --> 29:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But instead we're hearing about
reports.

29:45.717 --> 29:50.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his spokespeople are saying,
well, if
it's true, it would be a huge
scandal.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's mighty conditional.

29:52.491 --> 29:56.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Amy, from the
outside, it
looked like another -- we're
seeing the reports

29:56.261 --> 29:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the president was angry
when he did this.

29:59.431 --> 30:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the outside, it seemed like
he had a
pretty good week.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had the speech on Tuesday
that got great
reviews.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Absolutely.

30:06.371 --> 30:09.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Friday, when Attorney
General Sessions
recused himself, it seems to me,
from the

30:09.941 --> 30:12.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside looking in, that that
put the issue
to rest.

30:12.944 --> 30:14.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was a good thing for them.

30:14.046 --> 30:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But he didn't see it
as a good
thing.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Exactly.

30:17.783 --> 30:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: This is a White
House and certainly
a president who believes that,
if you back

30:20.085 --> 30:22.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
down on anything, you have lost.

30:22.621 --> 30:28.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the decision by Sessions
to recuse
himself was seen not as a
victory, but as

30:28.326 --> 30:30.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- really as a big defeat.

30:30.195 --> 30:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, this is a funny
thing, too,
about this administration, and
really the

30:35.100 --> 30:36.068 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like we live in these
bifurcated worlds.

30:37.769 --> 30:38.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

30:38.770 --> 30:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He gets angry, and it goes into
a tweet.

30:40.472 --> 30:45.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He defended Sessions on Twitter,
but then
sort of accepts, though
grudgingly, what the

30:46.011 --> 30:47.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
effect is.

30:47.446 --> 30:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was upset that Michael Flynn
had to resign,
but he accepted that.

30:50.415 --> 30:52.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's upset about Sessions, but
he accepted
it.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But he takes it out on Twitter.

30:54.186 --> 30:58.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, it's the rest of the
world that's
trying to keep up with what this
all means.

30:58.924 --> 31:04.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as we have seen from the
panel that was
right in front of us, it's not
really changing

31:04.262 --> 31:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anything on Capitol Hill.

31:05.430 --> 31:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no special prosecutor.

31:07.499 --> 31:09.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is still all within
Congress.

31:09.267 --> 31:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're either going to find
something or
they're not.

31:10.869 --> 31:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nothing that happened this
weekend is going
to change that.

31:13.538 --> 31:18.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're still just really
wrapping around
the axle on an issue that we
don't have any

31:18.643 --> 31:20.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clarity.

31:20.545 --> 31:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Though it does
give Democrats
a little more ammunition to ask
for an independent

31:23.915 --> 31:27.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
investigator, a special
prosecutor or whatever
it ends up being that they would
want to ask

31:27.085 --> 31:28.887 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

31:28.920 --> 31:33.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, if it had stopped with
Jeff Sessions
recusing himself, it would have
been harder

31:33.558 --> 31:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for Democrats to make the case
for an independent
investigation.

31:37.028 --> 31:41.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But add this last weekend to it,
and they
feel like they have a much
better case to

31:41.900 --> 31:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make, that they're going to keep
making.

31:43.668 --> 31:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And the polls are on
their side,
too, more Americans saying they
would like

31:46.805 --> 31:48.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to see that, a special
prosecutor.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN YANG: Yes.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And last week, after that speech
on Tuesday,
the White House felt they had
the momentum,

31:53.145 --> 31:55.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they were going to carry
this through,
push their legislative agenda.

31:55.981 --> 32:00.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We got a big piece of it today,
the House
Republicans unveiling their
proposal for the

32:00.619 --> 32:04.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
repeal and replacement of the
Affordable Care
Act.

32:04.689 --> 32:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sean Spicer says they want to
sign this into
law by Easter.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

32:09.561 --> 32:10.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is the goal.

32:10.829 --> 32:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, listen, This is the most
important thing
to remember.

32:11.963 --> 32:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have been saying this from
the very
beginning.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Watch the actions, not just the
words.

32:15.734 --> 32:18.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The tweets are important, but
the actions
are much more important.

32:18.236 --> 32:20.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a big deal.

32:20.272 --> 32:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what every single member
of Congress
ran on, was repealing Obamacare.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president talked about
repealing Obamacare.

32:26.645 --> 32:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here is their chance to do it.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A couple things to remember.

32:29.781 --> 32:33.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, two-thirds of the
folks in the
House, over 50 percent of the
folks the Senate

32:33.518 --> 32:38.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are Republicans have never
had a Republican
president during their tenure in
Washington.

32:38.156 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't know about putting
legislation
together.

32:41.193 --> 32:42.460 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They know about opposing.

32:42.494 --> 32:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't know about promoting.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is going to be a big
challenge for them.

32:45.497 --> 32:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan has had
challenges within
his own party.

32:48.233 --> 32:51.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen those rebel forces
push up against
him.

32:51.369 --> 32:53.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is he going to be able to corral
them?

32:53.438 --> 32:59.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitch McConnell, he's very good
at politics,
but he has a very narrow margin,
only 52 seats

32:59.711 --> 33:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Senate, so he cannot lose
very many
of his own.

33:03.315 --> 33:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is going to be the test to
see if, despite
all that we're seeing with the
tweets, despite

33:08.320 --> 33:12.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the chaos we see in the
White House, if
Republicans can get through,
even if not Easter,

33:12.958 --> 33:19.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's say early summer, they can
get through
an Obamacare repeal, that is a
big success.

33:19.164 --> 33:23.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what the repercussions are
going to be
is a whole other story, but,
politically,

33:23.835 --> 33:30.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would be a very big deal,
because it
shows that this sort of mishmash
of a coalition

33:30.542 --> 33:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that has been put together
during this Trump
era actually works.

33:33.945 --> 33:37.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it doesn't, then we have some
real big
questions, especially what we're
going to

33:37.249 --> 33:39.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see about taxes, infrastructure
and so forth.

33:39.851 --> 33:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And you already
have some Republican
senators expressing some
concern, some skepticism

33:45.056 --> 33:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about what House Republicans
might be proposing,
because they have Medicaid
expanded in their

33:52.163 --> 33:58.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states, and they are concerned
that what is
being proposed on the House side
might negatively

33:58.069 --> 33:59.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
affect their states.

33:59.871 --> 34:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, also, I think,
is this going
to be a test to see how
President Trump is

34:04.743 --> 34:05.710 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as...

34:05.744 --> 34:06.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right, as a
salesperson.

34:06.745 --> 34:07.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Exactly.

34:07.746 --> 34:08.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Exactly.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And at using his
bully pulpit.

34:10.582 --> 34:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He can do two things, one, to
sell it to the
public, but also to get those
recalcitrant

34:14.052 --> 34:15.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republicans on board.

34:15.587 --> 34:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's still very popular among
Republican base.

34:17.856 --> 34:22.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If he tweets out about
congressman so and
so not getting on board -- but
let's see where

34:22.928 --> 34:26.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the conservative, especially the
fiscal conservatives,
are on this in the House.

34:26.264 --> 34:31.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are still tax --
refundable tax credits,
which means it's still going to
cost money.

34:31.503 --> 34:35.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And for many members of
Congress, they see
this as an entitlement, which
they want to

34:35.540 --> 34:36.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fight against.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amy Walter, you have
got the last
word.

34:38.376 --> 34:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amy Walter, Tamara Keith, thank
you very much.

34:40.979 --> 34:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

34:45.617 --> 34:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

34:50.221 --> 34:57.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now: the director
behind the breakout
horror flick "Get Out."

34:57.128 --> 35:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The movie has been praised by
critics, and
it's exceeded most box office
expectations.

35:01.900 --> 35:05.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has a lot more on its mind
than just scaring
its audience.

35:05.904 --> 35:10.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Brown went to Los Angeles
to meet filmmaker
Jordan Peele, who's well known
for his work

35:10.475 --> 35:14.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on biting racial satire.

35:14.746 --> 35:28.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A trip to meet
the parents
in the heart of safe,
well-heeled, white suburban

35:28.059 --> 35:30.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
America: What could possibly go
wrong?

35:30.729 --> 35:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new film "Get Out" is a
horror film about
race, and part of the horror is
just how close

35:36.034 --> 35:38.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to normal it feels.

35:38.236 --> 35:42.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For first-time director Jordan
Peele, it's
a major hit, and an unlikely
one.

35:42.841 --> 35:46.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE, Director, "Get
Out": I was sure
that, at some point, someone
would come in

35:46.378 --> 35:48.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and go, guess what?

35:48.947 --> 35:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can't release the movie.

35:50.348 --> 35:51.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's done.

35:51.683 --> 35:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have gotten word from on
high, this is
too controversial.

35:55.253 --> 35:57.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will get in trouble.

35:57.088 --> 36:02.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The 38-year-old
Peele is best
known as part of the sketch
comedy team Key

36:02.560 --> 36:06.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and Peele, which had a
five-season run on
Comedy Central.

36:06.731 --> 36:12.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were racist zombies and
plenty of social
commentary on that show,
addressed with gut-splitting

36:12.604 --> 36:15.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
humor.

36:16.007 --> 36:21.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In "Get Out," the humor gives
way to horror.

36:21.913 --> 36:26.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In "Get Out," the humor gives
way to horror.

36:49.841 --> 36:55.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We watch as Chris, played by
Daniel Kaluuya,
begins to realize that all is
not right at

36:55.346 --> 37:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the home of girlfriend Rose,
actress Allison
Williams.

37:05.290 --> 37:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The oh-so-liberal parents are a
little too
friendly.

37:09.160 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's something very
strange about the
black servants.

37:13.698 --> 37:18.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Horror, says Peele, has always
been his true
passion.

37:18.603 --> 37:23.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He modeled his film on classics
like "The
Stepford Wives" that take a big
societal issue

37:23.842 --> 37:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and blow up the discomfort
level, what he
calls a social thriller.

37:28.079 --> 37:35.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: For me, the social
thriller
is the thriller in which the
fears, the horrors,

37:35.687 --> 37:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the thrills are coming from
society.

37:40.625 --> 37:43.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're coming from the way
humans interact.

37:43.561 --> 37:47.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why do you think
horror becomes
a good way into that?

37:47.365 --> 37:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: I think that human
beings are
the most awful monster we have
ever seen.

37:56.174 --> 37:57.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wait a minute.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, that's true.

37:59.177 --> 38:02.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're the most beautiful
monster and the
most horrible monster.

38:02.046 --> 38:03.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: That's right.

38:03.748 --> 38:08.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that humans are,
in our nature,
we're evil or anything like
that.

38:08.786 --> 38:21.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think there's a demon
in our DNA,
in our tribal subconscious that
affects the

38:21.466 --> 38:25.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way we work and we operate as a
group.

38:25.069 --> 38:30.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: After seeing your
film, I was
thinking about the key to the
psychological

38:30.708 --> 38:34.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
horror film, at least for me, is
how close
it is to reality, right?

38:34.579 --> 38:37.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: I love it because
it feels grounded.

38:37.448 --> 38:39.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It feels real.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My whole thing is, like, ground
it, ground
it.

38:42.187 --> 38:48.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's comedy, you taken an
absurd comedic
notion and you apply it to
reality.

38:48.293 --> 38:50.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it's horror, if it's a
thriller, you do
the same thing.

38:50.828 --> 38:56.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you're using
the tropes
and the ticks of white liberals.

38:56.968 --> 39:03.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The father meets the black
boyfriend and shows
him a picture of Jesse Owens,
right, sort

39:03.775 --> 39:07.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of, like, oh, are you black, I
didn't even
realize kind of thing.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: That's a lot of my
experience.

39:10.615 --> 39:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I had never really seen it
portrayed in
film.

39:16.821 --> 39:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That, to me, was a golden
opportunity to put
this kind of uncomfortable
interaction up

39:22.393 --> 39:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and allow us to talk and deal
with it.

39:25.830 --> 39:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But what is it?

39:26.831 --> 39:29.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is it a hypocrisy?

39:29.801 --> 39:30.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it racism?

39:30.802 --> 39:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we talking about?

39:32.570 --> 39:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: I think part of
why the way
we talk about racism is broken
is because

39:37.609 --> 39:44.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we think of racism as this
unacceptable evil
thing that I couldn't possibly
have within

39:44.115 --> 39:45.083 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
myself.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I look at racism as one of the
social demons.

39:47.986 --> 39:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in its worst, it's violent
and it's a
systemic commitment to
oppression.

39:54.826 --> 39:59.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At its lightest and most
harmless, it is these
things that are being called
micro-aggressions,

39:59.130 --> 40:04.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right, which many times it's an
olive branch
that someone's trying to say,
hey, I know

40:04.769 --> 40:05.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Tiger.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I know Tiger.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which is
something you use
in your film, right?

40:09.340 --> 40:11.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: I used in my film.

40:11.242 --> 40:17.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality of it is, when those
interactions
add up, it's -- I'm having a
different experience

40:17.849 --> 40:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than that person is having.

40:19.684 --> 40:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oh, wow, so, yes, I am being
viewed for my
skin as the starting point of
the interaction.

40:30.061 --> 40:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not -- I don't have the
privilege of existing
at this party in the same way
that this white

40:36.034 --> 40:37.802 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guy has.

40:37.835 --> 40:41.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're writing
this years ago,
several years ago, right, in the
middle of

40:41.272 --> 40:44.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that kind of, are we in a
post-racial America
discussion.

40:44.509 --> 40:46.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JORDAN PEELE: Yes.

40:46.544 --> 40:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was -- the original idea
with the movie
was to point out this very real
horror we

40:55.253 --> 40:56.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
haven't gotten over.

40:57.021 --> 41:02.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what really works about
this movie
is these interactions you're
talking about.

41:02.260 --> 41:07.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think black people, minorities
recognize
these interactions and go,
finally, someone

41:07.665 --> 41:08.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
put it up.

41:08.900 --> 41:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a lot of white people,
maybe some
recognize it.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe they don't.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I was wondering
whether you
saw there being two audiences
for this film,

41:16.774 --> 41:20.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether you even thought about
it that way,
the things that the black
audience would react

41:20.912 --> 41:22.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to that a white audience, they
may not get.

41:22.747 --> 41:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: You know, it's a
really good
question.

41:25.750 --> 41:31.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did think of it in terms of
two audiences
often.

41:31.556 --> 41:34.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even in the
making, you would
think about it?

41:34.325 --> 41:36.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: In the making,
yes.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say -- sometimes, I
would say to Daniel,
who plays Chris, I would be
like, so this

41:39.030 --> 41:45.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is -- this part, your -- quote,
unquote -- "blackness"
sort of needs to come to the
surface a little

41:45.536 --> 41:47.271 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

41:47.305 --> 41:50.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just give me that thing
where a black
audience member will go like,
thank you.

41:50.575 --> 41:51.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

41:51.576 --> 41:52.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All right, there he is.

41:52.577 --> 41:53.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All right, he is.

41:53.578 --> 41:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's black, he's black, he's
black, you know?

41:56.748 --> 41:57.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
At the same time...

41:57.782 --> 41:59.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:59.150 --> 42:00.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And he knew
exactly what that
meant, of course.

42:00.218 --> 42:00.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JORDAN PEELE: Then he would go,
yes, yes,
yes.

42:00.785 --> 42:01.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Got it.

42:01.786 --> 42:03.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

42:03.488 --> 42:08.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, I very much
didn't want
to make a movie just for black
people.

42:08.159 --> 42:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I wanted to make this an
experience where
everybody's Chris when you're in
the movie.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, everybody is black.

42:16.901 --> 42:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're a white person in the
audience,
you're experiencing a piece of
the black experience

42:22.407 --> 42:24.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
through this character.

42:24.108 --> 42:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Get Out" just
had another
strong weekend, earning $26
million.

42:32.617 --> 42:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That brings the total take to
more than $75
million in its first 10 days,
for a film that

42:37.955 --> 42:41.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cost just $5 million to make.

42:41.325 --> 42:43.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

42:43.594 --> 42:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We will be back
shortly with high
school students whose work is
headed to space.

42:49.467 --> 42:52.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

42:52.904 --> 42:58.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on
the air.

42:58.843 --> 43:00.611 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

43:00.645 --> 43:12.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Students from
Rochester, New York's
East High School have been busy
this year

43:12.490 --> 43:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writing a detailed proposal for
a science
experiment that is out of this
world.

43:22.700 --> 43:29.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Sasha-Ann Simons from PBS
station WXXI
reports, the project was chosen
to be conducted

43:29.707 --> 43:31.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the International Space
Station.

43:31.576 --> 43:36.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: When East High
School chemistry
teacher Mary Courtney submitted
three proposals

43:36.047 --> 43:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last fall for the Student
Spaceflight Experiments
Program, she couldn't wait to
find out which

43:41.085 --> 43:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one would take off, literally.

43:42.720 --> 43:46.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY COURTNEY, Teacher, East
High School:
This was a very difficult
project.

43:46.657 --> 43:59.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's probably the most difficult
project that
our students do their entire
time in high

43:59.470 --> 44:01.105 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

44:01.138 --> 44:05.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: As part of the
program,
students from 21 schools across
the North

44:05.810 --> 44:10.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America were competing for the
chance to have
their science experiments that
test how microgravity

44:10.381 --> 44:12.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affects various organisms sent
to space.

44:12.250 --> 44:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Students De'Aunte Johnson,
Tailor Davis, and
Binti Mohamed were thrilled that
their proposal

44:15.920 --> 44:18.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was the winning one from East
High.

44:18.422 --> 44:23.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BINTI MOHAMED, Student: Ms.
Courtney pushed
us aside and she brought the
other two people

44:24.028 --> 44:24.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that were involved.

44:25.029 --> 44:27.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she was like, you guys won.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was like, are you serious?

44:29.100 --> 44:30.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Like, I started freaking out.

44:30.968 --> 44:35.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: They chose to
conduct their
research on a group of
microscopic organisms

44:35.873 --> 44:37.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called phytoplankton, which live
in lakes
and oceans.

44:37.642 --> 44:48.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Through the process of
photosynthesis, the
organism produces half the
oxygen we have

44:49.020 --> 44:50.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Earth.

44:50.855 --> 44:58.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY COURTNEY: The question is,
when this
goes to space, is there an
effect by not having

44:58.429 --> 45:10.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gravity on the production of the
chlorophyll?

45:10.875 --> 45:20.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And

45:20.918 --> 45:25.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And

45:26.023 --> 45:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other variable that happens
is these -- this
experiment is going to be kept
in a dark container,

45:36.901 --> 45:41.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and so it's not going to be
exposed to oxygen.

45:41.238 --> 45:45.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: Johnson is the
captain of
this student spaceship.

45:45.743 --> 45:50.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DE'AUNTE JOHNSON, Student: We
had a couple
of different choices, but we
picked mine.

45:50.615 --> 45:52.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: So, this was
your idea?

45:52.416 --> 45:58.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DE'AUNTE JOHNSON: It was my
idea, but I had
the bounce my idea off of them a
couple times

45:58.422 --> 46:01.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just to make sure when we got it
correct.

46:01.325 --> 46:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: The final
proposal was a
true team effort, though.

46:04.662 --> 46:07.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BINTI MOHAMED: There were parts
we all had
to do.

46:07.765 --> 46:13.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tailor was doing the
introduction and De'Aunte
was doing part three and four
and stuff like

46:13.571 --> 46:15.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

46:15.439 --> 46:26.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, De'Aunte reviewed it later
on and changed
some certain stuff that we
needed to clarify

46:26.951 --> 46:28.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or get into more detail with.

46:28.786 --> 46:31.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: So, why did
they choose
phytoplankton?

46:31.522 --> 46:38.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY COURTNEY: As the United
States and other
countries move forward with
space exploration,

46:38.095 --> 46:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the idea eventually is to be
able to establish
colonies, either on the moon,
other planets.

46:48.472 --> 46:50.274 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

46:50.307 --> 46:57.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you have got to be able
when you're
-- if you're on Mars, you have
got to be able

46:57.148 --> 46:58.449 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to produce food.

46:58.482 --> 47:06.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: That means the
work is far
from over.

47:06.557 --> 47:10.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 21 winning experiments will
blast off
in a mini-laboratory to the
International

47:10.761 --> 47:13.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Space Station in June.

47:13.898 --> 47:20.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first order of business for
the East High team will be to
figure out which

47:20.371 --> 47:23.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first order of business for
the East High team will be to
figure out which

47:50.935 --> 47:56.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
type of phytoplankton they will
use.

47:56.373 --> 48:03.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DE'AUNTE JOHNSON: And also which
type of mixture
we're going to use to make sure
they have

48:03.080 --> 48:06.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DE'AUNTE JOHNSON: And also which
type of mixture
we're going to use to make sure
they have

48:44.722 --> 48:54.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough nutrients when they go up
into space.

48:54.565 --> 49:04.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: The students
are getting
acquainted with a
spectrophotometer, a machine

49:04.542 --> 49:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that measures the intensity of
light, and
is perhaps what will be their
saving grace.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DE'AUNTE JOHNSON: But are they
moving?

49:17.021 --> 49:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SASHA-ANN SIMONS: And if you
haven't guessed
it already, there's a lot riding
on the student

49:28.866 --> 49:30.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
project.

49:30.768 --> 49:37.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once the experiment is aboard
the space station,
astronauts will interact with
it, based on

49:37.875 --> 49:47.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the guidelines set by these
three.

49:47.918 --> 49:59.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
