Gwen Ifill.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

GWEN IFILL: We bring you the
"NewsHour" tonight
from the Wells Fargo Center in
Philadelphia,

00:11.378 --> 00:14.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
site of the Democratic National
Convention.

00:14.147 --> 00:20.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Discord and
controversy loom
over this first night. The DNC
chair resigns

00:20.354 --> 00:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over damning leaked e-mails, as
the FBI investigates
the hack, and Bernie Sanders
supporters still

00:28.095 --> 00:29.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
make noise.

00:29.963 --> 00:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: She's been in the
public eye for
decades, from first lady of a
small Southern

00:34.268 --> 00:40.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state to today, on the cusp of
being the first
woman ever nominated by a major
party for

00:40.607 --> 00:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president. Tonight, we begin our
series delving
into the life of Hillary Rodham
Clinton.

Rise of an

00:46.947 --> 00:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

no clear-cut
path for a woman to just walk
into politics

00:50.017 --> 00:55.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on her own coming out of law
school. And part
of what Hillary Clinton now says
about that

00:55.188 --> 00:58.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, it just didn't really occur
to her or
seem like something that made
sense.

HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan
in Washington. We will have all
the non-convention

01:02.496 --> 01:07.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news of the day, including the
final and heartbreaking
report from a rescue boat off
the Libyan coast,

01:07.968 --> 01:10.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where another desperate journey
ends in tragedy.

01:10.037 --> 01:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ERNA RIJNIERSE, Doctors
Without Borders:
We are not dealing with numbers.
We are talking

01:13.507 --> 01:18.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about human beings, people like
you, like
me, and everybody has their own
story.

01:18.645 --> 01:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:29.690 --> 01:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Democratic
National Convention
has opened for business, amid a
new burst

01:40.033 --> 01:46.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of discord. Calls for unity from
Hillary Clinton's
camp are competing with cries of
foul from

01:46.773 --> 01:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
backers of Bernie Sanders.

01:48.809 --> 01:52.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Correspondent John Yang begins
our coverage
here in Philadelphia.

01:52.079 --> 01:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The divisions were on
display right
from the start, when Baltimore
Mayor Sterling

01:58.919 --> 02:00.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gaveled the convention into
session.

02:00.854 --> 02:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was to have been Democratic
National Committee
Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz.
But a firestorm

02:07.461 --> 02:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
erupted among Sanders supporters
after WikiLeaks
posted DNC e-mails that showed
party officials

02:14.001 --> 02:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
criticizing and even mocking the
Sanders campaign
during the primaries.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: You don't care about half
the party.

02:21.842 --> 02:25.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, the
Florida congresswoman
got a tumultuous welcome from
her own home

02:25.612 --> 02:32.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
delegation's breakfast.

02:33.020 --> 02:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ
(D), Florida:
We have so much to do and we
have to make

02:46.333 --> 02:47.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that we move forward in a
unified way.
We know that the voices in this
room that

02:47.934 --> 02:49.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are standing up and being
disruptive, we know
that is not the Florida we know.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Wasserman Schultz had
already announced
her resignation as party
chairman at the end

02:51.171 --> 02:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the convention. Some Sanders
supporters
say it's not enough.

02:53.507 --> 02:59.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We want to actually unite
the party.
All we are asking for is for the
person who

02:59.679 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resigned in disgrace to leave
the room.

03:01.615 --> 03:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm very upset because I
think that Bernie,
if not has tied, may have
actually won this

03:06.686 --> 03:08.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, if he had been treated
fairly.

03:09.022 --> 03:14.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The embattled
congresswoman is
already facing a tough primary
challenge from

03:14.161 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law professor Tim Canova, who's
being backed
by Sanders. Addressing
supporters, Sanders

03:19.900 --> 03:22.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
urged party unity, and got booed
himself.

03:22.536 --> 03:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
We have got to defeat Donald
Trump.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

03:28.175 --> 03:34.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: And we have
got to elect
Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

03:36.416 --> 03:41.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He says the e-mail
leaks won't
change his endorsement of
Clinton, it remains

03:41.054 --> 03:42.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be seen what is delegates do.

03:42.956 --> 03:48.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the streets of Philadelphia,
thousands
of Sanders supporters braved the
blistering

03:48.929 --> 03:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heat to vent their anger.

03:50.831 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm not a Republican, but
I have to
agree with Ted Cruz. We have to
vote our conscience.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can't vote the way we're
told.

03:56.536 --> 04:01.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As this convention's
business gets
under way, the DNC has issued a
deep and sincere

04:01.942 --> 04:07.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy to Sanders and his
supporters. Sanders
will be the featured speaker
here tonight,

04:07.714 --> 04:13.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appearing after Michelle Obama
and Senator
Elizabeth Warren.

04:13.186 --> 04:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton campaign officials say
they hope this
uproar will be long forgotten by
week's end

04:18.125 --> 04:24.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that the gathering will live
up to its
theme of united together.

04:24.397 --> 04:28.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, the FBI is
investigating how the
thousands of DNC e-mails found
their way to

04:28.602 --> 04:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WikiLeaks. Clinton's campaign
manager Robby
Mook suggests it's the work of
Russian hackers

04:34.074 --> 04:39.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hoping to give Republican Donald
Trump a boost.
Trump calls that claim a joke.
He campaigned

04:40.013 --> 04:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
today in Roanoke, Virginia.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Hillary Clinton knew what was
going on. She

04:44.684 --> 04:50.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knew everything that was going
on. She knew
it's a rigged system, that
Bernie Sanders

04:50.624 --> 04:54.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
never had a chance, OK? He never
had a chance.

04:54.094 --> 04:58.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at it, look
what's going on.
They're having a lot of people
marching. Now,

04:58.565 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of those people are going
to vote for
us.

05:00.734 --> 05:04.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Hillary
Clinton also got
the endorsement of retired U.S.
Marine General

05:04.437 --> 05:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Allen, once the top U.S.
commander in
Afghanistan.

05:07.073 --> 05:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, he said: "I have
no doubt
that she is the leader we need
at this time

05:13.180 --> 05:19.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to keep our country safe, and I
trust her
with that most sacred
responsibility of commander

05:19.219 --> 05:21.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in chief."

05:21.154 --> 05:25.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton picked up that theme at
the annual
convention of the Veterans of
Foreign Wars.

05:25.091 --> 05:30.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
You will never hear me say that
I only listen

05:30.730 --> 05:39.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to myself on national security.
I will be
ready to get to work on day one.
I take nothing

05:39.539 --> 05:42.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more seriously than our
security.

05:42.709 --> 05:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump is to address
the same gathering
tomorrow.

05:47.080 --> 05:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Philadelphia, the 5,000
delegates have
gathered under tight security
along with an

05:51.918 --> 05:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
estimated 45,000 journalists,
activists and
observers.

05:57.390 --> 06:00.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Philadelphia.

06:00.660 --> 06:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Later this
afternoon, Senator
Sanders sent out e-mails and
text messages

06:06.866 --> 06:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
urging supporters not to boo or
to stage walkouts.

06:10.604 --> 06:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We head down to the convention
floor now with
NPR's "Weekend Edition Sunday"
host Rachel

06:15.408 --> 06:20.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Martin, who joins us tonight and
every night
this week as part of our joint
"PBS NewsHour"

06:20.714 --> 06:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and NPR convention coverage.

06:22.549 --> 06:26.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rachel, it doesn't seem like
Bernie Sanders'
plea worked.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RACHEL MARTIN: Yes, Gwen, that's
right.

06:28.855 --> 06:34.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You heard it there in John's
piece. There
is real discord in the
Democratic Party right

06:34.094 --> 06:38.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. After Cleveland, after the
Republican
National Convention, Hillary
Clinton and her

06:38.331 --> 06:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign had to deal with all
the personal
attacks on her. They were hoping
that this

06:42.636 --> 06:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be a very different
moment, that this
would be a moment when the
so-called Democratic

06:46.206 --> 06:49.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family would come together, wrap
her up in
all kinds of love and support.

06:49.175 --> 06:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not the case, at least
not thus on
day one of the convention. There
has been

06:54.547 --> 07:00.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all kind of booing. Every time
someone takes
the stage and says it's time to
come together

07:00.220 --> 07:05.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and for all of us to get behind
the candidacy
of Hillary Clinton, there is
audible booing

07:05.892 --> 07:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this auditorium, even when
Bernie supporters
come up and say that.

07:10.363 --> 07:15.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ben Jealous, the head of the
NAACP, strong
Bernie Sanders supporter, when
he got up,

07:15.135 --> 07:19.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he got booed. As John mentioned
in his piece,
Bernie Sanders himself was booed
as a breakfast

07:19.606 --> 07:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier today. So, this is going
to be the
challenge of people who come to
the podium

07:23.777 --> 07:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today to try to deliver a
message that makes
those Bernie Sanders voters feel
enfranchised,

07:28.315 --> 07:34.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feel that they are a part of
this party and
that their issues are being
considered really

07:34.154 --> 07:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the heart of the Democratic
platform.

07:36.623 --> 07:42.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will hear, of course, from
Bernie Sanders
himself, also Elizabeth Warren,
a key leader

07:42.228 --> 07:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the progressive wing of the
Democratic
Party, and then Michelle Obama,
the first

07:45.765 --> 07:50.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lady, who has sky-high favorable
ratings.
They're hoping that she can kind
of bring

07:50.737 --> 07:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everyone together in this moment
-- back to
you, Gwen and Judy.

07:54.007 --> 07:58.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Rachel
Martin down
at the podium, thanks very much.

07:58.044 --> 08:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's dig into now to the
details of that
DNC hack we were talking about
and the motivation

08:02.816 --> 08:03.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind it.

08:03.950 --> 08:06.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan is in
Washington with that
story.

08:06.152 --> 08:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Judy.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, I spoke earlier this
evening with
former U.S. Ambassador to Russia
Michael McFaul.

08:11.524 --> 08:15.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now a professor at Stanford
University.
And Thomas Rid, who joins us via
Skype from

08:15.261 --> 08:19.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Austria. He is a professor at
King's College
London. He has written
extensively about cyber-attacks

08:19.432 --> 08:22.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and digital security, most
recently in his
book "The Rise of the Machines."

08:22.902 --> 08:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, thanks for joining
us.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
THOMAS RID, King's College
London: Hi.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL, Former U.S.
Ambassador to
Russia: Great to be here.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thomas, I want
to start
with you.

08:29.642 --> 08:34.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, lay out the evidence for
us. We have
heard that this is the Russian
government.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do we know that this was
Russia? How do
we know that this is a
sophisticated act that

08:38.485 --> 08:39.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
might take a state actor?

08:39.786 --> 08:42.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS RID: So, there are two
bits of the
evidence.

08:42.756 --> 08:48.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first is, who hacked the
DNC? The second
is, who gave the e-mails to
WikiLeaks? On

08:48.962 --> 08:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the first stage, who hacked the
DNC, imagine
a burglary, and you find the
fingerprints

08:52.866 --> 09:00.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a house, and then you find
the same in
another house, and you know who
breached in

09:00.540 --> 09:02.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
one house, but not the other.

09:02.308 --> 09:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a bit the situation that
we're having
here. So, we have I.P.
addresses. We have

09:07.080 --> 09:14.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
server infrastructure. We have
SSL certificates,
so quite strong evidence to say
that the DNC

09:14.287 --> 09:17.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was actually hacked by groups
that are associated
with Russia.

09:17.490 --> 09:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, Michael
McFaul, are
you convinced that it was
Russia? Is this

09:20.994 --> 09:22.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the way that they operate?

09:22.829 --> 09:29.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Well, first,
more generally,
Russia has tremendous capability
in this domain.

09:29.702 --> 09:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I worked in the government for
five years.
I witnessed it. I saw it. And we
should all

09:35.241 --> 09:42.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just say that first. Second, the
reports that
we have, just like Thomas just
said, are very

09:42.682 --> 09:47.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggestive that it was two
different Russian
entities. The organization, the
company that

09:47.954 --> 09:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigated it, CrowdStrike,
was rather definitive
in their analysis that they
published a month

09:54.360 --> 09:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ago, by the way, not just a few
days ago.

09:56.930 --> 10:02.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now today, we have many
senior U.S. government
officials also confirming that
they have strong

10:02.669 --> 10:05.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suspicions that it was these
Russian entities.

10:05.371 --> 10:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mr. Rid, I
want to ask,
is this consistent with previous
hacks that

10:11.511 --> 10:13.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russian government might
have orchestrated?

10:13.646 --> 10:18.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does this fall within their
definition of
what is allowed within how they
carry out

10:18.985 --> 10:20.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cyber-warfare?

10:20.787 --> 10:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS RID: So, the Russian
government and
intelligence community have been
hacking and

10:26.359 --> 10:31.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
breaching adversary computer
networks for
a very long time, literally for
20 years this

10:31.798 --> 10:33.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

10:33.533 --> 10:37.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is the first time they
have breached
a system and didn't just
exfiltrate, take

10:37.036 --> 10:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out data, but then started
putting those files
into the public domain in order
to affect,

10:44.077 --> 10:48.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this case, a Democratic
election campaign.
That's new. That's a
game-changer, I think.

10:48.982 --> 10:53.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, stealing, yes, but dumping
into the public
domain, that, we haven't seen
before.

10:53.953 --> 11:00.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Can I just add a bit of
international perspective
here? We have the same entity
that was caught

11:00.326 --> 11:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the DNC's networks was also
caught in the
German Parliament, in the
Bundestag, in May

11:06.399 --> 11:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2015. The same entity was caught
in a French
TV station and actually just
interrupted their

11:11.337 --> 11:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
programming around the same
time.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was caught in other European
military networks.
And the attribution was actually
quite strong

11:17.944 --> 11:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in those cases. The German
government has
come out publicly and pointed
the finger at

11:22.582 --> 11:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russian military intelligence.

11:24.450 --> 11:27.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
McFaul, why would
Russia want to do this? What are
their interests

11:27.287 --> 11:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in publicizing this intel, if
they were in
fact the ones that acquired it
in the first

11:31.524 --> 11:33.359 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place?

11:33.393 --> 11:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: I think there
are two different
kinds of arguments to think
about here.

11:36.496 --> 11:43.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is the policy argument.
There's no question
in my mind that the Kremlin,
President Putin

11:43.369 --> 11:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and others have said this rather
clearly,
in my view, that they prefer
Trump to Clinton,

11:49.876 --> 11:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in terms of his policies. He
said things that
they like.

11:54.314 --> 11:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is another element
that I don't
think has gotten as much
attention, and that

11:58.318 --> 12:04.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that this is also personal.
If you go back
and you look at what Vladimir
Putin and others

12:04.457 --> 12:12.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said back during their last
electoral round,
they criticized Secretary
Clinton personally

12:12.332 --> 12:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for what they alleged was her
meddling in
their internal affairs.

12:17.704 --> 12:23.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She criticized a parliamentary
election back
in December 2011. She said it
wasn't free

12:23.276 --> 12:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or fair, or had problems. I
don't remember
the exact statement. And Putin
then said she

12:29.282 --> 12:35.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incited -- I think the word he
used, gave
the protesters a signal to come
out and protest

12:35.822 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against him. So Putin's a guy
that remembers
these things. Maybe that's
another explanation

12:41.527 --> 12:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for why they're seeking this tit
for tat now.

12:43.630 --> 12:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I want to pick
on something
you said a little earlier, is
that this sort

12:46.833 --> 12:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of intelligence tradecraft
happens all the
time, that we are probably
participating in

12:51.604 --> 12:56.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
some of it some country
somewhere. Is the
difference then that it's
happening to the

12:56.075 --> 12:57.277 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States?

12:57.310 --> 13:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: No, I would put
it somewhat
differently.

13:00.580 --> 13:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's be candid here. Do we
really believe
the DNC is the only organization
in the United

13:07.720 --> 13:13.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States that the Russians have
hacked? No,
I don't believe that. They have
an active

13:13.526 --> 13:17.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operation here where they're
constantly seeking
to gather intelligence.

13:17.430 --> 13:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's unique about this is that
they were
caught and that they were
exposed, and, number

13:22.802 --> 13:28.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two, the data dump. I mean,
that's the thing
that is really striking to me.
And that it

13:28.474 --> 13:33.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was released on the day before
the opening
of the Democratic National
Convention, that's

13:33.913 --> 13:35.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not just coincidence.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thomas Rid?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS RID: I think it's really
time for the
United States government and the
intelligence

13:40.420 --> 13:47.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community in the U.S. to pull
its weight and
also draw a line here, because,
indeed, as

13:47.193 --> 13:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael McFaul said, this is a
very significant
incident.

13:50.129 --> 13:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of countries in Europe are
looking at
this and thinking, oh, my God,
if they get

13:54.567 --> 13:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
away with doing this to the
Americans, what
are going to they do to us?

13:58.771 --> 14:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Thomas Rid, author
of "Rise of the Machines,"
Michael McFaul,

14:03.009 --> 14:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former ambassador to Russia,
thank you both
for joining us.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCFAUL: Thank you.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS RID: Thank you.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Hari for
that conversation.

14:10.483 --> 14:14.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're back to Philadelphia
now, where
the divisions within the
Democratic Party

14:14.987 --> 14:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are on full display tonight here
in the Wells
Fargo Arena.

14:18.124 --> 14:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To discuss all that, we are
joined by two
Minnesota lawmakers with
differing perspectives.

14:23.129 --> 14:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman Keith Ellison was an
early Bernie
Sanders supporter, but he threw
his endorsement

14:27.400 --> 14:33.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Hillary Clinton earlier this
month. And
Senator Amy Klobuchar is a
longtime Clinton

14:33.306 --> 14:33.873 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
backer.

14:33.906 --> 14:35.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
REP. KEITH ELLISON (D),
Minnesota: Thank you
for having us.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to start with
you, Congressman
Ellison, because, later tonight,
you will

14:38.678 --> 14:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be introducing Bernie Sanders,
and you have
been in the room with us tonight
and heard

14:42.682 --> 14:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the booing which has greeted
every mention
of Hillary Clinton's name.

14:46.686 --> 14:50.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders has said to his
people, calm
down, and it hasn't worked.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: Well, you
know, people's
passions are running high. A lot
of folks

14:53.893 --> 14:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaigned really hard for
Bernie, and they
put all they had into it.

14:57.163 --> 15:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, Bernie has said
that we have
fought the good fight. We have
made the platform

15:03.603 --> 15:09.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as progressive as it ever has
been. We have
made real progress. And we have
really started

15:09.675 --> 15:14.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a grassroots movement here. And
it's time
to make sure that we come behind
Hillary Clinton

15:14.814 --> 15:17.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to defeat Donald Trump.

15:17.049 --> 15:20.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I personally will say to you
that Hillary
Clinton has done progressive
things and has

15:20.920 --> 15:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a record to stand on, State
Children's Health
Insurance Programs. She helped
get eight million

15:25.792 --> 15:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids health insurance who didn't
have it.
She started her legal career out
at the Children's

15:31.364 --> 15:32.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Defense Fund.

15:32.231 --> 15:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why are they booing,
then?

15:34.133 --> 15:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: Because
they're adjusting.
Because they're coming around.
They have their

15:38.471 --> 15:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own, you know, strong feelings
about it, and
they have invested their heart
and soul into

15:42.675 --> 15:44.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Bernie's campaign.

15:44.410 --> 15:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I believe that, with time,
we will be
very, very tight. I think we
already have

15:49.515 --> 15:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
substantial unity already.

15:51.350 --> 15:55.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator
Klobuchar, do you think
Senator Sanders should have
moved earlier

15:55.154 --> 16:00.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to tamp down some of
these feelings
among his supporters, number
one? And, number

16:00.359 --> 16:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two, how much is it hurting
Secretary Clinton
to have the spectacle?

16:04.030 --> 16:06.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR (D),
Minnesota: Well, I
have said from the beginning, I
don't think

16:06.499 --> 16:11.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's time. It's more important
in what he
said. And he gave an emphatic
endorsement

16:11.504 --> 16:13.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of her a few weeks ago.

16:13.339 --> 16:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he also, as Keith noted, is
going to come
on tonight. Keith is going to be
introducing

16:18.444 --> 16:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him. I can't think of a better
person to introduce
him than Keith Ellison.

16:22.381 --> 16:28.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you look at today, it
was a wild
day, that's true, but look at
the facts here.

16:28.588 --> 16:32.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Sanders people were very
concerned about
Debbie Wasserman Schultz. She
stepped down

16:32.725 --> 16:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as chair. She is not even going
to be gaveling
-- didn't gavel the convention.

16:35.795 --> 16:37.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:37.597 --> 16:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: You have
Bernie making
his speech tonight. I think,
given everything

16:40.967 --> 16:46.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that happened, she took
responsibility. She
said -- got us through the 2012
election,

16:46.205 --> 16:50.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did an incredible job as chair,
but given
everything that's happened, she
decided to

16:51.010 --> 16:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
take responsibility for what
happened.

16:52.945 --> 16:56.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, to move on, you have got
Bernie speaking
tonight, you have got Elizabeth
Warren, you

16:56.349 --> 16:59.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have Michelle Obama. Really, the
convention
starts tonight.

16:59.852 --> 17:03.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It seems like it
takes more than
speakers, however, for true
unity to happen

17:03.723 --> 17:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a convention. We just spent a
week in Cleveland,
where the theme was a lack of
unity. And how

17:07.927 --> 17:12.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you know that is not going to
be -- how
do you prevent that from being
the same theme

17:12.131 --> 17:14.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Philadelphia?

17:14.066 --> 17:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: Because I
know that everybody
who supported Bernie Sanders
supported him

17:17.937 --> 17:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they believe that
college debt is
too high. They believe that the
minimum wage

17:23.409 --> 17:27.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needs to be increased. They
believe that we
have to take on climate action.

17:27.480 --> 17:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so how can a real Bernie
Sanders supporter
ever do something that would
help Donald Trump,

17:34.287 --> 17:39.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who is opposed to all of those
things? Now,
people have -- people -- you
can't always

17:39.125 --> 17:44.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just turn on a dime. I mean, if
you put everything,
your heart and soul into a
campaign, it might

17:44.964 --> 17:51.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take you a while to come around
to the realization
that, you know, another person
has won.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the fact is, I have faith in
these folks.
They are going to come around.

17:53.606 --> 17:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: And, if I
could add, Ted
Cruz, think of that speech. How
did he end

17:57.543 --> 18:01.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up? He ended up without even
endorsing their
candidate for president.

18:01.280 --> 18:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not happening tonight
with Bernie Sanders.
And along the points Keith made,
think about

18:05.451 --> 18:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. Climate change, what does
Donald Trump
say? He says it's made up by the
Chinese.

18:10.089 --> 18:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does Donald Trump say about
the housing
crisis? He says he wants to bet
on it. What

18:14.093 --> 18:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does he say about free college,
one of the
Bernie Sanders supporters' key
platform item?

18:19.832 --> 18:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says he wants to do Donald
Trump University.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is a vast difference.

18:23.903 --> 18:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we're here in
Philadelphia,
where we're still seeing
dissent, disagreement

18:28.341 --> 18:33.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along the two sides. And to both
of you, the
fact is, Bernie Sanders
supporters have strong

18:33.412 --> 18:38.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feelings, strong expectations
that are not
going to be the priority for
Secretary Clinton,

18:38.184 --> 18:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it comes to how far they
want to go on
the minimum wage, what they want
to do on

18:42.521 --> 18:44.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the environment.

18:44.256 --> 18:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: Well, there
I have to
say, you know, the platform is
one of the

18:47.460 --> 18:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most progressive platforms we
have ever seen.
And it wouldn't be without the
cooperation

18:52.398 --> 18:55.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and endorsement of Hillary
Clinton.

18:55.067 --> 19:00.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, $15 minimum wage, the
federal minimum
wage, is in the platform.
Debt-free college

19:00.272 --> 19:01.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is in the platform.

19:01.807 --> 19:03.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But do you expect
that she
is going to make that a
priority?

19:03.843 --> 19:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: I think that
she is going
to make it a big deal. That's
what people

19:07.380 --> 19:09.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all over the stump are saying.

19:09.181 --> 19:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, Hillary Clinton has been
fighting for
these things her whole life.
When has Hillary

19:12.651 --> 19:18.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton been about anything
other than trying
to make working people have a
better lifestyle?

19:18.991 --> 19:22.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what her whole Senate and
prior career
were about.

19:22.628 --> 19:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, look, I was a Bernie
supporter. I was
proud to be that. I'm now proud
to support

19:27.967 --> 19:32.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, because I
believe that we
do have shared values, and the
evidence of

19:32.038 --> 19:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is the platform. The platform
is the most
progressive we have ever seen.

19:35.741 --> 19:40.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm old enough to
remember when
the secret of the sauce for
Democrats was

19:40.212 --> 19:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supposed to be moving to the
middle, moving
and becoming more moderate. I
believe it may

19:45.518 --> 19:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been Hillary Clinton's
husband who spearheaded
this idea.

19:48.687 --> 19:52.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So now are we, looking at this
-- what the
pressure, the most progressive
platform ever,

19:52.925 --> 19:58.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Keith Ellison puts it, are we
now a Democratic
-- are you now a Democratic
Party moving more

19:58.130 --> 19:59.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and more to the left?

19:59.799 --> 20:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: I think what
Keith is
talking about with this platform
is, times

20:02.701 --> 20:06.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change, and right now what
people need is,
they need to be able to send
their kids to

20:06.839 --> 20:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
college, they need to able to
buy a house.

20:08.741 --> 20:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the platform simply reflects
where we
are as a country, and the fact
that we have

20:13.279 --> 20:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen this enormous income
inequality that
both of our candidates have been
talking about

20:17.750 --> 20:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the beginning that you
don't hear from
the Republican side, where all
you hear from

20:21.253 --> 20:23.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them is divide, divide, divide.

20:23.222 --> 20:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bernie Sanders' speech, you
compare it
to Ted Cruz's at the end of the
day, and you

20:27.460 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
won't even see the same points
or see the
same ending.

20:31.363 --> 20:33.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:33.132 --> 20:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But to come back
to the point
we were all discussing a few
minutes ago,

20:36.068 --> 20:40.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't there an impatience, not
only among
the Bernie Sanders supporters,
but among other

20:40.439 --> 20:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans, to see change, and
it's hard for
them to see that with Secretary
Clinton, who's

20:45.478 --> 20:48.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been on the American political
scene for two
or three decades?

20:48.114 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: Sometimes,
this is what
democracy looks like. People's
passions run

20:53.419 --> 20:55.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
strong.

20:55.254 --> 20:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're dealing with really
tough things all
across America. You're dealing
with low wages.

20:59.091 --> 21:03.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can't send their kids to
school. Of course
they're going to come in here
and demand change.

21:03.395 --> 21:09.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're not just going to
sit quiet as
their economic situation at home
is not making

21:09.635 --> 21:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the improvements at the pace
that they need
them to.

21:12.171 --> 21:16.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm not really too worried
about the level
of enthusiasm and passion that
we see on the

21:16.509 --> 21:17.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House floor. I think that...

21:17.910 --> 21:18.544 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:18.577 --> 21:19.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The House floor.

21:19.411 --> 21:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: You know
what?

21:19.778 --> 21:20.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:20.980 --> 21:21.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: You know, I
spend a lot
of time...

21:21.714 --> 21:22.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:22.715 --> 21:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're forgiven.
You're forgiven.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.183 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:24.216 --> 21:25.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: I spend a
lot of time
there.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that we're going to
see passion.
This is what democracy looks
like. This is

21:29.155 --> 21:33.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what people do in America. They
get out. They
demonstrate. They let their
voices with heard.

21:33.726 --> 21:34.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But we will be together.

21:34.760 --> 21:36.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Final thoughts,
Senator Klobuchar?

21:36.662 --> 21:39.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, just
to your original
point here about some of the
independent voters

21:39.431 --> 21:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well, I know a lot of people
in our state
who can -- we elected Jesse
Ventura. Right?

21:44.170 --> 21:48.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't want to have a
candidate that feels
temperamentally unsure. They
don't want to

21:48.174 --> 21:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have someone that is going to
bring them into
a war zone again. There's a lot
of things

21:53.345 --> 21:57.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that bring independent voters to
Hillary Clinton.
And our job this week, without a
doubt, is

21:57.716 --> 22:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to tell that story, to tell the
personal stories
about her and also to tell about
her vision

22:03.122 --> 22:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for America, because we didn't
hear about
that last week. All we heard was
negativity.

22:07.226 --> 22:11.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we have got
four whole
nights to go. We're just getting
started.

22:11.130 --> 22:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: Getting
started.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two lawmakers.

22:13.432 --> 22:15.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: You get to
watch us announce
the delegates together.

22:15.301 --> 22:17.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: There you
go.

22:17.102 --> 22:20.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two lawmakers
from Minnesota,
Senator Amy Klobuchar,
Representative Keith

22:20.873 --> 22:22.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ellison, thanks to you both.

22:22.241 --> 22:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. KEITH ELLISON: Thanks a
lot.

22:23.542 --> 22:24.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Thank you.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you.

22:26.478 --> 22:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now: from a
conservative
Goldwater girl, to the
presumptive Democratic

22:30.349 --> 22:32.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nominee for president.

22:32.218 --> 22:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we begin our series
exploring Hillary
Clinton's life, starting with
her entrance

22:36.622 --> 22:38.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into politics.

22:38.524 --> 22:43.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
It may be hard to see tonight,
but we are

22:43.128 --> 22:46.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all standing under a glass
ceiling right now.

22:46.432 --> 22:52.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Almost
half-a-century before
Hillary Clinton became the first
American

22:52.071 --> 22:58.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman to head up a major party's
presidential
ticket, Hillary Rodham was
making history

22:58.344 --> 23:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the first ever student to
deliver a commencement
address at Wellesley College in
1969.

23:04.149 --> 23:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We feel
that, for
too long, our leaders have
viewed politics

23:09.288 --> 23:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the art of the possible. And
the challenge
now is to practice politics as
the art of

23:15.261 --> 23:17.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
making what appears to be
impossible possible.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER, Author, "All
The Single
Ladies: Unmarried Women and the
Rise of an

23:19.932 --> 23:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Independent Nation": Buried in
it is the blueprint
for so much of what would come
in the future

23:24.169 --> 23:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Hillary Clinton that I think
still resonates
today, when she's on the verge
of perhaps

23:28.641 --> 23:30.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
becoming the first woman
president.

23:30.743 --> 23:37.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Author Rebecca
Traister describes
Clinton's college years as a
political transformation,

23:37.049 --> 23:40.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from her roots in this
conservative Chicago
suburb.

23:40.252 --> 23:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: My
father put everything
he had into a small fabric
printing shop in

23:46.659 --> 23:56.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chicago. My mother was out on
her own working
as a house maid at the age of
14. So, I grew

23:56.368 --> 24:00.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up respecting the dignity of
hard work.

24:00.272 --> 24:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Growing up,
Rodham's politics
mirrored those of her father, a
staunch Republican.

24:07.079 --> 24:13.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a college freshman, she
served as president
of the Young Republicans Club,
but she graduated

24:13.319 --> 24:20.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a liberal Democrat, who would
eventually
work on George McGovern's 1972
presidential

24:20.125 --> 24:21.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

24:21.960 --> 24:24.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER: She became a
young adult
in this era in which the great
social movements

24:24.596 --> 24:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the 20th century were totally
reshaping
the nation, the civil rights
movement, the

24:29.968 --> 24:35.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women's movement, the gay rights
movement.
All of that was fomenting as she
was coming

24:35.574 --> 24:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to political consciousness.

24:37.343 --> 24:42.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After college
came Yale Law
School and work with the
Children's Defense

24:42.147 --> 24:47.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fund, where she knocked on
doors, collecting
data about poor children. It was
the start

24:47.820 --> 24:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a long string of public
service work, work
that political reporter Indira
Lakshmanan

24:54.193 --> 24:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says motivates Clinton to this
day.

24:56.462 --> 24:59.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN, Journalist:
She is driven
by certain things that are
important to her,

24:59.965 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the welfare of women and
children, health
care for all Americans, income
inequality.

25:05.104 --> 25:11.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Hillary was
forming her
ideas about public service, a
fellow law student

25:11.143 --> 25:12.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
named Bill entered the picture.

25:13.011 --> 25:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER: He was from
Arkansas, and
he wanted to go back and start
his political

25:16.815 --> 25:24.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career. And so, in the early
'70s, Hillary
Rodham had this choice: Does she
embark on

25:24.823 --> 25:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her own career, or does she go
to Arkansas,
where she doesn't know anybody
except for

25:29.695 --> 25:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her boyfriend, and begin a
career on her own
as a lawyer, but really as a
secondary figure

25:36.268 --> 25:40.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to this man who is going to
embark on what
she thinks is destined to be a
very serious

25:40.672 --> 25:42.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and successful career in
politics?

25:42.541 --> 25:46.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, we know she
chooses to do
the latter.

25:46.445 --> 25:52.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In October, 1975,
Hillary Rodham
married Bill Clinton at their
home in Fayetteville,

25:52.918 --> 25:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arkansas. While Bill followed
his political
ambitions, getting elected
Arkansas' attorney

25:58.724 --> 26:04.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general, Hillary supported the
family by joining
a Little Rock law firm, where
she became their

26:05.030 --> 26:06.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
first female partner.

26:06.865 --> 26:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER: There was no
clear-cut path
for a woman to just walk into
politics on

26:10.869 --> 26:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her own coming out of law
school. And part
of what Hillary Clinton now says
about that

26:15.841 --> 26:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, it just didn't really occur
to her or
seem like something that made
sense, that

26:19.478 --> 26:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she wanted to participate in
making policy,
not as a headliner and not as a
candidate

26:23.916 --> 26:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
herself, but as an advocate and
kind of as
a policy wonk.

26:28.720 --> 26:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When Bill was
elected governor
in 1979, Hillary took on an
unofficial, but

26:35.461 --> 26:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
active role, says former White
House aide
David Gergen.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN, Former White House
Aide: For
a long, long time, even before
she got to

26:42.267 --> 26:47.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the White House, when the
Clintons were in
Arkansas and she was asked by
her husband

26:47.406 --> 26:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take the lead on some various
initiatives
there, and she bravely went out
and did that.

26:52.377 --> 26:57.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Indeed, Clinton
appointed his
wife to head up the Arkansas
Education Standards

26:57.616 --> 27:03.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee, where she worked to
reform the
state's public schools, at a
time when Arkansas

27:03.489 --> 27:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was one of the lowest-performing
states in
the country.

27:06.425 --> 27:10.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Because
we're going
to give them every chance we can
to develop

27:10.829 --> 27:12.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their minds, so that they can
play a role
in this state, this country to
make it the

27:12.965 --> 27:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of place it needs to be!

27:15.601 --> 27:17.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

27:17.469 --> 27:22.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: By the end of his
time as governor,
Bill Clinton was praised for his
education

27:22.574 --> 27:28.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reforms, many of which came out
of that committee,
and public school performance
had improved

27:28.881 --> 27:30.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
markedly.

27:30.582 --> 27:34.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: The Clintons'
argument
has always been, even if
unspoken, this sort

27:34.419 --> 27:39.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of idea that you get a
two-for-one deal with
them. You get two people who are
incredibly

27:39.091 --> 27:44.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
smart and well-educated and,
again, whether
you agree with their policies or
not, are

27:44.329 --> 27:49.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
committed to certain policies
and have been
trying to work on those all
their lives.

27:49.701 --> 27:54.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was a theme
Bill Clinton
carried over to his run for the
White House.

27:54.706 --> 28:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: If we
want a president
that brings out the best in us,
then I think

28:00.045 --> 28:04.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the choice is clear. It's the
next president
of the United States Bill
Clinton.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

28:06.118 --> 28:11.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that working
relationship,
says Gergen, would take a toll
on their marriage.

28:12.024 --> 28:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN: My sense was,
they'd been so
deeply involved in their public
lives, that

28:17.329 --> 28:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they -- and there was so much
going on, they
really never settled what the
rules of the

28:22.000 --> 28:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
road were when they came the
White House.
And it was volatile. It was a
volatile relationship.

28:27.005 --> 28:31.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How volatile
wasn't visible
to the outside world.

28:31.810 --> 28:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: With that, we turn
to syndicated
columnist Mark Shields, New York
Times columnist

28:38.350 --> 28:43.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political
Report for a special convention
edition of

28:43.689 --> 28:45.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Politics Monday.

28:45.490 --> 28:48.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since you're usually in the
Politics Monday
chair, Amy, I guess I will start
with you.

28:48.994 --> 28:53.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sat here a week ago in
Cleveland and talked
about the chaos on the floor of
the Republican

28:53.732 --> 28:57.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Convention the first day. And it
seems like
we have the Democratic version
of that.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Don't
we?

28:59.771 --> 29:05.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That unity was the theme that we
were going
to see from the moment this
convention started.

29:05.110 --> 29:10.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not surprisingly, they are
starting off the
very first day with Elizabeth
Warren, Bernie

29:10.082 --> 29:14.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders to try to quell or at
least satisfy
this crowd here. But it's clear
that there

29:14.653 --> 29:17.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a tremendous amount of
enthusiasm. You
know what I'm -- for Bernie
Sanders.

29:17.756 --> 29:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I'm struck by was, in
Cleveland, it was
the establishment that stayed
home and wasn't

29:22.260 --> 29:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there, but the floor was pretty
united. There
were some dissidents. Here, the
establishment

29:27.799 --> 29:33.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is completely united for Hillary
Clinton,
but the delegates are the ones
who are not

29:33.639 --> 29:35.507 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unified.

29:35.540 --> 29:37.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, as
somebody who's
watched a lot of Democratic
Conventions, what

29:37.376 --> 29:39.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do you make of all this?

29:39.177 --> 29:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think Amy
put her finger
on it. This is a convention that
one didn't

29:43.348 --> 29:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expect to begin with a political
headline
that involved the term e-mails,
which is one

29:50.756 --> 29:55.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democrats would like to
avoid from now
until November, especially with
Russia in

29:55.761 --> 29:57.596 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the second paragraph.

29:57.629 --> 30:03.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that in itself is a
little disturbing
and unsettling. And the Bernie
followers,

30:03.268 --> 30:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not surprisingly, don't follow.
They are committed.
And his endorsement, we will
find out if he

30:10.308 --> 30:15.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can deliver and he and Elizabeth
Warren together
are enough to make the case that
it's time

30:15.714 --> 30:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get in line and support
Hillary Clinton.

30:18.016 --> 30:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: David Brooks, what
does it tell
you that the Bernie Sanders
supporters, followers

30:22.020 --> 30:26.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't follow and that he can say
to his people
-- they sent out a text this
afternoon saying,

30:26.825 --> 30:31.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
please don't lead a protest on
the floor.
And that clearly has continued
on. What does

30:31.697 --> 30:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it tell us about that movement?

30:32.998 --> 30:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

30:34.766 --> 30:38.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, on the one hand,
revolutions always
devour their own. The French
revolutionaries

30:38.136 --> 30:42.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learned this the hard way. And
so, in some
sense, it's historical. But I do
think something

30:42.107 --> 30:46.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new is happening here, which is
that social
media is replacing political
organizations,

30:46.878 --> 30:50.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that people who are whipped
up by social
media and who have a
spontaneous, organic

30:50.882 --> 30:55.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grassroots organization, that
has its own
momentum, its own rules, its own
rhetorical

30:55.921 --> 30:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
etiquette, and it supersedes the
stuff we're
normally used to setting here,
where people

30:59.925 --> 31:03.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are involved campaign to
campaign and their
ultimate loyalty to the party.

31:03.795 --> 31:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The people in the Sanders -- are
passionate,
and their ultimate loyal is to
the cause and

31:07.566 --> 31:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the ideas, and not to the party.

31:09.434 --> 31:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, how does
Hillary Clinton
put all this together? We
haven't even begun

31:14.940 --> 31:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first tight in terms of the
big speakers.
What's the formula for her?

31:20.145 --> 31:24.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: One part is to get
the people
who -- folks in this hall do
they believe

31:24.483 --> 31:28.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speak for them, Elizabeth Warren
and Bernie
Sanders, to come out right out
of the bat.

31:28.220 --> 31:33.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also want to go to David's
points, because
I think that is very important.
The reality,

31:33.325 --> 31:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sort of interesting -- I
don't know if
it's ironic, if I'm using that
properly -- about

31:37.629 --> 31:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the DNC and the e-mails is that
all this is
coming at a time, we say this is
so controversial

31:43.668 --> 31:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the DNC was sort of putting
a finger
on the scale, or more than a
finger, an actual

31:47.572 --> 31:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hand on the scale, for Hillary
Clinton.

31:49.741 --> 31:55.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet the party apparatus is
really pretty
worthless. Bernie Sanders was
able to raise

31:55.280 --> 31:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money without the party. He
didn't need access
to their donors. He didn't need
them to give

31:59.718 --> 32:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
access to the media. He didn't
need them to
get access to voter files.

32:03.121 --> 32:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was able to do that all on
his own. So,
Reince Priebus from the RNC,
Debbie Wasserman

32:07.359 --> 32:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schultz from the DNC both
finding out that
the party in and of itself, as
an apparatus,

32:12.397 --> 32:17.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really -- if it's not -- I'm
not going
to say that it's dead, but it
certainly has

32:17.602 --> 32:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not as much life in it that it
once did.

32:19.704 --> 32:23.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Since last we have
been around
the table, we now have a vice
presidential

32:23.308 --> 32:28.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pick from Hillary Clinton, Mark
Shields, so
what can you tell us about Tim
Kaine? And

32:28.113 --> 32:32.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will his -- his presence
actually on the ticket
seems to have upset some Bernie
supporters

32:32.784 --> 32:34.519 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

32:34.553 --> 32:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The hardest
assignment over
the weekend for any journalist
directed by

32:37.189 --> 32:41.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
an editor was to find a
Republican to say
something negative about Tim
Kaine.

32:41.226 --> 32:46.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When you have got Lamar
Alexander, from Bill
Bolling, the former lieutenant
governor of

32:46.431 --> 32:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Virginia, to John McCain, to
Jeff Flake saying
he's a great friend, Pat Toomey,
who hasn't

32:51.403 --> 32:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endorsed -- these are people who
haven't endorsed
Donald Trump -- basically saying
what a wonderful

32:55.640 --> 33:00.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person Tim Kaine is, I have
never seen Hillary
Clinton look as comfortable in
any public

33:01.012 --> 33:04.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
setting as she did on Saturday,
when she announced
Tim Kaine.

33:04.683 --> 33:10.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a partner in Tim Kaine
with which
she can be comfortable. He's
dependable. He's

33:10.155 --> 33:15.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unflamboyant, and he's got her
back. And he
is not going to embarrass her.
And I just

33:15.126 --> 33:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think, in that sense, it's a
choice for the
long run. It's a not choice for
the short

33:19.998 --> 33:25.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run. It's not just to win an
election. It's
not a -- I could see them as a
partner if,

33:25.437 --> 33:27.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in fact, she does win in
November.

33:27.239 --> 33:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David Brooks,
how does
Tim Kaine change anything in
this very explosive

33:32.744 --> 33:34.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contest between Hillary Clinton
and Donald
Trump?

33:34.946 --> 33:39.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think he
might be a key
to some sort of actual electoral
majority,

33:39.718 --> 33:42.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or at least a step in that
direction.

33:42.087 --> 33:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Listen, since we last met, we
have seen some
of the polls out of the
Republican Convention.

33:45.891 --> 33:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The polls are obviously volatile
at this time
of the year, but nonetheless
there was a bump

33:50.028 --> 33:54.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there was a significant
bump. And so it
should send a little source of
concern, not

33:54.266 --> 33:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
panic, in Democratic ranks, but
there should
definitely be concern, because
there was a

33:57.168 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much bigger bounce than I
certainly expected.

33:59.371 --> 34:03.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, there was one
poll that
said there was a bounce. Another
poll said...

34:03.708 --> 34:05.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

34:05.410 --> 34:06.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Right. I think
there are now
a couple showing some sort of
bounce.

34:06.811 --> 34:08.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

34:08.113 --> 34:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so, anyway,
something seems
to be working.

34:10.048 --> 34:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the one thing I think the
place this election
is going to be settled is in
suburban service

34:15.620 --> 34:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worker office parks, people who
are part of
the global economy, people who
are not upset

34:20.292 --> 34:24.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by necessarily trade or
immigration, things
like that. And if your party
comes out and

34:25.030 --> 34:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking like you're hostile to
the global
economy, I think you're going to
have trouble

34:29.234 --> 34:31.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with those people.

34:31.036 --> 34:34.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Tim Kaine is very acceptable
to your basic
moderate independent who might
be put off

34:34.572 --> 34:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by Trumpianism and Sandersism.

34:36.341 --> 34:36.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:36.975 --> 34:38.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: With the isms.

34:38.777 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tim Kaine also managed somehow
to change his
mind about the Trans-Pacific
trade policy

34:44.416 --> 34:48.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
just in time to get this
nomination or to
get this selection.

34:48.787 --> 34:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can he be expected to be that
bridge, Amy?

34:50.722 --> 34:54.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, there are a
lot of anti-TPP
signs being waved on the floor.

34:54.859 --> 34:56.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

34:56.695 --> 35:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And I think the
challenge, at
this exact moment, is that Tim
Kaine doesn't

35:01.733 --> 35:06.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
excite the base as much as he
placates a lot
of Republicans and those
suburban voters.

35:06.504 --> 35:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I think Tim Kaine is a
longer-run pick.

35:09.374 --> 35:16.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked about why Mike Pence
picked by Donald
Trump. That was a short-term
pick to fix his

35:17.015 --> 35:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention problem and his
Republican problem.
Hillary Clinton has a
longer-term look, which

35:21.386 --> 35:27.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, I need to go get those
suburban women,
those college-educated white
voters who right

35:27.792 --> 35:32.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now are very skeptical about
Donald Trump.
Who's going to win those over? I
think Tim

35:32.530 --> 35:33.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kaine is the reason.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark?

35:35.400 --> 35:40.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, in a year,
quite frankly,
where it's been bizarre, whether
in fact you

35:40.271 --> 35:46.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have two candidates with
negative favorable/unfavorable
ratings, you have Bernie
Sanders, you have

35:46.544 --> 35:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz, you have all the
Republicans, Tim
Kaine, more than anything, in
the phrase of

35:51.583 --> 35:53.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Warren Harding, is a return to
normalcy.

35:53.618 --> 35:59.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is just so relentlessly
normal. I just
think there was a sense of
relief in the country.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

36:01.359 --> 36:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we can't wait to spend
more time talking
to you all tonight and for the
rest of this

36:04.429 --> 36:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week. Mark Shields, David
Brooks, Amy Walter,
thank you all.

36:08.600 --> 36:13.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we ask you again tune in
tonight starting
at 8:00 p.m. Eastern for our
special NPR/"PBS

36:13.838 --> 36:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NewsHour" coverage of the
Democratic National
Convention here in Philadelphia.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now let's go back
to Hari in
Washington.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Judy.

36:21.780 --> 36:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Reports
out of Japan
say a man with a knife has
killed at least

36:25.750 --> 36:31.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
15 people and wounded 45. Police
say it happened
at a facility for the disabled
in a town outside

36:31.356 --> 36:36.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tokyo. National broadcaster NHK
reports the
man was a former employee at the
facility,

36:36.227 --> 36:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and turned himself in after the
attack.

36:38.563 --> 36:43.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Islamic State group claimed
responsibility
today for Sunday's suicide
bombing in Germany

36:43.301 --> 36:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that wounded 15 people. It was
the latest
in a series of attacks across
the country.

36:47.572 --> 36:50.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fatima Manji of Independent
Television News
reports from Bavaria.

36:50.175 --> 36:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA MANJI: Once again, a
German city is
on high alert after a violent
attack, the

36:56.614 --> 37:02.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fourth in what Bavaria's
interior minister
called the country's days of
terror. Last

37:02.620 --> 37:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, a Syrian man blew himself
up outside
a wine bar just yards away from
a music festival

37:08.493 --> 37:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where he was refused entry.

37:10.261 --> 37:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Suddenly, there
was an extremely loud bang, more
like a loud

37:15.567 --> 37:20.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rattle, definitely the sound of
an explosion.
I was shaken. I didn't know what
it was. I

37:20.538 --> 37:22.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
went back away from there.

37:22.273 --> 37:25.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA MANJI: The Bavarian
Interior Ministry
say a video in Arabic was on the
bomber's

37:26.010 --> 37:31.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phone showing him pledging
allegiance to leader
of the so-called Islamic State
group.

37:31.082 --> 37:34.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOACHIM HERRMANN, Bavarian
Interior Minister
(through translator): I think
this video shows

37:34.452 --> 37:39.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unquestionably that the attack
was a terror
attack with an Islamist
background, that the

37:39.090 --> 37:41.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
perpetrator had Islamist
convictions.

37:41.559 --> 37:46.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATIMA MANJI: Police say he had
a bomb in
his backpack with many metal
parts that could've

37:46.464 --> 37:51.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed and injured many more
people. Had he
been allowed into the crowded
event, this

37:51.769 --> 37:57.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could've been worse. The bomber
lived at this
shelter with other migrants and
refugees.

37:57.408 --> 38:01.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials say his application
for asylum in
Germany had been rejected
because he was a

38:01.846 --> 38:08.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
registered refugee in Bulgaria,
and he was
due to be deported there. The
incident comes

38:08.119 --> 38:13.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the end of a violent week in
Germany. On
Friday, a German teenager of
Iranian descent

38:13.525 --> 38:17.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot dead nine people at a
shopping center
in Munich.

38:17.362 --> 38:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The shooter had a history of
mental illness
and may have been inspired by
the far right.

38:23.768 --> 38:29.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Sunday, a 21-year-old Syrian
man wielding
a machete killed a woman in what
police believe

38:29.707 --> 38:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a domestic dispute, all this
after an
attack in which a 17-year-old
asylum-seeker

38:36.247 --> 38:41.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
armed with an axe injured five
people on a
train in Bavaria. He was shot
dead after the

38:41.619 --> 38:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack, which was claimed by the
Islamic State
group.

38:44.255 --> 38:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The attacks
are fueling
renewed debate over Germany's
acceptance of

38:48.193 --> 38:51.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one million migrants and
refugees last year.

38:51.429 --> 38:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, at least 14 people were
killed and
dozens were wounded, when a
suicide bomber

38:56.067 --> 39:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rammed a checkpoint. It happened
at a busy
entrance to a Shiite town some
50 miles north

39:00.838 --> 39:06.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Baghdad. The Sunni-dominated
Islamic State
group claimed responsibility.
Meanwhile, a

39:06.044 --> 39:10.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
string of bombings inside
Baghdad killed nine
more people.

39:10.114 --> 39:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, police in
Fort Myers,
Florida, tried to piece together
what triggered

39:13.718 --> 39:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a shooting attack overnight at a
nightclub.
It left two teenagers dead and
17 wounded.

39:18.590 --> 39:23.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The club had been hosting a
swimsuit party
for teens. Police detained three
people, and

39:23.094 --> 39:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are looking for others, but they
do not think
it was an act of terror. The
shooting came

39:27.532 --> 39:33.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just over a month after the
Orlando nightclub
shooting that killed 49 people.

Basketball legend Michael Jordan
today pledged
$2 million today to help mend
relations between

39:38.543 --> 39:43.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police and black communities.
Half will go
to the Institute for
Community-Police Relations,

39:43.581 --> 39:48.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a program set up by the
International Association
of Chiefs of Police, and the
other half to

39:48.219 --> 39:54.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
The NBA Hall
of Famer said he can no longer
stay silent

39:54.192 --> 39:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after recent police-involved
shootings and
the ambush killings of officers.

A wildfire north of Los Angeles
has now forced
the evacuation of some 10,000
homes. The blaze

40:04.435 --> 40:09.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broke out Friday, and has
already burned more
than 50 square miles, and killed
one person.

40:09.707 --> 40:15.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flames driven by winds are
sweeping through
rugged uphill terrain. Nearly
3,000 firefighters

40:15.947 --> 40:18.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are on the lines, but they say
progress is
slow.

DREW SMITH, Los Angeles County
Fire Department:
This has been topography-driven.
Wind picks

40:22.253 --> 40:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, and it moves it from south
to north at
about 7,000 acres a day. So when
the winds

40:29.694 --> 40:33.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surface, we have those wind
speeds that's
going to move it across the
landscape.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Making matters
worse, triple-digit
heat in recent days and years of
severe drought.

40:38.770 --> 40:44.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Verizon made it official today:
It's buying
Internet pioneer Yahoo! for just
over $4.8

40:44.142 --> 40:49.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
billion. The telecom giant
bought AOL last
year, and hopes the two
acquisitions bring

40:49.447 --> 40:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new revenue streams from mobile
video and
advertising. Yahoo! was once
valued at $130

40:55.953 --> 41:01.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
billion, but suffered a severe
loss of advertising
in recent years, and laid off
thousands of

41:01.426 --> 41:03.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
employees.

41:03.227 --> 41:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street's week opened on a
down note,
after a four-week rally. The Dow
Jones industrial

41:07.365 --> 41:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 77 points to close
at 18493.
The Nasdaq fell two points, and
the S&amp;P 500

41:14.572 --> 41:16.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
slipped six.

41:16.341 --> 41:21.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And New Zealand is embarking on
an all-out
campaign to rid itself of rats
by the year

41:21.045 --> 41:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2050. It's an effort to save
native birds
from rodents that eat their eggs
and compete

41:25.917 --> 41:30.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for other food. Rats are not
native to New
Zealand. Instead, they arrived
with the first

41:30.588 --> 41:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ships carrying explorers and
colonists.

41:36.461 --> 41:46.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally tonight, our Desperate
Journey series
continues.

41:46.371 --> 41:50.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They died horrible deaths. The
identities
of all but one of them are
unknown. And 21

41:50.942 --> 41:55.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the 22 will be buried in
unmarked graves.
They are the victims of a
disaster off the

41:55.680 --> 42:00.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Libyan coast last week, when yet
another unseaworthy
boat, overcrowded with migrants,
became a

42:00.918 --> 42:05.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
sad statistic to the
unscrupulous and cheap
traffickers who set them afloat.

42:05.223 --> 42:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The immediate aftermath was
witnessed and
recorded by "NewsHour" special
correspondent

42:09.527 --> 42:13.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malcolm Brabant, who filmed
images in this
report that, we should warn,
some viewers

42:13.598 --> 42:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will find upsetting.

42:15.366 --> 42:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malcolm spent two weeks on board
a rescue
ship that is jointly operated by
Doctors Without

42:19.704 --> 42:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Borders, known as MSF and SOS
Mediterranee.

42:22.573 --> 42:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's hi third and final report
from aboard
the ship Aquarius.

42:27.111 --> 42:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
French, Arabic,
English?

42:29.947 --> 42:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After two weeks
at sea, this
is the third rescue for the
Aquarius.

42:35.987 --> 42:40.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Multilingual Amani Tekle assures
them that
deliverance is at hand.

42:40.425 --> 42:50.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANI TEKLE, Coordinator: Stay
where you are.
We are here to rescue. We are
here to take

42:50.435 --> 42:53.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you to Italy, OK? We are a
humanitarian organization,
so we are here to help you and
take you to

42:53.905 --> 42:55.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Italy.

42:55.706 --> 42:59.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take everybody to the
big ship, yes?
We have enough space for
everybody. We will

42:59.877 --> 43:05.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not leave anybody, OK? So,
please, just stay
where you are.

43:05.349 --> 43:10.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As the rescuers
draw close,
initial reports of fatalities
are confirmed.

43:11.022 --> 43:19.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bodies are bobbing backwards and
forwards
in the half-flooded dinghy.

43:19.730 --> 43:24.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The stench of fuel is
overwhelming. The fumes
could cause the survivors to
collapse and

43:24.602 --> 43:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drown. The priority is to get
them off as
quickly as possible. A second
dinghy is nearby.

43:30.441 --> 43:38.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also overcrowded. Boat
number one takes
18 people in relays back to the
mother ship.

43:38.950 --> 43:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boat number two, on which I'm
filming, remains
on station to prevent more
casualties. In

43:46.257 --> 43:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their haste to get to safety,
the survivors
are stepping on the corpses of
people who

43:51.062 --> 43:54.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were alive just an hour or so
earlier.

43:54.966 --> 44:08.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Eventually, the last man
scrambles on to the
rescue craft. And Frenchman
Bertrand Thiebault

44:08.846 --> 44:16.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of SOS Mediterranee tries to
assess just how
many people have died.

44:16.921 --> 44:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During a lull, rescuing people
from the second
stranded dinghy, he tells me
what he knows.

44:25.296 --> 44:31.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BERTRAND THIEBAULT, SOS
Mediterranee: So there
were only men who were alive.
They were shocked

44:31.669 --> 44:44.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because about 15 women were dead
in the middle
of the boat because of the fuel
inhalation.

44:44.682 --> 44:52.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen the dead women,
and, between
the floor and them, about five
other ones

44:52.256 --> 44:54.091 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dead.

44:54.125 --> 44:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is a new
experience
for Amani Tekle, a former
refugee from Eritrea.

44:59.730 --> 45:05.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMANI TEKLE: Today was one of
the worst -- I
mean, one of my worst days,
because since

45:05.937 --> 45:15.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we started on the rescue
operations this year,
I didn't saw any dead body.

45:15.613 --> 45:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: For about
half-an-hour, the
raft floats free like a ghost
ship, before

45:21.619 --> 45:26.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rescuers attach lines and
bring it alongside
the Aquarius, where the teams
update the death

45:26.824 --> 45:37.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
toll, 22 victims, all women,
aged between
16 and 30.

45:37.768 --> 45:45.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So how did this disaster come to
pass? David
from Nigeria described how the
decking on

45:45.042 --> 45:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which the people were sitting
cracked. Shards
of wood punctured the thin
rubber, and the

45:50.181 --> 45:51.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
women were crushed in the panic.

45:51.916 --> 45:55.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID, Survivor: The girls were
sitting down
inside the center.

45:55.820 --> 46:04.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then the boys were sitting all
around the
boat. So, by the time the
plywood get boxed,

46:04.128 --> 46:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the next time, everybody was
running, scattering,
running, run to this side, run
to this side,

46:12.970 --> 46:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run to this side. Then the fuel
was not mixing
with the water. And we were
taking buckets,

46:20.978 --> 46:26.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start baling the water out of
the boat, baling
water out of the boat. But the
water was still

46:26.617 --> 46:28.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gushing inside.

46:28.419 --> 46:34.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENNIS OSBI, Survivor: I think
the rushing
of the men coming forward to
where we were

46:34.291 --> 46:39.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standing, that came by the
women, but they
were sitting down. And if you
are coming,

46:39.196 --> 46:43.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can stomp on them and you
move forward.

46:43.167 --> 46:47.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Eric Felice
lost his wife,
Texi (ph), in the crush. It
happened when

46:47.438 --> 46:52.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
salvation appeared on the
horizon. But for
Texi and the other women, the
rescuers were

46:52.309 --> 46:54.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
too late.

46:54.111 --> 46:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC FELICE, Widower: As we are
coming for
the boats, literally, we see the
water through

46:56.447 --> 47:03.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the boats. I call out, come to
this place.
That place is OK. It's OK. I
didn't know.

47:03.120 --> 47:16.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, we see the rescue,
I was happy.
I went to call my girl, my
woman. She's already

47:16.967 --> 47:19.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dead. It's finished.

47:19.370 --> 47:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: What happened
to her?

47:24.208 --> 47:32.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC FELICE: I don't know. I
don't know. I
don't know.

47:32.983 --> 47:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In the small
clinic next
door to the sanctuary, Dr. Erna
Rijnierse

47:38.689 --> 47:42.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prepares 22 death certificates,
which she
will give to the Italian
authorities.

47:42.093 --> 47:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ERNA RIJNIERSE, Doctors
Without Borders:
People have inhaled fumes. Maybe
people have

47:45.596 --> 47:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fainted. They went under the
other ones, and
they asphyxiated. They -- they
died a horrible

47:52.169 --> 47:54.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
death, really, really bad.

47:54.739 --> 48:02.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing is, in terms
of identification,
these people don't come from
places where

48:02.379 --> 48:08.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's perfect dental records
or other things,
so it's going to be very, very
difficult to

48:08.819 --> 48:19.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
give them a name and an
identity. So we have
one, one person that we know.
The other ones,

48:19.230 --> 48:20.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't, and I don't think we
will ever find
out.

48:20.965 --> 48:23.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: There is an
organization
which has got the personnel, the
technology

48:23.667 --> 48:28.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the wherewithal to be able
to help in
this situation. And that's the
International

48:28.038 --> 48:32.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Commission for Missing Persons,
which is based
in the Bosnian capital,
Sarajevo.

48:32.209 --> 48:38.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it did a fantastic job in
identifying
the victims of the Srebrenica
massacre. Now,

48:38.749 --> 48:43.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ICMP, as it's called, has
offered to help
the Italian authorities to try
to identify

48:43.554 --> 48:48.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missing migrants to try to
provide some resolution
for families who've lost
relatives along the

48:48.859 --> 48:50.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
migrant trail.

48:50.694 --> 48:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the ICMP doesn't have
sufficient money
and will find fund-raising
difficult; 36 hours

48:56.934 --> 49:01.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after leaving the accident site,
the Aquarius
is not far from her base at
Trapani in northwest

49:01.372 --> 49:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sicily. The migrants, who've
been subdued
for much of the journey, now
liven up at their

49:05.576 --> 49:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first sight of Europe, for which
they have
invested and risked so much.

49:11.849 --> 49:16.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reception committee includes
the Red Cross,
doctors, psychologists and
undertakers.

49:16.654 --> 49:24.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): The
journey was
very hard to us, but thank God
we've reached

49:24.895 --> 49:32.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Italy. Thanks all of you people,
because you
are the people who saved our
lives. Thank

49:32.803 --> 49:34.572 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
God.

49:34.605 --> 49:39.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The passengers
are anxious
to get their feet on dry land.
But there's

49:39.276 --> 49:45.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a delay. There's a dispute
between MSF and
the Italian authorities about
how to proceed.

49:45.216 --> 49:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MSF's Dutch coordinator, Ferry
Schippers,
is fuming.

49:48.252 --> 49:50.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRY SCHIPPERS, Doctors Without
Borders:
We just heard that the judge
here in Trapani

49:50.888 --> 49:57.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wants the dead bodies off first,
which is
very insensitive. I mean, they
are definitely

49:57.828 --> 50:04.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not thinking. We have people on
board who
have relatives that died on that
boat, in

50:04.168 --> 50:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that rubber boat that day. And
they will see
the body bags passing, passing
by. I don't

50:09.640 --> 50:12.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
understand this. Believe me, I'm
very angry.

50:12.877 --> 50:19.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But after some
robust negotiations,
MSF wins the argument and the
living are allowed

50:19.049 --> 50:21.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to disembark before the dead.

50:21.151 --> 50:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
One of the first to go, newly
widowed Eric
Felice .
The survivors are given a
cursory health check

50:31.929 --> 50:42.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the Italians before going
ashore. And then,
as sensitively as possible, the
22 victims

50:42.106 --> 50:46.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are carried from the temporary
mortuary on
the ship's front deck.

50:46.544 --> 50:52.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They left Africa with heady
dreams of prosperity
in Europe. But the sea condemned
them to an

50:52.383 --> 50:55.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unmarked grave and a single red
rose.

50:55.986 --> 51:08.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERRY SCHIPPERS: We're going to
throw this
flower in the water out of
respect for the

51:08.098 --> 51:14.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who died in the boat.
With these flowers,
we sent them goodbye. And let's
hope this

51:14.872 --> 51:18.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who died in the boat.
With these flowers,
we sent them goodbye. And let's
hope this

51:37.928 --> 51:39.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will stop.

51:39.763 --> 51:41.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ERNA RIJNIERSE: We are not
dealing with
numbers. We are talking about
human beings,

51:41.699 --> 51:45.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people like you, like me, and
everybody has
their own story.

51:45.602 --> 51:50.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in my humble experience,
nobody runs away
from home, nobody leaves
everything they know

51:50.507 --> 51:54.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behind because it's such a good
place to be.

51:54.211 --> 51:59.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The Aquarius is
due to return
to sea tomorrow.

51:59.116 --> 52:02.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Sicily.

52:02.953 --> 52:07.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You can watch
