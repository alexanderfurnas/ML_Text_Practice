JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.840 --> 00:11.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: death
from above.
The Obama administration makes
public the

00:11.678 --> 00:18.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of inadvertent civilian
deaths from
U.S. airstrikes amid heated
debate and scrutiny.

00:18.318 --> 00:24.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, we report from London on
how the Brexit
vote has immigrants in Britain
feeling increasingly

00:24.892 --> 00:26.593 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unwelcome.

00:26.627 --> 00:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARIA PLUSZCZOK, Business Owner:
I was in
a train station and a guy was
like, the lift

00:30.631 --> 00:34.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not working because of you
foreigners.
Go back to your country.

00:34.701 --> 00:40.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields
and Ramesh Ponnuru take on the
uproar over

00:40.340 --> 00:45.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton's e-mail
investigation and
Donald Trump's seizure of the
trade issue,

00:45.846 --> 00:48.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all part of a full week of news.

00:48.415 --> 00:54.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.321 --> 00:58.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:45.806 --> 01:51.011 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:51.011 --> 01:55.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

02:13.900 --> 02:20.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Islamic State
group is
claiming responsibility for an
attack tonight

02:20.540 --> 02:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Islamic State
group is
claiming responsibility for an
attack tonight

03:14.061 --> 03:21.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at an upscale restaurant in
Bangladesh. Authorities
say up to nine gunmen took at
least 35 hostages

03:21.501 --> 03:28.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Dhaka, the capital, including
some 20 foreigners.
At least 26 people were wounded,
and two police

03:28.141 --> 03:30.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
officers were killed.

03:30.377 --> 03:35.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Security forces mounted a siege
of the site
as the night went on. The head
of an elite

03:35.348 --> 03:39.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anti-crime unit said they were
working to
save the hostages.

03:39.853 --> 03:44.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's state-run news agency
reports that
police have identified two of
the three suicide

03:44.891 --> 03:51.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombers in Tuesday's airport
attack in Istanbul.
The alleged mastermind of the
plot, who remains

03:51.298 --> 03:56.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at large, is described as an
extremist from
the Russian province of
Chechnya.

03:56.536 --> 04:01.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, security was
heightened at the
Istanbul Airport today, and
officials from

04:01.842 --> 04:07.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign consulates paid their
respects to
the 44 people who died in the
attacks.

04:07.881 --> 04:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A warning today from the leader
of al-Qaida,
Ayman Al-Zawahri. In an online
video message,

04:13.820 --> 04:19.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he threatens -- quote -- "the
gravest consequences"
if the surviving Boston Marathon
bomber is

04:19.926 --> 04:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
executed. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was
sentenced
last year to death by lethal
injection. The

04:26.233 --> 04:28.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2013 bombing left three people.

04:28.969 --> 04:34.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. Attorney General Loretta
Lynch voiced
regret today about a meeting
earlier this

04:34.040 --> 04:39.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week with former President Bill
Clinton. They
spoke Monday for about 30
minutes after his

04:39.779 --> 04:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
private plane landed near her
government aircraft
at the Phoenix Airport.

04:44.818 --> 04:51.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It stoked criticism because the
FBI is investigating
Hillary Clinton's e-mail
practices as secretary

04:51.358 --> 04:53.126 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of state.

04:53.160 --> 04:57.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, in Aspen, Colorado, Lynch
repeated
that she and the former
president never discussed

04:58.031 --> 05:01.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the investigation, but she said
she understands
the criticism.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: I may
have viewed it in a certain
light, but the

05:03.570 --> 05:07.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue is, how does it impact the
work that
I do and the work the Department
of Justice

05:07.908 --> 05:14.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does? And I certainly wouldn't
do it again,
and -- because I think it has
cast a shadow

05:14.514 --> 05:17.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over what it shouldn't, over
what it will
not touch.

05:17.284 --> 05:23.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lynch also said
she plans to
accept whatever recommendations
career FBI

05:23.323 --> 05:25.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
investigators make.

05:25.091 --> 05:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton's
presidential
campaign had no comment on the
meeting. But

05:29.196 --> 05:34.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Denver today, Republican
candidate Donald
Trump hammered away at both
Clinton and her

05:34.701 --> 05:36.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
husband, the former president.

05:36.436 --> 05:39.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I think he really opened it up.
He opened

05:39.606 --> 05:46.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up a Pandora's box, and it shows
what's going
on. And it shows what's
happening with our

05:46.513 --> 05:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
laws and with our government.

05:49.015 --> 05:54.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A spokesman for
President Obama
said today the Clinton e-mail
investigation

05:54.254 --> 05:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is entirely independent of the
White House.

05:57.891 --> 06:02.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain's prospects of a quick
exit from the
European Union grew cloudier
today. A leader

06:02.996 --> 06:08.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Brexit campaign said the
process might
not begin until next year if
he's elected

06:08.969 --> 06:14.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conservative Party leader and
prime minister.
Michael Gove said it will take
some time to

06:14.441 --> 06:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
invoke the E.U.'s Article 50,
which formally
begins a two-year exit process.

06:19.779 --> 06:23.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GOVE, U.K. Parliament
Member: I would
only trigger it after extensive
preliminary

06:23.049 --> 06:27.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
talks of the kind that I
discussed earlier,
so I have no expectation that
Article 50 would

06:27.787 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be triggered in this calendar
year. I argued
for specific changes in the
referendum campaign.

06:32.525 --> 06:35.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe in those changes. I
will deliver
them.

06:35.128 --> 06:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Britain's finance
minister, George Osborne,
announced that leaving

06:39.699 --> 06:45.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the E.U. will cut government
revenue, so he's
giving up on the goal of
reaching a budget

06:45.171 --> 06:47.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surplus by 2020.

06:47.874 --> 06:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amid the Brexit fallout, Britain
and France
came together to mark 100 years
since the

06:53.313 --> 06:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Battle of the Somme in World War
I. It was
one of the bloodiest in history,
as the armies

06:58.485 --> 07:04.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the British and French
empires faced off
against the Germans. One million
died over

07:04.157 --> 07:09.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five months. Leaders from both
countries met
today at a memorial in France.
The ceremony

07:09.896 --> 07:15.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
included cannon fire and flowers
laid at soldiers'
graves.

07:15.135 --> 07:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China today celebrated the 95th
anniversary
of the ruling Communist Party's
birth. President

07:20.507 --> 07:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Xi Jinping urged the party to
return to its
Marxist roots. He addressed
party members

07:25.578 --> 07:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Beijing's Great Hall of the
People, and
said corruption is now the
biggest threat

07:30.583 --> 07:32.485 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the party faces.

07:32.519 --> 07:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
XI JINPING, Chinese President
(through translator):
We must have a staunch will and
not let up

07:36.323 --> 07:41.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on our zero tolerance attitude.
We must investigate
all cases and punish those who
are corrupt,

07:41.728 --> 07:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to give corrupt elements no
place to hide
in the party.

07:44.698 --> 07:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
thousands turned
out in Hong Kong on the 19th
anniversary of

07:49.336 --> 07:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that city's return to Chinese
rule. They denounced
Beijing for kidnapping local
booksellers who

07:56.009 --> 07:59.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sold critical works about
Chinese leaders.

07:59.112 --> 08:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new Mississippi law involving
gay marriage
and transgender bathroom policy
is now on

08:05.452 --> 08:10.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hold. It was set to take effect
today, but
a federal judge blocked it. The
statute allows

08:10.757 --> 08:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
businesses and government
employees to cite
religious objections in refusing
services

08:16.563 --> 08:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for same-sex marriages. It also
could affect
school bathroom policy. The
state plans to

08:22.736 --> 08:24.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
appeal.

08:24.604 --> 08:30.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, stocks managed
modest gains,
to keep up a four-day comeback
from the Brexit

08:30.477 --> 08:37.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
meltdown. The Dow Jones
industrial average
was up 19 points to close at
17949. The Nasdaq

08:37.650 --> 08:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rose nearly 20 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added
four.

08:42.589 --> 08:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a visibly cleaner Roman
Coliseum was unveiled
today, 2,000 years after it
hosted gladiator

08:50.029 --> 08:55.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fights. The ancient site had
been covered
with grime and pollution over
the centuries.

08:55.568 --> 09:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took workers three years to
remove the
dirt, using water and brushes.
The next phase

09:01.040 --> 09:04.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
involves restoring the
Coliseum's interior.

09:05.011 --> 09:10.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a White House
response to the human cost of
drone strikes;

09:10.784 --> 09:17.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tens of thousands displaced as
an ISIS-held
city in Iraq is freed; growing
fears on the

09:17.357 --> 09:30.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of immigrants in Brexit's
aftermath;
and much more.

09:30.203 --> 09:37.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the Obama administration
revealed new
information that sheds light on
the reality

09:37.377 --> 09:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of modern warfare, the number of
civilians
accidentally killed in U.S.
airstrikes.

09:43.650 --> 09:45.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

09:45.485 --> 09:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today's release is
the first time
the White House has said how
many terrorists

09:49.789 --> 09:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and innocent civilians it
believes have been
killed by airstrikes, including
by drones.

09:55.562 --> 10:02.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Between 2009 and 2015, the
administration
says it launched 473 airstrikes
in Pakistan,

10:02.902 --> 10:04.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yemen and Africa.

10:04.771 --> 10:13.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It estimates that as many as
2,581 combatants,
and as many as 116 noncombatants
were killed.

10:13.513 --> 10:18.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, these numbers do not
include airstrikes
in Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria,
what the administration

10:18.885 --> 10:21.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
calls areas of active
hostilities.

10:21.287 --> 10:26.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new executive order has also
been issued,
with the aim of decreasing the
number of civilian

10:26.292 --> 10:28.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deaths.

10:28.127 --> 10:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get two views on all this
Sarah Holewinski.
She was recently with the U.S.
mission to

10:32.432 --> 10:37.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United Nations. And before
that, she was
the executive director of the
Center for Civilians

10:37.637 --> 10:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Conflict, an advocacy group
that seeks
to reduce the number of civilian
casualties.

10:42.876 --> 10:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Naureen Shah is the director
of the Security
and Human Rights Program at
Amnesty International

10:48.181 --> 10:49.249 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
USA.

10:49.282 --> 10:51.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sarah, Naureen, thank you both
for joining
us.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Naureen, let me start with you.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first time these numbers
have been released,
what do you make of these
numbers?

10:56.022 --> 10:58.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NAUREEN SHAH, Amnesty
International USA: Well,
this is a remarkable shift.

10:58.324 --> 11:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been asking for exactly
these numbers
for years. But the numbers are
extremely low,

11:03.596 --> 11:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they come along with a claim
of extraordinary
precision. For the people whose
cases Amnesty

11:09.736 --> 11:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
International has documented,
it's anything
but precise.

11:12.639 --> 11:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking about kids struck
by shrapnel,
a woman killed in front of her
grandchildren,

11:18.545 --> 11:23.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families losing breadwinners.
These are names.
They're individuals. They're not
numbers.

11:23.182 --> 11:26.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we need to hear more
acknowledgment from
the Obama administration of
that.

11:26.586 --> 11:30.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I should say, the
Obama administration
acknowledges that these numbers
are estimates.

11:30.223 --> 11:35.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They say that the NGOs,
non-government organizations,
like yours actually have more
access to research

11:36.029 --> 11:37.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these numbers.

11:37.931 --> 11:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Sarah, the policy has been
and will continue
to be that no airstrikes if
there's a near

11:45.238 --> 11:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainty that a noncombatant
would be killed.
But we have, on average, out of
these airstrikes,

11:52.946 --> 11:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one in every four of these
airstrikes has
claimed a noncombatant life.
What does that

11:57.383 --> 12:02.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say about this system and the
precision that
Naureen was talking about of the
system?

12:02.722 --> 12:04.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH HOLEWINSKI, Former
Executive Director,
Center for Civilians in
Conflict: Yes, precision

12:04.190 --> 12:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is a really tricky thing.

12:06.459 --> 12:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Precision means that you are
hitting the thing
that you think you're going to
hit. I am going

12:11.564 --> 12:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to hit this folder. I am going
to hit this
glass of water. It doesn't mean
that that

12:17.303 --> 12:21.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
folder or the glass of water is
actually the
thing that we think it is.

12:21.107 --> 12:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if you are striking from the
air with a
drone, for example, you may be
hitting a person

12:26.179 --> 12:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you thought was something,
but is actually
something else. And sometimes
those are civilians.

12:30.350 --> 12:34.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And also today, we
have an executive
order laying out policy, setting
in policy

12:34.954 --> 12:41.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the first time how the
United States is
going to carry out these attacks
in the war

12:41.094 --> 12:42.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on terrorists.

12:42.495 --> 12:46.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Naureen, what do you make of
this new policy,
the new executive order?

12:46.199 --> 12:48.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NAUREEN SHAH: It's extremely
important.

12:48.267 --> 12:52.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a lot of commitments
in this executive
order that can help us move away
from an unaccountable

12:52.772 --> 12:57.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drone killing program that's
really meant
that we were on a battlefield,
where the United

12:57.744 --> 13:01.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
States was claiming the
authority to kill
in secret and with impunity.

13:01.681 --> 13:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have to see from the
Obama administration
is that they start to make good
on those commitments,

13:05.451 --> 13:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that includes acknowledging
particular
people killed. That's in the
executive order,

13:09.122 --> 13:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's remarkable. But we have
to see the
administration follow through on
that and

13:13.159 --> 13:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just leave this at the end
of the conversation.

13:15.561 --> 13:17.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sarah, what's new in
this order?

13:17.697 --> 13:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HOLEWINSKI: There are
actually quite
a few new things.

13:20.099 --> 13:24.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, first and foremost, I want
Americans to
know that we are the only
country, America

13:24.237 --> 13:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the only country to have a
policy like
this on civilian protection.
That's pretty

13:29.042 --> 13:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remarkable. And we haven't had
it before.
So that's the newest thing about
this.

13:33.680 --> 13:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the executive order is
about just
enforcing best practices that
the U.S. military

13:38.785 --> 13:43.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been doing for a number of
years. But
the new thing, the new several
things, include,

13:43.990 --> 13:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, working with our
partners, so
allies and partners, Nigerian
military, Burmese

13:50.196 --> 13:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military, you know, militaries
that we're
equipping and supporting around
the world,

13:54.367 --> 13:58.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make sure that they are also
paying attention
to civilian protection and
learning the lessons

13:58.504 --> 14:00.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that America did.

14:00.373 --> 14:04.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We also have this very
boring-sounding thing
called an interagency working
group that comes

14:04.911 --> 14:09.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out of this. It may be
boring-sounding, but
that's exactly how you make
progress within

14:09.582 --> 14:11.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. government.

14:11.384 --> 14:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Naureen, what are the
measures?
What are you going to look for
to tell whether

14:15.254 --> 14:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
progress is being made in this?

14:17.090 --> 14:20.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAUREEN SHAH: We're going the
look for whether
the Obama administration breaks
the silence

14:20.193 --> 14:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on people who are killed in
drone strikes,
that they identify civilians,
but who aren't

14:24.397 --> 14:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans. And it's actually
astounding that
at this point several years into
the Obama

14:28.367 --> 14:33.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration they have never
specifically
named an individual who was
Pakistani or Somali

14:33.606 --> 14:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or Yemeni who was a civilian.

14:35.775 --> 14:39.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a double standard here.
We have seen
American civilians and an
Italian civilian

14:39.746 --> 14:43.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who was named, but not a
Pakistani civilian
or a Yemeni. And that double
standard has

14:43.282 --> 14:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to end. I think that's in the
executive order.
I think we are going to have to
press the

14:46.719 --> 14:51.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama administration to make
good on its aspirations
and its clear commitments.

14:51.157 --> 14:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sarah, another part
of this executive
order is it says that, every
year, the administration

14:56.162 --> 15:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to put out the numbers
that they
put out today, the number of
combatants and

15:00.399 --> 15:04.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also noncombatants killed by
airstrikes.

15:04.437 --> 15:11.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the first one is due May 1.
The president
won't -- the Obama
administration won't be

15:11.077 --> 15:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there May 1. This executive
order could be
changed by the next president.
So what does

15:16.549 --> 15:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this really mean? What is really
going on?

15:18.985 --> 15:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH HOLEWINSKI: Well, it's an
amazing step
from this administration to have
a uniform

15:23.022 --> 15:24.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
policy on civilian protection.

15:24.924 --> 15:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not as worried about it
being an executive
order. I think that was the way
that President

15:29.862 --> 15:33.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama felt like he could make
the biggest
impact on this issue that he
cares about a

15:33.533 --> 15:39.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot. The next president that
comes in will
have a fight on his or her hands
if they think

15:39.238 --> 15:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they are going to get rid
of this executive
order, certainly from, I hope,
the American

15:43.242 --> 15:47.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public, but also from civil
society and also
from allies around the world who
are taking

15:48.014 --> 15:51.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this as a sign of U.S.
leadership and are
glad to see it.

15:51.551 --> 15:55.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Naureen, are you
concerned the
fact that they break out these
numbers, that

15:55.421 --> 16:00.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they aren't telling us what's
going on in
what they call the areas of
active hostilities,

16:00.560 --> 16:02.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Iraq, in Afghanistan, in
Syria?

16:02.662 --> 16:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAUREEN SHAH: Well, what we're
really concerned
about is the administration
providing some

16:07.400 --> 16:11.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
numbers and that being the end
of the conversation.
It needs to be the start of a
conversation,

16:11.704 --> 16:16.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that we don't have this
sanitized view.
It can't be that you provide a
data dump and

16:16.909 --> 16:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then that's the end of the
inquiry.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need Congress to be asking
questions about
not only these numbers, but
numbers of people

16:22.682 --> 16:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are being killed in Iraq and
Syria and
other places. And we just need a
lot more

16:26.252 --> 16:30.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scrutiny over the way the U.S.
uses lethal
force and the way that every
government uses

16:30.122 --> 16:34.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lethal force. There has just
been a record
of people being able to kill
civilians and

16:34.327 --> 16:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others without accountability,
and it's something
that we see across the word.

16:37.697 --> 16:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I guess, also, the
question, also,
Sarah, is, are these airstrikes
with drones

16:43.269 --> 16:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and with manned aircraft, are
these effective
ways of fighting terror?

16:46.539 --> 16:50.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH HOLEWINSKI: It's one way
of fighting
terror. It's certainly not going
to counter

16:51.010 --> 16:53.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
terrorism everywhere.

16:53.379 --> 16:57.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's important about the
numbers that
were released today and this
executive order

16:58.017 --> 17:03.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that it is one step toward
the American
public and the Obama
administration and whatever

17:03.055 --> 17:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration comes next to
understanding
what the impact and efficiency
of those drone

17:08.694 --> 17:10.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strikes are.

17:10.463 --> 17:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We currently don't know. What is
the impact
on population? Now we're getting
to the point

17:14.600 --> 17:17.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where we're having that
discussion. It's a
very important discussion to
have.

17:17.503 --> 17:18.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Very good.

17:18.838 --> 17:22.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sarah Holewinski, Naureen Shah,
thank you
for coming in today.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SARAH HOLEWINSKI: Thank you.

17:24.477 --> 17:30.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thanks.

17:30.516 --> 17:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to Iraq, and
an exclusive
look at the Iraqi city of
Fallujah, from the

17:38.958 --> 17:43.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
side of Iraqi troops who
reclaimed it from
ISIS militants this week.

17:43.763 --> 17:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even with the government
victory, thousands
of people now languish in the
summer desert

17:49.168 --> 17:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heat, with almost nothing to
sustain them.

17:52.305 --> 17:54.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Jane Arraf
reports.

17:54.640 --> 18:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: This is Fallujah the
morning Iraqi
security forces took back the
city from ISIS.

18:01.380 --> 18:07.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Months before ISIS declared an
Islamic State
in Mosul two years ago, it
seized this city.

18:07.853 --> 18:14.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iraqi security forces, backed by
U.S. airstrikes,
recaptured Fallujah. It took a
month of fighting.

18:14.160 --> 18:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. tried to make sure
Iraq's Shia militias
backed by Iran were kept on the
sidelines

18:20.366 --> 18:22.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the battle for this Sunni
city.

18:22.668 --> 18:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as Iraqi government forces
moved on after
securing the Jolan neighborhood,
militia fighters

18:28.874 --> 18:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moved in. They scrawled graffiti
on walls
to make sure everyone knew they
were there,

18:33.813 --> 18:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and in some places insults,
accusing Fallujah
of being in bed with ISIS.

18:39.118 --> 18:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Don't take pictures of this," a
fighter tells
us, near a burning house. They
tell us to

18:44.690 --> 18:48.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go back to the Iraqi special
forces we have
come to see.

18:48.094 --> 18:49.628 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: PBS.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: PBS.

18:51.597 --> 18:57.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: U.S.-trained Iraqi
special forces
led the assault into the south
side of Fallujah.

18:57.470 --> 19:03.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First Sergeant Amar Ahmed Jassim
says the
elite forces are grateful for
their U.S. training.

19:03.943 --> 19:08.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1ST SGT. AMAR AHMED JASSIM, Iraq
(through
translator): America, since the
fall of Saddam

19:08.080 --> 19:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until now, has not abandoned
Iraq. Up until
now, they provide air support.
After all,

19:13.686 --> 19:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are our friends. They won't
abandon us.

19:15.888 --> 19:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Although the main
battle is over,
Iraqi helicopters are still
attacking remaining

19:20.659 --> 19:22.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ISIS fighters.

19:22.595 --> 19:28.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is just a couple of hours
after Iraqi
security forces have declared
Fallujah completely

19:28.367 --> 19:34.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liberated. Two weeks ago, they
said they had
taken back complete control of
the city, but

19:34.140 --> 19:39.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's clear that there have been
still large
pockets of ISIS fighters.

19:39.378 --> 19:43.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also clear that, even
though the city
has been spared a lot of the
destruction of

19:43.215 --> 19:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ramadi, the provincial capital,
there are
still neighborhoods that are
heavily damaged.

19:50.489 --> 19:56.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city is empty. ISIS had kept
more than
80,000 civilians as human
shields. They fled

19:56.762 --> 20:03.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when ISIS withdrew. The only
civilian we see
is Bushra Daud. There hasn't
been electricity

20:03.602 --> 20:08.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or running water here for months
and there's
hardly any food. She can't
explain why she

20:08.674 --> 20:10.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stayed.

20:10.409 --> 20:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS controlled Fallujah for two
years, running
a city of almost 100,000 people.
"We wage

20:16.649 --> 20:21.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
jihad to dedicate the region to
Allah," they
wrote in this public square.

20:21.921 --> 20:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighter Ali Sami Hadi tells us
the bridge
above is now dedicated to a
wounded Iraqi

20:27.460 --> 20:29.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
soldier hanged by ISIS.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALI SAMI HADI, Iraq (through
translator):
ISIS slaughtered those who
opposed them or

20:32.731 --> 20:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wouldn't join them. Here was
their court,
and this was their execution
site.

20:37.169 --> 20:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Celebratory gunfire
rings out
across the city, and fighters
who clearly

20:42.641 --> 20:45.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aren't professional soldiers
flood the streets.

20:45.277 --> 20:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abur Rah (ph), the fighter from
Basra, has
borrowed a bicycle. As dusk
falls, Prime Minister

20:52.818 --> 20:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Haider al-Abadi arrives for a
victory tour.

20:55.154 --> 21:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi Prime
Minister: This
was quite a challenge, but we
were prepared

21:00.759 --> 21:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the outside. Once we broke
their defenses,
it was easy to move in.

21:06.999 --> 21:12.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Fallujah looms large
in the history
of the Iraq War. Abadi notes the
American

21:12.571 --> 21:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military suffered many of its
casualties here
in 2004. He says reconciliation
with the country's

21:19.445 --> 21:24.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sunni population, and giving
more power to
the provinces, is the only way
forward.

21:24.984 --> 21:27.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Asked about the militias, he
tells us:

21:27.953 --> 21:35.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAIDER AL-ABADI: The militia is
-- I think
that they were providing some
support to the

21:36.028 --> 21:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal police in the sense of
equipment.
And if you look around, all
these forces are

21:44.637 --> 21:47.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really good forces in Fallujah.

21:47.306 --> 21:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Nearby, a commander
of the mostly
Shia paramilitary forces is
mobbed by supporters.

21:53.979 --> 22:01.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis is on the
U.S. list
of wanted terrorists. Here, he
is a celebrity.

22:01.287 --> 22:06.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tells us his forces refuse to
be kept out
of the much bigger fight ahead
in Mosul.

22:06.292 --> 22:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABU MAHDI AL-MUHANDIS, Iraq
(through translator):
We gave thousands of martyrs as
casualties

22:11.330 --> 22:15.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of the bomb factories in
Fallujah
and Mosul. We will go to Mosul,
and we will

22:15.935 --> 22:17.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meet in Mosul, God willing.

22:17.736 --> 22:21.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: It's an important
victory for
the Iraqi government and an
important step

22:21.874 --> 22:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in pushing back ISIS. But it has
come at a
cost. Everyone who lived under
ISIS has come

22:28.013 --> 22:34.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under suspicion. Iraq security
forces have
detained for investigation
20,000 men and

22:34.720 --> 22:39.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boys who fled the city. They are
still holding
9,000 of them.

22:39.425 --> 22:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An American organization has
arrived with
its Iraqi partner to deliver aid
to some of

22:45.097 --> 22:50.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those held at a detention center
three hours
from Baghdad. But officials say
they will

22:50.469 --> 22:55.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confiscate the toothbrushes
which can be used
to stab people. And they're
afraid some will

22:55.274 --> 22:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hang themselves with the towels.

22:57.509 --> 23:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Tell my family I love them,"
says this man.

23:04.250 --> 23:09.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another says the militias handed
him over
to the Iraqi army 15 days ago
over a personal

23:09.455 --> 23:12.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quarrel. Samir Salman has been
here much longer.

23:12.758 --> 23:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMIR SALMAN, Detainee (through
translator):
I have been here for seven
months. I know

23:16.161 --> 23:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nothing about my family. They
brought me from
Baghdad to here, and I don't
know why.

23:20.766 --> 23:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: Day after day in
desolate camps
in the desert, families wait for
news of their

23:25.137 --> 23:31.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
husbands and fathers. More than
30,000 of
the 80,000 civilians who fled
the city two

23:31.443 --> 23:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks ago have ended up here,
near the town
of Amiriyah al-Fallujah.

23:37.549 --> 23:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A day after the Iraqi government
announced
it retook the city, we can't
find anyone who

23:41.687 --> 23:47.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has heard the news. There is no
electricity
here. There isn't even enough
water or toilets.

23:47.559 --> 23:52.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there are few aid
organizations. U.N.
officials say the U.S. is
focusing on the

23:52.965 --> 23:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military fight against ISIS,
while underfunding
humanitarian aid.

23:58.671 --> 24:04.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Norwegian Refugee Council,
the NRC, is
one of the few international
organizations

24:04.777 --> 24:07.246 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

24:07.279 --> 24:10.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Regional director Carsten Hansen
says it's
a catastrophe.

24:10.215 --> 24:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARSTEN HANSEN, Norwegian
Refugee Council:
Horrible. So, for us, it's --
first of all,

24:14.720 --> 24:21.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we would like and we are
appealing to our
colleagues in the NGO community
and the U.N.,

24:21.060 --> 24:22.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we need to scale up.

24:22.995 --> 24:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: On this day, they
are distributing
mattresses, but there aren't
enough for everyone.

24:27.933 --> 24:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are some of the people who
didn't get
the mattresses. They either live
in other

24:32.738 --> 24:38.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
camps or are they aren't
registered or they
don't know how or register. A
lot of the them

24:38.577 --> 24:43.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are here without their husbands
or sons, who
are being investigated for ties
to ISIS.

24:43.582 --> 24:48.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's left thousands of women
and children
here in these camps. This is
said to be one

24:48.887 --> 24:53.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the better ones, actually.
Today is the
first time a lot of them are
getting mattresses.

24:53.125 --> 24:58.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And up until now, they have
actually been
sleeping on the ground in the
sand and the

24:58.430 --> 25:00.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dust and the heat.

25:00.299 --> 25:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the people here paid
ISIS everything
they had to leave the city. They
were already

25:05.003 --> 25:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poor and now they have nothing
left. The Iraqi
government considers them
potential security

25:10.342 --> 25:15.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threats and won't let even those
with relatives
in Baghdad leave the province.

25:15.247 --> 25:21.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hakeem Yassin is livid. He
insists we follow
him to see his tent.

25:21.687 --> 25:27.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Come with me," he says. "Look,
there's no
water. There's nothing."

25:27.359 --> 25:33.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He says corrupt Iraqi
businesspeople are making
money from these desolate camps.

25:33.532 --> 25:40.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mustafa Ahmed is one of those
who didn't get
a mattress. He was a baby during
the 2004

25:40.205 --> 25:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
battle for Fallujah, when he was
badly wounded
by shrapnel during a U.S. air
attack. He lost

25:45.644 --> 25:53.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a leg and a kidney. Four years
later, he was
taken to Oregon to be fitted
with a prosthetic

25:53.552 --> 25:56.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leg. But he's long outgrown it.

25:56.355 --> 26:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he and his family fled
Fallujah, he walked
eight miles on crutches. Here,
he can't even

26:01.794 --> 26:05.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get catheter tubes.

26:05.464 --> 26:12.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People here wait in misery just
20 miles from
Fallujah, unable to go forward
or return home.

26:12.771 --> 26:20.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Arraf.

26:20.045 --> 26:29.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:29.988 --> 26:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and Ramesh Ponnuru analyze this
week's news;

26:35.394 --> 26:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how Ernest Hemingway used other
people's bad
behavior to make a name for
himself; and the

26:41.366 --> 26:44.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
benefits of reading for fun.

26:44.036 --> 26:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Just days after the
British vote
to leave the European Union,
police in the

26:50.542 --> 26:56.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.K. announced an increase in
hate crime reports
against immigrants and
minorities.

26:56.815 --> 27:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anti-Muslim cartoon pamphlets
were distributed,
and a Muslim butcher was
firebombed near the

27:01.553 --> 27:07.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city of Birmingham. On streets
and public
transport across the country,
South Asians

27:07.125 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and other minorities are
reportedly being
told to -- quote -- "go home."

27:12.097 --> 27:16.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Polish immigrants are the
largest group of
E.U. citizens in the U.K. They
have also come

27:16.668 --> 27:18.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under attack in recent days.

27:18.971 --> 27:22.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan was in London,
and he filed
this report.

27:22.374 --> 27:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This section
of London,
known as Hammersmith has always
been a hub

27:26.678 --> 27:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Polish immigrants. The
Polish deli opened
up a few years ago, serving up a
slice of

27:31.984 --> 27:33.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

27:33.785 --> 27:37.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Daria Pluszczok's parents own
this business.
Xenophobic attacks in the
aftermath of the

27:37.656 --> 27:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brexit vote has the 22-year-old
anxious, so
anxious, she asked us not to
show her face.

27:43.295 --> 27:46.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARIA PLUSZCZOK, Business Owner:
I have loads
of customers that are coming in,
and telling

27:46.899 --> 27:51.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us they're a bit afraid now,
they're a bit
scared of coming out and
speaking Polish on

27:51.336 --> 27:55.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
roads and someone maybe
attacking them or
being rude to them.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Daria knows
the feeling
firsthand.

27:57.342 --> 28:02.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARIA PLUSZCZOK: I was in a
train station
and a guy was like, the lift is
not working

28:02.748 --> 28:05.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because of you foreigners. Go
back to your
country.

28:05.951 --> 28:10.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sentiments
that are being
expressed more post-Brexit vote.

28:10.155 --> 28:15.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Huntingdon, an 11-year-old
boy found one
of several leaflets sent
throughout the town,

28:15.093 --> 28:17.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying, "Polish vermin, go
home."

28:17.829 --> 28:23.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Portsmouth, this was
spray-painted behind
a war memorial. In Hammersmith,
London, just

28:23.902 --> 28:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down the road from the Polish
deli, someone
vandalized the front of the
Polish Social

28:28.040 --> 28:30.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Cultural Association.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We sat down with director Joanna
Mludzinska.

28:31.910 --> 28:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA MLUDZINSKA, Director,
Polish Social
Cultural Association: They
immediately started

28:33.745 --> 28:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to scrub this message out,
because, obviously,
we didn't want all our visitors
coming in

28:38.750 --> 28:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all day to be confronted with
this message.

28:41.219 --> 28:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What did it
say?

28:42.988 --> 28:47.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNA MLUDZINSKA: I don't
really want to
repeat the exact words, but you
can imagine.

28:47.059 --> 28:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the basic message was, get
out, but fairly
graphic. It was the first time
we have ever

28:52.898 --> 28:58.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had anything like this. Yes, I
suppose you
have to draw the conclusion that
something

28:58.503 --> 29:04.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- something has been set free
with this referendum
decision.

29:05.010 --> 29:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Since the
vandalism, there
has been an outpouring of
support toward the

29:10.182 --> 29:15.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center from well-wishers. Police
are investigating.
The mayor has asked for
vigilance. Even Prime

29:15.854 --> 29:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister David Cameron mentioned
it in his
first significant address to the
House of

29:19.825 --> 29:21.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Commons since the vote.

29:21.727 --> 29:23.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: We
have seen verbal abuse hurled
against individuals

29:23.862 --> 29:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're members of
ethnic minorities.
Let's remember, these people
have come here

29:28.033 --> 29:34.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and made a wonderful
contribution to our country.
We will not stand for hate crime
or these

29:34.640 --> 29:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kinds of attacks. They must be
stamped out.

29:37.342 --> 29:42.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jakub Krupa
works as the
Polish Press Agency's U.K.
correspondent.

29:42.648 --> 29:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says part of the reason Poles
are being
targeted comes down to numbers.

29:46.385 --> 29:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAKUB KRUPA, Polish Press
Agency: You have
850,000 Poles in the U.K., which
is a significant

29:50.422 --> 29:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group. When you think that three
million people
are coming from the E.U. living
in the U.K.,

29:56.695 --> 29:58.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every third migrant from the
European Union
is Polish.

29:58.930 --> 30:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Part of the
tension springs
from the community's rapid
growth.

30:02.668 --> 30:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAKUB KRUPA: Twelve years ago,
before Poland
joined the European Union, there
were only

30:07.673 --> 30:12.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50,000 people. You have 800,000
people coming
to the U.K. over the last 12
years.

30:12.344 --> 30:16.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Poland and
Britain have
a long history together, going
back to World

30:16.381 --> 30:20.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
War II, when Polish airmen aided
in the battle
for Britain.

30:20.852 --> 30:25.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suresh Grover is tracking the
most recent
battle. He works for The
Monitoring Group,

30:25.223 --> 30:28.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a 35-year-old civil rights
anti-racism organization.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SURESH GROVER, The Monitoring
Group: The Muslim
Council, for example, has
reported over 200

30:31.329 --> 30:38.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calls to the government, mosques
being picketed
by people. We have had reports
of people coming

30:38.937 --> 30:44.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out on the streets in Newcastle
with T-shirts
saying, "Now that we have won,
send them back."

30:44.676 --> 30:49.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Grover says 90
percent of
these incidents are never
reported to the

30:49.948 --> 30:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police. He blames the leave
campaign's immigrant
scapegoating for the expressions
of nativist

30:54.720 --> 30:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anger and immigrant fears.

30:56.421 --> 31:01.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SURESH GROVER: Racism that used
to be meted
out because of the color of your
skin now

31:01.626 --> 31:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transferred, not color-coded, to
other people
because they're products of a
globalized world

31:06.732 --> 31:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coming in and taking their
markets.

31:08.633 --> 31:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After the
vote, Nigel Farage,
who leads the anti-E.U. U.K.
Independence

31:13.739 --> 31:18.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Party, said the strain
immigrants put on every
system, from the economy to
health care to

31:18.910 --> 31:22.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
education, is something the
remain voters
don't understand.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NIGEL FARAGE, European
Parliament Member:
They don't get what open-door
mass immigration

31:25.517 --> 31:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a result of E.U. membership
has done to
people's wages, to people's
availability of

31:31.656 --> 31:37.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting G.P. appointments, or
their kids into
local schools. This was the
issue ultimately

31:37.195 --> 31:38.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that won this election.

31:39.030 --> 31:43.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The spark that
lit the racist
fire may have been economic, but
Grover says

31:43.602 --> 31:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the flames can spread, consuming
vast parts
of British society.

31:47.239 --> 31:53.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SURESH GROVER: The residue of
this nationalism,
it's not just patriotic -- it's
nationalism

31:54.012 --> 31:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
towards the right -- lasts for a
long time,
and the damage is done for a
long time.

31:59.518 --> 32:03.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Beginning with
a sense of
injustice for people like Daria
Pluszczok.

32:03.121 --> 32:06.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You think that Polish citizens
are second-class
citizens here?

32:06.691 --> 32:07.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DARIA PLUSZCZOK: Yes.

32:07.492 --> 32:09.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Why?

32:09.261 --> 32:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARIA PLUSZCZOK: I don't think
we're just
being treated equally at all. I
don't know.

32:14.299 --> 32:15.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's just my opinion.

32:15.734 --> 32:24.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
Hari Sreenivasan, London.

32:24.776 --> 32:35.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to our
wrap of the
week's political news, from the
new cloud

32:35.420 --> 32:40.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hanging over an investigation
into Hillary
Clinton's e-mail practices to
Donald Trump's

32:40.792 --> 32:42.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
latest take on trade.

32:42.661 --> 32:47.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We turn to the analysis of
Shields and Ponnuru.
That is syndicated columnist
Mark Shields,

32:47.499 --> 32:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and "National Review" senior
editor Ramesh
Ponnuru. David Brooks is away.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy.

32:55.841 --> 32:59.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's start out,
though, with
what happened today, the
attorney general

32:59.110 --> 33:03.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States, Loretta
Lynch, saying
that she wouldn't do it again,
wouldn't have

33:03.181 --> 33:08.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a meeting like the one she had
earlier in
the week with former President
Bill Clinton.

33:08.220 --> 33:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark, Loretta Lynch said,
wouldn't do it again.
And she said now she accepts the
recommendation,

33:15.193 --> 33:19.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
she will accept the
recommendation of the
FBI director, won't make any
changes.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much damage to Hillary
Clinton from this?

33:21.600 --> 33:27.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, we will find
out. That's
to be determined, but the damage
to Bill Clinton's

33:27.105 --> 33:33.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judgment, to Loretta Lynch's
judgment, the
attorney general, is
considerable.

33:33.311 --> 33:37.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just -- you know, Ben Bradlee,
the legendary
editor of The Washington Post,
said never

33:37.649 --> 33:42.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do anything that you can't
imagine being reported
the next day in The Washington
Post on the

33:42.888 --> 33:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front page above the fold. And
this is a perfect
example of that.

33:46.992 --> 33:54.132 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Bill Clinton, yes, he's
gregarious. His unlimited
self-confidence in his ability
to charm people

33:54.165 --> 33:58.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is deserved. He's one of the
probably -- most
charming people ever to walk the
planet. But

33:59.004 --> 34:06.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the misjudgment of his having a
meeting, a
private meeting with the
attorney general

34:06.645 --> 34:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
while the Justice Department is
investigating
his wife on these charges is
just unthinkable.

34:12.617 --> 34:15.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And where was her judgment in
saying, no,
Mr. President?

34:15.387 --> 34:16.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attorney
general.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're saying
it doesn't
hurt Hillary Clinton?

34:19.357 --> 34:21.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, it will be
determined.

34:21.293 --> 34:27.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have given the decision now
to James Comey,
the FBI director, completely. If
I'm not mistaken,

34:27.399 --> 34:34.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, at the time of David
Petraeus, the recommendation
was to prosecute him for felony,
and the attorney

34:34.739 --> 34:39.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general of the United States
then, Eric Holder,
intervened and said, no, this is
a misdemeanor,

34:39.544 --> 34:41.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it shouldn't be a felony.

34:41.579 --> 34:50.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, James Comey, his
independence, his integrity
has been firmly established in
practice by

34:50.555 --> 34:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standing up to the White House
of George W.
Bush that appointed him. So it
gives to him,

34:56.661 --> 35:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's it. And I don't think
anybody questions
his -- that he's a partisan.

35:02.500 --> 35:06.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ramesh, how do
you see this
affecting Hillary Clinton at
this point?

35:06.237 --> 35:11.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Well, Attorney
General Lynch
has said that she expects to
accept the FBI

35:11.843 --> 35:13.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recommendations.

35:13.511 --> 35:17.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a source close to her told
journalist
Mark Halperin that she still has
a chance

35:17.916 --> 35:22.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of overriding that
recommendation. I think
it would be very hard in these
political circumstances

35:22.954 --> 35:25.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for her to actually overrule it.

35:25.523 --> 35:30.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there's no indictment of
Hillary Clinton
following this investigation, I
think this

35:30.729 --> 35:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incident makes it easier for
Republicans to
say, well, that's because the
fix was in.

35:34.399 --> 35:40.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But in terms of
Loretta Lynch
saying today, I wouldn't do it
again, I'm

35:40.505 --> 35:44.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not going to let -- you're
saying Loretta
-- somebody close to Loretta
Lynch is saying

35:44.442 --> 35:48.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something different. She said
she's going
to accept the recommendation of
the FBI. You're

35:49.014 --> 35:51.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
saying, despite that...

35:51.416 --> 35:56.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: There are
conflicting reports
about how ironclad that
assurance is.

35:56.521 --> 35:58.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

35:58.289 --> 36:00.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: But, at the end
of the day,
the damage has already been done
to Hillary

36:00.158 --> 36:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton. Assuming that there is
no indictment,
the damage is that most
Americans don't regard

36:03.661 --> 36:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her as honest and trustworthy,
and that's
been something that has been an
anchor on

36:08.867 --> 36:10.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her poll numbers.

36:10.635 --> 36:12.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying
just no matter
what comes out of this FBI
investigation?

36:12.604 --> 36:16.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: I think that,
even if there
are not formal legal charge,
people have concluded

36:16.708 --> 36:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that she was not forthcoming.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the other
-- go ahead.

36:19.811 --> 36:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Just one quick
thing, Judy,
in that it reinforces the
narrative, the unflattering

36:23.915 --> 36:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
narrative about the Clintons,
that they don't
play by the same rules as
anybody else and

36:28.820 --> 36:30.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everybody else.

36:30.488 --> 36:36.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's a problem for
both the
president, but particularly for
Secretary

36:36.795 --> 36:38.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

36:38.663 --> 36:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this happens
the same week
that the House Republicans come
out with their

36:41.833 --> 36:47.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report on the Benghazi attack.
This is the
2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya.

36:47.839 --> 36:53.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They spent months looking into
this, Ramesh.
And it was thought that the
object of all

36:53.912 --> 36:59.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this was Hillary Clinton. The
report essentially
doesn't bring a lot of new
information about

36:59.150 --> 37:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her. It does harshly criticize
the administration
for not providing better
security there, though.

37:05.156 --> 37:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: That's right.

37:06.925 --> 37:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If people go into the report
looking for a
smoking gun about Hillary
Clinton, they're

37:10.795 --> 37:16.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be disappointed. But it
does provide
new detail on two things, first,
the security

37:16.601 --> 37:21.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failures in Benghazi and how
repeated warnings
about those failures and those
risks were

37:21.739 --> 37:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ignored, and, second, how the
administration
early on after the attacks put
out a public

37:28.246 --> 37:34.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
narrative about the relationship
of those
attacks to an anti-Muslim video
that it had

37:34.052 --> 37:35.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reason to believe wasn't true.

37:35.353 --> 37:36.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does it add
up to, Mark?

37:36.855 --> 37:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It adds up, Judy,
to a personal
tragedy.

37:39.290 --> 37:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anne Stevens, the ambassador's
sister, had
an interview with "The New
Yorker" this week

37:43.328 --> 37:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in which she essentially said
her brother
took the risk knowing the
security circumstances

37:51.169 --> 37:53.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
himself in Benghazi when he went
there.

37:53.138 --> 38:00.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think this is a story that
died on two
earlier occasions. The first was
when Hillary

38:00.178 --> 38:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton appeared before the
committee. I mean,
in a marathon session, she
absolutely dominated

38:05.083 --> 38:12.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them. She was far superior to
her interrogators.
She exposed them as shallow and
partisan.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she showed great command of
the facts.

38:14.826 --> 38:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second that was reinforced
by a then House
Majority -- House Majority
Leader Kevin McCarthy's

38:20.498 --> 38:25.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boast on FOX News that the
Benghazi committee
had knocked down her poll
numbers, and that

38:25.904 --> 38:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican House Caucus
deserved credit
for having created this
committee for that

38:31.276 --> 38:32.410 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
purpose.

38:32.443 --> 38:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this -- I just don't -- I
think the story
is over.

38:35.413 --> 38:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's a wash?

38:37.215 --> 38:39.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Yes, I don't
think there is
going to be a huge political
impact, except

38:39.584 --> 38:41.419 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on this.

38:41.452 --> 38:43.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is one reason, this whole
Benghazi story
is one reason that Hillary
Clinton can't run

38:43.721 --> 38:47.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on her accomplishment in Libya
when she was
secretary of state, which at one
point that

38:47.759 --> 38:48.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they had wanted to do.

38:48.893 --> 38:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Pretty tough to
run on Libya,
yes.

38:50.728 --> 38:52.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

38:52.564 --> 38:57.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, let's talk about Donald
Trump for a
minute. He's been speaking all
over the country

38:57.302 --> 39:02.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this week, Mark, on trade, and
talking about
American workers, and saying
that Democrats

39:02.907 --> 39:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- singling out Hillary Clinton,
but saying
Democrats across the board, and
he also singled

39:07.579 --> 39:13.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out the Chamber of Commerce,
which is typically
a friend of Republicans, and
saying they're

39:13.985 --> 39:18.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the tank, too, to this whole
idea of free
trade.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Right.

39:19.424 --> 39:21.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this a smart
strategy on
Donald Trump's part?

39:21.893 --> 39:23.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats ought to be grateful
that Donald
Trump has not been doing this
for the past

39:25.863 --> 39:30.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two months, that he's been
squandering his
time and goodwill by attacking a
federal judge's

39:30.969 --> 39:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heritage and things of that
importance, of
his personal -- or explaining
Trump institute

39:36.975 --> 39:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or Trump University or whatever
else.

39:40.211 --> 39:47.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is, Judy -- actually, it's
been a cornerstone
of Republican ideology a belief
in free trade.

39:47.952 --> 39:53.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the reality is that
Republican voters
now are more skeptical, as seen
in exit polls

39:53.625 --> 40:00.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this year, of free trade's
benefits, the liabilities,
the loss of jobs, rather than
creation of

40:00.765 --> 40:03.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
jobs, even more so than
Democratic voters.

40:03.635 --> 40:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So Donald Trump is going into
areas where
the manufacturing jobs have been
lost, where

40:10.275 --> 40:14.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is stagnation, where there
is very little
optimism about the future, where
people are

40:14.412 --> 40:18.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
underemployed, and he has an
explanation for
it, and he stands as the
anti-establishment

40:18.750 --> 40:20.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
figure.

40:20.585 --> 40:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's critical of Washington.
He's critical
of both parties. He's critical
of the Chamber

40:23.821 --> 40:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Commerce. So, I think it's --
and, plus,
it was a real speech. I mean, he
did it with

40:29.994 --> 40:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
footnotes. He did with it a
press release.

40:32.363 --> 40:34.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was actually a
couple of
speeches.

40:34.132 --> 40:36.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right. But
it was like
a real campaign all of a sudden,
instead of

40:36.334 --> 40:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump talking off the
cuff.

40:37.835 --> 40:41.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you see him
getting some
mileage out of this, Ramesh?

40:41.539 --> 40:46.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: I am a little
bit more skeptical
about the political utility of
this line of

40:46.511 --> 40:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack on trade that he has
taken, because,
if you look at the polling, even
though we

40:52.884 --> 40:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been hearing a lot of
skepticism about
trade from politicians over the
last year,

40:58.056 --> 41:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public opinion doesn't seem to
have shifted
that much.

41:00.625 --> 41:05.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Americans seem to regard
trade more as
a source of opportunity than as
a source of

41:05.430 --> 41:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
danger. Those numbers have not
really budged,
at least the Gallup numbers,
over the last

41:10.001 --> 41:14.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decade. And I think there is an
opportunity
for Hillary Clinton to take a
more balanced

41:14.038 --> 41:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at trade and in that
fashion to win some
of the voters that have voted
Republican in

41:20.411 --> 41:22.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the past.

41:22.347 --> 41:25.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So there's not
more motivation,
though, on the part of workers
who feel aggrieved

41:25.983 --> 41:26.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by trade perhaps?

41:26.918 --> 41:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I do. It's a
disagreement.

41:29.187 --> 41:36.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you go to Pennsylvania,
and go to
Ohio, go to Michigan, go to
Indiana, go to

41:36.494 --> 41:41.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wisconsin, and you will find, I
mean, a sense
of disenchantment and
alienation. And I think

41:41.733 --> 41:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump taps into that. And
it's certainly
far superior to what he's been
wasting his

41:46.637 --> 41:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time on in this campaign.

41:48.406 --> 41:51.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you see, in
fact, some
poll numbers in some of these
battleground

41:51.309 --> 41:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states coming out, the states
like Pennsylvania,
where we have white blue-collar
workers who

41:57.849 --> 42:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are apparently, a number of
them, gravitating
to Donald Trump.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right. No,
that's exactly
true.

42:04.822 --> 42:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: You have got the
white-collar
workers going the other ways in
a lot of these

42:07.725 --> 42:11.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
polls as well, a lot of
white-collar Republicans,
college-educated Republicans...

42:11.262 --> 42:11.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Heading toward...

42:11.662 --> 42:13.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:13.498 --> 42:14.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: ... are more
supportive of
Hillary than they have been of
past Democrats.

42:14.132 --> 42:15.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

42:15.800 --> 42:19.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The map and the
demographics
are shifting in all kinds of
ways.

42:19.404 --> 42:26.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, finally, this Supreme Court
decision this
week, Ramesh, on abortion, the
court basically

42:26.044 --> 42:30.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ruled that Texas tightening the
definition
of what an abortion clinic has
to be, has

42:30.648 --> 42:37.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do at these Texas clinics,
that that's
unconstitutional. Is this -- do
you see this

42:37.221 --> 42:39.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
becoming a political issue,
abortion?

42:39.190 --> 42:44.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: Abortion is
always a political
issue to some degree in a
presidential election.

42:44.362 --> 42:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most voters don't think of it as
their top
issue, but there are a lot of
voters out there

42:48.466 --> 42:52.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who do. What's interesting this
year, what's
unusual is that you have got a
Republican

42:52.703 --> 42:58.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee who doesn't seem to care
that much
about the abortion issue or
about the pro-life

42:58.376 --> 43:00.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
element of the Republican
coalition.

43:00.711 --> 43:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So on the day that the Supreme
Court made
its decision, usually, the
nominee would put

43:04.615 --> 43:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out a statement. Donald Trump
didn't have
anything to say about it. What
he had to talk

43:08.119 --> 43:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about instead was Senator
Elizabeth Warren's
attacks on the hats that the
Trump campaign

43:13.891 --> 43:16.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been selling. That's what he
decided to
talk about instead.

43:16.527 --> 43:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
the effect...

43:18.529 --> 43:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think, Judy,
abortion remains
a constant in American politics.

43:22.700 --> 43:28.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Americans have grown
dramatically more tolerant,
more accepting of gay and
lesbian rights,

43:28.739 --> 43:35.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all sorts of -- having a
child out of wedlock,
sex outside of marriage,
Americans. But abortion

43:35.713 --> 43:41.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remains a divide and a division
within this
country. A majority of Americans
believe it

43:41.052 --> 43:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should be legal in most or all
circumstances.

43:44.489 --> 43:51.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A substantial minority, over 40
percent, believe
it shouldn't be. And what you
have is really

43:51.796 --> 43:57.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a moral cleavage in the country.
Americans,
even 50 percent of women,
according to Gallup,

43:57.368 --> 44:02.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe that abortion is morally
wrong, even
though they are accepting of it.

44:02.039 --> 44:08.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's this terrible dilemma.
And the Democrats,
and especially Secretary Clinton
has become

44:08.145 --> 44:14.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
probably the most aggressively
pro-choice
nominee of any party in our
history. I mean,

44:14.552 --> 44:19.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her position used to be that
abortion should
be safe, legal and rare. And the
rare has

44:19.524 --> 44:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been dropped. It's now just safe
and legal.

44:22.226 --> 44:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she accepted the nomination
by going to
Planned Parenthood, not by going
to the AFL-CIO,

44:28.566 --> 44:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not by going to a school, not by
going to
a women's shelter, by going to
Planned Parenthood

44:34.672 --> 44:37.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and say, this is where I want to
be, this
is where I'm most comfortable.

44:37.408 --> 44:41.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think it probably
indicates where she
feels -- I mean, it's her
conviction, and

44:41.045 --> 44:42.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's where she sees this
election.

44:42.847 --> 44:48.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump has been all over the
lot. I mean,
he was for late-term abortion
legally. And

44:48.452 --> 44:53.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now he -- and this campaign, he
has been for
prosecuting and incarcerating a
woman who

44:54.025 --> 44:59.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a legal abortion. But he's
now revamped
both positions and still -- I
think he's still

44:59.497 --> 45:01.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supporting Planned Parenthood,
if I'm not
mistaken.

45:01.632 --> 45:07.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are going to
have to leave
it there on this issue, as you
say, perpetual

45:07.071 --> 45:10.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in American political life and
moral life.

45:10.474 --> 45:17.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields, Ramesh Ponnuru,
thank you very
much.

45:17.615 --> 45:21.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU: You're welcome.

45:21.185 --> 45:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: another
addition to our
summer reading list.

45:26.791 --> 45:32.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a look at the origins of
one of American
literature's finest works by one
of our most

45:32.063 --> 45:33.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
celebrated writers.

45:33.931 --> 45:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recently, Jeffrey Brown talked
with journalist
and cultural historian Lesley
M.M. Blume about

45:39.604 --> 45:45.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her new book, "Everybody Behaves
Badly: The
True Story Behind Hemingway's
Masterpiece

45:45.810 --> 45:47.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The Sun Also Rises."

45:47.478 --> 45:49.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lesley Blume,
welcome to you.

45:49.447 --> 45:50.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME, Author,
"Everybody Behaves
Badly: The True Story Behind
Hemingway's Masterpiece

45:50.147 --> 45:51.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Sun Also Rises": Thank you.

45:51.849 --> 45:53.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is
interesting that the
picture on the cover is a little
unusual,

45:53.684 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the picture on the cover is
actually the
starting point for you to this
whole endeavor.

45:57.321 --> 45:59.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: Yes.

45:59.090 --> 46:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I was researching another
project, and
I came across this very enticing
photograph

46:01.525 --> 46:07.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
of Hemingway with a very
attractive and
mischievous-looking
group of people around the cafe
table in Pamplona

46:07.698 --> 46:09.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1925.

46:09.367 --> 46:10.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there was a woman.

46:10.234 --> 46:12.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pamplona, Spain,
right.

46:12.036 --> 46:14.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: I'm sorry.
Pamplona, Spain,
where they were all gathered for
the annual

46:14.505 --> 46:17.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
San Fermin bull-fighting
festival.

46:17.508 --> 46:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the woman who was sitting
next to Hemingway
was this sort of, like,
glamorous woman, and

46:22.146 --> 46:28.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she had a sort of coquettish
look on her face.
And I was immediately intrigued
by her.

46:28.085 --> 46:30.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Who's that and
what's her story?

46:30.054 --> 46:31.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: Exactly.

46:31.889 --> 46:36.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it turned out that she --
her name was
Lady Duff Twysden, and she was
the real-life

46:36.294 --> 46:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inspiration behind Lady Brett
Ashley in Hemingway's
debut novel, "The Sun Also
Rises."

46:41.165 --> 46:44.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have long been a Lost
Generation obsessive,
but I hadn't realized that that
she had been

46:44.869 --> 46:49.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that Lady Brett Ashley had
been drawn from
real life. And I wanted to learn
more, so

46:49.573 --> 46:53.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I looked for a compelling book
that would
tell me the real life backstory
behind "The

46:53.878 --> 46:56.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sun Also Rises," and I didn't
find one.

46:56.180 --> 46:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right. You
couldn't find one,
so you decided to do it?

46:57.982 --> 46:59.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: I wrote it.

46:59.684 --> 47:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Remind us about
"The Sun Also
Rises," the story, the novel
itself.

47:02.386 --> 47:08.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: It came out
in 1926, and
it is a group of American and
British expats

47:08.659 --> 47:13.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are set up in Paris. They
are part of
an expat colony. They're up to
no good, but

47:13.397 --> 47:17.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it always sways to nobility,
because they're
all there to be writers or
artists.

47:17.268 --> 47:23.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the case of Lady Duff
Twysden, she was
there to sit out an aristocratic
divorce.

47:23.274 --> 47:31.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in real life, as in on
paper, this group
of expats goes to Pamplona for
the festival,

47:31.182 --> 47:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the entire party, shall we
say, dissolves
into quite a brouhaha.

47:37.722 --> 47:39.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, all kinds of
shenanigans.

47:39.990 --> 47:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: Yes, a lot of
bad behavior.

47:42.126 --> 47:44.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Rivalries,
sexual...

47:45.029 --> 47:51.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: Sexual
rivalry, fistfights,
you name it, it happened. And it
wasn't a

47:51.602 --> 47:56.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very good situation for anybody
involved,
except for Hemingway, who in
turn saw this

47:56.640 --> 48:00.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as desperately needed material
to stage a
breakthrough novelistically.

48:01.011 --> 48:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then suddenly
he had a
lot of material.

48:04.248 --> 48:09.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: Well, he
literally took
the events that had transpired
in Pamplona

48:09.286 --> 48:11.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Paris and translated them
onto paper.

48:11.889 --> 48:15.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To the point
where I saw you
say some people wondered whether
it was actual

48:15.126 --> 48:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just journalism or a novel he
had written.

48:18.362 --> 48:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: Well,
Hemingway at that
time up to that point and after
the fact was

48:21.899 --> 48:25.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a reporter. And he was known for
being a really
good reporter.

48:25.269 --> 48:29.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And one of the real-life
inspirations behind
"The Sun Also Rises" characters
literally

48:29.673 --> 48:34.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looked at his book after it came
out a year
later, and said, this is nothing
but a report

48:34.145 --> 48:36.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on what happened. How can he
pass this off
as fiction?

48:36.781 --> 48:41.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, this is
Hemingway before
he was Hemingway, right? This is
-- he's all

48:41.352 --> 48:43.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of 25 years old at the time.

48:43.320 --> 48:45.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: Right.

48:45.089 --> 48:49.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Hemingway is a baby when
he turns up
in Paris, but he's an ambitious
baby. And

48:49.260 --> 48:53.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he has the talent. And he's
there to stage
his breakthrough. So many of the
expats who

48:53.631 --> 49:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were there at that time were
there to do precisely
that. It was an ambition-fueled
town.

49:00.204 --> 49:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hemingway was looking to make a
big splash
with a revolutionary new modern
style that

49:04.875 --> 49:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stretched out adjectives and
just really got
to the point. There was quite a
journalistic

49:09.847 --> 49:14.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
element to that style also. He
wasn't the
only person in town doing it,
but he was the

49:14.351 --> 49:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one who knew that he could do it
in a commercially
successful way.

49:17.521 --> 49:22.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Not only was he
the only person
in town, but a lot of famous
people in town,

49:22.293 --> 49:25.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, Fitzgerald and Gertrude
Stein and Ezra
Pound.

49:25.462 --> 49:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: All three of
those people
really helped Hemingway
significantly, and

49:29.934 --> 49:34.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound
were stylistic
mentors to Hemingway.

49:34.104 --> 49:38.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they weren't selling a lot
of copies of
their work. Gertrude Stein
famously only sold

49:38.609 --> 49:43.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a reported 73 copies of her
first book in
18 months or something. Ezra
Pound is not

49:43.681 --> 49:46.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
selling tens of thousands of
copies of "The
Cantos."

49:46.851 --> 49:51.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Hemingway, on the other
hand, takes what's
viable from their styles and
adds it to his

49:51.989 --> 49:56.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own instinct -- instinctive
style. And he
knows that he has commercially
successful

49:56.861 --> 49:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work, and he's going to showcase
that in "The
Sun Also Rises."

49:59.730 --> 50:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And that made his
reputation,
or certainly helped it, his
reputation.

50:02.733 --> 50:04.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: It brokered
his reputation.

50:04.702 --> 50:09.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes. How
exactly? Was
it the style? The character of
the man? What

50:09.440 --> 50:10.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was it, do you think?

50:10.908 --> 50:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: It was a
combination of
a lot of different things.

50:12.676 --> 50:17.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hemingway himself and
Hemingway's writing
were both brilliant, brilliant
cocktails.

50:18.015 --> 50:22.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so with Hemingway's writing,
he famously
wrote to one of his publishers
-- he said,

50:22.753 --> 50:27.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you don't need a high school
education to
enjoy my writing. And it's going
to titillate

50:27.925 --> 50:32.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the masses. I mean, anybody can
relate to
it, but the style is so
revolutionary that

50:32.096 --> 50:35.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it will titillate highbrow
critics, which
it did.

50:35.532 --> 50:40.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he said, for people who
are not interested
in the stylistic components of
it, there's

50:40.871 --> 50:45.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of -- quote -- "dope about
high society,"
and that is always interesting.
So, there

50:45.876 --> 50:50.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was something for everyone. That
was one of
the things that helped him bring
that revolutionary

50:50.247 --> 50:53.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
style to the masses in a way
that somebody
like Gertrude Stein and Ezra
Pound is just

50:53.984 --> 50:55.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not going to be able to do.

50:55.753 --> 50:59.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Those always went
hand in hand
with Hemingway, right, the
writing and the

51:00.024 --> 51:01.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
biography.

51:01.759 --> 51:06.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How did -- when you think about
the ideas,
the views of Hemingway, they
have bounced

51:06.463 --> 51:11.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around over the decades, right,
of how people
have seen him. How did you come
to see him?

51:11.035 --> 51:12.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Did you like him?

51:12.102 --> 51:13.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: It's an
interesting question.

51:13.871 --> 51:19.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spent an awful lot of time
with Hemingway.
And Hemingway had a remarkable
ability to

51:19.576 --> 51:23.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reach very noble goals through
sometimes ignoble
means.

51:23.247 --> 51:28.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the question is less
a question
of whether or not I like him or
whether you

51:28.485 --> 51:35.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forgive what he did in the
service of his
ambition. And Hemingway's talent
was so outsized,

51:35.225 --> 51:40.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I feel like I can forgive
him a lot of
his trespasses to have achieved
what he did

51:40.264 --> 51:40.864 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
achieve.

51:40.898 --> 51:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

51:42.666 --> 51:45.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The book is "Everybody Behaves
Badly: The
True Story Behind Hemingway's
Masterpiece

51:45.602 --> 51:47.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The Sun Also Rises."

51:47.171 --> 51:48.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Lesley Blume, thank you.

51:48.038 --> 51:49.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESLEY M.M. BLUME: Thank you so
much.

51:49.440 --> 51:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All week, we have
been sharing
our summer reading list.

51:53.677 --> 51:59.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we wanted to close out with
an essay from
author Jennifer Weiner, in
praise of diving

51:59.116 --> 52:00.918 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into a book.

52:00.951 --> 52:04.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER WEINER, Author, "Hungry
Heart": They
say that the happiest day of a
writer's life

52:04.555 --> 52:09.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the day he or she gets to go
home to tell
mom and dad that the book that
they have written

52:09.126 --> 52:14.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is actually going to be
published, to be sold
in stores, and read by
strangers, and out

52:14.164 --> 52:15.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

52:15.866 --> 52:21.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I assume that's true for every
writer who
didn't call her first book "Good
in Bed."

52:21.105 --> 52:26.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will never forget my mom
hugging me, and
then pulling back to ask, "So
what's the title?"

52:26.343 --> 52:31.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and feeling my heart sink when I
realized
that I would actually have to
tell her.

52:31.281 --> 52:36.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With its naked legs and
cheesecake on the
cover, its breezy tone and
wisecracking, single-in-the-city

52:36.987 --> 52:42.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heroine, I knew that my debut
wasn't a candidate
for the National Book Award. I
knew it was

52:42.893 --> 52:47.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an entertaining, diverting read,
the kind
of book that would get packed in
beach bags

52:47.231 --> 52:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or purchased for plane trips.

52:49.733 --> 52:55.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I didn't know was the way
the world would
treat books like mine, the scorn
and opprobrium

52:55.039 --> 52:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would be heaped on what the
world would
come to call chick lit, or how
much it would

52:59.643 --> 53:02.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hurt, or how completely I would
believe it.

53:02.846 --> 53:07.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At some point in my life,
between birth and
publication, I had gotten the
message that

53:07.351 --> 53:12.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there were books that mattered
and books that
didn't. For years, I believed
that my work

53:12.489 --> 53:17.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fell squarely into the second
category. I
bought what the critics were
selling, that

53:17.661 --> 53:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
chick lit wasn't real
literature, that it
was only entertainment, that it
was even dangerous,

53:22.599 --> 53:27.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a kind of fast-growing weed
pushing other
worthier books off the shelves.

53:27.538 --> 53:33.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as the years went on, I
started to think,
what's wrong with something
that's -- quote

53:33.377 --> 53:38.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "just entertaining"? Is the
problem that
I'm writing something that's
diverting and

53:38.382 --> 53:43.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disposable, or that what I'm
writing is diverting,
and disposable and for women?

Is chick lit any worse than
mysteries or thrillers,
the genre fiction that men read,
the stuff

53:48.992 --> 53:54.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's at least slightly more
respectable
than romance and women's
fiction? And, most

53:54.698 --> 53:57.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
importantly, is pleasure such a
terrible thing?

53:57.801 --> 54:03.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's taken time, but what I have
come to realize
is that providing enjoyment,
helping a plane

54:03.607 --> 54:09.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ride pass more quickly, making a
hospital
stay less excruciating, letting
a young woman

54:09.079 --> 54:15.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
struggling with her own
insecurities and dysfunction
feel less lonely, is a prize,
too, and it's

54:15.352 --> 54:17.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one to be treasured.

54:17.354 --> 54:21.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, America, as we prepare
to celebrate
our nation's freedom and head to
the beach,

54:21.825 --> 54:28.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's time to embrace the F-word:
fun. Let's
declare our independence from
the shackles

54:28.298 --> 54:34.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of shame. Take whatever you want
to the beach,
or the bus, or to bed. Read
without apology,

54:34.571 --> 54:36.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for enrichment and enjoyment.

54:36.373 --> 54:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it's spiky, challenging
postmodern
fiction, or commercial women's
fiction, or

54:42.746 --> 54:48.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commercial men's fiction, more
commonly known
as books, read what you like
wherever you

54:48.852 --> 54:53.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can and embrace the joy of the
stories that
make you happy.

jobs few others want.

on his next chapter in life.

55:45.509 --> 55:47.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
