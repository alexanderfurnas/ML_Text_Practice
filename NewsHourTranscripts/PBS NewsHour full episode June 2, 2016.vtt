HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
away.

00:07.908 --> 00:11.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
California becomes
a battleground for Hillary
Clinton and Bernie

00:11.612 --> 00:17.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders, while Donald Trump gets
hit hard
with heightened scrutiny over
Trump University.

00:17.317 --> 00:22.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: A new report shows
music legend
Prince died from an opioid
overdose. How his

00:22.155 --> 00:25.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
death highlights America's
worsening opioid
epidemic.

00:25.525 --> 00:29.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: In the most expensive
renters market
in the nation, those tired of
living in cramped

00:29.997 --> 00:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
San Francisco are pushing for
more housing
at all levels.

00:33.267 --> 00:36.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONJA TRAUSS, Bay Area Renters
Federation:
Getting into the Bay Area is
like getting

00:36.169 --> 00:41.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a country club. You either
have to have
a lot of money right off the bat
or you have

00:41.241 --> 00:42.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
got to know someone.

00:42.609 --> 00:49.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:49.383 --> 00:52.185 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.219 --> 01:01.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Obama
administration
called today for curbs on payday
loans, used

01:01.828 --> 01:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by an estimated 12 million
Americans each
year. The Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau

01:06.133 --> 01:10.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says they turn into debt traps
with triple-digit
interest rates.

01:10.637 --> 01:15.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Proposed regulations would
include payment
tests to ensure borrowers can
repay loans

01:15.208 --> 01:20.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
without having to renew them,
and limits on
the number of times lenders can
debit a borrower's

01:20.514 --> 01:25.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
account. Trade groups warn the
restrictions
will kill the industry.

01:25.118 --> 01:28.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the presidential race,
Democrat Hillary
Clinton hammered Republican
Donald Trump on

01:28.922 --> 01:33.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign policy, and Trump
answered with a
major endorsement. In a San
Diego speech,

01:33.694 --> 01:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton emphasized her own
experience, and
said Trump's behavior, by
contrast, shows

01:38.699 --> 01:41.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he is temperamentally unfit to
be commander
in chief.

01:41.935 --> 01:46.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
This is not someone who should
ever have the

01:46.239 --> 01:53.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear codes, because it's not
hard to imagine
Donald Trump leading us into a
war just because

01:53.613 --> 01:56.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
somebody got under his very thin
skin.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:58.385 --> 02:02.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even as
Clinton was speaking,
Trump won a critical endorsement
from House

02:02.189 --> 02:06.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan. Up to now,
the Wisconsin
Republican had declined to take
that step.

02:06.493 --> 02:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, he did, writing in The
Janesville Gazette:
"It's no secret that he and I
have our differences,

02:12.799 --> 02:17.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the reality is, on the
issues that make
up our agenda, we have more in
common -- more

02:17.704 --> 02:20.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
common ground than
disagreement," he said.

02:20.474 --> 02:24.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama today urged
graduates at the
U.S. Air Force Academy to engage
with the

02:24.911 --> 02:29.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world, not pull back. The
commencement address
in Colorado Springs was the last
of his presidency.

02:29.850 --> 02:34.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He argued the U.S. has the
strongest military
in the world and must not shirk
its role as

02:34.988 --> 02:36.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a global leader.

02:36.923 --> 02:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
In these uncertain times, it's
tempting sometimes

02:39.226 --> 02:44.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pull back, to try to wash our
hands of
conflicts that seem intractable,
let other

02:44.297 --> 02:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countries fend for themselves.

02:46.133 --> 02:53.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But history teaches, from Pearl
Harbor to
9/11, that oceans alone cannot
protect us.

02:53.540 --> 02:57.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hateful ideologies can spark
terror from Boston
to San Bernardino.

02:57.844 --> 03:04.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Afterward, Mr.
Obama saluted
and shook hands with each of the
812 graduates.

03:04.551 --> 03:09.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About one-quarter of the class
was female
40 years since women were first
admitted to

03:09.489 --> 03:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the academy. The Air Force
Thunderbirds flew
over the graduation, but a short
time later,

03:14.895 --> 03:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of them crashed just south
of Colorado
Springs. The pilot ejected
safely, and the

03:20.233 --> 03:23.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president met briefly with him
before leaving
Colorado.

03:23.537 --> 03:29.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Navy's precision air team
also suffered
a crash. One of the Blue Angels'
F/A-18 fighter

03:29.342 --> 03:34.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jets went down near Nashville,
Tennessee,
as they practiced for an air
show. A local

03:34.247 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV station showed still images
of a fireball
after the crash. Black plumes of
smoke rose

03:39.820 --> 03:45.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the scene as the other
members of the
team flew overhead. The fate of
the pilot

03:45.225 --> 03:46.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was unclear.

03:46.927 --> 03:50.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Texas, a new round of storms
dumped even
more rain today, and made record
flooding

03:50.630 --> 03:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even worse. A flash flood
warning went up
across Central Texas, with
disasters now declared

03:55.402 --> 04:00.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 31 counties. Swollen rivers
threatened
to force additional evacuations
from low-lying

04:00.740 --> 04:05.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
areas. The flooding has reached
levels not
seen in more than 100 years.

04:05.345 --> 04:10.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parts of Europe are underwater
from some of
the worst flooding in a century
there. Rivers

04:10.283 --> 04:14.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are out of their banks in
France, Germany
and Belgium, killing six people
and forcing

04:14.855 --> 04:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evacuations. The waters are
rising so fast
on the Seine in Paris that the
famed Louvre

04:19.059 --> 04:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
museum announced it will close
tomorrow, so
workers can move art works to
upper floors.

04:24.965 --> 04:29.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Germany, floods are
sweeping through
towns in Bavaria. Disaster
relief crews have

04:29.269 --> 04:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started clearing the wreckage,
but more storms
are looming.

04:33.707 --> 04:38.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
German lawmakers declared today
that mass
killings of Armenians by Ottoman
Turks during

04:38.578 --> 04:44.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World War I was genocide. The
vote came amid
tensions with modern-day Turkey
over migrants

04:44.985 --> 04:46.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and political repression.

04:46.853 --> 04:50.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alex Thomson of Independent
Television News
has our report.

04:50.190 --> 04:58.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Armenians dancing
in the streets
outside. Meanwhile: "All those
in favor? All

04:59.032 --> 05:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
those against? Abstentions?"

05:03.370 --> 05:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that point, applause and
polite thank-you
signs from Armenians in the
public gallery

05:16.249 --> 05:26.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of Germany's Parliament.
Turkey's reaction
immediate, angry and not that
polite, the

05:26.059 --> 05:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prime minister accusing Germany
of an historic
mistake and saying Turkey will
never, ever

05:32.132 --> 05:34.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
accept it.

05:34.167 --> 05:39.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): In
Germany, an important
ally for Turkey, the German
Parliament accepted

05:39.706 --> 05:45.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a motion by the racist Armenian
lobby. There
is no event in our past that
would cause us

05:45.278 --> 05:47.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to bow down our heads in
embarrassment.

05:47.113 --> 05:52.118 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
ALEX THOMSON: A
million-and-a-half Armenians
were killed by Turkish Ottoman
forces during

05:52.152 --> 05:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the First World War, an event
widely recognized
as the first genocide of the
20th century

05:57.490 --> 06:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and officially so now by many
countries.

06:00.160 --> 06:08.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, a century on, Turkey
remains enraged
by the very idea. Speaking on a
visit to Kenya,

06:08.468 --> 06:12.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's president said they'd
recalled their
ambassador from Berlin and the
vote could

06:12.639 --> 06:20.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cause serious damage to
relations between
the two countries, major NATO
allies and countries

06:20.046 --> 06:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who need each other perhaps as
never before
in the grip of Europe's migrant
crisis.

06:24.884 --> 06:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Political
leaders in Armenia
praised the German Parliament's
vote.

06:29.256 --> 06:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OPEC failed again today to reach
agreement
on controlling output to push up
prices. Cartel

06:34.894 --> 06:39.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ministers met in Vienna, but
Saudi Arabia
and Iran remained divided over
freezing or

06:39.432 --> 06:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
curbing production. Iran is
pumping more oil,
now that Western sanctions have
been lifted.

06:45.705 --> 06:48.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street closed out the week
with modest
gains. The Dow Jones industrial
average was

06:48.775 --> 06:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up about 49 points to close at
17838. The
Nasdaq rose 19 points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added

06:55.715 --> 06:57.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nearly six.

06:57.617 --> 07:02.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And organizers of the Summer
Olympics in Brazil
sought to play down a host of
worries today.

07:02.255 --> 07:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said Rio de Janeiro will be
ready, despite
an economic crisis, the
impeachment of Brazil's

07:07.294 --> 07:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president, construction delays,
and the Zika
virus.

07:10.230 --> 07:15.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But American cyclist Tejay van
Garderen became
the first athlete to withdraw
from Olympic

07:15.535 --> 07:20.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consideration, citing Zika. He
said he won't
chance catching the virus and
passing it to

07:20.573 --> 07:22.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his pregnant wife.

07:22.575 --> 07:27.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the tightening
Democratic primary in
California; Trump University's

07:27.747 --> 07:33.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controversial business model;
amid confirmations
of Prince's overdose, a look at
the country's

07:33.286 --> 07:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
growing opioid epidemic; and
much more.

07:38.758 --> 07:48.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the primary season reaches
its final weeks
of campaigning, all three
candidates are stumping

07:48.802 --> 07:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the primary season reaches
its final weeks
of campaigning, all three
candidates are stumping

07:57.277 --> 08:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in California, the state with
the largest
delegate haul.

08:01.047 --> 08:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang takes a closer look at
the tightening
race on the Democratic side.

08:04.684 --> 08:06.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thanks, Hari.

08:06.486 --> 08:11.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For weeks, Bernie Sanders has
campaigned all
across California, gaining
momentum ahead

08:11.324 --> 08:15.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of next week's big primary.
That's forced
Hillary Clinton to spend more
time and money

08:15.829 --> 08:17.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Golden State.

08:17.797 --> 08:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on that, I'm joined by
Scott Shafer.
He's senior editor for KQED's
California politics

08:23.303 --> 08:24.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and government desk.

08:24.437 --> 08:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Scott, thanks for being with us.

08:26.306 --> 08:30.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know you have been out on the
campaign trail
today. The polls in California
have been all

08:30.076 --> 08:35.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the over the place, but I think
they seem
to be showing agreement that the
race really

08:35.482 --> 08:38.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has tightened. What happened?
What's going
on here?

08:38.518 --> 08:42.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT SHAFER, KQED: Yes, we have
now four
polls, John, in the last week
that show this

08:42.555 --> 08:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is basically a dead heat.

08:44.391 --> 08:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what is happening is
this. California
is a very diverse state. It has
about a quarter

08:48.061 --> 08:52.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the electorate are Latino.
It's got a large
-- 10 percent or so
Asian-American voters,

08:52.499 --> 08:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African-American voters, and the
conventional
wisdom has been that those
voters give Hillary

08:56.669 --> 09:00.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton the kind of firewall,
that they were
reliable Clinton voters.

09:00.974 --> 09:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we're seeing is, as these
polls have
tightened, Bernie Sanders has
done a really

09:04.577 --> 09:09.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good job doing outreach to those
communities.
He's ahead with Asian-Americans
in one poll.

09:09.549 --> 09:15.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's roughly even with Latinos.
And so that's
why we have seen this race
tighten up so much.

09:15.655 --> 09:19.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really -- they're scrapping
now for every
single vote that's out there.

09:19.159 --> 09:22.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What are the issues
that are helping
him along, helping Sanders make
those inroads

09:22.896 --> 09:24.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
among those communities?

09:24.731 --> 09:31.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT SHAFER: Well, I think, you
know, income
inequality has been a big part
of his message,

09:31.037 --> 09:33.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and California is a very
expensive state.

09:33.573 --> 09:37.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know you're going to be
talking more about
that later in the program, and
so it resonates

09:37.310 --> 09:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with folks. There's a lot of
students and
former students here that have
college debt,

09:42.549 --> 09:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
student loans that they haven't
paid off.
That's really working to his
advantage.

09:46.753 --> 09:52.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think a lot of it, too, is
-- he's the
hot ticket in town, so to speak.
He's sort

09:52.392 --> 09:57.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of like the Golden State
Warriors or the San
Jose Sharks. They're now in the
finals. And

09:57.397 --> 10:01.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if you weren't following
those teams
during the regular season, now
it's come down

10:01.334 --> 10:04.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the finals and you want to
get involved,
you want to go to a game, you
want to be part

10:04.571 --> 10:06.339 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

10:06.372 --> 10:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think he is generating
that kind
of excitement. Hillary Clinton
is very familiar

10:09.843 --> 10:13.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Californians. She's been on
the ballot
here. She beat Barack Obama here
in 2008.

10:13.680 --> 10:19.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Her husband won twice in
California. So, he's
a newer personality, and he's
generating a

10:19.652 --> 10:21.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lot of enthusiasm, especially
among younger
voters.

10:21.955 --> 10:25.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And the polls are
showing that
there are some unusually wide
differences

10:25.258 --> 10:27.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
among the core supporters for
each candidate.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are the polls showing?

10:28.995 --> 10:31.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT SHAFER: Well, there is a
huge generational
divide, John.

10:31.564 --> 10:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got voters who are 65
and older 2-1
for Clinton. You have got voters
who are 35,

10:38.104 --> 10:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
30 and younger 5-1 for Bernie
Sanders. You
have got Democrats who are
skewing toward

10:43.610 --> 10:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton. Then you have
got independent
nonpartisan voters, we call them
no-party-preference

10:47.947 --> 10:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters in California. They're
definitely leaning
toward Bernie Sanders.

10:52.218 --> 10:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's really why turnout
is so important,
because it really depends
exactly on what

10:57.891 --> 11:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the electorate looks like now.
Because we
vote by mail and we have early
voting, two

11:02.095 --> 11:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million people, more than two
million, have
already their ballots.

11:05.198 --> 11:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And pollsters have
also been asking
people if they have already
voted who they

11:10.470 --> 11:12.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
voted for. What are they
finding?

11:12.405 --> 11:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT SHAFER: Well, according to
the Field
Poll, which came out today,
there is definitely

11:17.043 --> 11:21.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an advantage among people who
have already
voted for Clinton. They prefer
her.

11:21.347 --> 11:26.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not too surprising. Her
voters tend
to be older. They tend to be
reliable, regular

11:26.252 --> 11:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters. So it's not surprising
that you would
see an advantage to her. Now,
it's always

11:29.889 --> 11:34.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
great for a campaign to get
those votes in
the bank, so you can focus on
the voters who

11:34.561 --> 11:37.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
haven't yet cast their ballots.

11:37.497 --> 11:41.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look at the larger
electorate,
it's much closer. Independent,
nonpartisan

11:41.434 --> 11:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters definitely support Bernie
Sanders over
Clinton. And so his challenge
will be getting

11:46.940 --> 11:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those people to the polls, and
they have some
challenges to cast ballots, and
they have

11:51.611 --> 11:53.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
got to overcome those
challenges.

11:53.379 --> 11:58.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Talk about those
challenges. It's
a semi-closed primary. What does
that mean,

11:58.318 --> 12:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how easy is it for those
no-party-preference
voters to get a Democratic
ballot?

12:03.222 --> 12:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT SHAFER: So, Republicans
only allowed
registered Republicans to vote
in the primary

12:07.293 --> 12:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, but Democrats have allowed
these non-partisan,
no-preference-party voters to
come in and

12:11.564 --> 12:13.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vote in their primary.

12:13.399 --> 12:18.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you are one of those voters
and you don't
ask for a Democratic ballot with
Clinton and

12:18.371 --> 12:22.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders on it, you are going to
get a ballot
where it's blank at the top. And
so you have

12:22.542 --> 12:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to by May 31 request a
mail-in ballot
for the Democrats. Now, a lot of
people haven't

12:29.315 --> 12:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done that. Some of these are
younger voters,
new voters.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may open their ballot the
day before
the election and realize, where
is Sanders

12:35.722 --> 12:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Clinton? They then have to
go to the polling
place and exchange their ballot.
Maybe they

12:41.494 --> 12:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have planned to do that. Maybe
they haven't.

12:43.363 --> 12:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in fact, there was a lawsuit
over this
very thing. Sanders supporters
sued two counties

12:48.968 --> 12:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the state -- secretary of
state in California.
The judge in that case threw it
out. But they

12:55.008 --> 12:59.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to extend the voter
registration deadline
right up until the election on
June 7. That's

12:59.779 --> 13:02.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to happen, but there
is a fair amount
of confusion.

13:02.548 --> 13:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We have got a little
less than
a minute left, Scott.

13:05.918 --> 13:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a challenge for the
Sanders voters,
it sounds like, but there has
also been a

13:09.288 --> 13:13.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
surge in new voter registration.
Are there
signs in there that could help
Sanders?

13:13.693 --> 13:15.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT SHAFER: There are.

13:15.662 --> 13:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new registrants or many of
them are young.
Now, you would expect that,
because who registers

13:20.199 --> 13:24.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote? People who are turning
18, people
who have moved to a place and
now they want

13:24.637 --> 13:27.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to register to vote. So it's not
that surprising.

13:27.073 --> 13:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, nonetheless, those are the
voters he
needs to turn out. They are also
-- they also

13:32.111 --> 13:38.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skew Democrats. So that helps
Hillary Clinton.
So, again, that's why not only
getting your

13:38.551 --> 13:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- getting a ballot into the
hands of these
folks, but getting them to turn
it in on time,

13:42.422 --> 13:48.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is so important. And it is --
like I said,
it is a challenge, but they're
very motivated.

13:48.428 --> 13:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The upside for the Sanders
campaign is that
when you look at the polls, his
supporters

13:52.598 --> 13:57.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are much more excited and
enthused to be voting
than Hillary Clinton's. So you
have to think

13:57.103 --> 13:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's going to auger well for
him on Election
Day.

13:59.706 --> 14:01.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, a game of voter
turnout.

14:01.474 --> 14:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scott Shafer from KQED, thanks
for joining
us.

14:02.275 --> 14:06.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT SHAFER: You bet.

14:06.679 --> 14:18.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As he
campaigns for votes,
Donald Trump is also defending
his business

14:18.825 --> 14:20.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reputation.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports
on the allegations and Trump's
defense of

14:24.063 --> 14:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his business venture Trump
University.

14:26.399 --> 14:32.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is about
the Trump brand
and the now-defunct business
called Trump

14:32.205 --> 14:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University that relied on the
billionaire's
Donald Trump's real estate
brand, pledging

14:35.441 --> 14:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that students would gain his
knowledge.

14:38.144 --> 14:43.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three lawsuits on behalf of some
students
charge it was all a scam. Their
voices are

14:43.249 --> 14:47.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this campaign ad from an
anti-Trump conservative
super PAC.

14:47.286 --> 14:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I spent about $30,000 in
Trump University
and basically all it did was
ruin my credit

14:52.091 --> 14:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and ruin my life. They didn't
really deliver
on anything. Got to remember,
there's 5,000

14:56.429 --> 14:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
victims in this. In the end,
there's no there
there.

14:59.098 --> 15:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, though,
a defiant
Donald Trump tweeted that he's
instructed

15:03.936 --> 15:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his execs to reopen Trump
University after
the lawsuits end. New York
Attorney General

15:09.842 --> 15:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eric Schneiderman is behind one
of those lawsuits,
which could go to trial as early
as this year.

15:15.014 --> 15:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN, New York
Attorney General:
It's not a university. We have
all sorts of

15:17.817 --> 15:22.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rules and regulations to govern
what's allowed
to be called a university and
what's not.

15:22.388 --> 15:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump's role was really as
pitch man.
The president of Trump
University and Trump

15:27.193 --> 15:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
himself have both testified
under oath that
he didn't meet the people who
taught the seminar,

15:32.298 --> 15:34.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so they weren't his handpicked
experts. In
fact, they weren't experts.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Two other suits
are pending
in California.

15:37.336 --> 15:42.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of pages of court
documents were
released this week in those
actions, including

15:42.575 --> 15:47.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the playbooks that Trump
University staffers
used. They refer not to
students, but to buyers

15:47.914 --> 15:55.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to whom the staff can sell more
seminars costing
up to $35,000 a pop. Maps,
diagrams and detailed

15:55.621 --> 16:01.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
schedules direct salespeople on
how to corral
and convince people, including
those who can't

16:01.360 --> 16:03.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
afford it.

16:03.162 --> 16:07.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At one point, the document
advises -- quote
-- "Money is never a reason for
not enrolling.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They will find the money."

16:09.335 --> 16:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The documents also contain
searing depositions
from former employees, one
saying that he

16:14.407 --> 16:19.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was reprimanded for not pushing
a couple to
mortgage their home. To all
this, Trump has

16:19.278 --> 16:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responded that most students
were satisfied,
releasing his own ad of success
stories.

16:24.417 --> 16:29.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I wouldn't have been able
to do those
deals without learning Donald
Trump's business

16:29.388 --> 16:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
techniques and real estate
strategies, and
I learned them all from Trump
University.

16:33.593 --> 16:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump insists
he is the victim
of bias by federal Judge Gonzalo
Curiel, who

16:38.631 --> 16:43.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oversees the class-action suits
in California.
He's the one who ordered the
document release

16:43.369 --> 16:44.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this week.

16:44.937 --> 16:48.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he said yesterday that some
of those documents
should have been withheld.

16:48.140 --> 16:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
What happens is the judge, who
happens to

16:52.445 --> 16:55.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be, we believe, Mexican, which
is great. I
think that is fine.

16:55.381 --> 17:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In fact, Curiel
is of Mexican
descent, but was American-born
in Indiana.

17:01.554 --> 17:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the middle of all this,
Hillary Clinton,
facing her own e-mail scandal,
hopes to gain

17:06.492 --> 17:08.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ground.

17:08.527 --> 17:11.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
He is trying to scam America,
the way he scammed

17:11.864 --> 17:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all those people at Trump U.

17:13.833 --> 17:18.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Voters will
likely decide
on Trump, and his political
brand, before

17:18.804 --> 17:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the courts rule on his business
one. At least
one court trial has been
delayed, at Trump's

17:23.509 --> 17:25.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
request, until after the
election.

17:28.447 --> 17:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We get more on
the controversy
surrounding Trump University
from Tom Hamburger

17:33.920 --> 17:35.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of The Washington Post.

17:35.855 --> 17:40.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Tom, what are we to make of
the involvement
that Donald Trump had with this
specific company?

17:40.559 --> 17:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's got his name on lots of
companies all
over the world.

17:42.595 --> 17:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM HAMBURGER, The Washington
Post: That's
true. He's become the expert at
branding.

17:47.833 --> 17:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this particular case, Donald
Trump eventually
owned 93 percent of Trump
University. And

17:55.207 --> 18:00.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the documents that were released
this week
portray him as really the
marketer in chief

18:00.680 --> 18:06.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this company. He's very
active in the marketing
of the program, less active in
doing one of

18:06.986 --> 18:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the things he promised, choosing
the instructors
and going over the curriculum.

18:09.722 --> 18:13.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Right. So, how
handpicked
were the instructors? That's
part of the sell.

18:13.392 --> 18:15.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TOM HAMBURGER: Exactly.

18:15.127 --> 18:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the claims made in Trump
marketing
material and by Donald Trump
himself in a

18:20.700 --> 18:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marketing video is that he,
Donald Trump,
handpicked the instructors who
were going

18:27.206 --> 18:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to teach basically his secrets
and how to
succeed in real estate.

18:31.243 --> 18:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The realty is that Trump didn't
pick the instructors.
The sort of star, even the
marquee instructors'

18:38.384 --> 18:43.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
names, he didn't know, as
revealed in depositions,
and though he claimed he was
handpicking them,

18:43.456 --> 18:45.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was really hands-off.

18:45.291 --> 18:49.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What do we
know about these
playbooks that Lisa referenced
in her story?

18:49.362 --> 18:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They reference everyone as
buyers, not necessarily
as students.

18:51.998 --> 18:58.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM HAMBURGER: Well, it's quite
clear from
the documents that came through
this weekend

18:58.571 --> 19:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
previously that Trump University
was primarily
focused on selling courses to
potential buyers,

19:07.179 --> 19:08.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to students.

19:08.981 --> 19:14.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was all about marketing and
profits. The
-- that is the clearly-stated
priority. It

19:14.587 --> 19:20.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes through in these employee
handbooks
or guides known as playbooks
that were released

19:20.393 --> 19:26.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this week. It's -- sell, sell,
sell is the
-- is what it's all about.

19:26.832 --> 19:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what are
the alumni
of Trump U., Trump University,
whatever they

19:31.070 --> 19:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were called in different states,
how do they
feel about it? What are they
saying?

19:34.473 --> 19:41.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM HAMBURGER: Well, we're
hearing, of course,
from some of those who had paid
money to Trump

19:41.514 --> 19:46.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University to get trained in the
Donald Trump
real estate techniques were
dissatisfied,

19:46.552 --> 19:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so dissatisfied that they
filed a couple
of class-action lawsuits, two in
California,

19:51.824 --> 19:57.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the attorney general in New
York was impressed
by their complaints and filed a
$40 million

19:57.263 --> 19:59.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lawsuit in New York.

19:59.198 --> 20:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's important to add that in
the documents
we saw this week, there were
student evaluations

20:03.536 --> 20:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and individual students who
praised the program.
So it's not entirely unanimous,
but the stories

20:11.877 --> 20:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of complaints of people who feel
they were
defrauded or misled are legion.
And the complaints

20:18.884 --> 20:21.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they make in the documents we
have seen are
quite strong.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Donald Trump,
as part of
his defense, says, listen, I
have got a lot

20:23.789 --> 20:27.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of satisfied customers. They
filled out a
survey saying they were
satisfied. They got

20:27.526 --> 20:29.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they felt like they paid
for.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOM HAMBURGER: Exactly right.

20:31.330 --> 20:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of the document release
this week
included some of those surveys.
Survey after

20:36.335 --> 20:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survey showed students rating
the courses
that they took and their
instructors at a

20:41.540 --> 20:47.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
five out of five, the highest
possible rating.
There are some who have
criticized the sort

20:47.680 --> 20:52.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of validity of those surveys,
but they are
there and it's part of the
evidence, part

20:52.218 --> 20:56.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the documentary evidence that
was released
by Judge Curiel this week.

20:56.722 --> 21:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What does the
defense team,
what does Trump's team have to
say about this?

21:00.159 --> 21:04.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or how do they plan to mount
their defense
in separate legal actions in
different parts

21:04.997 --> 21:06.198 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country?

21:06.232 --> 21:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM HAMBURGER: Well, there are a
couple of
things going on.

21:09.235 --> 21:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump spoke out last
Friday in San
Diego against the judge who sits
in the Southern

21:16.609 --> 21:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
District of California, Judge
Curiel, and
said -- described him as a
biased guy, said

21:22.982 --> 21:27.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's a Donald Trump hater, also
identified
him at one point, as I think
your segment

21:27.586 --> 21:29.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
noted, as a Mexican.

21:29.355 --> 21:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He, in fact, is born in Indiana
and went to
Indiana University Law School.
So part of

21:36.395 --> 21:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is discrediting the judge.
They suggest
also -- and Donald Trump has
said this, as

21:41.500 --> 21:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has his spokesperson, Hope Hicks
-- they're
confident they will win these
cases. That's

21:46.639 --> 21:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the reasons they say they
don't want
to settle. They want to go to
trial, they

21:50.876 --> 21:56.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have an abundance of satisfied
graduates and
the charges against them, if I
can use the

21:56.615 --> 21:58.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
word, have been trumped up.

21:58.584 --> 22:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
well, no coincidence
that he happens to be on a
monitor right behind

22:01.620 --> 22:02.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you in your newsroom.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:04.089 --> 22:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tom Hamburger
joining us
from The Washington Post right
now, thanks

22:05.591 --> 22:08.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so much.

22:08.227 --> 22:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOM HAMBURGER: Thank you.

22:13.566 --> 22:19.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us,
coming up
on the "NewsHour": the push for
more affordable

22:19.471 --> 22:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
housing in one of the nation's
most expensive
cities; a director's cut from
our town hall,

22:25.110 --> 22:31.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama talks gun
control; new songs
from American classic Judy
Collins; and teenagers

22:31.383 --> 22:35.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explain why they're always on
their phones.

22:35.688 --> 22:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: the opioid epidemic
and the problems
of treatment.

22:39.291 --> 22:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Law enforcement officials told
the Associated
Press and The Minneapolis
Star-Tribune today

22:42.828 --> 22:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that music legend Prince died
from an accidental
opioid overdose in April. The
superstar, according

22:49.235 --> 22:54.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to reports, self-administered
fentanyl, a
synthetic opioid painkiller much
stronger

22:54.373 --> 22:56.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than morphine.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also been reported that
Prince had an
earlier overdose, and was then
revived with

22:59.511 --> 23:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a dose of a drug called Narcan.
That treatment,
and Prince's later attempt to
get help from

23:04.250 --> 23:09.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an addiction specialist, have
cast a spotlight
on the question of treatment for
addiction.

23:09.555 --> 23:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here to discuss this with us is
Dr. Sharon
Stancliff, medical director of
the Harm Reduction

23:13.492 --> 23:18.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Coalition, a national
organization focusing
on advocacy and the health care
of those struggling

23:18.497 --> 23:20.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with drug use.

23:20.299 --> 23:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Doctor, when you hear fentanyl,
a fairly strong
drug in all the classes of
drugs, what does

23:25.638 --> 23:28.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that make you think of what
Prince was going
through?

23:28.073 --> 23:33.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHARON STANCLIFF, Harm
Reduction Coalition:
Well, I understand Prince had a
chronic pain

23:33.245 --> 23:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem, and fentanyl is often
prescribed
either as a patch or
preparations that dissolve

23:38.050 --> 23:40.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the mouth for chronic pain.

23:40.619 --> 23:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know if he had a
prescription for
that, but that's extremely
likely. We also

23:45.057 --> 23:50.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are hearing a lot about fentanyl
in the news
because there is illicitly
manufactured fentanyl

23:50.429 --> 23:55.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
found in many parts of the
country either
mixed into heroin or sold as
heroin.

23:55.467 --> 24:00.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're hearing about a lot of
fentanyl
overdoses. They could be from
pain management

24:00.439 --> 24:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or they could be from illicit
preparations.

24:02.808 --> 24:06.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: When you see
these stories
and hear about these stories
across the country,

24:06.245 --> 24:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're seeing, we're hearing more
about people
who get addicted while they're
being treated

24:11.517 --> 24:12.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for chronic pain.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. SHARON STANCLIFF: Right.

24:14.753 --> 24:20.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, anyone who takes an opioid
on a repeated
basis daily will become
dependent upon the

24:20.159 --> 24:25.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opioid. Many people will be able
to, when
the pain stops, taper off of the
opioid and

24:25.364 --> 24:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go on as though nothing had
happened.

24:27.833 --> 24:33.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Others find that it's really
hard to taper
off, and once tapered off, they
continue to

24:33.172 --> 24:39.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have craving for that -- an
opioid for weeks,
months, even years, and so
that's why we have

24:39.411 --> 24:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a variety of medications to
treat opioid addiction
or opioid use disorders.

24:44.350 --> 24:49.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of the
things that people
also wonder about is now there
are more first-responders

24:49.788 --> 24:54.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that have Narcan in the
ambulances and there
are different facilities that
have Narcan.

24:54.927 --> 24:59.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the concerns with the use
of the drug
is that sometimes this almost
gives someone

24:59.131 --> 25:04.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an insurance policy and it
doesn't necessarily
hit home how close to death they
came with

25:04.136 --> 25:07.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an overdose when they were
seemingly miraculously
pulled out from it.

25:07.973 --> 25:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHARON STANCLIFF: Well, the
other choice
might be death in many cases, so
we need that

25:13.645 --> 25:14.179 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
perspective.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHARON STANCLIFF: But also
getting Narcan,
or naloxone, when you are
actually opioid-dependent

25:18.417 --> 25:22.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is an extremely unpleasant
event.

25:22.554 --> 25:26.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have heard one person
described it as only
slightly better than death.
Someone goes from

25:26.992 --> 25:33.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
completely relaxed, unaware of
their surroundings,
to being in mild to moderate,
even severe

25:33.232 --> 25:38.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
withdrawal. So there's very,
very few people
out there, if any -- there's
somebody in every

25:38.303 --> 25:43.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bucket, I suppose -- that would
use naloxone
as a safety net in the field.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, when people are
brought back from
an overdose, whether they are
brought back

25:46.845 --> 25:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the hospital or the ambulance
services
which have long carried it or by
fellow drug

25:53.218 --> 25:57.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
users or family members, they
kind of miss
the horrifying experience that
-- the person

25:57.856 --> 26:01.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that thought they were going to
die that really
had the intense experience.

26:01.894 --> 26:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They just wake up feeling really
awful. That
being said, that moment or the
next day is

26:07.900 --> 26:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a good time to approach people
and talk to
them about what just happened
and maybe see

26:13.539 --> 26:17.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what kind of care or drug
treatment that they
can get.

26:17.709 --> 26:21.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have in
medicine established
a set of protocols that say, if
you have a

26:21.780 --> 26:24.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heart attack, here's what we're
going to do,
here's the regimen that we're
going to put

26:24.817 --> 26:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you on, here's how you change
your diet, here's
how you add your exercise. What
do we do when

26:28.520 --> 26:30.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it comes to drug overdoses?

26:30.322 --> 26:34.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHARON STANCLIFF: If it is
somebody that
has actually an opioid use
disorder, that

26:34.126 --> 26:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're using elicit opioids or
getting opioids
prescriptions outside of
prescriptions, then

26:39.264 --> 26:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we need to treat them for opioid
use disorder.

26:42.835 --> 26:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the best treatments for that
actually
are giving them medicine on a
regular basis.

26:47.573 --> 26:52.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have had methadone in
methadone clinics
for many years, and it has saved
many lives,

26:52.411 --> 26:56.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prevented many overdoses. And
now we have
a medication called
buprenorphine, which has

26:56.882 --> 26:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several trade names. It's
commonly known as
Suboxone.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Even with the
amount of
attention that opioid abuse has
gotten in

27:02.688 --> 27:07.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past couple of years, do you
think that
we have an understanding, a
perspective of

27:07.092 --> 27:09.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the scale of this problem in
America right
now?

27:09.761 --> 27:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. SHARON STANCLIFF: I think
some parts of
the country are very much aware
of it.

27:13.866 --> 27:19.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Erie County, they're having
so many deaths.
In Massachusetts, they're having
so many deaths.

27:19.238 --> 27:25.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think that there is
enough of
an investment on the parts of
the governments,

27:25.377 --> 27:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both in funding and in educating
the public
about the importance of
medication as part

27:32.184 --> 27:33.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the treatment.

27:33.952 --> 27:37.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We seem to still sort of
function under this
mythology that most people can
do fine if

27:37.856 --> 27:43.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they simply go into a detox or a
28-day rehab
and they will come out and they
will be fine.

27:43.829 --> 27:48.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's true for some number of
people, but
many people, once you have had a
few relapses,

27:48.767 --> 27:53.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it really needs to become a
medicalized treatment,
maybe with some counseling or
maybe not.

27:53.872 --> 28:01.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think we need both the
funding and the
impetus put into educating
people about it.

28:01.346 --> 28:04.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Sharon
Stancliff of
the Harm Reduction Coalition,
thanks for joining

28:04.816 --> 28:06.018 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

28:06.051 --> 28:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. SHARON STANCLIFF: Thank you
very much

Special correspondent Duarte
Geraldino reports
from the San Francisco Bay Area.

28:30.509 --> 28:34.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our weekly Making
Sense series,
which airs every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

28:34.079 --> 28:34.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Whose house?

28:34.613 --> 28:36.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: Our house!

28:36.448 --> 28:43.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: In the San
Francisco Bay
Area, it seems any small group
of voices can

28:43.822 --> 28:45.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
derail a proposed housing
development.

28:45.524 --> 28:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROTESTERS: Ed lee, can't you
see we don't
need no luxury?

28:49.461 --> 28:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Some urban
liberals wage
war on so-called luxury housing.
Around here,

28:54.933 --> 28:58.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the going price for a
two-bedroom is over
four grand a month.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTERS: No one Bay Area.

29:00.706 --> 29:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Meanwhile,
some suburban
conservatives fight against
subsidized housing.

29:05.077 --> 29:09.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Stand up for your
property rights before
they get taken away. They want
to take away

29:09.548 --> 29:13.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your decision of where you're
going to live
and how you're going to live.

29:13.251 --> 29:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But there is a
new and growing
group protesting what it sees as
the not in

29:18.357 --> 29:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my backyard, or NIMBY, attitudes
of both the
left and the right. This group
calls itself

29:23.662 --> 29:24.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YIMBY, Yes In My Backyard.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Welcome, everybody, to
the rally for
housing.

29:26.865 --> 29:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Sonja Trauss,
hobbled by
a broken foot, is hopping mad
about the lack

29:34.272 --> 29:38.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of new construction, which she
says is inflating
housing prices throughout the
Bay Area.

29:38.543 --> 29:41.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONJA TRAUSS, Bay Area Renters
Federation:
It's caused by zoning, but it's
also caused

29:42.014 --> 29:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by super local control. That's
really what
it is.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: And you're
trying to disrupt
that?

29:47.586 --> 29:49.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SONJA TRAUSS: Yes.

29:49.488 --> 29:52.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: YIMBY groups
are fighting
to ease local development
requirements originally

29:52.791 --> 29:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meant to maximize community
input, but that
today effectively delay new
projects for years,

29:59.364 --> 30:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meaning newcomers have to outbid
existing
residents for a place to live.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONJA TRAUSS: It's one-for-one
replacement.
Everybody that comes in,
basically, someone

30:06.905 --> 30:08.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has to leave.

30:08.073 --> 30:09.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: And yet more
people are
coming in.

30:09.841 --> 30:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONJA TRAUSS: Exactly. There's
more people
that want to live here than we
have space

30:11.810 --> 30:14.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for. And step one is, make more
space.

30:14.246 --> 30:18.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: A good rule of
thumb is
that, on average, two new jobs
are enough

30:18.350 --> 30:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to justify a new housing unit.
But that hasn't
been the case in San Francisco.
In fact, since

30:23.989 --> 30:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2011, more than a half-million
jobs have been
added to the Bay Area economy,
but only 100,000

30:30.095 --> 30:33.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new housing units built, one for
every five
new jobs.

30:33.432 --> 30:37.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONJA TRAUSS: Getting into the
Bay Area is
like getting into a country
club. You either

30:37.836 --> 30:41.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to have a lot of money
right off the
bat or you have got to know
someone.

30:41.273 --> 30:46.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Now even
Governor Jerry
Brown seems to be siding with
the YIMBYs against

30:46.411 --> 30:52.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the NIMBYs. He's just introduced
legislation
to simplify the approval process
for new projects

30:52.217 --> 30:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that include at least some
affordable housing.

30:54.186 --> 30:59.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JERRY BROWN (D),
California: You're going
to have to reduce some of the
regulatory burdens.

30:59.224 --> 31:04.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But the YIMBYs
say the governor's
proposal doesn't go far enough.
They would

31:04.296 --> 31:09.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fast-track new construction at
all levels,
even new luxury housing, betting
more overall

31:09.835 --> 31:12.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supply will reduce prices across
the board.

31:12.771 --> 31:16.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SONJA TRAUSS: The goal
ultimately is to have
more housing.

31:16.041 --> 31:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Just more
housing?

31:17.375 --> 31:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SONJA TRAUSS: Just more, yes,
yes.

31:18.210 --> 31:18.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Anything more?

31:18.777 --> 31:19.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SONJA TRAUSS: Yes.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NOAH SMITH, Columnist,
Bloomberg: I'm a gentrifier.

31:21.513 --> 31:24.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Noah Smith
knows some people
consider him part of the
problem.

31:24.750 --> 31:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOAH SMITH: The city shouldn't
just be a theme
park for young
upper-middle-class people like

31:30.722 --> 31:32.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

31:32.591 --> 31:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Smith is an
economist who
writes for the financial media
firm Bloomberg.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is also part of the new
creative class
flocking to the Bay Area.

31:38.797 --> 31:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOAH SMITH: And I am sure that
there is someone
who has it just a little bit
harder to find

31:44.169 --> 31:48.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
housing because I occupy this
place that I
am overpaying for.

31:48.073 --> 31:53.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Folks like
Smith have pushed
median rent for a one-bedroom in
San Francisco

31:53.345 --> 32:01.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
above $3,600 a month, making
this city, with
all its charm and grit, the most
expensive

32:01.253 --> 32:02.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rental market in the nation.

32:02.988 --> 32:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEN PASSETTI, Business Owner: A
studio in
the Tenderloin, which is filled
with drug

32:06.558 --> 32:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
addicts and homeless people,
will go for about
$2,200 to $2,800.

32:11.797 --> 32:17.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: In 2013, Jen
Passetti and
her husband opened a mom-and-pop
restaurant

32:17.169 --> 32:20.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Tenderloin district, an
area that's
since been transformed.

32:20.772 --> 32:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEN PASSETTI: It's insane. The
way the rents
are jumping, I will have to
leave. I can't

32:25.544 --> 32:29.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
afford to stay in San Francisco
at the prices
that are present.

32:29.314 --> 32:33.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: So you're
going to run a
local business, but live way
out, outside?

32:33.418 --> 32:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEN PASSETTI: I mean, what --
what choice
do you have?

32:35.453 --> 32:39.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: A major
inconvenience for
Passetti, who could soon have a
much longer

32:39.291 --> 32:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commute, but a true hardship for
her kitchen
staff and other blue-collar
workers.

32:43.862 --> 32:51.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOAH SMITH: Lower-income people
are involved
in the service economy, and they
prepare food,

32:51.603 --> 32:55.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they clean houses, they work on
construction
and things like that. And these
require you

32:56.007 --> 32:57.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be close to a lot of
customers.

32:57.742 --> 32:59.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: So they're
necessarily local.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOAH SMITH: They're necessarily
local. That's
right.

33:02.013 --> 33:06.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Smith reasons,
when lower-income
workers are forced further away
from employment,

33:06.384 --> 33:10.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
travel costs eat away at their
income, adding
to inequality.

33:10.088 --> 33:11.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY MCCOY, Democratic Council
Central Committee
Candidate: I think it's
important to have

33:11.890 --> 33:13.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
housing at all levels.

33:13.758 --> 33:17.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: YIMBY is
supporting Gary
McCoy's run for a seat on the
Democratic Council

33:17.229 --> 33:22.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Central Committee. McCoy
believes YIMBY's
pro- growth strategy could
reduce homelessness.

33:22.734 --> 33:27.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY MCCOY: I was homeless for
somewhere around
three or four years. The hardest
thing for

33:27.539 --> 33:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me still is very rainy days,
rainy, wet days,
because it brings back, you
know, trying to

33:35.480 --> 33:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find where to go out of the
elements and having
wet socks.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: More people are fighting
over fewer
units.

33:41.753 --> 33:46.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: So YIMBY wants
to change
San Francisco's political
structure, but it's

33:46.124 --> 33:48.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not stopping at the city's
borders.

33:48.059 --> 33:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONJA TRAUSS: The state spent a
lot of money
on highways, on the BART, and
everywhere that's

33:53.398 --> 33:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on transit that has good access
to jobs really
needs to be built up.

33:57.569 --> 34:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Trauss is
talking about
affluent nearby suburbs like
Lafayette, California,

34:02.941 --> 34:11.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
population 25,000, median home
price, $1.5
million, and just 20 minutes
away from downtown

34:11.483 --> 34:16.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
San Francisco on BART, the Bay
Area rapid
transit system.

34:16.855 --> 34:21.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In December, Trauss sued
Lafayette, after
it took a parcel that had been
set aside for

34:21.760 --> 34:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
315 affordable apartments and
rezoned it for
44 single-family homes.

34:27.933 --> 34:30.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN FALK, City Manager,
Lafayette, California:
The parcel that Sonja is talking
about is

34:30.835 --> 34:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
located a mile-and-a-half from
the BART station.
So for those people who are
least able to

34:37.208 --> 34:42.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
afford a car, this would be the
worst place
for them to live. But still
Sonja has filed

34:42.213 --> 34:44.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that lawsuit.

34:44.082 --> 34:47.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Lafayette City
Manager Steven
Falk points out that more than
500 apartments

34:47.485 --> 34:52.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and townhouses are being built,
many of them
within a half-mile, walking
distance, from

34:52.791 --> 34:54.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
public transportation.

34:54.592 --> 34:59.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN FALK: I think it's an
unfair criticism
to say that Lafayette is not
doing its fair

34:59.164 --> 35:00.932 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
share.

35:00.966 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Her belief is,
by in any
way restricting development so
that more units

35:05.503 --> 35:10.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not thrown into the market,
you are by
default contributing to prices
raising. You

35:10.375 --> 35:12.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
don't believe that's the case?

35:12.210 --> 35:16.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN FALK: Coming out of that
so-called
great recession, there were
thousands of homes

35:16.948 --> 35:23.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in my county, not hundreds,
thousands of homes
that could not find a renter or
a buyer. Are

35:23.254 --> 35:31.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we willing to despoil our
natural and wild
places for what we know is a
temporary economic

35:31.062 --> 35:34.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
phenomenon? I think the answer
should be no.

35:34.065 --> 35:39.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GRIFFITHS, San
Francisco: This will
be a tract development right up
to the road.

35:39.504 --> 35:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Michael
Griffiths agrees
with Steven Falk about not
disturbing nature,

35:44.042 --> 35:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but he is a little more extreme.
That's why
he and a group of Lafayette
homeowners are

35:48.580 --> 35:53.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also suing the city to block the
44-home compromise
development.

35:53.051 --> 35:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GRIFFITHS: Best use is
open space
for all, recreational use, enjoy
the view

35:58.056 --> 35:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the magical Mount Diablo.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Are you
opposed to development?

36:01.693 --> 36:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GRIFFITHS: No. But we
feel it's critical
and fundamental that voters who
pay taxes

36:06.898 --> 36:10.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and live here have the right to
vote on this
important issue.

36:10.468 --> 36:13.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: But Trauss
doesn't believe
anyone should have the right to
vote on and

36:13.872 --> 36:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thereby stall development that
could ease
the housing shortage.

36:16.674 --> 36:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONJA TRAUSS: We need housing
everywhere,
and we can't allow cities to
just turn down

36:22.113 --> 36:26.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
perfectly good apartment
projects just because
they want empty fields or
single-family homes.

36:26.918 --> 36:29.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we might do lawsuits anywhere
in the U.S.

36:29.854 --> 36:34.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DUARTE GERALDINO: Those lawsuits
could put
a new development a short walk
away from your

36:34.726 --> 36:35.927 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
backyard.

36:35.960 --> 36:43.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In San Francisco, Duarte
Geraldino for the
"PBS NewsHour."

36:43.868 --> 36:52.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Last night on
the "NewsHour,"
President Obama joined Gwen
Ifill for a wide-ranging

36:52.577 --> 36:56.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interview and town hall meeting
in Elkhart,
Indiana.

36:56.181 --> 37:00.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After the broadcast, the
president continued
to take questions from the
audience.

37:00.351 --> 37:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gun shop owner Doug Rhude
challenged the president's
record on gun control.

37:04.722 --> 37:11.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUG RHUDE, Gun Shop Owner:
Knowing that we
apply common sense to other
issues in our

37:11.763 --> 37:17.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
society, specifically like
holding irresponsible
people accountable for their
actions when

37:17.202 --> 37:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they drink and drive and kill
somebody, and
we do that without restricting
control of

37:24.175 --> 37:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cars and cells phones to the
rest of us, the
good guys, why then do you and
Hillary want

37:29.414 --> 37:36.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to control and restrict and
limit gun manufacturers,
gun owners and responsible use
of guns and

37:36.955 --> 37:41.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ammunition to the rest of us,
the good guys,
instead of holding the bad guys
accountable

37:41.626 --> 37:43.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for their actions?

37:43.428 --> 37:50.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
First of all, the notion that I
or Hillary

37:50.702 --> 38:01.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or Democrats or whoever you want
to choose
are hell-bent on taking away
folks' guns is

38:01.312 --> 38:03.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just not true.

38:03.081 --> 38:09.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't care how many times
the NRA says
it. I'm about to leave office.
There have

38:09.954 --> 38:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been more guns sold since I have
been president
than just about any time in U.S.
history.

38:18.530 --> 38:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are enough guns for every
man, woman
and child in this country.

38:22.133 --> 38:32.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at no point have I ever,
ever proposed
confiscating guns from
responsible gun owners.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it's just not true.

38:35.380 --> 38:42.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I have said is precisely
what you suggested,
which is, why don't we treat
this like every

38:42.120 --> 38:50.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other thing that we use? I just
came from
a meeting today in the Situation
Room in which

38:50.094 --> 39:00.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I got people who we know have
been on ISIL
Web sites, living here in the
United States,

39:00.405 --> 39:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. citizens, and we're allowed
to put them
on the no-fly list when it comes
to airlines,

39:08.012 --> 39:17.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but because of the National
Rifle Association,
I cannot prohibit those people
from buying

39:17.755 --> 39:19.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a gun.

39:19.624 --> 39:30.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is somebody who is a known
ISIL sympathizer.
And if he wants to walk in to a
gun store

39:30.435 --> 39:37.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a gun show right now and buy
as much -- as
many weapons and ammo as he can,
nothing's

39:37.842 --> 39:42.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prohibiting him from doing that,
even though
the FBI knows who that person
is.

39:42.647 --> 39:49.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, sir, I just have to say,
respectfully,
that there is a way for us to
have commonsense

39:49.587 --> 39:58.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun laws. There is a way for us
to make sure
that lawful, responsible gun
owners like yourself

39:58.196 --> 40:04.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are able to use them for
sporting, hunting,
protecting yourself, but the
only way we're

40:04.702 --> 40:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to do that is if we don't
have a situation
in which anything that is
proposed is viewed

40:11.142 --> 40:20.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as some tyrannical destruction
of the Second
Amendment. And that's how the
issue too often

40:20.385 --> 40:22.153 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gets framed.

40:22.186 --> 40:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You can watch
the entire
town hall with the president,
plus more video

excerpts, on our Web site at
PBS.org/NewsHour.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Next: new
songs from an
American classic.

40:40.972 --> 40:45.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown visited Judy
Collins to hear
a preview of her 51st album
being released

40:45.176 --> 40:51.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tomorrow, along with a tour with
more than
100 dates.

40:51.983 --> 41:00.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Judy Collins has
been making
beautiful music since the early
1960s, and,

41:00.658 --> 41:04.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since 1967, writing her own
songs.

41:04.462 --> 41:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In her New York apartment
recently, she played
a new one for us.

41:08.499 --> 41:15.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY COLLINS, Musician: I really
thought of
myself not as a singer in the
beginning. I

41:15.540 --> 41:17.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really thought of myself as a
storyteller.

41:17.542 --> 41:20.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, really?
Meaning that it
was all about the story.

41:20.211 --> 41:21.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY COLLINS: It was.

41:21.979 --> 41:28.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Many years later,
at age 77,
the stories and songs continue,
and for her

41:28.252 --> 41:34.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
latest album, titled "Silver
Skies Blue,"
Collins has taken a new step:
co-writing an

41:34.292 --> 41:41.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entire record with another
artist, 36- year-old
Ari Hest.

41:41.199 --> 41:47.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Collins grew up in a musical
family. Her father,
blind from age 4, was a singer
and radio host

41:47.538 --> 41:52.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who inspired her with Irish
ballads, Rodgers
and Hammerstein, and much more.
She studied

41:52.977 --> 41:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
classical piano, and then
discovered, and
became part of, a growing folk
music scene

41:58.716 --> 42:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that was infused with social
activism.

42:00.718 --> 42:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY COLLINS: I learned to sing
along the
way. So, the songs provided me
with a living,

42:07.725 --> 42:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with entertainment, education,
singing lessons,
and adventure throughout my
whole career,

42:16.134 --> 42:17.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
really.

42:17.935 --> 42:21.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the things
that you,
of course, became so well-known
for is bringing

42:21.139 --> 42:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
songs that other people wrote to
the attention
of a general audience.

42:25.343 --> 42:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY COLLINS: I was desperate to
sing great
songs, the kind of classic songs
that I had

42:31.315 --> 42:38.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been raised with. This is the
burgeoning of
the great folk music revival.
And I was in

42:38.156 --> 42:42.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the village. So I learned Woody
and I learned
Pete. I learned all their great
songs.

42:42.493 --> 42:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when I came to New York, I
was...

42:43.928 --> 42:45.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Woody Guthrie,
Pete Seeger,
and on and on and on.

42:45.863 --> 42:47.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY COLLINS: That's right.

42:47.598 --> 42:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was sitting in the middle of
this incredible
burgeoning of beauty and art and
fantasy,

42:55.473 --> 43:00.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and also politically and
socially important
songs. I just would walk around
the village,

43:00.845 --> 43:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Tom Paxton would come along
and say, oh,
hi, I just wrote this song,
bottle of wine,

43:05.416 --> 43:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fruit on the vine. Why don't you
sing it?

43:08.319 --> 43:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dylan was just starting here in
'61 here in
New York. And I went to hear him
at Town Hall,

43:13.891 --> 43:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and said I have to sing "Masters
of War,"
and I have to sing "The Lonesome
Death of

43:19.063 --> 43:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hattie Carrol," one of the great
songs to
come out of that era.

43:24.302 --> 43:32.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Over the years,
she'd become
renowned for her versions of
classics such

43:32.610 --> 43:42.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as "Amazing Grace," sung here at
Dromoland
Castle in Ireland and, at the
Metropolitan

43:42.653 --> 43:49.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as "Amazing Grace," sung here at
Dromoland
Castle in Ireland and, at the
Metropolitan

43:49.293 --> 43:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Museum, Stephen Sondheim's "Send
in the Clowns."

43:54.899 --> 44:03.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you think of what it is
that you're
doing when it's someone else's
song?

44:03.608 --> 44:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY COLLINS: You have to apply
the same criteria
to the songs that you write, as
well as the

44:10.648 --> 44:16.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
songs that you sing of other
people. They
all have to somehow become --
they have to

44:16.287 --> 44:17.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
become Judy Collins songs.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Your song.

44:18.523 --> 44:20.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY COLLINS: Yes.

44:20.358 --> 44:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to make them into that
somehow. And
that's magical, and also which
songs you choose

44:24.128 --> 44:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is magical, because you don't
know what -- it's
falling in love. If you're
falling in love,

44:29.166 --> 44:34.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you don't know why. I mean,
sure, he has blue
eyes or, sure, he has green
eyes, but you

44:34.672 --> 44:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't know what it is that
really is the chemistry.
It's the same thing with a song.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Can you give me
an example?

44:40.511 --> 44:42.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY COLLINS: In the early
things, so things
like "Turn, Turn, Turn," of
course. I heard

44:43.014 --> 44:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that and immediately wanted to
sing it my
whole -- ever since I heard it
as a 15-year-old.

44:51.422 --> 45:04.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's been
great success,
including four gold and two
platinum albums.

45:04.669 --> 45:11.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But over the years, Collins has
also faced
well-documented challenges,
depression, bulimia,

45:11.309 --> 45:14.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the suicide of her son, a long
fight with
alcoholism.

45:14.845 --> 45:22.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY COLLINS: I'm a recovering
alcoholic.
In fact, today is my
anniversary, 38 years.

45:22.753 --> 45:24.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Wow.

45:24.555 --> 45:31.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY COLLINS: When I have
troubles, I have
been able to go into my music
and my writing

45:31.562 --> 45:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be able to find my way
through those things.

45:34.732 --> 45:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But that, too,
was threatened
when she developed problems with
her vocal

45:41.005 --> 45:43.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cords that eventually required
surgery.

45:43.374 --> 45:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY COLLINS: It was terrifying.
I spent a
number of years just horrified
with, what

45:47.378 --> 45:49.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was going to do if I couldn't
perform?

45:49.246 --> 45:55.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I see you do a
lot of speaking
on the subject of healing, the
healing power

45:55.386 --> 45:57.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of art and music.

45:57.154 --> 45:58.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY COLLINS: I do.

45:59.023 --> 46:06.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say that my own life has
been very
impacted by the fact that I'm a
working musician.

46:06.664 --> 46:10.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm involved with music,
with writing
it, playing it, practicing it,
performing

46:10.868 --> 46:17.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it. And it really does -- that
two hours when
I'm on stage is a meditation, in
a way. You

46:17.074 --> 46:23.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't do a lot when you're
singing, except
to be present.

46:23.381 --> 46:29.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Still on stage,
Judy Collins
and her new musical partner Ari
Hest are now

46:29.954 --> 46:31.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the midst of a national tour.

46:31.856 --> 46:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From New York, I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS
NewsHour."

HARI SREENIVASAN: Next: to
another in our
Brief But Spectacular series.
This week, we

46:53.244 --> 47:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Next: to
another in our
Brief But Spectacular series.
This week, we

47:00.751 --> 47:05.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
asked a handful of
eighth-graders from a public
school in Los Angeles about
technology, what

47:05.589 --> 47:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they use, and whether they could
survive without
it.

47:08.426 --> 47:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: No, I do not use
Facebook.

47:10.461 --> 47:13.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I know it as, like, a
parent social
media kind of thing.

47:13.064 --> 47:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: Like, my grandma, my
aunts are on
Facebook.

47:16.133 --> 47:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Like, that was the
first thing to
come out, Facebook. It's, like,
after Instagram

47:20.604 --> 47:25.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and all that came out, we wanted
to get the
newer thing.

47:26.010 --> 47:31.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: I use my phone for
everything.

47:31.982 --> 47:33.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Instagram and Snapchat.

47:33.617 --> 47:37.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I either go on Snapchat
or I'm on
Instagram.

47:37.288 --> 47:38.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: I do use Uber.

47:38.255 --> 47:40.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: I'm on Snapchat and
Instagram a lot.

47:40.357 --> 47:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: I use Instagram to post
pictures
that I feel, like, pretty
confident about.

47:44.061 --> 47:45.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: I usually get above 100
likes.

47:45.629 --> 47:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: I don't know, probably
about 130.

47:47.798 --> 47:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: In the 200s.

47:49.066 --> 47:50.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Maybe like 74.

47:50.634 --> 47:53.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: When a friend doesn't
like my photo,
I'm just like, like my photo.

47:53.637 --> 47:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: You tell them to like
it?

47:55.506 --> 47:57.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

47:57.274 --> 48:01.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: My mom, sometimes, she
wants me to,
like, go outside and, like, get
some fresh

48:01.045 --> 48:02.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
air.

48:02.847 --> 48:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: They are taking away my
chargers.
They say that I'm going to go
crazy because

48:05.082 --> 48:06.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spend too much time on my
phone.

48:06.584 --> 48:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: You're wasting your
time, frying
your brain on that screen.

48:09.453 --> 48:12.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Yes, I can imagine
going a few days
without going with technology,
because then

48:12.623 --> 48:15.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would just be outside working
out and getting
better at sports.

48:15.259 --> 48:19.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I really don't think
that I can imagine
a world without technology.

48:19.063 --> 48:24.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I have got to think
about that. I
don't know what to do then.

48:24.235 --> 48:28.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: My parents are always
like, yes,
when I was growing up, we had to
play outside

48:29.006 --> 48:30.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and we never had phones.

48:30.775 --> 48:34.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: But I think they were
more close
with their friends and family.
They didn't

48:34.311 --> 48:39.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have, like, an excuse to be on
their phone
at the dinner table. There was
no phones at

48:39.183 --> 48:40.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the dinner table.

48:40.718 --> 48:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: What does worry me
about technology
is people like cyber-bullying.

48:42.486 --> 48:45.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: People are called names
when they
try to speak their mind.

48:45.356 --> 48:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: There's always people
that are going
to hate on you. But you should
just concentrate

48:48.125 --> 48:49.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the people that like your
stuff.

48:49.527 --> 48:52.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you know all the
people who are
liking your photo?

48:52.997 --> 48:58.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: I know probably 80 to
90 percent
of the people who are liking my
photos.

48:58.636 --> 49:03.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Before I have met
somebody, I have
seen their Instagrams and see
how they look

49:03.941 --> 49:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and see how they, like, kind of
act and how
they perceive themselves. And
so, without

49:11.215 --> 49:16.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, I really just don't know
how I would,
like, I don't know, see people
or get to know

49:16.854 --> 49:17.955 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

49:17.988 --> 49:19.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: This is my Brief But
Spectacular
take.

49:19.890 --> 49:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: And this is my Brief
But Spectacular
take.

49:22.526 --> 49:23.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: On technology.

49:23.360 --> 49:24.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: On being a teenager.

49:24.695 --> 49:27.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: On what the technology
means to me.

49:27.231 --> 49:31.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: And anything else you
want to say?

49:31.669 --> 49:32.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Follow me on Instagram.

49:32.469 --> 49:33.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: That was pretty easy.

49:33.304 --> 49:35.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:35.239 --> 49:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You can find

49:39.176 --> 49:43.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And finally tonight, our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

49:43.380 --> 49:45.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

49:45.216 --> 49:49.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Earth Harp is a unique
musical installation
that can turn any architectural
or natural

49:49.587 --> 49:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
space into an instrument. We
recently spoke
with its inventor, Malibu-based
William Close,

49:54.091 --> 50:00.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during a three-week exhibition
at the Kennedy
Center here in Washington, D.C.

50:00.497 --> 50:11.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM CLOSE, Earth Harp: My
name is William
Close. I am an installation
artist and an

50:11.809 --> 50:15.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
instrument inventor.

50:16.013 --> 50:20.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Earth Harp, I invented right
around the
turn of the millennium. I
actually mounted

50:20.351 --> 50:26.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a series of chambers to one side
of a valley,
and I ran strings 1,000 feet
across to the

50:26.357 --> 50:29.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other side, creating a literal
harp out of
the earth.

50:29.860 --> 50:39.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
The way the Earth
Harp works is, the strings are
going from
the chamber which rests on the
stage, and

50:39.637 --> 50:43.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are going out and attaching
into the
architecture of the space that
it inhabits.

50:43.874 --> 50:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Kennedy Center, the
strings are going
up and tying into the building
itself and

50:49.313 --> 50:52.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turning the hall into the
instrument.

50:52.449 --> 50:58.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You could wear rosin-covered
gloves and run
your hands along the strings and
actually

50:58.789 --> 51:02.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
create what's called a
compression wave. It's
very similar to running your
finger on the

51:02.660 --> 51:07.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
edge of a wine glass. And the
sound is very
symphonic.

51:07.798 --> 51:11.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here are the Kennedy Center, it
sounds like
I'm in a cathedral when I play.
It's just

51:11.902 --> 51:19.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really beautiful. When I play
the Earth Harp,
I'm actually standing inside the
strings,

51:19.243 --> 51:28.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so I'm surrounded by all
that vibration
and music, and it's really
fantastic.

51:28.619 --> 51:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have had the Earth Harp in so
many different
environments. I have strung it
to a mountain

51:32.456 --> 51:38.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peak. I have strung it to the
top of skyscrapers.
The Earth Harp has been at the
Coliseum in

51:38.495 --> 51:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rome, where it was strung out to
the Arch
of Constantine.

51:42.466 --> 51:49.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the very beginning, when I
developed
the instrument, the Earth Harp
has really

51:49.707 --> 51:56.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
captured people's imagination,
and, also,
it's really validated itself as
a truly functional

51:56.447 --> 51:58.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
musical instrument.

51:58.515 --> 52:05.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the
"NewsHour" online
right now: Drug-resistant
superbugs are already

52:05.322 --> 52:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an enormous public health
problem. But they're
also a global economic problem.
On our Making

Hood.

52:45.129 --> 52:47.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
