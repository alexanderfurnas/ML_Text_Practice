HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
both away.

00:08.208 --> 00:16.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
remembering the
legendary artist known as
Prince, dead at

00:16.717 --> 00:18.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
57.

00:18.785 --> 00:22.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: The campaign moves
into new battleground
states, and we examine the role
of trade in

00:22.122 --> 00:24.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 2016 election.

00:24.224 --> 00:29.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A ballot initiative in
Washington state to
create a carbon pollution tax,
but some environmentalists

00:29.863 --> 00:31.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
oppose it.

00:31.732 --> 00:34.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN TOLLESON, Lobbyist: I would
not disagree
with you that climate is
changing, but this

00:34.968 --> 00:40.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a global phenomenon, and it
needs a global
solution. Is it fair to put on
the back of

00:40.307 --> 00:42.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Washington employers and
families?

00:43.010 --> 00:45.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:45.846 --> 00:49.016 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:49.116 --> 01:02.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: From rules
governing delegates
to rules governing bathrooms, it
was all part

01:02.562 --> 01:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this campaign day in the
presidential race.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang begins our coverage.

01:07.801 --> 01:12.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At a "Today Show"
town hall this
morning, Donald Trump promised a
kinder, gentler

01:12.406 --> 01:14.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican front-runner.

01:14.174 --> 01:16.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
It's easier for me to be
presidential than

01:17.077 --> 01:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for me to be doing what I have
been doing
for the last, really, nine
months. But, at

01:22.115 --> 01:25.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right time, I will be so
presidential,
you will be so bored.

01:25.419 --> 01:30.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He also stepped into
a contentious
issue, defending the right of
transgender

01:30.290 --> 01:33.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people to use the bathroom that
matches their
gender identity.

01:33.193 --> 01:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You leave it the
way it is.
There have been very few
complaints the way

01:36.964 --> 01:42.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is. People go. They use the
bathroom that
they feel is appropriate. There
has been so

01:42.769 --> 01:44.671 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
little trouble.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
This morning, Donald Trump went
on "The Today

01:46.540 --> 01:48.308 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Show."

01:48.408 --> 01:52.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That drew a swift rebuke from
Texas Senator
Ted Cruz, as he stumped in
Maryland, one of

01:52.312 --> 01:54.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the new primary battlegrounds.

01:54.147 --> 01:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Donald agreed
with Hillary
Clinton and Barack Obama, in
attacking the

01:58.719 --> 02:04.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state of North Carolina for
passing their
bathroom ordinance. Have we gone
stark raving

02:04.157 --> 02:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuts? This is the political
correctness. This
is basic common sense.

02:13.033 --> 02:17.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, the
Republican National
Committee met in Hollywood,
Florida, amid

02:17.270 --> 02:22.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's complaints about party
rules. In a
Google Hangout, the "NewsHour"'s
Daniel Bush

02:22.642 --> 02:24.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reports the group made no
changes.

02:25.012 --> 02:29.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: What Sean Spicer,
the RNC's chief
strategist, told me yesterday
was that the

02:30.083 --> 02:35.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
chairman, Reince Priebus,
directed members
here this week not to set new
rules ahead

02:35.922 --> 02:40.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the conventions, because the
RNC wants
to avoid a perception that it's
paving the

02:40.560 --> 02:43.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way for one candidate or another
to get the
nomination.

02:43.764 --> 02:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hillary Clinton,
meanwhile, is
close to wrapping up the
Democratic nomination.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She campaigned in Connecticut,
focusing on
gun control.

02:51.371 --> 02:54.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm raising it everywhere I go
because we

02:54.975 --> 03:00.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need a national movement. The
gun lobby is
the most powerful lobby in
Washington.

03:01.014 --> 03:05.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Bernie Sanders
returned to campaigning
in Pennsylvania, after taking a
beating in

03:06.086 --> 03:08.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the New York primary.

03:08.155 --> 03:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I don't mind losing, but three
million people

03:13.126 --> 03:14.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in New York state, three million
people who
registered as independents
didn't have the

03:14.561 --> 03:18.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right to participate in the
Democratic or
Republican primary.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

03:20.834 --> 03:25.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, Sanders muted
his criticism
of Clinton today, whose delegate
lead is now

03:25.272 --> 03:26.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all but insurmountable.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

03:29.609 --> 03:32.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You can hear
more online
from Daniel Bush, covering the
Republican

03:33.046 --> 03:37.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Committee meeting. And
we will take
a closer look at the primaries
in five states

03:37.384 --> 03:40.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
next Tuesday later in the
program.

03:40.320 --> 03:44.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
Aftershocks rocked
Ecuador again, five days after
the country's

03:44.691 --> 03:49.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worst earthquake in decades. And
the official
death toll ticked steadily
higher, reaching

03:49.329 --> 03:56.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
577. More than 160 people are
still missing
and more than 23,000 are
homeless.

03:56.203 --> 04:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Rafael
Correa announced
he's raising the national sales
tax and putting

04:01.241 --> 04:05.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a one-time levy on millionaires
to pay for
reconstruction.

04:06.046 --> 04:10.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Volkswagen formally submitted a
plan today
to settle with U.S. customers
over its emissions

04:10.717 --> 04:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cheating scandal. Under the
terms, the German
automaker says it will buy back
the affected

04:15.922 --> 04:23.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
models or fix them, whichever
the owner wants.
In all, some 482,000 customers
of Volkswagen's

04:23.497 --> 04:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diesel-engine cars will be
affected. Details,
including the total amount that
V.W. will

04:28.935 --> 04:31.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pay, are still being worked out.

04:31.938 --> 04:36.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Queen Elizabeth celebrated a
milestone birthday
today and thousands paid tribute
to her across

04:36.243 --> 04:37.711 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Britain.

04:37.811 --> 04:41.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tim Ewart of Independent
Television News wraps
up the day's celebrations.

04:41.948 --> 04:51.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM EWART: The band played, the
sun shone,
well-wishers lined the streets
to offer flowers

04:51.758 --> 04:58.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and cards. In a town heavy with
royal history,
Britain's 90-year-old monarch
set forth to

04:58.198 --> 05:02.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
meet her people.

05:02.836 --> 05:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some, the real die-hards, had
slept on this
pavement for two nights to be in
prime position.

05:10.710 --> 05:14.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She knows these faces well, and
she wasn't
going to disappoint them.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Three cheers for Her
Majesty!

05:17.450 --> 05:19.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CHEERING)

05:19.419 --> 05:24.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM EWART: A statue of Victoria,
the queen's
great-great-grandmother, stands
outside Windsor

05:24.291 --> 05:29.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Castle. Victoria was once
Britain's oldest
and longest-serving monarch. But
she died

05:30.063 --> 05:36.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at 81, and Elizabeth passed the
milestone
of longest reign last year.

05:36.136 --> 05:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A group of other 90-year-olds
was assembled
to meet the monarch. Such an age
was once

05:42.442 --> 05:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rare, but no longer. There are
around half-a-million
nonagenarians in England and
Wales. The queen,

05:48.982 --> 05:50.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
though, never fails to impress.

05:50.884 --> 05:57.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I thought she looked
wonderful, and
I was interested in her makeup,
because she

05:57.157 --> 06:04.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looked so lovely and smooth. I
was wanting
to ask her what she used.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:07.000 --> 06:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM EWART: The queen is 90, her
husband nearly
95, but, for all the advancing
years, the

06:14.407 --> 06:16.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
show goes on.

06:16.376 --> 06:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Elizabeth
ascended to the
throne in 1952, after the death
of her father,

06:20.313 --> 06:22.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
King George VI.

06:22.148 --> 06:26.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The man who flew a
mini-helicopter onto the
U.S. Capitol lawn a year ago
this month was

06:26.319 --> 06:31.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sentenced today. Douglas Hughes
got four months
in prison for piloting a
gyrocopter without

06:31.725 --> 06:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a license. Hughes and his craft
penetrated
some of the nation's most
restricted airspace

06:36.229 --> 06:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before landing at the Capitol.
He said he
was protesting big money in
politics.

06:41.701 --> 06:46.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street came back to earth
after a three-day
rally. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost

06:46.139 --> 06:53.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 113 points to close at
17982. The
Nasdaq fell two points, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped

06:53.346 --> 06:55.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nearly 11.

06:55.181 --> 06:58.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Olympic Flame was lit
today, starting
the countdown to the 2017 summer
games in

06:59.085 --> 07:02.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rio de Janeiro. The ceremony
took place at
the Ancient Stadium in Olympia,
Greece, where

07:03.089 --> 07:07.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the games originated. An actress
playing a
high priestess lit the torch,
starting it

07:07.794 --> 07:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a journey to Brazil. The
Games are set
to open on August 5, but they
have been plagued

07:12.699 --> 07:15.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by delays and political turmoil
in Brazil.

07:15.468 --> 07:21.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
mourning
a music icon -- Prince dies at
57; a look

07:21.875 --> 07:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ahead to the next primaries and
the fight
over trade along the campaign
trail; Obama

07:27.480 --> 07:34.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Saudi Arabia amid tensions in
the relationship
between two longtime allies; and
much more.

07:34.421 --> 07:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And now for
more on the
race for the White House.

07:46.766 --> 07:50.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters in five states head to
the polls on
Tuesday. Front-runners Donald
Trump and Hillary

07:50.303 --> 07:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton are hoping Tuesday will
bring them
closer to the necessary
delegates needed to

07:54.607 --> 07:56.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
secure their parties'
nominations.

07:56.843 --> 07:58.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s John Yang has
the latest.

07:58.645 --> 08:02.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, we focus on
two key states
voting next week.

08:02.515 --> 08:07.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me to talk about the
race in Maryland
is John Fritze of The Baltimore
Sun, and from

08:07.320 --> 08:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Karen
Langley of
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to
talk about

08:11.958 --> 08:14.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that state's primary.

08:14.127 --> 08:17.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Both of these states have
littlest wrinkles
in their ballots.

08:17.130 --> 08:22.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Karen Langley, the biggest
wrinkle may
be in Pennsylvania. When
Republican voters

08:22.235 --> 08:25.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go into the voting booth next
Tuesday, what
are they going to see?

08:25.271 --> 08:29.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN LANGLEY, The Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette:
Well, they're going to be voting
for a presidential

08:29.576 --> 08:31.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
candidate, of course.

08:31.444 --> 08:36.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will also be voting for
delegates to
send to the Republican National
Convention.

08:36.149 --> 08:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is no tie between the
presidential
candidate who is selected by the
state or

08:42.122 --> 08:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its congressional districts and
these delegates
who the congressional districts
will be choosing

08:46.760 --> 08:48.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Tuesday.

08:48.762 --> 08:54.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those delegates do not have to
commit to supporting
any particular candidate, even
on the first

08:54.768 --> 08:59.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ballot. And so you could
theoretically have
a presidential candidate win the
state and

08:59.906 --> 09:04.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not get any of those 54
delegates who will
be selected by the congressional
districts.

09:05.044 --> 09:08.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And how will the
voters know who
these delegates are going to
support? They're

09:08.882 --> 09:12.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
technically unbound, but some of
them are
already saying what they're
going to do.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KAREN LANGLEY: That's right.

09:15.021 --> 09:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So when these delegates have
been asked, and
reporters have been trying to
fig outer what

09:18.792 --> 09:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they would do if they were
selected, some
of them say that they would
support a particular

09:23.797 --> 09:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate, at least on the first
ballot. A
large portion of them say that
they would

09:28.201 --> 09:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go the way their congressional
district does,
at least on that first ballot.

09:32.238 --> 09:36.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some of them just say that
they will take
into consideration things like
the statewide

09:36.543 --> 09:40.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
winner, the congressional
district winner,
and then who they think would be
most electable

09:40.647 --> 09:42.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in November.

09:42.582 --> 09:48.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those candidates, as we can
imagine, going
into Cleveland could be coming
under a lot

09:48.588 --> 09:53.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of lobbying from the
presidential campaigns,
since they they're the ones who
have the majority

09:53.493 --> 09:55.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of sway, as far as the delegates
from Pennsylvania
are concerned.

09:55.929 --> 10:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And in Maryland, John
Fritze, this
is the first time in a long time
that this

10:01.100 --> 10:02.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state has actually mattered in
the race.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN FRITZE, The Baltimore Sun:
That's absolutely
right.

10:04.704 --> 10:08.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have not a competitive
presidential in
Maryland in decades, really. And
while Pennsylvania

10:08.908 --> 10:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the biggest prize on Tuesday,
I like to
joke that the Maryland delegates
are more

10:12.479 --> 10:18.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
loyal. Our delegates are bound
for the first
two ballots in Cleveland. And
so, you know,

10:18.685 --> 10:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a candidate coming in and
trying to get
every single delegate, I think
we have perhaps

10:22.922 --> 10:24.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seen a little more tension
because of that.

10:24.858 --> 10:28.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Trump wins a congressional
district in
our state, that -- those three
delegates are

10:28.261 --> 10:29.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bound for the first two ballots.

10:30.096 --> 10:34.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And also in the -- in
Maryland
on the Democratic side, you have
got the primary

10:35.001 --> 10:40.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote really being driven in a
way by lower-level
races, rather than the
presidential race.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FRITZE: Right, an unusual
twist. Usually,
we talk about top-down effect.
In this state,

10:43.610 --> 10:47.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have got two really good
races. We have
got a great Senate race going
on, Democratic

10:47.180 --> 10:49.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
primary.

10:49.215 --> 10:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have also got the mayoral
race in Baltimore,
which doesn't get as much
attention in Washington.

10:51.951 --> 10:56.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first big election in
the city since
the death of Freddie Gray, since
the riots

10:56.189 --> 11:00.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
last year. Huge amount of
interest. And I
expect it's going to -- there's
already indications

11:00.126 --> 11:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that early voting is way up in
the city.

11:01.761 --> 11:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And could those races
affect upward,
affect the presidential race?

11:05.031 --> 11:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN FRITZE: I think so. I think
so.

11:06.966 --> 11:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if -- for instance, if
you see a huge
African-American turnout in
Baltimore City,

11:10.403 --> 11:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Baltimore is a predominantly an
African-American
city. When we talk about large
turnouts in

11:14.207 --> 11:17.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maryland, we are talking about
an increase
in African-American turnout.
That certainly

11:17.777 --> 11:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefits somebody like Hillary
Clinton, and
it benefits someone like
Congresswoman Donna

11:21.514 --> 11:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Edwards, who is running for
Senate.

11:23.383 --> 11:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of her message is that she
would be a
historic figure, because she
would be the

11:26.286 --> 11:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first black woman to represent
the state in
the Senate.

11:29.422 --> 11:33.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Karen Langley, in
Pennsylvania,
what's the state of the race?
What's going

11:33.426 --> 11:38.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on, on the ground, on each side
in the Republican
and presidential -- Republican
and Democratic

11:38.498 --> 11:38.998 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
races?

11:39.098 --> 11:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN LANGLEY: Sure.

11:41.100 --> 11:45.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we're seeing a lot of
appearances by
the candidates, by surrogates
for the candidates.

11:45.204 --> 11:49.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Yesterday, in Hershey,
Pennsylvania, I was
at a Ted Cruz event. Donald
Trump will be

11:49.976 --> 11:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in town here in Harrisburg later
tonight.
Bill Clinton was in Harrisburg
today.

11:54.981 --> 12:01.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As far as what we know about the
-- you know,
the polls, both Clinton and
Trump have wide

12:01.888 --> 12:07.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
margins so far. One longtime
observer of state
politics who I spoke with said
that the question

12:07.460 --> 12:11.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really not whether those
candidates will
win their respective primaries,
but by how

12:11.431 --> 12:13.232 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

12:13.333 --> 12:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And John Kasich, from
a neighboring
state, born in Western
Pennsylvania, is he

12:16.202 --> 12:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having any impact or getting any
traction?

12:18.771 --> 12:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN LANGLEY: You know, he, in
some surveys,
is right there with Cruz as the
-- you know,

12:26.879 --> 12:28.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
second place to Trump.

12:29.015 --> 12:35.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that when Kasich is in
Pittsburgh,
he certainly talks up his roots
from there.

12:35.355 --> 12:40.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen an advertisement, I
think not
maybe by him, but by supporters,
that plays

12:41.094 --> 12:43.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up those Pennsylvania
connections as well.

12:43.262 --> 12:48.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the Republican voters
who I have talked
to say that they like him, but
that they don't

12:48.101 --> 12:51.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think that he stands a chance
and, therefore,
won't get their vote.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: John Fritze, what's
the state of
play in Maryland on both sides?

12:53.940 --> 12:55.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN FRITZE: It's actually
really relatively
similar.

12:55.942 --> 12:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had most of the major
candidates in.
I was at a Donald Trump rally
out on the Eastern

12:59.679 --> 13:04.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shore last night. Ted Cruz
announced his second
visit. He was in the state in
Western Maryland

13:04.851 --> 13:07.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today. So, we have seen a fair
number of candidates.

13:07.420 --> 13:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Democratic side, both
Clinton and Bernie
Sanders are on the air
statewide, so they're

13:11.557 --> 13:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running advertising. You know,
the polling
is pretty similar to
Pennsylvania. Certainly,

13:18.097 --> 13:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton in particular has just a
huge increase.
A poll out today from Monmouth
has her up

13:22.368 --> 13:26.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
25 points in Maryland. Maryland
is the kind
of state where Clinton has
tended to do well

13:26.873 --> 13:30.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in, closed primary, high
African-American
turnout.

13:30.243 --> 13:35.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's really a state that will
be good for
her, I think, if the trends
hold. On the Republican

13:35.848 --> 13:40.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
side, Trump has a pretty
significant margin,
too, but, again, somebody like
Kasich or Cruz

13:40.553 --> 13:44.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can potentially come in and
steal some delegates
from these congressional
districts in order

13:44.490 --> 13:48.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to slow down Trump as he
tries to get
to the magic number.

13:48.194 --> 13:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: John Fritze of The
Baltimore sun,
Karen Langley from Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania,

13:51.297 --> 13:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with The Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette, thanks a
lot for being with us.

13:54.067 --> 13:54.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN FRITZE: Thanks.

13:54.967 --> 13:56.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN LANGLEY: Thank you.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As the
candidates campaign
in Pennsylvania, Indiana and
elsewhere, one

14:00.306 --> 14:04.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the issues resonating
strongly this year
is trade, and whether it's
helping or hurting

14:05.078 --> 14:07.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the American economy and its
workers.

14:07.280 --> 14:12.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been a long time since
trade policy played
out this way in a campaign.

14:12.351 --> 14:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, our colleagues at NPR
have been
looking more closely at these
issues as part

14:16.456 --> 14:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an ongoing series of reports
we are jointly
doing about issues on the
campaign trail.

14:21.761 --> 14:25.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on how trade is playing
out in the
race for the White House, I am
joined by Thea

14:25.932 --> 14:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lee. She's deputy chief of staff
at the AFL-CIO
and an international economist.
And Matthew

14:31.838 --> 14:36.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Slaughter, dean of the Tuck
School at Dartmouth
College. From 2005 to 2007, he
served on the

14:36.843 --> 14:39.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Council of Economic Advisers to
President
George W. Bush.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Thea Lee, so, why is this
resonating so much
right now?

14:42.749 --> 14:45.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEA LEE, Deputy Chief of Staff,
AFL-CIO:
You know, I think we have hit a
breaking point.

14:45.318 --> 14:49.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American workers have really not
benefited
from a lot of changes in the
economy over

14:49.789 --> 14:53.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last couple of decades. We
have seen that
real wages are essentially flat
for more than

14:53.559 --> 14:58.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four decades. And so we have had
a period
of tremendous economic growth
and technological

14:58.431 --> 15:02.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
innovation and globalization,
and yet American
workers are working harder than
ever.

15:02.602 --> 15:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're more educated than ever.
More people
in each family are working, and
they're not

15:05.972 --> 15:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really making ends meet. And
trade has been
a key contributing factor. It's
not the only

15:11.244 --> 15:14.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
factor. It may not even be the
largest factor.
But it is a key policy choice
that we have

15:14.981 --> 15:16.783 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
made.

15:16.883 --> 15:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we have a decision
about a big trade
agreement like the Trans-Pacific
Partnership,

15:19.619 --> 15:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this focuses the attention. And
I think we
have seen candidates really take
advantage

15:23.689 --> 15:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of that attention on trade right
now, and
workers are responding and it's
resonating.

15:28.494 --> 15:31.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matthew
Slaughter, any other
reasons that this is catching on
right now?

15:31.564 --> 15:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW SLAUGHTER, Associate
Dean, Tuck School
of Business, Dartmouth College:
I think Thea

15:34.100 --> 15:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is right that the American
workers, a lot
of them sitting around their
kitchen tables

15:38.938 --> 15:43.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thinking about voting, they have
not performed
as well as they had in the past.

15:43.543 --> 15:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're concerned about their
prospects. They're
concerned about their children.
And yet I

15:47.046 --> 15:51.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think what's important to keep
in mind is
trade in particular and
globalization more

15:51.150 --> 15:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
generally, they have generated
large gains
for America overall over the
many decades.

15:55.922 --> 16:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with the right kind of
policies going
forward, more global engagement
can help more

16:00.459 --> 16:02.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American families in the future
as well.

16:02.461 --> 16:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This isn't
what we're hearing
candidates say from either side
of the aisle,

16:06.899 --> 16:08.734 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thea.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEA LEE: Right, we have no
major presidential
candidate candidates from either
party right

16:10.937 --> 16:14.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now that are supporting the
Trans-Pacific
Partnership, for example.

16:14.841 --> 16:20.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the reason is that
the gains have
actually been relatively small.
And the distributional

16:20.680 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consequences have been large.
And on top of
that, we have doubled down. And
instead of

16:25.218 --> 16:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compensating the losers, you
know, taxing
the winners to compensate the
losers, in some

16:28.688 --> 16:32.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ways, we have done the opposite.
We have cut
tax rates for the wealthy. We
have decimated

16:32.925 --> 16:34.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the social safety net.

16:34.827 --> 16:39.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have gotten rid of education
and training
and infrastructure programs.
It's almost like

16:39.332 --> 16:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have transpired to make trade
less successful
in the global economy -- in the
U.S. economy

16:45.872 --> 16:50.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as it affects American workers.
We haven't
done what we needed to do. We
haven't negotiated

16:50.276 --> 16:53.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the right kind of trade
agreements, and then
we haven't taken the steps in
the domestic

16:53.579 --> 16:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy that would mitigate the
distributional
consequences and also make sure
that the United

16:58.584 --> 17:01.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States was truly competitive in
the global
economy.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matthew
Slaughter, so how
come the candidates aren't
singing the praises

17:04.824 --> 17:06.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that you do of trade?

17:06.659 --> 17:11.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW SLAUGHTER: Well, I think
a lot of
it has to do with politics is
oftentimes very

17:11.497 --> 17:16.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
local. It's long been the case
that international
trade and other dynamic forces
in the U.S.

17:16.535 --> 17:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy, like technological
change, the benefits
often accrue to many different
companies and

17:21.073 --> 17:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many different communities and
workers in
ways that aren't always
immediately visible.

17:25.244 --> 17:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet the forces of dynamic
change like
trade, the losses in those who
don't directly

17:29.649 --> 17:32.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
benefit are oftentimes quite
concentrated
and visible.

17:32.818 --> 17:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think what's a little
concerning
in the current political
environment is, it's

17:36.389 --> 17:40.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
typically presidents, in
particular, who by
definition should be thinking
about the aggregate

17:40.927 --> 17:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economic well-being for America.
We seem to
have lost the narrative of the
benefits that

17:45.231 --> 17:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trade and globalization have
generated for
America.

17:48.034 --> 17:52.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those benefits include things
like a spur
to innovation for companies, a
greater return

17:52.104 --> 17:56.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the investments they make in
new ideas.
We have long known, for example,
that companies

17:56.142 --> 18:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaged in exporting, they tend
to pay much
higher wages than do companies
elsewhere in

18:00.646 --> 18:02.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the U.S. economy.

18:02.615 --> 18:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we need to remember in the
current political
conversation the benefits that
globalization

18:07.286 --> 18:11.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
has generated and good
agreements like the
TPP could generate more of in
the future.

18:12.024 --> 18:15.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thea is definitely right. We
need to think
about ways to expand and
strengthen the social

18:15.828 --> 18:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safety net, and I think the TPP
is a positive
step forward in that direction.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
what about
the fact that -- the idea that
it takes a

18:21.400 --> 18:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
long time to see some of the
benefits?

18:23.302 --> 18:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEA LEE: Well, it takes -- we
haven't seen
the benefits. American workers
have not seen

18:27.940 --> 18:30.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the benefits of trade
agreements. That's just
a basic fact.

18:30.209 --> 18:34.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in some ways, I think Matt
has the story
exactly wrong, that rather than
benefits being

18:34.714 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widespread and the negative
consequences concentrated
in a few workers who lose their
jobs, in fact,

18:39.719 --> 18:45.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what we're seeing is that
overall, in the
economy, workers are seeing
stagnant and falling

18:45.291 --> 18:47.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wages.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you know, even the
cheaper prices
that we get from imports and
from trade has

18:51.097 --> 18:56.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not offset the fact that our job
market is
not delivering those jobs. And
trade has been

18:56.102 --> 18:59.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a key part of that. We see it in
communities.
Workers feel it every day.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Matthew, let
me let you
give a last response here.

19:02.041 --> 19:07.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW SLAUGHTER: So, it is
well-known that
companies and their workers that
are connected

19:07.313 --> 19:11.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the global economy through
trade and international
investment, the academic
research is very

19:11.117 --> 19:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear. Those tend to be better
jobs on a lot
of dimensions that all voters, I
think, in

19:15.421 --> 19:17.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
America care about.

19:17.289 --> 19:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the key question
from a policy
perspective is, A, how do we
have smart trade

19:20.760 --> 19:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and investment agreements with
the rest of
the world that allow more
workers to be connected

19:24.730 --> 19:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the opportunity of the global
economy,
and, at the same time, design a
stronger,

19:30.202 --> 19:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more resilient, better-funded
social safety
net, so that workers, whether
it's through

19:34.340 --> 19:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade or technological change,
or whatever
dynamic forces, who aren't doing
as well as

19:39.245 --> 19:42.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they would like in the American
labor market,
we provide more public supports
for those

19:42.181 --> 19:44.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people to have better
opportunities in the
future?

19:44.250 --> 19:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Matthew Slaughter,
Thea Lee, thanks so much.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THEA LEE: Thank you.

19:48.454 --> 19:52.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: NPR's next
story in the
series A Nation Engaged can be
heard on Saturday

19:52.124 --> 20:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night on "All Things Considered"
with Michel
Martin.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

20:07.239 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
fighting climate
change by taxing pollution; and
a road map

20:11.410 --> 20:14.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for success in a world of
rapidly changing
technology.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, President Obama
today held his
second annual summit with Saudi
Arabia and

20:19.051 --> 20:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its Gulf Cooperation Council
allies, Kuwait,
Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and the
United Arab

20:24.690 --> 20:26.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Emirates.

20:26.592 --> 20:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They discussed common interests
and issues,
but beneath the show of unity
lies rising

20:30.129 --> 20:33.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tensions between the U.S. and
Saudi Arabia.

20:33.199 --> 20:35.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner has the story.

20:35.601 --> 20:41.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Beneath the
ornate chandeliers
of Riyadh's Diriyah Palace this
morning, Saudi

20:41.741 --> 20:47.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
King Salman gave flicker of a
smile, as President
Obama outlined steps the U.S.
and Gulf states

20:47.947 --> 20:53.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
were taking to deepen
cooperation on regional
and security challenges.

20:53.819 --> 20:59.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But their two days of meetings
came amidst
new strains emerging in the
decades-long partnership

20:59.258 --> 21:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the two countries. The
fundamental
bargain, oil for guns, a
reliable supply of

21:05.464 --> 21:10.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi oil, in return for U.S.
military protection
and weaponry for the kingdom.

21:10.769 --> 21:17.309 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
But, today
shale-oil-and-gas-rich America
has less need of Saudi oil. And
with the region

21:17.409 --> 21:23.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in turmoil, from conflicts in
Syria, Iraq
and Yemen, Islamic State
aggression, oil prices

21:23.716 --> 21:27.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
falling, and a rising Iran, the
original bargain
is fraying.

21:27.319 --> 21:32.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANDA SLIM, Middle East
Institute: This relationship
saw its glory days in the 1980s,
1990s. And

21:32.658 --> 21:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since the al-Qaida attacks in
New York on
September 11, 2001, a lot of
mistrust has

21:40.566 --> 21:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeped into this relationship,
and that breach
has been overcome.

21:43.869 --> 21:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Randa Slim, an
analyst at
the Middle East Institute, says
each country

21:48.607 --> 21:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
feels let down by the other.

21:50.509 --> 21:55.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: The GCC, led by the
Saudis, has
not done enough in the fight
against ISIS.

21:55.548 --> 22:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One factor is that they consider
the major
fight for them is Iran, and not
necessarily

22:02.188 --> 22:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS. The Saudis look at the
Obama administration
as being enthralled with Iran,
and not willing

22:08.661 --> 22:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to stand up to what they
perceive to be subversive
Iranian activities in their
backyard.

22:14.366 --> 22:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: President Obama
sought to
downplay those differences
today.

22:18.003 --> 22:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: A lot of the
strain was always
overblown. During the course of
our administration,

22:23.976 --> 22:34.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the GCC countries have
extensively cooperated
with us on counterterrorism, on
curbing the

22:34.453 --> 22:39.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
financing of terrorist
activities. They are
part of the ISIL -- counter-ISIL
coalition.

22:39.758 --> 22:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But the kingdom
has a list
of grievances that have shaken
their confidence,

22:45.798 --> 22:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief among them, the U.S. did
nothing to
save its longtime Sunni partner,
Egyptian

22:51.370 --> 22:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Hosni Mubarak, from
being toppled
in the Arab Spring revolt.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRUCE RIEDEL, Brookings
Institution: The fall
of Mubarak sent the message to
the Saudis

22:58.344 --> 23:04.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the United States won't
stand by autocrats
when the people of the country
is demanding

23:04.783 --> 23:06.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change. It was a shock to the
Saudis.

23:06.986 --> 23:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Former CIA and
National Security
Council official Bruce Riedel
spent decades

23:11.790 --> 23:13.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
working in the Middle East.

23:13.659 --> 23:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE RIEDEL: From the Saudis'
standpoint,
they immediately said, what
about us? Are

23:17.463 --> 23:19.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we going to go the same way?

23:19.531 --> 23:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Then, last
year, Riyadh felt
betrayed by the Obama
administration's nuclear

23:24.069 --> 23:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deal with its Shiite regional
rival, Iran.

23:26.839 --> 23:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRUCE RIEDEL: The Saudis and the
other Gulf
states are paranoid that the
United States

23:33.012 --> 23:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to shift sides, and
that we're going
to find a new friend in Iran and
dump them.

23:40.019 --> 23:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And, lately,
the kingdom
is angry about legislation
making its way

23:43.989 --> 23:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through Congress to let 9/11
victims' families
sue Saudi Arabia, home to 15 of
the 19 hijackers.

23:51.897 --> 23:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington has grievances too,
top on the
list, that Saudi Arabia's focus
on provoking

23:57.770 --> 24:05.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its archrival, Iran, as it did
when it beheaded
a Saudi Shiite cleric in
January, fuels sectarian

24:05.577 --> 24:11.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tensions in the region. That
makes it harder
to unite against America's
number one foe,

24:11.250 --> 24:13.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Islamic State.

24:13.519 --> 24:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After joining the U.S.-led anti-
ISIS coalition
in 2014, the Saudis made bombing
runs against

24:19.391 --> 24:25.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the terrorist group in Iraq and
Syria, but
those have stopped. Instead,
Riyadh is using

24:25.464 --> 24:31.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
billions of dollars in U.S.
plane and weapons
sales to fight a proxy war
against Iranian-backed

24:31.370 --> 24:33.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Houthi rebels in Yemen.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D),
Connecticut: The humanitarian
casualties of this war have been
catastrophic.

24:35.974 --> 24:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Democratic
Senator Chris
Murphy of Connecticut, a member
of the Senate

24:39.945 --> 24:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Foreign Relations Committee, has
introduced
a bill to put conditions on U.S.
arms sales

24:44.717 --> 24:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Saudis, saying their use
undercuts
America's image and interests.

24:49.054 --> 24:54.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY: Inside Yemen,
this isn't
a Saudi bombing campaign. This
is a U.S.-Saudi

24:54.460 --> 24:55.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bombing campaign.

24:55.794 --> 24:57.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Because it's
done with American
weaponry.

24:57.696 --> 25:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY: It's done
with American

American targeting.

It's done with American
refueling of planes.

MARGARET WARNER: And he faults
the Saudis
for letting ISIS and al-Qaida
actually expand

25:07.373 --> 25:09.174 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Yemen.

25:09.274 --> 25:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY: We also know
for a fact
that the Saudis have not been
targeting either

25:11.877 --> 25:13.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of those groups inside this
civil war.

25:14.012 --> 25:18.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: President Obama
expressed
impatience with Riyadh's rivalry
with Iran

25:18.150 --> 25:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a recent interview with "The
Atlantic"
magazine, saying Saudi leaders
"need to find

25:23.021 --> 25:27.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an effective way to share the
neighborhood
and institute some sort of cold
peace with

25:27.893 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran, not count on the U.S. to
back them in
endless proxy wars."

25:33.065 --> 25:38.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudi leaders made it clear that
comment didn't
sit well with them. U.S.-Saudi
strains are

25:38.237 --> 25:43.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most pronounced over handling
the civil war
in Syria with its multiple
players, Iranian-backed

25:43.976 --> 25:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Bashar Assad, the
Islamic State
and other terror groups, and
Western-backed

25:49.481 --> 25:51.417 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rebels.

25:51.517 --> 25:56.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudi Arabia has funded the
training and equipping
of anti-Assad rebels, but, of
late, not done

25:56.455 --> 25:58.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much more to defeat ISIS there.

25:58.424 --> 26:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDA SLIM: Saudi Arabia doesn't
believe this
is going to be achieved without
removing Assad

26:04.496 --> 26:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from power, and that is where
the goals differ.

26:07.366 --> 26:12.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And then there
is the greatest,
but rarely spoken of point of
friction, the

26:12.938 --> 26:16.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudis funding of Sunni mosques
and schools
that spread their fundamentalist
strain of

26:16.942 --> 26:19.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islam, Wahhabism, throughout the
Muslim world.

26:20.045 --> 26:23.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS MURPHY: If you want
to look at
the roots of al-Qaida, if you
want to look

26:23.949 --> 26:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the roots of ISIL, there's no
way of denying
that part of those roots run
through the export

26:32.658 --> 26:34.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Wahhabism from Saudi Arabia.

26:34.626 --> 26:38.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Yet, with the
two nations
still needing each other, as
long as the Saudi

26:38.797 --> 26:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
monarchy is in power, no one
predicts a breakup
any time soon.

26:43.235 --> 26:49.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Global leaders
will gather
at the U.N. tomorrow to sign a
landmark agreement

27:02.454 --> 27:07.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
aimed at limiting climate
change, and it's
happening, not coincidentally,
on Earth Day.

27:07.860 --> 27:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many observers say those
actions will
not be enough. In Washington
state, there's

27:11.897 --> 27:17.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a battle over taking a big step
and whether
to approve the first tax on
carbon in the

27:17.736 --> 27:19.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.

"NewsHour" economics
correspondent Paul Solman
has the story, part of his
weekly reporting,

Making Sense, which airs every
Thursday.

YORAM BAUMAN, Economist: You
might be an economist
if you don't read human interest
stories because

27:28.580 --> 27:29.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they don't interest you.

27:31.650 --> 27:35.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: At Seattle's museum
of flight
a couple weeks ago, the annual
Climate Night

27:35.387 --> 27:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
event, headlining, Yoram Bauman,
the world's
first and only stand-up
economist.

27:41.593 --> 27:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: You might be an
economist if
you have ever gone into a bank
or other financial

27:45.097 --> 27:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
institution in the hopes of
getting a date.

27:47.866 --> 27:49.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:49.735 --> 27:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: If you adamantly
refuse to sell
your children because you think
they will

27:52.571 --> 27:54.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be worth more later.

27:54.506 --> 27:59.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But these days,
Bauman's leading
a dead serious fight, to combat
climate change

27:59.578 --> 28:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in his home state of Washington,
by using
a basic principle of economics.

28:04.950 --> 28:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: Which is that the
way to get
less pollution is to make
polluting expensive,

28:09.221 --> 28:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, if you make pollution
expensive,
you get market forces working to
promote conservation,

28:14.927 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
innovation, development of new
technologies,
all the things that I as an
economist love

28:20.232 --> 28:22.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about capitalism.

28:22.167 --> 28:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the way to make
carbon-based
greenhouse gas pollution more
expensive, says

28:25.671 --> 28:32.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bauman, is to tax it. So, he
founded a grassroots
group, Carbon Washington, to put
the issue

28:32.844 --> 28:34.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to voters.

28:34.212 --> 28:37.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Initiative 732, it's going
to be on the
November ballot.

28:37.883 --> 28:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I-732 works by charging
polluters with
a carbon fee, which lowers
pollution.

28:41.386 --> 28:46.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: And then the revenue that
is created
will go to reducing other taxes
in the state.

28:46.692 --> 28:53.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Making the carbon
tax, starting
at $25 per ton of CO2, about 25
cents per

28:53.498 --> 28:55.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gallon of gasoline,
revenue-neutral.

28:55.567 --> 29:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: The revenue from
the carbon
tax goes to cut existing taxes.
Most of it

29:01.573 --> 29:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes to cut the state sales tax
by a full
percentage point. Most
households are going

29:06.745 --> 29:10.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pay a few hundred dollars a
year more for
fossil fuels and a few hundred
dollars a year

29:11.049 --> 29:12.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
less for everything else.

29:12.851 --> 29:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Everyone will pay
the carbon
tax, says Bauman; everyone gets
the sales

29:17.356 --> 29:20.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tax cut. But two groups get a
bonus.

29:20.292 --> 29:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: One of those
groups is manufacturers
who are competing with
businesses outside

29:24.296 --> 29:26.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the state.

29:26.198 --> 29:29.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: They will get the
state business
tax eliminated. And low income
households,

29:29.901 --> 29:34.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who might be especially hurt by
higher gas
taxes, will get a tax rebate.

29:34.206 --> 29:39.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YORAM BAUMAN: It's going to
provide up to
$1,500 a year for 400,000
working families

29:39.311 --> 29:44.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Washington state. And that is
how we are
going to do our part to save the
world.

29:44.750 --> 29:49.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, is a
revenue-neutral carbon
tax how the world will
eventually cope with

29:49.621 --> 29:55.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate change via economics? Or
is it just
another tree-hugger's quixotic
quest?

29:55.594 --> 30:00.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, in Washington, the fight
has produced
some odd alliances, although
there's nothing

30:01.099 --> 30:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
surprising about business'
opposition.

30:04.302 --> 30:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ian Tolleson is a lobbyist for
food processors
in the Pacific Northwest.

30:08.240 --> 30:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN TOLLESON, Lobbyist: We heat
things, we
cut things, we wash, and this is
all for food

30:13.679 --> 30:19.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
safety. And that requires a lot
of energy,
tax, tax, tax all through the
supply chain.

30:19.484 --> 30:25.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what that does, our products
are now more
expensive on the shelf. And how
can we compete

30:25.657 --> 30:28.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with those producers that
wouldn't have this
tax?

30:28.894 --> 30:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We met up with
Tolleson at Seattle's
Pike Place Market, which
features, among other

30:36.268 --> 30:42.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
attractions, the world's
presumably first
and only Hula-Hoop,
guitar-on-chin-balancing

30:42.307 --> 30:44.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
troubadour.

30:44.309 --> 30:48.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But isn't Tolleson at all
worried about global
warming?

30:49.014 --> 30:54.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am sitting here sweating in
Seattle in April.
I'm not saying that proves
climate change,

30:54.853 --> 30:56.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it certainly suggests that
something is
going on.

30:57.089 --> 31:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN TOLLESON: I won't disagree
with you that
climate is changing, but this is
a global

31:01.359 --> 31:06.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phenomenon, and it needs a
global solution.
Is it fair to put that on the
back of Washington

31:06.898 --> 31:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
employers and families?

31:08.900 --> 31:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Moreover, says
Tolleson:

31:11.103 --> 31:15.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN TOLLESON: We already have
the fourth cleanest
economy in the whole United
States.

31:16.074 --> 31:19.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Case in point, the
harvester
just around the corner.

31:19.945 --> 31:24.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY CRAWFORD, Pike Place
Market: It turns
food waste into organic liquid
fertilizer.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Pike Place's Emily
Crawford.

31:27.385 --> 31:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY CRAWFORD: We have 20
different vendors
putting their food scraps into
the harvester,

31:32.157 --> 31:38.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which can process more than
4,000 pounds of
food scraps every day, which the
EPA has shown

31:38.396 --> 31:43.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is one of the biggest causes for
carbon emissions
in the United States, is food
waste.

31:43.802 --> 31:49.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Siding against the
carbon tax
and with big business, its usual
adversary,

31:49.307 --> 31:55.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the unions, though State Labor
Council president
Jeff Johnson says he too is an
ardent environmentalist.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFF JOHNSON, President,
Washington State
Labor Council: During the
winter, we have

31:57.682 --> 32:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been struck with repeated floods
and mudslides.
In the summer, we have droughts
and forest

32:02.220 --> 32:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fires. Our shellfish industry
has left the
state and gone to Hawaii because
the acid

32:07.425 --> 32:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
levels in the ocean has risen so
much.

32:09.995 --> 32:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But doesn't that
mean that you
should embrace anything that
would help climate

32:15.066 --> 32:16.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
change and counteract it?

32:17.002 --> 32:21.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF JOHNSON: No, it doesn't,
particularly
if you embrace a measure that's
actually going

32:21.873 --> 32:26.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to send us down the wrong path.
We have got
an energy-intensive company,
Kaiser Aluminum

32:26.478 --> 32:31.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out in Spokane, eastern side of
our state.
It's the most efficient aluminum
rolling mill

32:31.316 --> 32:32.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the world, right?

32:33.084 --> 32:38.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With just a carbon price, they
become less
competitive with aluminum makers
in other

32:38.924 --> 32:40.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parts of the states, in other
parts of the
world.

32:40.792 --> 32:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's the key
issue for
a labor leader, right? You're
always trying

32:46.164 --> 32:47.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to protect jobs?

32:48.066 --> 32:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF JOHNSON: I'm trying to
protect jobs of
the individuals, but also the
revenues of

32:50.902 --> 32:55.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the community in Spokane, and
we're trying
to keep the most, the world's
most efficient

32:55.507 --> 33:01.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aluminum producer in our state,
rather than
them moving or shutting down.

33:01.146 --> 33:02.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: What does that
shirt say?

33:03.081 --> 33:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL MANGALIMAN, Executive
Director, Got Green:
Oh, yes, this is where -- we're
Got Green.

33:06.718 --> 33:12.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We are a community-based
organization in South
Seattle led by people of color.

33:12.157 --> 33:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Business and labor
are strange
enough bedfellows. But why is
environmental

33:16.795 --> 33:19.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
organizer Jill Mangaliman
opposing the carbon
tax?

33:19.798 --> 33:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILL MANGALIMAN: This is a great
opportunity
for us to actually put something
back into

33:23.835 --> 33:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the communities who are -- who
have been struggling
for so long, historically.
Without any kind

33:28.573 --> 33:32.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of targeted revenue, business
can continue
as usual, and that's not what we
want.

33:32.978 --> 33:39.351 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Instead of
revenue-neutral, Mangaliman
wants revenue-targeted to groups
like Got

33:39.451 --> 33:46.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Green and the economically
stressed constituents
they serve. So, a curious
coalition is con.

33:47.092 --> 33:48.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But look who's popping up pro.

33:48.693 --> 33:52.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're a conservative policy
guy. How come
you're in favor of a carbon tax?

33:52.898 --> 33:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD MYERS, Washington Policy
Center: Anything
that moves environmental policy
away from

33:56.167 --> 34:00.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
regulation, which is very
high-cost and ineffective,
toward a personal incentive,
which is more

34:00.372 --> 34:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effective, is a good thing.

34:02.274 --> 34:06.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Todd Myers, a
right-winger, pushing
the revenue-neutral carbon
initiative.

34:06.645 --> 34:11.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TODD MYERS: It provides an
incentive to be
more efficient, to have less
impact on the

34:11.116 --> 34:16.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
environment, but, at the same
time, doesn't
increase taxes, doesn't waste
money on regulation,

34:16.488 --> 34:18.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doesn't harm the environment.

34:18.156 --> 34:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: By contrast, fellow
supporter
Jason Puracal is a man of the
left.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What was it like to spend two
years in prison
in Nicaragua?

34:27.365 --> 34:30.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JASON PURACAL, Carbon
Washington: Well, it
was horrific conditions. That's
for sure.

34:30.869 --> 34:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Now safe in Seattle
with his
family, Puracal is an
environmental activist,

34:36.875 --> 34:41.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
imprisoned in Nicaragua in 2010
on trumped-up
charges, later dropped.

34:41.980 --> 34:46.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON PURACAL: My family had to
launch an
international campaign to save
my life, and

34:46.718 --> 34:51.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ultimately succeeded with the
support of thousands
of people from around the world.
That case

34:51.523 --> 34:59.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically inspired, how do we do
change at
a greater level, at a policy
level?

34:59.531 --> 35:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: You mean that your
wrongful imprisonment
in Nicaragua has impelled you to
join this

35:06.438 --> 35:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revenue-neutral carbon tax
initiative?

35:09.174 --> 35:14.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON PURACAL: Yes. It's great
to put a price
on carbon and try to move us
away from fossil

35:14.112 --> 35:17.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fuels, but how do we do so in a
way that's
equitable for all?

35:17.549 --> 35:24.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, the lower sales
tax will
offset higher gas costs, with an
annual rebate

35:24.322 --> 35:27.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
further softening the blow for
low-income
families.

35:27.859 --> 35:34.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if people stop using carbon,
take a drastic
change...

35:34.899 --> 35:36.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JASON PURACAL: Which is the
intention, right?

35:36.768 --> 35:40.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: ... then there will
be less revenue.

35:40.372 --> 35:44.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON PURACAL: At some point in
the future,
yes, there will have to be some
renegotiations

35:45.043 --> 35:50.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on where that revenue comes
from, if we are
able to transition off of fossil
fuels altogether,

35:50.382 --> 35:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which would be a great problem
to have.

35:52.684 --> 35:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the moment,
though, Seattle
is experiencing midsummer days
in early spring.

35:58.656 --> 36:06.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fish are jumping. Some
locals are high.
And the carbon tax is polling 44
percent for,

36:06.598 --> 36:09.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
46 percent against with seven
months to go.

36:09.834 --> 36:14.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
economics
correspondent Paul Solman,
reporting from

36:14.939 --> 36:18.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
balmy Seattle.

36:18.109 --> 36:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: how to
make your way
through the future world of ever
rapidly changing

36:30.455 --> 36:31.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
technology.

36:31.856 --> 36:34.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the theme of the newest
addition to
the PBS Bookshelf.

36:34.492 --> 36:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy Woodruff recorded this
conversation recently
with an entrepreneur who has
some suggestions.

36:38.530 --> 36:45.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in 1985,
when Steve Case
co-founded America Online, only
3 percent

36:45.403 --> 36:51.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Americans were actually
online. Fast-forward
some 30 years, and we can see
the global change

36:51.976 --> 36:56.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brought about by the Internet
and an ever-growing
array of devices and social
media.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, what is next?

36:59.017 --> 37:03.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we get a glimpse from
Steve Case himself.
He is the author of a new book,
"The Third

37:03.254 --> 37:06.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wave: An Entrepreneur's Vision
of the Future."

37:06.691 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Steve Case, it is good to see
you.

37:07.992 --> 37:09.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE CASE, Co-Founder, AOL:
It's good to
see you again.

37:09.894 --> 37:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you borrowed
that term the
third wave from the futurist
Alvin Toffler.

37:13.264 --> 37:15.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STEVE CASE: Yes.

37:15.133 --> 37:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was in college in the
1980, I read
Toffler "Third Wave." It
completely mesmerized

37:18.436 --> 37:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me inspired me. I spent the last
almost four
decades pursuing some of the
ideas he talked

37:23.241 --> 37:25.009 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

37:25.110 --> 37:27.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when I was writing a book, I
wanted to
pay respect to him. I open the
book with talking

37:27.278 --> 37:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about my experience reading
Toffler. And I
hope others will similarly be
inspired by

37:31.816 --> 37:36.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my book, and because the future
once again
is going to change, and the path
forward is

37:36.154 --> 37:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be different than what
we saw in
the last two waves. And that's
what I was

37:38.923 --> 37:40.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trying to lay out in this book.

37:40.892 --> 37:44.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in a
thumbnail, first wave
was the creation of the
Internet, which you

37:45.063 --> 37:51.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were involved in. Second wave
was building
on that, you describe, social
media devices

37:51.903 --> 37:53.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and so forth.

37:53.104 --> 37:54.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the next wave?

37:54.772 --> 37:56.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STEVE CASE: It's really
integrating the Internet
seamlessly throughout our lives.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is a lot of things
that haven't
changed that much in the first
wave or the

37:59.744 --> 38:03.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
second wave. How we learn, our
kids learn
is about the same. How we stay
healthy is

38:03.548 --> 38:08.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the same. How we manage
energy is about
the same. Even how we think
about food is

38:08.686 --> 38:10.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about the same.

38:10.588 --> 38:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And work itself is starting to
change in the
third wave because of the
freelance economy,

38:13.758 --> 38:17.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what some call the gig economy.
So, I think
it's important for everybody,
not just businesspeople

38:17.529 --> 38:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or technologists, to understand
what is happening
next. And that is what I try to
lay out in

38:22.033 --> 38:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this book with sort of a -- a
little bit of
a road map forward and a little
bit of a playbook

38:25.937 --> 38:30.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of how you can think
about orchestrating
your career and your life, and
how you think

38:30.175 --> 38:33.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about maybe your kids and even
your grandkids.
What world are they going to be
inheriting?

38:33.978 --> 38:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You write about
your experiences
even before AOL, bumpy in the
beginning, very

38:38.683 --> 38:42.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
high, and then there was the
ride down, and
on to what you are doing now.

38:42.720 --> 38:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the lessons of that
experience for
the future, do you think?

38:46.224 --> 38:48.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STEVE CASE: Well, I think
revolutions often
happen in evolutionary ways.

38:49.027 --> 38:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AOL was a 10-year-in-the-making
overnight
success. We really were at it
for a long time

38:52.664 --> 38:56.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before we finally broke through.
After we
merged with Time Warner, we kind
of lost some

38:56.601 --> 39:00.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our way. And what I try to
lay out in the
book is a framework to think
about what is

39:00.838 --> 39:04.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening next and make sure you
are focused
on the right priorities, you do
have the right

39:04.709 --> 39:06.511 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

39:06.611 --> 39:08.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And entrepreneurship really is a
team sport.
So, if you don't have the right
people kind

39:08.846 --> 39:12.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of working on the projects in a
collaborative
way, you can't really get a lot
of traction.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What were some of
the mistakes?

39:14.652 --> 39:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE CASE: Early on, I thought
it would happen
faster, frankly. I really did
believe in the

39:18.056 --> 39:19.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea of the Internet when it was
still pretty
nascent.

39:20.058 --> 39:24.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought everybody would
understand that.
And it really took us more than
a decade before

39:24.562 --> 39:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we really got traction. Later
on, as we got
bigger and we went from dozens
of people to

39:28.900 --> 39:31.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hundreds of people to thousands
of people,
and then after the merger, tens
of thousands

39:31.769 --> 39:34.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people, kind of lost sight of
some of the
importance of culture and...

39:34.105 --> 39:37.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was the Time
Warner merger.
And full disclosure, I was
working for CNN

39:37.242 --> 39:39.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then, so I was one of people
affected by that.

39:39.110 --> 39:40.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVE CASE: You were.

39:41.012 --> 39:43.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so -- but, basically, as it
got bigger,
it was -- the culture changed
and some of

39:43.982 --> 39:47.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the focus in terms of different
people and
their priorities kind of
changed. Ultimately,

39:47.885 --> 39:51.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my takeaway from that -- and
Thomas Edison
said this more than a century
ago.

39:51.923 --> 39:57.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vision without execution is
hallucination.
Having the idea is important,
but being able

39:57.829 --> 40:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to execute against the idea is
more important.
That ultimately comes down to
people and trust

40:02.133 --> 40:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and kind of getting people to
work together
in a collaborative way.

40:04.502 --> 40:08.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Give us a better
sense of what
you mean by the Internet of
everything, which

40:08.906 --> 40:10.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is what you're saying it's going
to be?

40:10.808 --> 40:13.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because, right now, people think
of the Internet,
and they think about the device
they carry

40:13.244 --> 40:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around in their hand or that
YouTube video
or something, participating in
social media.

40:19.517 --> 40:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you're saying it is going to
be embedded
in the way we live, in our
education, in health

40:23.688 --> 40:25.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care, in everything.

40:25.290 --> 40:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE CASE: The third wave is
really much
more of an invisible Internet.

40:28.493 --> 40:33.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people do talk about the
Internet of things,
which are devices and sensors to
track health

40:33.231 --> 40:37.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and energy and things like that.
And that
will be part of it, but as this
really cuts

40:37.502 --> 40:41.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across all aspects of our lives,
and really
cuts across all industries in
the economy,

40:41.839 --> 40:44.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it really is going to be much
bigger than
the Internet of things, which is
why talk

40:45.043 --> 40:46.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about it as sort of the Internet
of everything.

40:46.844 --> 40:50.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How are we
changing as people,
do you think, because of the
Internet?

40:50.281 --> 40:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE CASE: It's amazing to see
what has happened
in the last 30 years, in terms
of how it's

40:53.651 --> 40:56.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
empowered people, not just in
this country,
but all around the world.

40:56.220 --> 40:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the third wave, I think
it's going
to take the next step. And as
you really think

40:59.424 --> 41:02.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about how do you learn
differently, how do
your kids learn differently, not
everybody

41:02.760 --> 41:06.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learns the same way. And we kind
of teach
them the same way. So more
personalized, adaptive

41:06.397 --> 41:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approaches to learning is going
to be part
of that.

41:08.933 --> 41:12.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And health, there are different
ways to stay
healthy, different ways to
manage chronic

41:12.937 --> 41:17.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disease, different ways to think
about life-threatening
diseases. Right now, it is a
little bit too

41:17.608 --> 41:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one size fits all. I actually
think the third
wave is going to be the most
striking in terms

41:21.813 --> 41:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of really impact on people's
lives, impact
on society, as well as the
impact on business.

41:26.784 --> 41:31.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you see
maintaining the
human component in that, that
people are still

41:31.556 --> 41:35.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to have human
relationships, that they
are going to have time for each
other?

41:35.226 --> 41:38.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE CASE: I think maybe more
so in the third
wave, because some of the things
like education,

41:38.963 --> 41:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it could be a more personalized
experience
around learning based on your
interest and

41:42.600 --> 41:44.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your best way to learn.

41:44.602 --> 41:48.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In health, similarly, it can be
a more personalized
approach to understanding your
own issues

41:49.006 --> 41:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what opportunities you have
or what risks
you have and dealing with that
in a much more

41:53.745 --> 41:55.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
personalized kind of way.

41:55.480 --> 41:58.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Entrepreneurs are not just
Silicon Valley
or New York City or Boston. It's
starting

41:58.750 --> 42:03.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to happen all across the
country, particularly
young impact entrepreneurs that
want to build

42:03.488 --> 42:07.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
businesses, not just focused on
profit, but
focused on purpose. And they
want to focus

42:07.392 --> 42:11.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on creating jobs, so there is
this passion
about in the third wave taking
it to the next

42:11.829 --> 42:12.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
level.

42:13.097 --> 42:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am very excited and very
optimistic about
that future.

42:15.166 --> 42:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last question. Is
everybody
going to be able to participate
in this, or

42:20.238 --> 42:24.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is there going to be sort of the
haves who
have got all the technology and
those who

42:24.142 --> 42:26.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are left behind and are going to
be much slower
to realize it?

42:26.844 --> 42:29.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE CASE: Well, even 30 years
ago, when
we got started and virtually
everybody was

42:29.514 --> 42:33.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disconnected, we were really
concerned as
it grew about the digital
divide. How do you

42:33.151 --> 42:35.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make sure everybody is
connected?

42:35.219 --> 42:38.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is going to be a challenge
in the third
wave as well. But some of that
is also democratizing

42:39.056 --> 42:44.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access to entrepreneurship, so
anybody with
an idea has a shot, so the rise
of the rest

42:44.295 --> 42:48.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think will help level that
playing field.
Inclusive entrepreneurship will
help level

42:48.299 --> 42:52.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that playing field, different
kinds of entrepreneurs
with different kind of ideas
challenging the

42:53.037 --> 42:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
status quo, saying there is a
better way,
and using the third wave as a
new paradigm

42:58.042 --> 42:59.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to think about the future.

42:59.510 --> 43:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steve Case still
thinking about
the future.

43:02.380 --> 43:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The book is "The Third Wave: An
Entrepreneur's
Vision of the Future."

43:06.551 --> 43:09.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you very much for coming
in.

43:09.253 --> 43:15.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVE CASE: Thank you.

43:15.827 --> 43:21.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight, we want
to leave you once more with
Prince at his

43:22.099 --> 43:26.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
best. During his 2004 induction
into the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame, Prince
played a guitar

43:26.270 --> 43:31.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solo during a rendition of
"While My Guitar
Gently Weeps," alongside Tom
Petty and Steve

43:31.909 --> 43:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Winwood, part of a tribute to
the Beatles'
George Harrison.

43:35.580 --> 43:40.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On his passing, the museum said
of Prince
-- quote -- "He rewrote the
rules, taking

43:40.284 --> 43:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the traditions of funk, soul,
hard rock and
dance to forge his own sound."

43:44.989 --> 44:05.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(MUSIC)

44:05.376 --> 44:48.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that's the
"NewsHour"
