ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO, I MEAN, HE'S SAID BEFORE,

05:21.688 --> 05:22.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MOST RECENTLY, I THINK, IN

05:22.923 --> 05:25.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS CONFIRMATION HEARINGS IN THE

05:25.325 --> 05:27.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATE, THAT THIS IDEA OF

05:27.994 --> 05:28.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCERTAINTY-- WE DON'T REALLY

05:28.895 --> 05:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW HOW MUCH OF THE WARMING OF

05:31.097 --> 05:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PLANET IS DRIVEN BY HUMAN

05:32.632 --> 05:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIVITY.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WHAT HE SAID THE OTHER

05:34.434 --> 05:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAY WAS A STEP FURTHER THAN THAT

05:35.869 --> 05:38.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY SAYING, "I DON'T BELIEVE THAT

05:38.305 --> 05:40.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMANS ARE THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF

05:41.675 --> 05:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT IS A DEGREE FURTHER, AND I

05:42.909 --> 05:44.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT'S WHY YOU SAW A LOT

05:44.177 --> 05:45.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE BACKLASH THAT MR. PRUITT

05:45.745 --> 05:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:50.917 --> 05:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT WAS SWIFT.

05:52.886 --> 05:55.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY POINTED OUT, CORRECTLY SO,

05:55.055 --> 05:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DECADES OF RESEARCH POINT

05:58.191 --> 06:00.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HUMAN ACTIVITY AS BEING THE

06:00.360 --> 06:02.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIMARY DRIVER, AND THIS IS TRUE

06:02.629 --> 06:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH RESEARCHERS AT PLACES

06:05.065 --> 06:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INTERNATIONAL GROUPS OF

06:14.140 --> 06:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL FOR MANY DECADES NOW.

06:16.743 --> 06:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INTERESTING THING IS THAT IT

06:18.144 --> 06:19.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T JUST PUT HIM AT ODDS WITH

06:19.980 --> 06:21.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WARMING IN THIS WAY AND THAT

06:28.021 --> 06:29.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO

07:56.309 --> 07:57.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN PART, IT'S A GOOD

07:57.844 --> 07:58.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT

07:58.912 --> 07:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MOVING PARTS.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS I MENTIONED, THE CLEAN POWER

08:01.247 --> 08:02.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLANT IS TIED UP IN THE FEDERAL

08:02.449 --> 08:04.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURTS RIGHT NOW, AND YET,

08:04.818 --> 08:06.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARBON EMISSIONS HAVE FALLEN,

08:06.119 --> 08:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT OF STATES ARE ON PACE

08:08.054 --> 08:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO MEET THE TARGETS THAT THAT

08:09.222 --> 08:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SETS.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IN SOME WAYS, THE MARKET IS

08:12.726 --> 08:14.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DICTATING SOME OF THIS-- WIND

08:18.565 --> 08:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SOME EXTENT IT'S OUT OF THE

GOVERNMENT'S HANDS.

CLEAR.

VERY DIFFERENT TYPE OF HATRED.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IRAQI POLITICS.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE OTHER IS THIS KIND OF

11:02.161 --> 11:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLOBAL CALIPHATE IDEA THAT'S

11:04.030 --> 11:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENERGIZING PEOPLE IN MANY

DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND THAT

11:07.166 --> 11:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OVER ORDERLY FASHION, THAT'S

20:19.652 --> 20:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OKAY.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE

20:21.821 --> 20:23.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A HUGE ROLE TO PLAY AND ALSO THE

PRIVATE SECTOR.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD THERE'S A

20:26.025 --> 20:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVELY DISCUSSION GOING ON ABOUT

20:28.727 --> 20:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW WE CAN USE MORE

20:33.399 --> 20:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DO YOU

20:34.166 --> 20:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE THE THINKING ABOUT THIS?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT'S NOT VERY SEXY TO

20:38.037 --> 20:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUND A NEW WATER MAIN OR WASTE

20:40.940 --> 20:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER SYSTEM THAT'S CRUCIAL.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YET, WE START TO THINK ABOUT

20:44.143 --> 20:46.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IN VERY SPECIFIC TERMS WHEN

20:46.979 --> 20:48.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A DAM THAT'S ABOUT TO

20:48.314 --> 20:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BREAK OR WHEN THERE'S A BRIDGE

20:49.715 --> 20:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT JUST COLLAPSED.

20:50.950 --> 20:51.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:51.951 --> 20:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUR WATER SUPPLY, YOUR BRIDGES,

20:54.386 --> 20:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUR TUNNELS, UNTIL THEY'RE

20:55.454 --> 20:56.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUDDENLY NOT THERE.

20:56.922 --> 20:57.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY IN THIS REGION, WE'VE

20:57.923 --> 20:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEN A NUMBER OF-- I SHOULD

20:59.625 --> 21:00.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT OUT TRANSIT WAS THE LOWEST

21:00.926 --> 21:02.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADED, "D-MINUS," ACROSS THE

COUNTRY, CERTAINLY HERE IN THE

21:13.873 --> 21:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S A WAKE-UP CALL FOR THE

21:15.608 --> 21:16.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE NEED TO REALIZE THIS

21:17.543 --> 21:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUE IS ALREADY COSTING EACH

FAMILY $9 A DAY.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT OUR ECONOMIC STUDIES

21:23.282 --> 21:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUGGEST IS THAT FOR AN

21:24.383 --> 21:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTMENT OF JUST $3 A DAY

21:25.951 --> 21:27.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PER FAMILY, YOU COULD ELIMINATE

21:27.820 --> 21:29.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DRAG ON THE ECONOMY, AND

21:29.488 --> 21:30.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF WE DON'T WE'RE PUTTING AT

21:30.956 --> 21:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RISK 2.5 MILLION JOBS BY 2025

DANGER.

22:00.920 --> 22:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
