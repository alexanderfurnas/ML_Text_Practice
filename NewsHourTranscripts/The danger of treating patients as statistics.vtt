JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
Often lost in the health care
debate are the individual

00:05.066 --> 00:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stories of fear and
uncertainty that come
with a medical diagnosis.

Elizabeth Silver is
an author and attorney
who was unexpectedly
plunged into a world

00:15.033 --> 00:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of statistics and probability.

00:17.566 --> 00:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She offers her Humble Opinion
on how to consider a prognosis.

ELIZABETH SILVER, Author, "The
Tincture of Time": When my
daughter was six weeks old,

00:26.400 --> 00:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she suffered a serious stroke
and spent two weeks in the
neonatal intensive care unit.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As new parents, my husband
and I spent that time beside
her, waiting for answers and,

00:37.733 --> 00:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the end, were given very few.

00:40.166 --> 00:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At home, with a single click,
we could watch videos, read
articles, and, most importantly,

00:47.166 --> 00:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stumble across numbers
that would send us either
rejoicing or panicking.

00:50.700 --> 00:54.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Like many parents, we
had nothing to hold
onto but statistics.

00:54.966 --> 00:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to one I read, her
stroke carried a 20 percent
chance of death and 90 percent

00:59.700 --> 01:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chance of severe
neurological damage.

01:02.533 --> 01:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I focused on the 90 percent,
and imagined very different
versions of our lives.

01:09.466 --> 01:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the next year, as we
weaved in and out of doctors'
offices, I recalled the aphorism

01:14.266 --> 01:17.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that physicians are
supposed to treat the
patient, not the paper.

01:17.066 --> 01:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hippocrates, the ancient Greek
philosopher and physician,
said that it is more important

01:21.833 --> 01:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to know what sort of person
has a disease than to know
what sort of disease a person

01:26.233 --> 01:27.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
has.

01:27.933 --> 01:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In other words, we must
remember that patients
are people with stories.

01:31.700 --> 01:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I took a step back and began
looking at these statistics,
these abstract medical studies

01:38.733 --> 01:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and numbers, and started to
view them just as I would
a story, a novel or a film.

01:44.600 --> 01:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
After all, a statistic is only
a particular version of a story.

01:48.766 --> 01:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as with all
stories, there are always
multiple perspectives
and multiple truths.

01:55.700 --> 01:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can analyze them
like literature: When
was that statistic taken?

01:58.633 --> 01:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who was the source group?

01:59.700 --> 02:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Was it self-selecting?

02:01.600 --> 02:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What else do the
subjects have in common?

02:04.533 --> 02:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When looking at a statistic
in a medical study,
you don't have the full
picture of your prognosis,

02:09.533 --> 02:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
unless you have every
perspective, every
detail in the story.

02:14.033 --> 02:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is something you
will never get from a number.

02:18.900 --> 02:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three years later, my daughter
escaped all her damning
statistics and is living a full,

02:25.100 --> 02:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happy life, as if
it never happened.

02:27.633 --> 02:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I look closer at her
story in its totality,
those statistics didn't
differentiate based

02:32.166 --> 02:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on age, my prenatal
care, or even the actual
size of the stroke.

02:39.133 --> 02:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all know that statistics
are useful, but if we rely on
them with too much weight, this

02:44.933 --> 02:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can only lead to a breakdown
of trust with medicine.

02:47.533 --> 02:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We end up focusing on the 90
percent chance of things going
wrong, and, in the process,

02:53.900 --> 02:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neglect the 10 percent
chance of things going right.

02:56.666 --> 03:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Perhaps my daughter's story
might one day be counted in a
future study, and her success

03:01.566 --> 03:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will serve as a tick
against those frightening,
bigger numbers, because
there is an alternate

03:08.166 --> 03:11.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ending that includes
the full picture, and
it can be beautiful.

03:11.666 --> 03:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
