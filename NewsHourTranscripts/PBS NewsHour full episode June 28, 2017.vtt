JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.733 --> 00:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.233 --> 00:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: the
Senate scramble on health care.

00:10.833 --> 00:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans struggle to
make changes to win enough
votes to replace Obamacare.

00:17.833 --> 00:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk with one senator
at the center of the storm,
John Thune of South Dakota.

00:22.466 --> 00:26.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then: Most Americans
disapprove of the GOP's
handling of health care.

00:28.266 --> 00:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our "PBS NewsHour"/NPR/MARIST
poll has the latest
on public sentiment of
the Trump presidency.

00:34.566 --> 00:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And one side effect of summer:
a spike in Lyme disease.

00:39.433 --> 00:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles O'Brien looks at
why there is a vaccine
for dogs, but not humans.

00:43.333 --> 00:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN O'BELL, Veterinarian:
When I pull ticks off of my
children, I wish that I had some

00:50.366 --> 00:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
easy options like vaccination
or prevention, like I can
give for my dogs, because it's

00:54.866 --> 00:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an issue for people
and their pets alike.

00:56.833 --> 00:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:59.933 --> 01:04.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.300 --> 01:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate Republican
leaders have spent this day
behind closed doors trying

01:17.033 --> 01:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win over more of
their own members in the
health care reform fight.

01:21.833 --> 01:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
has delayed any action until
after the Fourth of July

01:28.800 --> 01:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recess, but a spokesman says
he hopes to have a revised
bill as soon as Friday.

01:33.900 --> 01:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the White House, President
Trump suggested the effort is
working along very well, despite

01:37.500 --> 01:39.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the obstacles.

01:39.000 --> 01:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: It's very tough.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Every state is different.

01:41.133 --> 01:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Every senator is different.

01:43.166 --> 01:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have to tell you, the
Republican senators had a really
impressive meeting yesterday

01:48.266 --> 01:50.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the White House.

01:50.433 --> 01:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we're going to get at
least very close, and I think
we're going to get it over the

01:55.066 --> 01:57.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
line.

01:57.733 --> 01:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, the
president told reporters
- - quote -- "We're going
to have a big surprise

01:58.433 --> 01:59.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on health care."

01:59.400 --> 02:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He didn't say what that meant.

02:01.566 --> 02:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will hear about all of this
from Republican Senator John
Thune after the news summary.

02:08.500 --> 02:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's former
campaign chairman has
registered, retroactively,
as a foreign agent.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Manafort filed papers
Tuesday that show his firm was
paid more than $17 million by

02:19.900 --> 02:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a pro-Russian political
party in Ukraine.

02:23.500 --> 02:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He resigned from the Trump
campaign last August, when word
of his consulting work leaked.

02:30.466 --> 02:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In March of this year, Michael
Flynn, who had been fired
as the president's national

02:33.433 --> 02:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security adviser, also
registered as a foreign agent.

02:38.233 --> 02:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Businesses and governments
around the globe spent a second
day battling a cyber-attack.

02:43.066 --> 02:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The so-called ransomware assault
eased some today, but in the
U.S., a subsidiary of FedEx

02:50.033 --> 02:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was disrupted, and a
Cadbury chocolate factory in
Australia had to shut down.

02:56.300 --> 03:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In London, British Defense
Secretary Michael Fallon said
it is verging on an act of war.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON, U.K. Defense
Secretary: State or nonstate
entities, lurking behind a veil

03:05.733 --> 03:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of encryption, targeting
our national infrastructure,
as we saw with the
recent cyber-strike on

03:12.833 --> 03:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Parliament itself,
that isn't a cold war.

03:16.866 --> 03:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a gray war, permanently
teetering on the edge
of outright hostility.

03:23.866 --> 03:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The outbreak
began in Ukraine, where it has
done the most damage so far.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will take a closer
look later in the program.

03:30.666 --> 03:35.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The months-long unrest
in Venezuela took a
dramatic turn overnight.

03:35.100 --> 03:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government says that a
police helicopter opened fire
on the nation's Supreme Court

03:40.833 --> 03:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Interior Ministry.

03:42.833 --> 03:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amateur video captured
images of the helicopter,
before it disappeared.

03:47.033 --> 03:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials charged the
mastermind of the plot was a
rogue police pilot and actor.

03:54.066 --> 03:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Opponents of socialist President
Nicolas Maduro suggested that
the raid could be a government

03:58.766 --> 04:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ploy to justify
increased repression.

04:01.933 --> 04:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former members of Colombia's
largest rebel group now face
the challenge of reintegrating

04:07.533 --> 04:09.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into society.

04:09.933 --> 04:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one-time fighters
of the FARC surrendered
their weapons at a
disarmament camp on Tuesday.

04:14.466 --> 04:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
U.N. inspectors
supervised the ceremony.

04:17.166 --> 04:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rebels staged a peace
agreement last year,
after decades of fighting.

04:24.133 --> 04:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Liverpool, England, six
people, most of them police
officials, were charged today

04:27.433 --> 04:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a 1989 soccer
stadium disaster.

04:30.500 --> 04:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are accused of offenses
ranging from negligence to
manslaughter in the deaths of

04:36.466 --> 04:38.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
96 people.

04:38.500 --> 04:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The victims were crushed when
thousands of people rushed
into a crowded section of a

04:43.533 --> 04:45.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stadium.

04:45.600 --> 04:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police blamed rowdy fans,
but the families finally
won a new investigation.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TREVOR HICKS, Father of
Victims: I mean, there
are no winners in this.

04:51.800 --> 04:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It doesn't bring anybody
back from the disaster.

04:54.233 --> 04:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what it does do, it sends a
message out of accountability,
as we keep saying, that

05:00.933 --> 05:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
nobody, but nobody is
above the law, be it the
police or anybody else.

05:02.966 --> 05:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The accused
include the man who was leading
police operations at the stadium

05:07.866 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that day.

05:09.833 --> 05:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, the
Homeland Security Department
announced that it's stepping up

05:13.433 --> 05:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security measures for
flights coming into the U.S.

05:17.133 --> 05:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They include enhanced
screening of electronic
devices and passengers.

05:21.933 --> 05:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Airlines that comply could
be exempt from an earlier
ban on carry-on laptops.

05:28.500 --> 05:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Those that don't comply
may face a total ban
on electronic devices.

05:34.366 --> 05:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wall Street rallied today behind
financial and tech stocks.

05:37.133 --> 05:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial
average gained nearly 144
points to close at 21454.

05:43.866 --> 05:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose 87, and
the S&amp;P 500 added 21.

05:51.400 --> 05:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Michael Bond, creator
of the beloved children's
literary character
Paddington Bear, has died

05:55.433 --> 05:57.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Britain.

05:57.400 --> 06:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bond first introduced the
marmalade-loving teddy in "A
Bear Called Paddington" in 1958.

06:03.766 --> 06:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That led ultimately to more
than 20 books, several TV
shows and a 2014 movie.

06:09.766 --> 06:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Michael Bond was 91 years old.

06:11.966 --> 06:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Republican senators speed
up their efforts to revise

06:18.900 --> 06:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the GOP's health care bill; new
poll numbers reveal what the
nation thinks about that and

06:23.866 --> 06:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president; a massive
cyber-attack spreads throughout
the globe; and much more.

06:30.300 --> 06:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's a question.

06:37.866 --> 06:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's next in the
Republican effort to repeal
and replace Obamacare?

06:44.833 --> 06:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke short time ago with
one of the senators who helped
write the now-delayed bill, John

06:50.266 --> 06:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thune of South Dakota.

06:52.233 --> 06:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is chairman of the Republican
Conference, making him the
third-ranking Republican in

06:56.433 --> 06:57.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Senate.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Thune, thank
you for joining us.

06:59.966 --> 07:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to start out asking
you where the negotiations
stand this afternoon.

07:03.633 --> 07:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president acknowledged
today that it's going to be
very tough, but then he went on

07:07.700 --> 07:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to say there's a
big surprise coming.

07:09.600 --> 07:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you know what he
was talking about?

07:10.666 --> 07:11.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:11.666 --> 07:13.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:13.666 --> 07:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN THUNE (R), South Dakota:
Well, I'm not sure what that
is, Judy, but thank you.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's nice to be with you.

07:17.166 --> 07:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the state of
negotiations at the moment
are we're still having
conversations and working

07:22.300 --> 07:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through the issues that right
now are, I think, keeping us
from getting to a consensus, and

07:26.933 --> 07:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope that eventually we will
be able to work through those.

07:29.400 --> 07:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's the next few days.

07:31.466 --> 07:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the goal is, as
much as we can, have at least
sort of a framework in place

07:35.100 --> 07:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the end of the week that we
can send to the Congressional
Budget Office to get scoring

07:39.500 --> 07:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back, so that when we come
back after the Fourth of July
break next week, the following

07:46.500 --> 07:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week, we can move a bill to
the floor, get it up and get
to work on it and open up the

07:49.300 --> 07:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amendment process and
hopefully eventually pass it.

07:51.533 --> 07:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is the
bigger challenge, Senator?

07:54.400 --> 07:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Is it appealing to
the moderates, who
believe that the cuts in
Medicaid and other parts

08:01.933 --> 08:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the bill are too
hard on those with lower
income, or is it the more
conservative members,

08:04.333 --> 08:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who want a bigger
repeal of Obamacare?

08:06.533 --> 08:07.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:07.733 --> 08:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN THUNE: It's kind
of a combination.

08:09.866 --> 08:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's really -- you know,
there are some things, Judy,
in this process that you can

08:13.133 --> 08:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dial back and forth.

08:15.200 --> 08:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have been trying to
turn those dials as much as we
can to bring people on board.

08:19.733 --> 08:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we do have the more
conservative members
in our conference who
have specific things

08:25.900 --> 08:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they want to see
addressed in this bill.

08:27.933 --> 08:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we have got more
moderate members who, as you
mentioned, are concerned about

08:31.466 --> 08:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Medicaid and trying to put, you
know, the final touches on that.

08:36.133 --> 08:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
pick up on the Medicaid point,
because we are hearing today

08:39.333 --> 08:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from more health care experts
who say these Medicaid changes
would force the states to

08:46.200 --> 08:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make some very tough
decisions about what
they're going to pay for.

08:48.700 --> 08:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They talk about things
like in-home services
for the elderly, for
people with disabilities.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they say those could be
in very serious jeopardy.

08:57.733 --> 08:59.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:59.733 --> 09:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Well, look, I think
the thing with Medicare --
and a lot of this -- I should

09:02.333 --> 09:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, with Medicaid -- and this
is going to depend -- states
are going to be in a position

09:05.633 --> 09:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have a lot of flexibility.

09:07.666 --> 09:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What this basically does is
allows them to choose the two
base years that they would

09:10.633 --> 09:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
calculate current their
reimbursement levels on.

09:14.500 --> 09:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a separate
reimbursement for elderly,
so for nursing home
recipients, another one

09:21.466 --> 09:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the blind and disabled,
another one for children, and
yet another one for able-bodied

09:24.933 --> 09:27.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
adults.

09:27.033 --> 09:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they all have per-capita
allotments based upon what the
states are experiencing today

09:30.700 --> 09:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in terms of Medicaid costs.

09:32.633 --> 09:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then those are inflated
over the years, the next
decade, increased at the rate of

09:36.500 --> 09:38.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inflation.

09:38.533 --> 09:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they have to figure
out how to take those dollars
and put them to the best use

09:41.900 --> 09:43.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the state.

09:43.966 --> 09:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of state by state, the Center
for American Progress took

09:46.900 --> 09:48.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those CBO numbers.

09:48.466 --> 09:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They broke them down by state.

09:50.266 --> 09:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They looked at South
Dakota, your home state.

09:53.966 --> 09:58.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They determined that
almost 64,000 fewer
South Dakotans would be
covered under the Senate

10:01.400 --> 10:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan by 2026 than if
the ACA remained in
effect, and that includes
something like 40,000 on

10:06.700 --> 10:10.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid, 24,000 on
the individual market.

10:10.466 --> 10:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How would you deal with that?

10:11.666 --> 10:13.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Well, I don't
know how they would - - how
they came up with that number.

10:15.600 --> 10:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In my state of South Dakota,
we weren't an expansion state.

10:18.666 --> 10:23.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we currently operate
the Medicaid program in
a fairly cost-effective
and efficient way.

10:25.133 --> 10:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
People in the individual
marketplace should
have more options.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The plan that we -- the
discussion draft that
we have out there today,
which is in the process,

10:31.633 --> 10:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of course, of being modified,
actually opens up for people
who are zero percent to 100

10:36.233 --> 10:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of the federal
poverty level, not eligible
for Medicaid, would
open up the opportunity

10:40.733 --> 10:45.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for them to purchase
insurance with help from
the federal government.

10:45.566 --> 10:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And in my state,
that's 37,000 people.

10:47.633 --> 10:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there are 37,000 people
today who don't have access
to health insurance that would

10:54.566 --> 10:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under the proposal that --
the discussion draft at least
that is out there today.

10:56.733 --> 11:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another subject,
Senator, a lot of reporting
in the last few days about

11:00.500 --> 11:02.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Trump's
role in all this.

11:02.800 --> 11:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A number of reports saying the
president is not as steeped
in the details as he might

11:09.866 --> 11:13.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
otherwise be, and that
he doesn't have a strong
view of how this should
come out, that mainly

11:14.933 --> 11:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his view is he just wants
to see something passed.

11:16.933 --> 11:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is your how -- would you
describe the president's role?

11:19.500 --> 11:20.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:20.733 --> 11:22.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN THUNE: I think
he does want a result.

11:22.700 --> 11:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He clearly, in the meeting that
we had about him yesterday,
was trying to sort of push

11:26.766 --> 11:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the process along, realizing
that the Senate has a
role to play and that
there are differences

11:31.333 --> 11:33.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of opinion.

11:33.433 --> 11:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think he got a flavor
yesterday for what we have
been hearing in our meetings

11:36.300 --> 11:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Republican Senators,
because some of those
differences came out.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think the
president is engaged.

11:42.566 --> 11:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's, obviously, talking to
individual senators about
their specific concerns.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's talking to
groups of senators.

11:49.266 --> 11:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He had all of us
down there yesterday.

11:50.633 --> 11:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: So I think he
wants to get a result, Judy.

11:55.266 --> 11:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think he wants it to be
a health care plan, proposal
that we can go out there and

12:00.300 --> 12:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
defend and that he can
defend and argue for
to the American people.

12:02.566 --> 12:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't -- I still think
we're going to get there.

12:04.700 --> 12:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last weekend,
I'm sure you know, there was
a pro-Trump political action

12:09.166 --> 12:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
committee that ran an attack
ad, essentially, against Senator
Dean Heller of Nevada, who

12:14.133 --> 12:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was at that point
expressing concerns about
the health care bill.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reporting is that
Leader McConnell called the
White House, said that this was

12:23.200 --> 12:25.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stupid to do.

12:25.733 --> 12:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this something that you and
other Republicans have let the
White House know you don't want

12:32.500 --> 12:34.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them to do?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, what are you saying
to the White House about this?

12:35.633 --> 12:37.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:37.733 --> 12:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: I think it's been
conveyed in pretty uncertain
-- I should say certain terms

12:41.033 --> 12:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that, that's a bad idea.

12:44.966 --> 12:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Particularly in the middle
of a discussion where you're
trying to get to a result on

12:47.533 --> 12:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a major consequential issue
like this, you don't want to
have one of your own members

12:52.033 --> 12:54.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being attacked.

12:54.133 --> 12:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to get to 50, but that
works a lot better if members
are allowed to be able to

13:00.233 --> 13:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
discuss it with their
colleagues, with their
constituents, and not
have the threat of a

13:04.733 --> 13:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
political campaign hanging
out there over their head.

13:07.000 --> 13:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally,
just quickly, Senator Thune, any
serious discussion of including

13:11.633 --> 13:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats in these
deliberations?

13:13.566 --> 13:15.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:15.566 --> 13:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: It's my preferred
working style here is to
have bipartisan legislation.

13:19.100 --> 13:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what the Democrats have
made clear is that they don't
want to deal with anything

13:22.933 --> 13:25.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that repeals and
replaces Obamacare.

13:25.400 --> 13:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they wouldn't want
to do anything that gets rid
of the mandates, which is a

13:28.800 --> 13:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big part of our proposal,
getting rid of the
individual employer mandates.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They would want
to keep the taxes.

13:34.333 --> 13:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want to do away
with taxes that are driving
up the costs of premiums.

13:37.933 --> 13:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it would be hard to
see a scenario where Democrats
would be willing to come to

13:44.833 --> 13:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the table in good faith and
actually work with us on a
solution that meets those -- you

13:47.400 --> 13:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
know, those requirements.

13:49.833 --> 13:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator
John Thune, a member
of the Republican
leadership, thank you very

13:53.933 --> 13:55.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

13:55.333 --> 13:56.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:56.766 --> 14:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN THUNE: Thanks, Judy.

14:03.800 --> 14:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The "NewsHour,"
in partnership with the Marist
Institute for Public Opinion

14:09.533 --> 14:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and NPR, is out with a new
poll that looks at Americans'
opinions on President Trump,

14:15.700 --> 14:17.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health care, the
economy and more.

14:17.766 --> 14:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me now to dig into
the results are Lee Miringoff
of Marist and Amy Walter of

14:23.633 --> 14:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Cook Political Report.

14:25.433 --> 14:26.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lee, I'm going to
start with you.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's look at one of the
questions, first, about the
Republican health care plan...

14:31.500 --> 14:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LEE MIRINGOFF, Director,
Marist Institute for
Public Opinion: Sure.

14:32.700 --> 14:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
... in the Senate.

14:34.133 --> 14:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the plan the
president is pushing for.

14:35.533 --> 14:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You asked people their
assessment of the Senate plan.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you find?

14:40.133 --> 14:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEE MIRINGOFF: Well, it was very
poor in terms of public opinion.

14:43.966 --> 14:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's fascinating in the
numbers is even a plurality of
Republicans around the nation

14:50.466 --> 14:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are unsure on terms of the
Senate health care plan.

14:54.166 --> 14:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the Republicans took a very
big risk going forward with
something when they didn't even

15:00.600 --> 15:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have their core following
solidly behind them.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think the proof
is in the results.

15:05.966 --> 15:08.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Democrats,
obviously, were opposed.

15:08.300 --> 15:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Independents have been scurrying
away from the Republicans
and questioning President

15:14.733 --> 15:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump and Republicans in
Congress in greater numbers.

15:18.300 --> 15:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, as far as the health care
proposal is concerned, it
clearly didn't have the kind

15:25.300 --> 15:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of support that you would want
to go forward with if you're
trying to make such a major

15:30.533 --> 15:32.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just to quickly
go over the numbers, approval
overall, 17 percent of the

15:35.000 --> 15:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senate plan,
disapproval, 55 percent.

15:37.966 --> 15:42.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then when you ask
people if they approved
of the way Republicans
in Congress are handling

15:42.266 --> 15:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
health care, it was 21
percent approval, 65
percent disapproval.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Amy, what does
all this tell you?

15:49.633 --> 15:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Yes.

15:51.666 --> 15:54.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, Lee makes a very
good point that, even
among Republicans,
there's not a tremendous

15:54.500 --> 15:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
amount of support, not only
for the bill, but for the way
that Republicans in Congress

15:58.600 --> 16:00.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are handling it.

16:00.766 --> 16:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a very small plurality
of Republicans said they like
the job that Republicans in

16:05.700 --> 16:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congress are doing on this.

16:07.700 --> 16:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quite frankly, Republicans
have not done a very good job
shaping and defining this bill.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's being defined by what it
isn't as much as by what it is.

16:14.833 --> 16:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's pretty clear
in the polling data
that we're seeing here.

16:19.400 --> 16:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other interesting thing that
I found in this poll was that,
when they asked the question

16:24.100 --> 16:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about who would you blame
if this all falls apart, if
there's no repeal of Obamacare,

16:31.100 --> 16:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and most Americans -- this is
true of Democrat, Republican,
independent -- they don't blame

16:34.900 --> 16:36.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

16:36.966 --> 16:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They either blame Republicans
-- independents and Democrats
say they would blame Republicans

16:39.666 --> 16:41.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Congress.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans say they
blame Democrats mostly.

16:43.466 --> 16:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Trump gets
very little blame.

16:45.466 --> 16:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEE MIRINGOFF: What is really
interesting is that although
Obamacare really doesn't

16:48.533 --> 16:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a champion right now, most
of the talk has been how to
replace and repeal, it remains

16:54.933 --> 16:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
popular with Americans.

16:57.166 --> 17:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think -- so the
Republican proposal not
only wasn't well-organized.

17:00.966 --> 17:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It really flew in the face
of what public opinion is, so
really going uphill on this.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think that's why
they have had such a
difficult time with it.

17:09.433 --> 17:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lee, you
also asked the generic question,
what do people think of

17:12.600 --> 17:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the job the president is doing?

17:15.100 --> 17:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think, not
surprising, along party
lines, a large majority
of Republicans like what

17:20.100 --> 17:22.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's doing.

17:22.033 --> 17:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A large majority of Democrats
dislike it, but among
independents, some interesting,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interesting results.

17:28.100 --> 17:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEE MIRINGOFF: Yes, and the
independents are the group,
of course, in the middle.

17:32.133 --> 17:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, they're much more
like Democrats right now than
Republicans in terms of their

17:38.333 --> 17:40.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attitude.

17:40.366 --> 17:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have grown in their
disapproval of President Trump
since the first poll right

17:45.066 --> 17:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after he took office.

17:47.066 --> 17:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now almost 60 percent
of independents have a
negative view of him.

17:52.166 --> 17:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those numbers have gone
up, the negative numbers have.

17:55.066 --> 17:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there's a real question on
their part about the direction
the country is going in and

17:59.833 --> 18:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of other concerns that
they have on an issue-by-issue
basis, health care being

18:04.766 --> 18:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one, but others of concern
to independents as well.

18:08.966 --> 18:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They were willing to
give him the benefit
of the doubt initially,
but that has certainly

18:13.566 --> 18:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
evaporated, and whatever
political capital he
had with this group,
that's been well spent

18:19.733 --> 18:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - or it has been
spent, I should say.

18:21.766 --> 18:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, what do
you see in these numbers,
especially among independents?

18:24.933 --> 18:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, Lee framed it
perfectly, which is whatever
benefit of the doubt they

18:31.900 --> 18:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be giving -- they may have
been giving the president in
January, and it was a very

18:34.633 --> 18:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thin benefit, it's been
dried up pretty well by now.

18:39.300 --> 18:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're also looking, if
you just think historically
or look historically, at what

18:43.266 --> 18:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it means to have support for
independents this low, and if
you look at the last midterm

18:50.266 --> 18:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elections where a president
had low approval ratings with
independents at this number,

18:53.033 --> 18:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
somewhere between 30 percent,
35 percent approval rating among
independents, they went on to

18:57.633 --> 19:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lose a very large number of
seats in that midterm election.

19:01.266 --> 19:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that really could be the
tipping point for a lot of
these Republicans, too, who are

19:05.400 --> 19:07.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up in 2018.

19:07.466 --> 19:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They may sit in districts that
a Republican carried or that
are Republican-leaning, but

19:10.966 --> 19:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they count on independents
coming over and supporting
the Republican in the November

19:17.200 --> 19:19.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

19:19.666 --> 19:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If those independents are
feeling dissatisfied or
they're feeling dispirited,
or, quite frankly,

19:25.100 --> 19:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're feeling angry --
that's the other important
thing to note about this poll.

19:27.466 --> 19:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just that independents
felt like they didn't
approve of Donald Trump.

19:32.433 --> 19:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their strong disapproval
ratings of Donald Trump are
somewhere -- for President Trump

19:36.433 --> 19:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - are somewhere in the 40
percent range vs. just I think
it's in the teens that strongly

19:42.266 --> 19:44.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
support him.

19:44.866 --> 19:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that intensity of
disapproval is a real - -
should be a real warning
sign for all Republicans,

19:50.100 --> 19:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
especially those
who are up in 2018.

19:52.133 --> 19:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
Lee, you also asked a question
I hadn't seen before, and

19:55.933 --> 20:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was comparing who is a
more effective leader, President
Trump or former President

20:00.766 --> 20:02.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Obama?

20:02.366 --> 20:06.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Thirty-four percent
President Trump, 58
percent President Obama.

20:06.033 --> 20:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess that mirrors overall
support for this president.

20:09.800 --> 20:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEE MIRINGOFF: Yes.

20:11.866 --> 20:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, and former presidents
always look do better after
they have completed their term

20:18.066 --> 20:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in office, but at this
point in President
Obama's administration
in '09, his numbers

20:22.800 --> 20:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were in the mid-50s.

20:24.866 --> 20:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Contrast that with the low
to mid-30s with Donald Trump,
and you see the answer to the

20:29.133 --> 20:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question, why is this president
having such a difficult time
in the court of public opinion?

20:35.533 --> 20:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
fascinating numbers.

20:37.033 --> 20:38.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's more there.

20:38.266 --> 20:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I know everybody
will want to dig in.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can find it all
on our Web site.

20:41.600 --> 20:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the meantime, Lee Miringoff
of Marist, Amy Walter of The
Cook Political Report, thank

20:46.466 --> 20:47.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you both.

20:47.433 --> 20:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEE MIRINGOFF: Thank you, Judy.

20:49.966 --> 20:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just one
more of the poll's findings.

20:52.066 --> 20:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When asked about the president's
financial dealings, 33 percent
of those polled say they

20:58.266 --> 21:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believe he has done
something illegal.

21:00.400 --> 21:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An additional 28 percent
feel he has done something
unethical, but not illegal.

21:06.466 --> 21:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And 31 percent believe he
has done nothing wrong.

21:09.200 --> 21:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our correspondent John Yang
takes a closer look at ethical
concerns over the president's

21:13.633 --> 21:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
business interests
and his unprecedented
early reelection run.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The day President
Trump took the oath of office,
he did something no chief

21:27.066 --> 21:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
executive before him had ever
done on Inauguration Day, filed
the paperwork to be an official

21:34.100 --> 21:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
candidate for reelection.

21:36.933 --> 21:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The move allows him to raise,
money more than $13 million in
the first three months of the

21:44.000 --> 21:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, and hold rallies paid for
by his campaign, like this one
last week in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We're not even
campaigning, and look at this

21:51.266 --> 21:52.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crowd.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: The president
of the United States!

21:54.100 --> 21:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: But he
is campaigning.

21:56.766 --> 22:01.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His first reelection
event was just 29 days
into his presidency.

22:03.800 --> 22:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All five of his campaign-paid
rallies have been in states he
won in last year's election:

22:08.366 --> 22:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Pennsylvania, and Iowa.

22:15.333 --> 22:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Campaign events give him greater
flexibility, like being able
to sell Make America Great

22:21.066 --> 22:23.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Again merchandise.

22:23.533 --> 22:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL STEEL, Republican
Strategist: This is
an opportunity for the
president to spread

22:25.066 --> 22:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his message directly to his most
active and energized supporters.

22:29.066 --> 22:34.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's also an opportunity
to raise money, to
sell merchandise.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In some cases, like the
fund-raiser here in Washington,
it's an opportunity to patronize

22:38.766 --> 22:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his own business establishments.

22:40.833 --> 22:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And I am here to
tell you about our incredible
progress in making America

22:45.966 --> 22:47.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great again.

22:47.433 --> 22:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They have been
vintage Donald Trump.

22:49.133 --> 22:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: We are
going to start taking
care of our country.

22:53.566 --> 22:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And they seem to
boost Mr. Trump's mood, getting
him out of Washington and in

22:59.633 --> 23:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
front of enthusiastic crowds.

23:02.200 --> 23:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, here at the
Trump International Hotel,
just five blocks away
from the White House,

23:09.000 --> 23:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first big fund-raiser of the
2020 campaign, it's benefiting
both the Trump campaign and

23:13.700 --> 23:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republican
National Committee.

23:15.333 --> 23:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The top ticket is
$35,000 a head.

23:20.300 --> 23:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The choice of venue highlights
the flow of campaign cash into
Trump Organization businesses,

23:27.266 --> 23:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a practice, which is legal, of
his first run that continues
in his bid for reelection.

23:33.266 --> 23:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Trump campaign
declined a request to
comment for this story.

23:36.766 --> 23:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But deputy campaign manager
Michael Glassner told the
Associated Press that they chose

23:41.666 --> 23:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Trump Hotel because it's a
premier and convenient location.

23:48.700 --> 23:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has walked away
from day-to-day management of
his hotels, golf courses and

23:53.666 --> 23:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other businesses, placing all
his assets into a trust, of
which he's the sole beneficiary.

23:58.833 --> 24:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ethics lawyer Kenneth Gross
says he's never seen a candidate
pay so much money to his

24:03.333 --> 24:05.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own businesses.

24:05.433 --> 24:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KENNETH GROSS, Ethics
Law Expert: What we saw
during the campaign is
the campaign committee

24:07.833 --> 24:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paying Trump facilities,
whether it's the Trump Hotel
or Mar-a-Lago, or renting space

24:15.033 --> 24:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the Trump Tower in New
York, which it did for the
campaign headquarters, buying

24:21.433 --> 24:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump steaks, Trump vodka,
Trump wine, Trump ice.

24:28.266 --> 24:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this is money from the
campaign that eventually
goes to fatten the
wallets of Trump, Inc.

24:34.766 --> 24:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know of anything illegal
about having a campaign do
a campaign visit at your own

24:42.800 --> 24:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
owned facility, as long
as it's arms-length.

24:45.166 --> 24:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think, from an appearance
standpoint, it's not great.

JOHN YANG: The reelection
campaign spent more
than $6.3 million in
the first three months

24:53.566 --> 24:56.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the year.

24:56.200 --> 24:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than $450,000 of that
went to Trump businesses,
including rent at the
Trump Tower in New York

25:01.633 --> 25:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Trump hotels in New York
and Las Vegas, catering from
Trump restaurants, and thousands

25:07.366 --> 25:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of dollars for
Trump bottled water.

25:09.700 --> 25:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Critics say holding campaign
events at Trump properties
also gives them free publicity

25:14.400 --> 25:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and added prestige.

25:16.733 --> 25:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lawsuit from the Democratic
attorneys general of
Maryland and the District
of Columbia alleges

25:23.333 --> 25:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, since Mr. Trump took
office, goods and services sold
by various Trump businesses

25:27.400 --> 25:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have sold at a premium.

25:29.100 --> 25:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It said room rates at
his D.C. hotel have gone
up hundreds of dollars.

KARL RACINE, D.C. Attorney
General: Never in the history
of this country have we had

25:36.766 --> 25:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a president with these
kinds of extensive business
entanglements or a president who

25:43.200 --> 25:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refused to adequately distance
themselves from their holdings.

25:46.433 --> 25:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: White House Press
Secretary Sean Spicer called
the suit partisan politics.

25:53.433 --> 25:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, at the Trump Hotel
fund-raiser, the only politics
on anybody's mind is likely

25:58.800 --> 26:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be the 2020 campaign, as
the man who rewrote the book on
running for president appears

26:03.566 --> 26:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be trying to rewrite the
book on running for reelection.

26:08.033 --> 26:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
John Yang in Washington.

26:15.233 --> 26:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we
reported earlier, governments
and industries the
world over are trying to

26:25.966 --> 26:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deal with effects of the latest
in a series of cyber-attacks.

26:29.966 --> 26:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The so-called ransomware
assault is the second such
strike in the last six weeks.

26:36.133 --> 26:38.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan in
New York has more.

26:38.600 --> 26:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This
attack originated yesterday
in Ukraine, and rapidly
spread through Europe

26:43.166 --> 26:45.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and beyond.

26:45.233 --> 26:48.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The virus is called
Petya, and it takes
over infected computers,
effectively locking out

26:49.233 --> 26:50.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
users.

26:50.766 --> 26:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A payment is required to return
control of the machine and data.

26:53.433 --> 26:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In early May, a similar
virus called WannaCry spread
to over 150 countries.

27:00.933 --> 27:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This new attack shows
signs of greater technical
sophistication, but
both apparently used,

27:05.966 --> 27:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in part, a tool developed by the
U.S. National Security Agency,
a tool that was leaked into

27:09.733 --> 27:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the open last year.

27:11.766 --> 27:13.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
With me now for more on
this is Rodney Joffe.

27:13.866 --> 27:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the senior vice president
and national security executive
for Neustar, a cyber-security

27:18.800 --> 27:20.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
firm.

27:20.866 --> 27:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rodney, it seems that we have
not learned that much from
what happened two months ago,

27:25.933 --> 27:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it seems that the attackers
have learned a little bit more.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RODNEY JOFFE, Senior
Vice President and Senior
Technologist, Neustar,
Inc.: There's no question

27:29.600 --> 27:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that this is more sophisticated.

27:31.666 --> 27:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we look at the code, when
we look at the mechanism that
was used, this one is much

27:35.800 --> 27:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more sophisticated.

27:37.266 --> 27:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It actually uses three different
vectors we have seen so far.

27:40.400 --> 27:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vector you're talking about
that was used in WannaCry is
the third option that is used

27:46.166 --> 27:48.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by this one.

27:48.233 --> 27:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It uses two others, but
the damage is much more
significant in this case.

27:54.166 --> 27:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not looking like so much
like ransomware anymore, but
it's starting to look like it's

27:59.500 --> 28:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a deliberate attempt to cause
havoc by destroying machines.

28:03.033 --> 28:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is
this something that a
hacker collective would
do, or is this something

28:10.000 --> 28:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that a state government
would be interested in
doing, destabilizing
Ukraine from all of

28:12.866 --> 28:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these companies that do business
with it or pay taxes to it?

28:15.866 --> 28:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RODNEY JOFFE: You know,
it's real tough these
days to tell where the
dividing line is between

28:22.733 --> 28:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the criminals and nation
states, and they really do work
hand in hand, especially in

28:24.933 --> 28:27.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern Europe.

28:27.000 --> 28:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you look this, the
criminals are obviously out
there for financial gain.

28:31.100 --> 28:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was set up in such a way
that there's very little chance
of much in terms of financial

28:36.566 --> 28:38.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gain.

28:38.600 --> 28:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, as of last evening,
by the way, there was $10,500
that had actually paid into this

28:43.566 --> 28:45.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wallet.

28:45.666 --> 28:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I have got to tell
you that the effort that
went into writing the
code and distributing

28:47.266 --> 28:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it clearly cost a lot
more than $10,500.

28:50.466 --> 28:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What
is the measurable impact
on Ukraine going forward?

28:57.500 --> 29:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODNEY JOFFE: I think that the
biggest problem that they're
going to be facing is the fact

29:02.666 --> 29:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the ability to pay taxes to
the state is seriously affected.

29:06.100 --> 29:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have seen images that
were tweeted of things
like supermarkets where
the checkout systems

29:13.333 --> 29:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had been compromised -- and
we're showing the screen.

29:16.666 --> 29:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also see the very large --
obviously, the multinational
shipping line that has now been

29:22.266 --> 29:24.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
affected.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it looks like a deliberate
attempt to cause some kind of
significant financial impact,

29:29.333 --> 29:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not just on the citizens of
Ukraine, but on Ukraine itself.

29:32.866 --> 29:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You
know, when you said
you noticed differences
in the design between

29:36.533 --> 29:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the WannaCry and this, do we
have any indication that paying
these people off actually gets

29:41.266 --> 29:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you your data back, or was it
not even designed to do that?

29:44.066 --> 29:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODNEY JOFFE: Theoretically,
it was designed to do that,
but it's clear so far that the

29:51.100 --> 29:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mechanism that was put in place
to actually collect ransom is
nowhere near the sophistication

29:57.400 --> 29:59.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the malware itself.

29:59.366 --> 30:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you don't think that someone
would have made that kind
of mistake, built something

30:02.766 --> 30:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was very, very effective
to compromise, and no
real ability to collect.

30:09.433 --> 30:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We haven't seen or heard
of anyone so far who has
been able to decrypt it.

30:15.300 --> 30:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we also know is that,
within a very short time after
the malware was discovered,

30:20.266 --> 30:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the single e-mail address
that was needed to communicate
with was actually shut down

30:23.666 --> 30:25.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the provider.

30:25.733 --> 30:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's one reason that I
believe that no one is going
to be able to easily get their

30:30.933 --> 30:33.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
data back.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing is that there
are reports that are surfacing
now, as folks have looked

30:35.900 --> 30:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the code, that there is
at least one bug in the code
that actually makes it so that

30:41.800 --> 30:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
decryption is not possible.

30:43.900 --> 30:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Are the rest
of us basically collateral
damage when it comes to what's

30:47.233 --> 30:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happening, say, between
Ukraine and Russia?

30:49.133 --> 30:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is falling on the
day now where this is
Constitution Day for Ukraine.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're celebrating their
independence from Russia,
what, 21 years ago.

30:55.533 --> 30:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RODNEY JOFFE: We clearly
are collateral damage.

30:57.633 --> 31:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This was obviously
targeted at Ukraine.

31:01.933 --> 31:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it is affecting others.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, one of the things that
we have learned in the past is
that, in many ways, the people

31:10.300 --> 31:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
behind a lot of the
malware don't care about
the collateral damage.

31:13.133 --> 31:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have a single target or
a single objective, and they
don't really seem to care.

31:16.966 --> 31:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have seen that for years.

31:18.366 --> 31:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is no different.

31:20.366 --> 31:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rodney Joffe
joining us from Washington,
D.C., tonight, thanks so

31:21.933 --> 31:23.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

31:23.100 --> 31:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RODNEY JOFFE: Thanks
for having me.

31:27.233 --> 31:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

31:36.566 --> 31:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
why there is still no vaccine
for Lyme disease; and from

31:43.600 --> 31:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

bestselling author Scott Turow
and his latest legal thriller

31:48.233 --> 31:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
set after the Bosnian War.

31:50.433 --> 31:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But first: Britain's
Prime Minister Theresa
May has promised a
national investigation

31:57.800 --> 32:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the exterior paneling,
called cladding, used
in the construction of
high-rise buildings,

32:03.433 --> 32:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this in the wake of the London
apartment fire two weeks ago
that left at least 80 dead.

32:09.333 --> 32:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Testing shows that the paneling
is highly flammable, and is
found on apartment blocks

32:12.200 --> 32:13.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around Britain.

32:13.466 --> 32:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is thought to have
accelerated the fire.

32:16.100 --> 32:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The disaster at Grenfell
Tower has seriously
undermined confidence
in Prime Minister May's

32:22.166 --> 32:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Conservative
minority government.

32:24.266 --> 32:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many believe the tragedy could
mark a turning point in how
Britain cares for its poorest.

32:30.100 --> 32:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
From London, Malcolm
Brabant reports.

32:32.566 --> 32:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The faces
of Grenfell Tower haunt the
streets of North Kensington.

32:38.933 --> 32:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hope that the missing will
ever be found has long expired.

32:42.066 --> 32:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two weeks on, the official
death toll remains at 79.

32:46.166 --> 32:51.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This traumatized community is
convinced at least 100 perished,
if not more, in what was

32:52.100 --> 32:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a high-rise crematorium.

32:54.133 --> 32:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LAMMY, Parliament Member:
Grenfell is a monumental
disaster on a scale that we have

32:59.000 --> 33:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not seen for a generation.

33:01.166 --> 33:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It raises huge issues about how
Britain cares for people that
are poorer in our social housing

33:09.866 --> 33:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in particular who need
the state to house them.

33:12.333 --> 33:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's absolutely clear that what
we have seen is gross negligence
or corporate manslaughter.

33:16.866 --> 33:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
memorials proffer silent
protests and demand reform.

33:21.133 --> 33:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lawmaker David Lammy, who
lost a friend in the fire,
is leading the charge.

33:25.566 --> 33:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LAMMY: At its heart,
Brits like to see themselves
as fair and as tolerant.

33:32.433 --> 33:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What they saw in Grenfell
has alarmed them.

33:36.866 --> 33:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They really saw the face
of a welfare state that
has largely disappeared.

33:40.900 --> 33:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I do believe Grenfell
is a turning point.

33:43.033 --> 33:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a Hurricane Katrina moment.

33:45.066 --> 33:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: During urgent
safety spot checks in 120
public housing blocks across

33:51.600 --> 33:55.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Britain, cladding in
every single case failed
fire resistance tests.

33:55.233 --> 33:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the London borough of
Camden, the risk to tenants was
compounded by other inadequate

33:59.866 --> 34:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fire protection measures and
considered so severe that the
council ordered the immediate

34:04.766 --> 34:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evacuation of 4,000
people over last weekend.

34:07.933 --> 34:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I think they're behaving
ridiculous, to be quite
honest with you, because they

34:12.600 --> 34:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have known for seven years
about all this stuff.

34:15.166 --> 34:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The system is broken,
it's cracking up, and it's
evident to see for everybody.

34:19.033 --> 34:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As
refugees from the wars
of former Yugoslavia,
Alen and Andrea Kevric

34:25.166 --> 34:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are used to leaving
home in a hurry.

34:27.233 --> 34:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The council gave them $7,500
for temporary accommodation
during repairs, but a private

34:32.533 --> 34:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rental agency rejected them.

34:34.600 --> 34:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREA KEVRIC, Nurse: They
actually realized who we are,
that we are plebs from social

34:39.166 --> 34:41.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
housing.

34:41.266 --> 34:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they don't want us there.

34:43.300 --> 34:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the reality, how people
are treated in this country.

34:47.533 --> 34:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According to
local council officials, the
fire department recommended

34:51.433 --> 34:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evacuation, but hundreds of
residents refused to move.

34:55.400 --> 34:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Kevrices, who have four
children, are uncertain about
their immediate future in

34:59.766 --> 35:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a country that has
become their home.

35:01.966 --> 35:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In common with many immigrants,
they have low-paid jobs and
are priced out of London's

35:06.300 --> 35:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
expensive housing market.

35:08.400 --> 35:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREA KEVRIC: To make some
kind of decent living, I have
to be in social housing, which

35:17.200 --> 35:22.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm very lucky to be
in, because it's so rare
and hard to come by.

35:22.933 --> 35:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was lucky to get it.

35:24.966 --> 35:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so my rent is considerably
reduced, but, even with
that, we just make ends meet.

35:31.800 --> 35:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEN KEVRIC, Premises Manager:
The divide between rich and
poor unfortunately only gets

35:38.766 --> 35:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exposed with the worst
kind of disasters.

35:42.400 --> 35:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
History will teach us as well
that's the only way when we
can actually ask for change.

35:49.266 --> 35:52.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This crisis
coincides with a slew of
reports highlighting poverty in

35:52.300 --> 35:54.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Britain.

35:54.366 --> 35:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. children's agency,
UNICEF, says Britain has some of
the highest levels of hunger and

35:58.133 --> 36:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deprivation amongst the
world's richest nations.

36:01.366 --> 36:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It claims that one in
three British children
experience poverty in
terms of food, clothing

36:06.200 --> 36:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and social activities.

The housing charity shelter
warns a million families could
be made homeless by 2020.

36:15.133 --> 36:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Volunteers at this food bank
in the heart of London are
taking delivery of donations

36:19.833 --> 36:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will help
sustain 50 people.

36:21.900 --> 36:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The food bank charity Trussell
Trust is reporting today that
four in five of its clients are

36:28.233 --> 36:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going hungry for days at a time.

36:30.233 --> 36:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOROTHEA HACKMAN, Trussell
Trust: A big group of those are
not receiving their benefits,

36:34.466 --> 36:35.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
benefit delayed.

36:35.633 --> 36:38.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The next biggest
group are low-income.

36:38.166 --> 36:41.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And these are people
who are just managing.

36:41.033 --> 36:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one crisis, a canceled
day's work, an additional bill,
a sick child, any of those

36:48.766 --> 36:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
issues can tip them
into desperately
needing more assistance.

36:53.066 --> 36:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dr.
Youssef El-Gingihy, a
general practitioner and
author who has campaigned

37:00.133 --> 37:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against cuts in the National
Health Service, believes that
Britain's political tide is

37:02.433 --> 37:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
turning irrevocably.

37:03.433 --> 37:04.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

37:04.866 --> 37:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOUSSEF EL-GINGIHY,
Activist: Austerity kills.

37:07.433 --> 37:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This terrible tragedy
with the Grenfell Tower
fire has unfortunately
become this grim monument,

37:12.500 --> 37:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this rather ghastly memorial for
the Conservative government's
austerity regime of massive cuts

37:18.500 --> 37:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to public spending,
particularly on public services.

37:21.800 --> 37:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
argument about austerity
erupted in Parliament today.

37:25.833 --> 37:28.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are there questions
for the prime minister.

37:28.600 --> 37:31.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jeremy Corbyn?

37:31.033 --> 37:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader,
Labor Party: This
disregard for working-class
communities, the terrible

37:33.066 --> 37:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consequences of deregulation
and cutting corners, I urge the
prime minister to come up with

37:46.133 --> 37:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the resources needed to
test and remove cladding,
retrofit sprinklers,
properly fund the fire

37:50.500 --> 37:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service and the police, so that
all our communities can truly
feel safe in their own homes.

37:57.466 --> 38:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: The cladding of
tower blocks didn't start under

38:06.600 --> 38:08.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this government.

38:08.066 --> 38:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It didn't start under the
previous coalition government.

38:14.400 --> 38:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The cladding of tower
blocks began under
the Blair government.

38:17.133 --> 38:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's
been 10 years since Tony
Blair was prime minister.

38:21.033 --> 38:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under Corbyn, Labor has
returned to its socialist
roots, and a rock star
welcome at last weekend's

38:27.966 --> 38:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Glastonbury music festival
showed his popularity
amongst young people.

38:30.633 --> 38:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN: Is it right that
so many people in our country
have no home to live in, and

38:36.700 --> 38:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
only a street to sleep on?

38:38.833 --> 38:40.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AUDIENCE: No!

38:40.900 --> 38:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN: Is it right that
so many people live in such
poverty in a society surrounded

38:48.233 --> 38:49.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by such riches?

38:49.966 --> 38:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, it obviously is not.

38:52.033 --> 38:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE-LOUISE LEYLAND, Camden
Councillor: Did you like it?

38:54.466 --> 38:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT:
Conservatives like Camden
Councillor Claire-Louise
Leyland are fighting

38:57.333 --> 39:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Corbyn's portrayal of the
Conservatives as uncaring.

39:00.733 --> 39:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE-LOUISE LEYLAND: It's
duplicitous and I think really
unhelpful for people who are

39:05.600 --> 39:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to deal with trauma
to try and turn this into
such a simple argument.

39:11.466 --> 39:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Difficult choices were made.

39:13.533 --> 39:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Things happened that shouldn't
have happened, and we need to
really explore what went wrong.

39:17.366 --> 39:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As the
politicians fight for the moral
high ground over Grenfell, there

39:21.466 --> 39:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is yet another report about
divided Britain by a commission
which says that successive

39:28.900 --> 39:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Labor and Conservative
governments have failed
to reduce the gap
between the haves and the

39:31.566 --> 39:33.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have-nots.

39:33.600 --> 39:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Social Mobility Commission
warns that, unless there is
urgent radical and reform,

39:37.433 --> 39:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the divisions in Britain
will get widen even,
threatening social cohesion
and economic prosperity.

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm

JUDY WOODRUFF: This is peak
season in the United States
for Lyme disease, as people

40:04.300 --> 40:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spend more time outdoors and
can be at risk for tick bites.

40:08.166 --> 40:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each year, at least 30,000 cases
are reported, and researchers
believe those estimates are

40:14.033 --> 40:16.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
low.

40:16.500 --> 40:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given its debilitating
effects on some people, and
after years of research,
it begs the question:

40:21.700 --> 40:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Why is there still no
vaccine people can get
to prevent Lyme disease?

40:26.533 --> 40:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has been
exploring that for his weekly
reports on the Leading Edge of

40:30.733 --> 40:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
science and technology.

40:33.100 --> 40:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It looks like a
routine medical visit, but Dr.
Linden Hu of Tufts University

40:43.800 --> 40:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is prepping a patient
for a procedure that
would tick me off.

40:47.633 --> 40:49.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:49.700 --> 40:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HU LINDEN, Tufts University:
So now we're going to just
put the ticks in there.

40:50.966 --> 40:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They move really fast,
so you keep an eye, too.

40:53.733 --> 40:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He is placing 28
larval ticks on a volunteer's
arm, hoping they will help

41:00.166 --> 41:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
solve some of the
mysteries of Lyme disease.

41:02.033 --> 41:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KYRAN ROMANOWSKI, Lyme
Disease Sufferer: I'm nervous.

41:03.533 --> 41:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not particularly thrilled
having 30 ticks in my arm.

41:06.366 --> 41:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Kyran Romanowski
was diagnosed with Lyme
disease in June of 2016.

41:13.766 --> 41:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His symptoms, achy
joints, fatigue and
memory recall lapses, have
persisted long after he

41:18.433 --> 41:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stopped taking antibiotics.

41:20.566 --> 41:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KYRAN ROMANOWSKI: Why am I still
having these symptoms when I had
all these courses of treatment?

41:27.100 --> 41:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, is the bacteria
still in my body?

41:30.533 --> 41:31.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

41:31.700 --> 41:33.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN:
Neither do doctors.

41:33.833 --> 41:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About 10 percent to 15 percent
of people who get Lyme report
stubborn symptoms for months,

41:39.833 --> 41:43.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even years, even after
antibiotic treatment.

41:43.333 --> 41:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is it lingering
damage from Lyme?

41:45.733 --> 41:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are the body's natural
defenses stuck in attack mode?

41:49.166 --> 41:50.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Or is it something else?

41:50.700 --> 41:52.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

41:52.666 --> 41:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDEN HU: So, another
possibility is that the bacteria
persist, and they haven't been

41:54.733 --> 41:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eradicated by the antibiotic
treatment, and that the immune
system may still be recognizing

42:01.533 --> 42:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them and fighting them
and causing symptoms of
inflammation and infection.

42:03.666 --> 42:08.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Could the
Lyme disease bacteria,
Borrelia burgdorferi, be
cleverly hiding inside

42:09.466 --> 42:11.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the human body?

42:11.466 --> 42:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Doctors cannot detect the
organisms using existing blood
tests, but Dr. Hu hopes Borrelia

42:17.333 --> 42:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and ticks are like
magnet and steel.

42:19.766 --> 42:21.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:21.900 --> 42:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDEN HU: The bacteria are so
well-adapted to their natural
vector, the tick, that they're

42:25.466 --> 42:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to sense the tick, and the
tick acts as a concentrating
vessel to allow you to

42:29.433 --> 42:31.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better sample
what's in the host.

42:31.500 --> 42:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: After removing
these ticks, Dr. Hu will grind
them up and test them for

42:35.900 --> 42:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Lyme bacteria.

42:37.866 --> 42:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The ticks have been bred in the
lab, under sterile conditions,
so if Borrelia is there,

42:43.766 --> 42:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it can only have come
from the patient.

42:46.533 --> 42:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deploying ticks as bacteria
detectors may seem far from a
practical test, but it could

42:52.933 --> 42:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
give researchers some
ideas on how to devise one.

42:57.233 --> 43:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rheumatologist Allen Steere
and his team at Massachusetts
General Hospital are working

43:03.433 --> 43:06.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on better tests and
treatments as well.

43:06.833 --> 43:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His lab is filled with more
than 40 years of blood, cells
and tissues samples from Lyme

43:12.300 --> 43:14.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suffers.

43:14.866 --> 43:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1975, Steere was the
investigator who first
connected the dots between
a cluster of children

43:20.133 --> 43:24.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with symptoms of arthritis in
Lyme, Connecticut, and what came
to be known as Lyme disease.

43:25.466 --> 43:27.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:27.466 --> 43:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLEN STEERE, Massachusetts
General Hospital: My career
has largely been focused on the

43:29.466 --> 43:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elucidation of Lyme disease
in human patients, what it's
like clinically, development of

43:36.266 --> 43:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diagnostic test and treatment
strategies with various courses
antibiotic therapy, but then

43:44.400 --> 43:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also prevention of the
disease by vaccination.

43:47.233 --> 43:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The Lyme
disease vaccine which he helped
develop is a sore subject.

43:54.400 --> 43:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sold under the brand
name LYMErix by
SmithKline Beecham, now
GlaxoSmithKline, it was first

43:58.966 --> 44:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prescribed in 1998.

44:01.733 --> 44:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was 80 percent effective
at stemming the disease.

44:05.200 --> 44:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But hundreds of recipients
claimed the vaccine made
their Lyme symptoms worse.

44:12.200 --> 44:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Federal investigators found no
scientific proof the vaccine was
the cause of their complaints,

44:17.500 --> 44:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but anti-vaccine advocacy
groups threatened class-action
lawsuits, and sales plummeted.

44:22.000 --> 44:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In 2002, SmithKline took
LYMErix off the market.

44:24.733 --> 44:26.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

44:26.733 --> 44:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLEN STEERE: And I think
the time has come to
reconsider the decision.

44:29.933 --> 44:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lyme disease is the only
infection that I know
of for which there is
an effective vaccine,

44:36.266 --> 44:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it's not available
to the public.

44:38.700 --> 44:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Unless
you happen to be a dog.

44:42.433 --> 44:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Giselle, the miniature
dachshund, is getting
her Lyme vaccine shot
at the Angell Animal

44:49.866 --> 44:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medical Center run by
the Massachusetts Society
for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals.

44:54.300 --> 44:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Her owner is veterinarian
Susan O'Bell.

44:58.400 --> 45:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN O'BELL, Veterinarian: I
just feel very fortunate that
there are several Lyme vaccine

45:02.533 --> 45:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
options for dogs, although I
have to say, when I pull ticks
off of my children, I wish

45:09.466 --> 45:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I had some easy options
like vaccination or prevention,
like I can give for my dogs,

45:15.966 --> 45:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it's an issue for
people and their pets alike.

45:18.333 --> 45:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sure seems like something
we should be working on to
prevent, one way or another.

45:22.533 --> 45:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And, in fact,
the French biotech firm Valneva
is in the first phase of U.S.

45:29.533 --> 45:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Food and Drug Administration
testing on a new vaccine
that is similar to LYMErix.

45:35.033 --> 45:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the 15 years since
the vaccine was pulled
off the market, Lyme
has exploded into an

45:40.733 --> 45:45.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
epidemic; 300,000 people
get it every year.

45:46.966 --> 45:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kyran Romanowski hopes his
five-day stint of tick hosting
will in some way help reduce

45:52.533 --> 45:53.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that number.

45:53.533 --> 45:55.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:55.666 --> 45:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDEN HU: It looks like a
couple ticks have been fed
and they're still feeding.

45:56.900 --> 45:58.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KYRAN ROMANOWSKI: Some
people are grossed out.

45:58.000 --> 45:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why would you do that?

45:59.400 --> 46:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I told someone,
and they freaked out.

46:01.166 --> 46:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You are going to
put 30 ticks on you.

46:02.433 --> 46:04.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Are you crazy?

46:04.566 --> 46:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: He may not be
squeamish, but he was pretty
happy when Dr. Hu took them

46:08.200 --> 46:09.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
off.

46:09.200 --> 46:10.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:10.433 --> 46:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LINDEN HU: Glad to see
them go, Mr. Romanowski?

46:11.366 --> 46:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KYRAN ROMANOWSKI: I am ecstatic.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Hu
would share that emotion
if his results would stop
this raging, uncontrolled

46:18.433 --> 46:20.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
epidemic.

46:20.733 --> 46:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Miles O'Brien in Boston.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A
bestselling novelist
takes on war crimes.

46:41.033 --> 46:44.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has our
latest addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

46:44.166 --> 46:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 2004,
400 people were rounded
up from their homes in
a village in Bosnia,

46:50.333 --> 46:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and buried alive in
an old coal mine.

46:52.466 --> 46:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But did this mass
killing really happen?

46:55.033 --> 46:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, if so, who were
the perpetrators?

46:57.433 --> 47:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those questions must be decided
at the International Criminal
Court in the Netherlands.

47:02.133 --> 47:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the setting for a new legal
thriller titled "Testimony"
and a new setting for acclaimed

47:06.766 --> 47:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
author Scott Turow, the attorney
and writer whose work has sold
more than 30 million copies

47:12.933 --> 47:15.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
since his debut novel,
"Presumed Innocent."

47:15.066 --> 47:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to name all the
other bestsellers, Scott, but
it's nice to talk to you here.

47:18.133 --> 47:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW, Author,
"Testimony": Jeff, it's
nice to talk to you.

47:20.666 --> 47:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have
left behind the fictional
Kindle County, the
setting that many of us

47:24.233 --> 47:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are familiar with, that place
that's sort of familiar,
for a much broader palette.

47:27.633 --> 47:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

47:28.633 --> 47:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why?

47:30.800 --> 47:33.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: You know, I
just sort of accumulated
a writer's bucket list,
and one of the things,

47:33.400 --> 47:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years ago, that I decided I
would write about at some point
is the International Criminal

47:37.800 --> 47:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Court and The Hague,
just because I had never
read anything set there.

47:41.166 --> 47:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you started
with the idea of the court.

47:43.700 --> 47:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: I did, for sure.

47:45.333 --> 47:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Something
intrigued you about
those kinds of trials?

47:47.400 --> 47:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: I had been in The
Hague in the year 2000, and
had found myself at a party

47:53.166 --> 47:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
surrounded by a bunch
of American lawyers
who were saying, you
have got to write about

47:56.100 --> 47:58.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this place.

47:58.066 --> 48:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And unlike most times when
people have ideas about Aunt
Tilly's watch or their divorce,

48:04.566 --> 48:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this sounded like it
would actually make an
interesting setting.

48:07.466 --> 48:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have
the legal background,
and you're an attorney.

48:10.533 --> 48:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How much research goes
into all of these -- the
stories that you write?

48:14.133 --> 48:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: A lot.

48:15.833 --> 48:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm a year off my usual
cycle, because I went to
the Netherlands twice.

48:19.633 --> 48:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I went to Bosnia once.

48:22.533 --> 48:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had a lot to learn about
first the court, even more to
learn about the Roma people,

48:30.700 --> 48:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, of course, the Bosnian
conflict, about which I
was inexcusably ignorant.

48:37.300 --> 48:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this
is set in the aftermath
of the Bosnian War.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

48:41.966 --> 48:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's
about a group of Roma,
often known as gypsies...

48:44.000 --> 48:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

48:45.466 --> 48:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... who
are still living there...

48:46.266 --> 48:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

48:47.500 --> 48:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: ...
but resettled there.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Yes.

48:50.733 --> 48:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Resettled in the
fictional world, resettled
after the Bosnian War,
driven out of Kosovo,

48:56.966 --> 49:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and have chosen to live right
near the American NATO bases
in Bosnia, which were there for

49:04.733 --> 49:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a decade after the war to
sort of keep the peace.

49:07.433 --> 49:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you
have this big story.

49:09.100 --> 49:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have this history.

49:10.733 --> 49:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the way in, as always,
is a particular character.

49:13.933 --> 49:15.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

49:15.466 --> 49:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In this case,
a lawyer from Kindle County.

49:17.866 --> 49:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: From Kindle County.

49:18.866 --> 49:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

49:20.366 --> 49:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: The former U.S.
attorney in Kindle County.

49:21.900 --> 49:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A very successful
man, who - - but is unfulfilled.

49:23.666 --> 49:25.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

49:25.733 --> 49:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thrown his life up for grabs,
says that he has never felt
fully at home with himself.

49:31.733 --> 49:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that helps explain why
he'd be willing to leave the
United States to work overseas.

49:38.033 --> 49:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And is that
the way in for you, really?

49:40.133 --> 49:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: What interested
me was when I found that the
United States Congress had

49:44.700 --> 49:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passed a law called the U.S.
Service-Members Protection Act,
which says that the president

49:52.166 --> 49:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has authority to forcibly
rescue anybody -- any
American serviceman charged
before the International

49:58.000 --> 49:59.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Criminal Court.

49:59.500 --> 50:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, of course, the novelist
says, ah, good, conflict.

50:03.933 --> 50:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the idea of an American
prosecutor investigating,
among other suspects, American

50:11.333 --> 50:15.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
service members was
immediately interesting.

50:15.233 --> 50:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We can't go into
all the details of this plot
here, but, I mean, it's fair

50:19.533 --> 50:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say that the book continues
what I think I can call your
own complicated relationship

50:26.033 --> 50:27.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the law?

50:27.033 --> 50:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Yes, I think so.

50:29.100 --> 50:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, as a
kind of a both noble calling,
but also the -- what's the

50:31.866 --> 50:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
word, a tawdriness, in
some ways of the law.

50:35.033 --> 50:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

50:37.033 --> 50:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There cannot be any greater
challenge to the law than
trying to adjudicate mass crimes

50:43.866 --> 50:44.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like war crimes.

50:44.866 --> 50:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

50:47.000 --> 50:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I keep thinking, in your work
and in this one, that most of
us look at the legal system

50:49.800 --> 50:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a way to get at the truth.

50:52.066 --> 50:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think of it as that,
or as a way to get at a truth,
or what's going on there,

50:59.533 --> 51:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and what is it that
helps translates for
you as a novelist?

51:02.333 --> 51:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Well, you know,
I really think of the trial
of a lawsuit as an exercise in

51:07.066 --> 51:09.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

51:09.100 --> 51:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people are offering
competing visions of what
happened in the past.

51:15.500 --> 51:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the justice system
is willing to accept
either of those competing
visions and to impose

51:23.800 --> 51:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consequences as a result.

51:26.533 --> 51:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you think of it that way,
it's a little bit startling,
because we want to believe

51:30.300 --> 51:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there is one truth and,
therefore, one justice, whereas,
if you have practiced law

51:37.266 --> 51:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as long as I have, you realize
that there is actually a
range of acceptable outcomes.

51:41.733 --> 51:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

51:43.233 --> 51:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, truth these days
is a kind of fraught concept.

51:44.500 --> 51:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Yes, it's...

51:46.633 --> 51:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But it always
has been -- it sounds like
it always has been for you.

51:47.900 --> 51:49.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Well, it
is in the courtroom.

51:49.866 --> 51:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it was frustrating
for me as a prosecutor.

51:53.033 --> 51:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I wrote "Presumed Innocent"
originally, I didn't say
who had committed the crime.

51:59.833 --> 52:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I had a long heart-to-heart
with myself about the
purpose of the mystery.

52:05.166 --> 52:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one thing the mystery does
is deliver to us a certainty
that life and the courtroom

52:09.333 --> 52:10.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very often can't.

52:10.633 --> 52:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Has
that continued?

52:12.933 --> 52:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I actually saw an
interview where you said, "I'm
a big believer in the fact

52:16.300 --> 52:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that all authors really
write only one book."

52:19.333 --> 52:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

52:20.466 --> 52:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think that's true.

52:22.433 --> 52:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the older I get, the
more I'm trying to figure
out what the book is and why.

52:25.833 --> 52:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I know that, in a
book like "Testimony,"
issues like identity are
enormously important.

52:32.266 --> 52:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No character is fully at home.

52:37.100 --> 52:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have a hard time isolating
what it is in myself that
makes me so fascinated with

52:43.666 --> 52:48.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that theme, because I
came from a normal upper
middle-class family.

52:50.366 --> 52:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet, as I look back at my
books, the uses of power, issues
of identity, they have -- it's

52:56.300 --> 52:57.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recurrent.

52:57.300 --> 52:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It happens again and again.

52:59.400 --> 53:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, a lot of
people continue to read your one
book in its many forms, right?

53:02.900 --> 53:03.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

53:03.900 --> 53:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Fortunately for me.

53:04.900 --> 53:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Good for you.

53:06.033 --> 53:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: I'm
grateful to all of them.

53:07.266 --> 53:08.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new
one is "Testimony."

53:08.633 --> 53:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Scott Turow, nice
to talk to you.

53:11.000 --> 53:12.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

53:12.566 --> 53:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Jeff, it's
good to talk to you, too.
