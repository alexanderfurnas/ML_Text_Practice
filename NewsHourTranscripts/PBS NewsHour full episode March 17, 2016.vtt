JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.875 --> 00:09.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.743 --> 00:17.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm glad you're sorry now.
I'm glad you're
taking action now, but it's a
little bit late

00:17.317 --> 00:19.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the kids in Flint.

00:19.152 --> 00:24.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a heated
hearing, members
of Congress grill Michigan
Governor Rick Snyder

00:24.291 --> 00:29.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and the head of the
Environmental Protection
Agency over Flint's water
crisis.

00:29.897 --> 00:35.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Thursday: next
steps in the
political battle over President
Obama's Supreme

00:35.369 --> 00:37.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Court pick.

00:37.437 --> 00:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as March Madness sets in, we
look at some
of the questions surrounding
paying collegiate

00:43.644 --> 00:45.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
athletes.

00:45.412 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ED O'BANNON, Former UCLA
Basketball Player:
Close to 15 years later, and
they're still

00:48.548 --> 00:56.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making money off of my image. I
just thought
to myself, there's got to be
something wrong

00:56.423 --> 00:57.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about this.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:00.694 --> 01:05.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.165 --> 01:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama's
Supreme Court
nominee, Judge Merrick Garland,
began making

01:18.245 --> 01:23.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the rounds on Capitol Hill
today, this in
the face of Senate Republicans
saying they

01:23.150 --> 01:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will not consider any Obama
nominee this year.

01:26.787 --> 01:32.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, Garland started with
Minority Leader
Harry Reid and Patrick Leahy,
ranking Democrat

01:32.592 --> 01:37.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on the Senate Judiciary
Committee. Leahy said
the judge won't be commenting on
the political

01:37.764 --> 01:39.399 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fight.

01:39.433 --> 01:43.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont:
He's not
going to go out before the press
like I am

01:43.503 --> 01:48.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and give his side of the story.
Where he gets
his chance to say anything tell
is at a hearing,

01:48.709 --> 01:52.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that's what he ought to
have.

01:52.346 --> 01:57.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A spokesman for
Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell called
the visits a

01:57.617 --> 02:00.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stunt orchestrated by the White
House.

02:00.087 --> 02:05.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
nomination politics
in the Senate later in the
program.

02:05.792 --> 02:11.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the presidential race, House
Speaker Paul
Ryan tried again to shut down
speculation

02:11.331 --> 02:16.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he might agree to be the
Republican nominee
if there's a contested
convention. He said

02:16.770 --> 02:20.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anyone who's saying otherwise
should -- quote
-- "knock it off."

02:20.640 --> 02:26.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at a weekly briefing, Ryan
also criticized
Donald Trump for warning his
supporters that

02:26.446 --> 02:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they might riot if he's close
and is still
denied the nomination.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
Nobody should say such things,
in my opinion,

02:33.153 --> 02:38.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because to even address or hint
to violence
is unacceptable.

02:38.592 --> 02:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Republican
front-runner
also drew fire from Moscow. A
spokesman for

02:43.964 --> 02:50.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
charged that
an online ad for Trump reflects
a -- quote

02:50.103 --> 02:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "demonization of Russia." The
ad refers
to Putin as -- quote -- "one of
our toughest

02:55.142 --> 02:56.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
opponents."

02:56.977 --> 03:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, President Vladimir
Putin warned
today that he's prepared to send
more warplanes

03:01.048 --> 03:07.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and troops back to Syria if need
be. Russian
forces began a partial pullout
this week after

03:07.287 --> 03:12.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helping Syria's military make
major advances
in the run-up to peace talks.

03:12.626 --> 03:18.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a Moscow ceremony, Putin made
clear that
he won't let those gains be
lost.

03:18.298 --> 03:23.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): If necessary,
literally within

03:23.503 --> 03:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few hours, Russia can build up
its contingent
in the region to a size
proportionate to the

03:27.741 --> 03:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation developing there and
use the entire
arsenal of capabilities at our
disposal.

03:32.379 --> 03:37.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Kurdish regions
in Northern Syria announced that
they're forming

03:37.350 --> 03:43.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their own federal region. The
area extends
from the eastern border with
Iraq to the cities

03:43.323 --> 03:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Kobani and near Aleppo
farther west. The
Syrian government and opposition
groups rejected

03:49.563 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the move, and the United States
said that
it won't recognize any
self-ruled region unless

03:54.668 --> 03:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Syrian people vote on it.

03:57.304 --> 04:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
formally declared
today that the Islamic State
group is committing

04:02.409 --> 04:09.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
genocide in Iraq and Syria, the
targets, Christians
and other minorities. Congress
and human rights

04:09.182 --> 04:14.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups had pushed for the
finding, and they
set today as a deadline for the
declaration.

04:14.287 --> 04:18.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the announcement doesn't
obligate the
U.S. to take any additional
action.

04:19.025 --> 04:25.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Turkey, a Kurdish militant
group has claimed
responsibility for Sunday's
bombing in Ankara

04:25.632 --> 04:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that killed 37 people. The group
is an offshoot
of the main Kurdish separatist
group PKK.

04:32.339 --> 04:37.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it warned that there may be
more attacks.
For their part, German officials
shuttered

04:37.811 --> 04:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their embassy in Ankara and
their consulate
in Istanbul in response to a
threat. They

04:42.983 --> 04:46.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called it -- quote -- "concrete
and very serious."

04:46.253 --> 04:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The European Union is wrestling
again with
how to stop the human tide
flowing out of

04:51.825 --> 04:57.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey. A summit opened today,
but there were
signs that a tentative deal
might fall through.

04:58.031 --> 05:03.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alex Thomson of Independent
Television News
is watching developments from
Greece, where

05:03.036 --> 05:05.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
some 40,000 migrants are
stranded.

05:05.805 --> 05:11.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Still unable to
agree, European
leaders arrived in Brussels for
another two-day

05:11.044 --> 05:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
summit to discuss the migration
crisis, which
saw more than 1.2 million
migrants arrive

05:16.650 --> 05:18.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Europe last year.

05:18.552 --> 05:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TUSK, European Council
President: Only
if we all work together in a
coordinated manner

05:23.390 --> 05:30.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and keep our cool, we will
achieve success.
I am cautiously optimistic, but,
frankly speaking,

05:30.530 --> 05:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more cautious than optimistic.

05:32.365 --> 05:37.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALEX THOMSON: Under the
so-called one-for-one
deal, for every Syrian refugee
just across

05:37.537 --> 05:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the water there in Turkey behind
us that gets
resettled here in Europe, a
Syria refugee

05:43.109 --> 05:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from here in Greece goes back
across the Aegean.

05:46.379 --> 05:51.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, when all this was
apparently arranged
10 days ago, the figures were
vague. Since

05:51.952 --> 05:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, though, it's emerged that
the E.U. is
apparently only prepared to take
72,000 such

05:56.890 --> 06:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people all up, and there is no
commitment
yet beyond that figure.

06:02.395 --> 06:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Further places may be available
under a voluntary
separate scheme, but this would
require a

06:07.434 --> 06:13.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change to E.U. law, and getting
all 28 member
states on board is a tall order,
as the E.U.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
summit chairman has
acknowledged.

06:15.508 --> 06:20.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But charities say the
controversial plans
are against European and
international law.

06:20.080 --> 06:25.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All 28 E.U.
member states must
agree to any deal.

06:25.852 --> 06:30.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saudi Arabia has announced that
it's paring
back combat operations in Yemen
after nearly

06:30.724 --> 06:36.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a year of airstrikes and ground
combat. The
kingdom has been leading a Sunni
Arab coalition

06:36.563 --> 06:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to roll back gains by
Shiite rebels
in Yemen. But the air raids have
killed hundreds

06:42.002 --> 06:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of civilians. And the United
Nations today
raised the death toll to 119 in
a Saudi strike

06:49.209 --> 06:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that took place Tuesday near the
Yemeni capital
of Sanaa.

06:53.747 --> 06:58.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Earth's temperature was much
higher than
usual last month. The National
Oceanic and

06:58.785 --> 07:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Atmospheric Administration
reports February
2016 beat the old record by
six-tenths of

07:05.225 --> 07:11.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a degree, a far bigger margin
than usual.
In the process, Arctic Sea ice
reached a record

07:11.364 --> 07:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
low. Scientists say the heat was
partly due
to a super El Nino effect.

07:16.836 --> 07:22.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Automatic braking systems will
be standard
in the U.S. for most cars and
light trucks

07:22.208 --> 07:28.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within the next six years.
Twenty major automakers
have agreed to that voluntary
schedule today

07:28.481 --> 07:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.
U.S. drivers have nearly two
million rear-end

07:35.121 --> 07:36.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
crashes each year.

07:36.923 --> 07:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, on Wall Street, oil rose to
more than
$40 a barrel, and helped push
stocks higher.

07:42.762 --> 07:50.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 155
points to close above 17480. The
Nasdaq rose

07:50.236 --> 07:53.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
11, and the S&amp;P 500 added 13.

07:53.907 --> 07:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Congress
lambastes Michigan's governor
and the EPA

07:59.245 --> 08:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the Flint water crisis; the
economics
of paying student athletes;
SeaWorld ends

08:05.919 --> 08:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its orca whale breeding program;
and much
more.

08:15.195 --> 08:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The water crisis in Flint,
Michigan, was in
the spotlight again today, this
time at a

08:25.772 --> 08:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hearing before Congress, where
the question
seemed to be, who is the most to
blame for

08:30.844 --> 08:32.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dangerous lead poisoning?

08:32.979 --> 08:38.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was heated at times, and
there were calls
for resignations of top
officials.

08:38.084 --> 08:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Correspondent John Yang begins.

08:39.819 --> 08:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Committee on Oversight and
Government
Reform will come to order.

08:43.022 --> 08:48.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Michigan Governor
Rick Snyder and
EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy
took the oath,

08:48.261 --> 08:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
settled into their seats, and
the grilling
began.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic Congressman Elijah
Cummings started
with Republican Snyder.

08:55.902 --> 09:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D),
Maryland: Governor
Snyder has been described as
running the state

09:00.340 --> 09:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Michigan like a business.
There's no doubt
in my mind that, if a corporate
CEO did what

09:05.945 --> 09:12.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Snyder's administration
has done,
he would be hauled up on
criminal charges.

09:12.786 --> 09:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: An emergency manager
appointed
by Snyder's administration
switched Flint's

09:17.524 --> 09:24.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water supply to the Flint River
in April 2014,
in a bid to save money. But no
corrosion control

09:24.230 --> 09:29.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was added. That allowed lead
from aging pipes
to leach into drinking water for
more than

09:29.235 --> 09:31.004 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a year.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Snyder said today that
Michigan's Department
of Environmental Quality
repeatedly assured

09:34.941 --> 09:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him the water was safe, until
last fall.

09:38.144 --> 09:43.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. RICK SNYDER (R), Michigan:
It was on
October 1, 2015, that I learned
that our state

09:43.950 --> 09:51.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experts were wrong. Flint's
water had dangerous
levels of lead. On that date, I
took immediate

09:51.491 --> 09:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
action. Not a day or night goes
by that this
tragedy doesn't weigh on my
mind, the questions

09:59.265 --> 10:04.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should have asked, the answers
I should
have demanded, how I could have
prevented

10:04.437 --> 10:05.905 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That wasn't nearly
enough to satisfy
some on the committee.

10:08.641 --> 10:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. MATT CARTWRIGHT (D),
Pennsylvania: Plausible
deniability only works when it's
plausible,

10:12.979 --> 10:18.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I'm not buying that you
didn't know about
any of this until October 2015.
You weren't

10:18.818 --> 10:25.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a medically induced coma for
a year. And
I have had about enough of your
false contrition

10:25.225 --> 10:27.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and your phony apologies.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Republican Committee
Chairman Jason
Chaffetz laid blame mostly with
the Environmental

10:31.764 --> 10:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Protection Agency and its boss,
Gina McCarthy.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. JASON CHAFFETZ (R), Utah: I
am asking
the questions.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GINA MCCARTHY, Administrator,
Environmental
Protection Agency: OK.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JASON CHAFFETZ: Yes, OK. In
February
is when you first arrived on the
scene, and

10:40.974 --> 10:45.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it wasn't until January of next
year that
you actually you did something.
That's the

10:45.278 --> 10:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fundamental problem. Don't look
around like
you're mystified. That's what
happened. You

10:49.549 --> 10:52.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't take action. You didn't.
And you could
have pulled that switch.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GINA MCCARTHY: We consistently
took action
from that point forward,
consistently.

10:55.855 --> 10:59.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. JASON CHAFFETZ: There are a
lot of people
in this audience from Flint.
Nobody believes

10:59.759 --> 11:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you took action. You had
the presence,
you had the authority, you had
the backing

11:04.931 --> 11:08.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the federal government, and
you didn't
act when you had the chance. And
if you're

11:08.968 --> 11:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to do the courageous
thing, you too
should step down.

11:11.604 --> 11:16.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: McCarthy blamed the
state for giving
the EPA bad information and
maintained she

11:16.376 --> 11:19.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did everything within her legal
authority
to respond.

11:19.579 --> 11:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GINA MCCARTHY: We just couldn't
get a straight
answer anywhere. People don't
deserve that

11:23.316 --> 11:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of their government. I will
take responsibility
for not pushing hard enough, but
I will not

11:29.222 --> 11:35.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take responsibility for causing
this problem.
It wasn't EPA at the helm when
this happened.

11:35.662 --> 11:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The issue of lead in
water also
affects communities from Ohio to
North Carolina,

11:40.934 --> 11:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Mississippi to New Jersey.
Governor Snyder
today urged Congress to approve
$220 million

11:48.207 --> 11:53.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for replacing contaminated pipes
in Flint
and in other cities. And he said
he wants

11:53.112 --> 11:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michigan to spend a similar
amount.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PROTESTERS: No justice, no
peace!

11:57.684 --> 12:03.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But some Flint
residents who attended
today's hearing said that's not
good enough,

12:03.056 --> 12:06.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
given Michigan's budget surplus
of $575 million.

12:06.693 --> 12:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NAKIYA WAKES, Flint Resident: I
was hearing
stuff in Snyder's testimony
today. We was

12:14.701 --> 12:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never told about any of this
until January
of 2016. He has ignored Flint
and all warnings.

12:24.744 --> 12:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then he says that he has money
put up for
a rainy day fund. Well, it's
pouring. Where

12:30.450 --> 12:31.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is the money at?

12:31.884 --> 12:33.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

12:33.720 --> 12:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lead levels in
Flint's water are
dropping, but they still don't
meet federal

12:37.690 --> 12:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drinking water standards. That
means city
residents will continue to use
bottled water

12:42.895 --> 12:45.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the foreseeable future.

12:45.131 --> 12:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

12:47.834 --> 12:53.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's pick up
further on these
questions of what mistakes were
made and by

12:53.539 --> 12:59.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whom in Flint, as well as
growing concerns
about the safety of water in
other communities.

12:59.812 --> 13:04.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Shepardson, a Michigan
native, has been
reporting on Flint and watching
the latest

13:04.884 --> 13:10.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
developments for Reuters. And
Marc Edwards,
he is a civil and environmental
engineer and

13:10.356 --> 13:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
professor at Virginia Tech
University. He's
widely credited with helping to
expose the

13:15.561 --> 13:21.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Flint water problems. He
testified before
the same House committee earlier
this week.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we welcome you both.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David Shepardson, to you first.

13:24.704 --> 13:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get the impression from
listening to this
hearing today that everybody
involved bears

13:28.975 --> 13:30.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some responsibility. Is that
accurate?

13:30.977 --> 13:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON, Reuters: I
think everybody
admits that things didn't go
well, i mean,

13:34.380 --> 13:36.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the state, the local
authorities.

13:36.282 --> 13:42.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the EPA has probably a
little bit different
position, that they do not admit
specific

13:42.955 --> 13:47.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrongdoing. All they admit, they
didn't act
fast enough. In fact, the agency
yesterday

13:47.260 --> 13:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
released about 1,200 pages of
e-mails that
show that, as far back as
September, the administrator

13:53.900 --> 13:56.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asked her deputies whether it
was appropriate
the intervene.

13:56.903 --> 14:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she said that this could get
big very
quickly. So, certainly, the
agency knew that

14:02.275 --> 14:06.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this was a growing issue of
concern, but they
didn't opt to take the step of
issuing an

14:06.779 --> 14:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
emergency order to intervene
until January
of this year.

14:09.816 --> 14:15.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, given that,
is there one
individual or one agency that
bears more responsibility

14:15.988 --> 14:17.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than others?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Well, I guess
it depends
on your point of view.

14:19.559 --> 14:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The main problem was that the
state failed
to add corrosion control to the
water, and

14:26.099 --> 14:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the EPA would say, and the state
would agree,
that they didn't inform the EPA
of this for

14:31.070 --> 14:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months and months. And because
of that, that
catastrophic decision led to the
ultimate

14:36.209 --> 14:41.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poisoning of the water, but from
there, depending
on what political party you're
in, it really

14:41.347 --> 14:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- the splitting of the blame
depends on your
point of view.

14:45.017 --> 14:47.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's really what the last two
hearings have
been largely about.

14:47.286 --> 14:50.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's impossible
to separate
it from the politics, but we
will try.

14:50.590 --> 14:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professor Marc Edwards, you were
asked to
go in and look at the Flint
water situation,

14:56.129 --> 15:03.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what, almost a year ago by a
family that lived
there. What would you add to
where the responsibility

15:03.302 --> 15:05.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lies here?

15:05.271 --> 15:09.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC EDWARDS, Virginia Tech
University: Well,
it's very clear that Governor
Snyder was guilty

15:09.242 --> 15:12.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of not listening to the
complaints of residents
in Flint.

15:12.512 --> 15:16.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was guilty of being
overly trusting
of the Michigan Department of
Environmental

15:16.482 --> 15:23.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Quality and the EPA. And he's
accepted that
blame. He called it his Katrina.
And he also

15:23.656 --> 15:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now wants to be part of the
solution, but
I think the thing that concerns
me most is

15:28.427 --> 15:32.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EPA's testimony, which I find to
be outrageous
and Orwellian.

15:32.165 --> 15:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In what way?

15:34.066 --> 15:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC EDWARDS: Well, I mean, for
example, they
said the EPA whistle-blower's
memo that blew

15:39.372 --> 15:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lid off this back in July
was inconclusive,
when, in fact, it proved that
the entire city

15:45.645 --> 15:47.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was in danger.

15:47.413 --> 15:53.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EPA today claimed that they
didn't know if
they could enforce federal law.
EPA didn't

15:53.419 --> 15:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know if they could enforce
federal law or
not. They said also that they
were strong-armed

15:57.924 --> 16:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the state. I mean, how can
you be strong-armed
by someone you're supposed to be
supervising?

16:03.229 --> 16:08.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even more outrageous is,
they have claimed
that they warned Flint residents
in July that

16:08.701 --> 16:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the water wasn't safe to drink,
when, in fact,
when Virginia Tech, our team,
tried to warn

16:14.540 --> 16:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people in July, August and
September that
the water was unsafe, we had to
fight the

16:20.379 --> 16:22.114 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
EPA.

16:22.148 --> 16:27.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EPA said nothing to back us up.
So they are
a major part of what went wrong
in Flint,

16:27.086 --> 16:31.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and for them to sit there and
act like they
have done nothing wrong is just,
again, outrageous

16:31.958 --> 16:33.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Orwellian.

16:33.759 --> 16:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we should
point out that
we did invite the EPA to
participate in the

16:37.697 --> 16:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
discussion tonight to come on
for an interview,
and they declined our request.

16:42.001 --> 16:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this story goes on, but, for
right now,
David Shepardson, in Flint, the
problem has

16:47.840 --> 16:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gotten a little bit better, but
it continues.
Is that right?

16:51.978 --> 16:53.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Right.

16:53.846 --> 16:57.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's -- so there's two
funding issues
right now. The water is not yet
safe to drink,

16:57.683 --> 17:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there are still -- the EPA
is still doing
tests, and there are still many
people who

17:02.021 --> 17:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are forced to use bottled water
for cooking
and drinking.

17:05.658 --> 17:10.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But both the state -- the
governor has asked
the state legislature to fund
another $160

17:10.529 --> 17:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million over two years, and
there's another
fight in Congress over whether
the federal

17:14.533 --> 17:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government should kick in about
$220 million
for Flint and other cities
struggling with

17:19.305 --> 17:20.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lead in pipes.

17:20.239 --> 17:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that to be
resolved.

17:22.441 --> 17:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professor Edwards, though, while
we're talking
about this, we know that you
have written

17:27.580 --> 17:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there are a number of older
American
cities that are confronting very
similar problems

17:33.920 --> 17:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to what Flint has experienced.
Where are we
talking about exactly in this
country?

17:39.292 --> 17:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC EDWARDS: Well, you're
talking about all
the major U.S. cities that have
lead pipe,

17:43.095 --> 17:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where it's acknowledged that the
example to
meet intent of this rule, 70
percent of those

17:47.767 --> 17:50.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cities would have to tell people
that the
water is unsafe.

17:50.970 --> 17:55.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have been arguing this
with EPA for
10 years, warning them that
something like

17:55.608 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flint was going to happen. And
the only thing
that's really unusual here is
that they got

18:00.446 --> 18:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caught in Flint. A group of
outsiders exposed
that children were getting lead
poisoning,

18:05.751 --> 18:09.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
even as MDQ and EPA were
claiming the water's
safe.

18:09.588 --> 18:15.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To this day, EPA and MDQ have
not admitted
that the water broke federal
law.

18:15.161 --> 18:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much of the
rest of the
country should be worrying about
this?

18:19.565 --> 18:23.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARC EDWARDS: Well, I think what
you're going
to do is, when you start turning
over rocks

18:23.469 --> 18:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and looking for what's going on
with lead
in drinking water in this
country, something

18:26.973 --> 18:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slimy is going to crawl out
every time.

18:29.675 --> 18:34.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're seeing that in New Jersey
now. You're
seeing it in Chicago,
Philadelphia, Jackson.

18:34.880 --> 18:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, EPA has known about this
problem for
10 years, and it's done nothing.
And we have

18:40.286 --> 18:45.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been screaming at EPA to try to
stop something
like Flint from happening.

18:45.224 --> 18:49.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: When you say we,
you mean you
and those folks who are working
with you on

18:49.962 --> 18:50.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

18:50.463 --> 18:52.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARC EDWARDS: Yes.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, there were several us in
Washington, D.C.,
who saw how this attitude of EPA
that anything

18:56.002 --> 19:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes in terms of cheating on
measuring lead
in water, so that it looks low
when you sample

19:01.007 --> 19:05.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, but it could be high when
people are drinking
the water, it was leaving --
it's left all

19:05.878 --> 19:07.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Americans in harm's way.

19:07.747 --> 19:13.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dave Shepardson,
how well-prepared
are America's cities, states and
the EPA to

19:13.552 --> 19:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal with what apparently is a
much bigger
problem than anybody realized?

19:17.456 --> 19:19.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: It's a
staggering issue.

19:19.291 --> 19:25.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are about 155,000 water
systems the
EPA enforces. The vast majority
of states

19:25.231 --> 19:29.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are the primary ones overseeing
these water
systems. And by the EPA's
estimate, over the

19:29.902 --> 19:35.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
next 20 years, the water
infrastructure of
the country needs at least $600
billion in

19:35.074 --> 19:36.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investments.

19:36.842 --> 19:40.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So -- and there have been
numerous reports
recently of the lead problems in
Mississippi

19:40.479 --> 19:45.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Pennsylvania and throughout
the country.
And, as Mark said, clearly,
Flint has cast

19:45.384 --> 19:50.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention on it, but it's not
just lead in
water, but it's also lead in
paint and other

19:50.623 --> 19:55.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sources. The lead issue for
children across
the country, it goes far beyond
certainly

19:55.795 --> 19:57.563 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Flint.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
to what extent
is this an issue that is a
priority before

19:59.765 --> 20:02.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Congress and the
administration?

20:02.268 --> 20:06.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Well, Michigan
Senator Debbie
Stabenow was on the floor today
complaining

20:06.639 --> 20:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they didn't reach a deal
before the Senate
goes on a two-week recess, and
there is going

20:11.877 --> 20:13.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be more fighting.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But remember that's it's also an
issue in
the presidential campaign, that
both Bernie

20:16.015 --> 20:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders and Hillary Clinton have
called for
Governor Snyder to resign. And I
do think

20:20.753 --> 20:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the issue of infrastructure and
funding for
cities like Flint is going to
continue to

20:25.391 --> 20:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be an issue throughout the
campaign season.

20:27.193 --> 20:31.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we
certainly need to
continue to watch this, and we
will do that.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David Shepardson, we thank you.

20:33.399 --> 20:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Professor Marc Edwards at
Virginia Tech,
thank you.

20:39.839 --> 20:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID SHEPARDSON: Thanks.

20:44.944 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Supreme Court
nominee Merrick
Garland made the trek to Capitol
Hill today.

20:53.419 --> 20:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama's selection for
the Supreme
Court made his first official
visit, meeting

20:58.157 --> 21:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with key Senate Democrats.

21:00.159 --> 21:05.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more, we're joined by NPR
congressional
correspondent Ailsa Chang. She
joins us from

21:05.231 --> 21:06.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Capitol Hill.

21:06.132 --> 21:07.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hello, Ailsa.

21:07.466 --> 21:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, tell us, what sort of a
reception did
Judge Garland get?

21:10.469 --> 21:14.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AILSA CHANG, NPR: Well, today,
because it
was the two Democrats, he got an
overwhelmingly

21:14.640 --> 21:16.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
positive reception.

21:16.475 --> 21:21.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But that was what was so
conspicuous, is that
today's visit to Capitol Hill
was just made

21:21.480 --> 21:26.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up of two appointments with two
key Democrats.
Usually, when a Supreme Court
nominee arrives

21:26.986 --> 21:33.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Hill, the first people he
or she meets
are the top two Senate leaders,
one in each

21:33.225 --> 21:37.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
party, and the top senators on
the Judiciary
Committee of each party.

21:37.463 --> 21:43.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, today, because he only met
with Minority
Leader Harry Reid and the
ranking member or

21:43.035 --> 21:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
top Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, Patrick
Leahy, it wasn't quite the
reception that

21:48.541 --> 21:52.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're usually used to seeing for
Supreme Court
nominees on the Hill.

21:52.978 --> 21:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neither Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell
nor the Judiciary chair,
Grassley, Chuck Grassley,

21:59.118 --> 22:00.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were on his schedule today.

22:01.020 --> 22:05.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Any word, Ailsa,
on how these
meetings went, or were they
purely formalities?

22:05.257 --> 22:10.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AILSA CHANG: They're usually a
formality.
They're very ceremonial. There's
this gracious

22:10.362 --> 22:14.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affair. They're mostly a photo
opportunity.

22:14.133 --> 22:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question now is, how many
meetings will
he actually get with Republican
senators in

22:19.538 --> 22:24.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the weeks ahead? He actually
spoke on the
phone with Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell

22:24.710 --> 22:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday. McConnell, through
his spokesperson,
told everybody that he wanted,
he preferred

22:29.515 --> 22:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to speak to Garland on the phone
because he
didn't want to put Garland
through the unnecessary

22:35.754 --> 22:40.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political routines, and that he
wanted to
inform him that he will not get
a face-to-face

22:40.059 --> 22:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting with the Senate majority
leader, because
Garland will not get a
confirmation vote this

22:44.630 --> 22:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year, according to the Senate
majority leader.

22:47.333 --> 22:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he said that he did wish
Garland well.
Now, Chairman Chuck Grassley --
at least the

22:53.405 --> 22:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House yesterday said that
Grassley's
office had said that Grassley
would -- planned

22:58.877 --> 23:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to meet with the nominee in a
couple weeks
after the Senate recess.

23:03.749 --> 23:10.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Grassley this morning made
it very clear
that he made no such promise,
that when he

23:10.723 --> 23:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spoke to Garland personally on
the phone yesterday,
he said Garland should call him
back after

23:15.794 --> 23:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the recess is over and check in
with him again,
and they would decide how to go
forward from

23:20.499 --> 23:21.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

23:21.066 --> 23:22.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

23:22.901 --> 23:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, a few Republican senators
have said that
they will meet with him. Is that
right? Just

23:27.006 --> 23:28.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a handful.

23:28.107 --> 23:29.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AILSA CHANG: Just a handful,
about five or
six.

23:29.975 --> 23:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Susan Collins of Maine, who has
been known
for a long time to be a
moderate, from the

23:33.612 --> 23:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very outset, she said that she
thinks that
the nominee, whomever Obama
picks, should

23:38.951 --> 23:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get a full confirmation process,
should get
a full confirmation hearing,
should get a

23:42.421 --> 23:47.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confirmation vote. So it's no
surprise that
she reiterated this week that
she would meet

23:47.826 --> 23:49.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with Merrick Garland.

23:49.695 --> 23:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three senators that are running
in battleground
states in 2016 said that they
would go ahead

23:56.235 --> 24:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and meet with Garland, Kelly
Ayotte of New
Hampshire, Rob Portman of Ohio,
and Mark Kirk

24:02.408 --> 24:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Illinois. Kirk had said also
from nearly
the outset that he thinks
Obama's nominee

24:07.413 --> 24:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should get a full confirmation
hearing.

24:09.348 --> 24:13.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, again, these
are senators
who are facing -- they're having
to compete

24:13.218 --> 24:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in states where the Democrats
have some chance,
so they're feeling a little bit
of a different

24:18.524 --> 24:20.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
atmosphere back home.

24:20.359 --> 24:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ailsa, what exactly then does
Merrick Garland
face? Are we just looking at
weeks and months

24:24.129 --> 24:26.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of no contact at all with the
Senate?

24:26.532 --> 24:30.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AILSA CHANG: I mean, it -- well,
he will certainly
-- he will certainly coming up
to the Hill

24:30.469 --> 24:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for many, many meetings with
Democrats, but
the question is, how many more
Republicans

24:36.108 --> 24:37.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will agree to these meetings?

24:37.943 --> 24:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, if you talk to Chuck
Schumer of New York,
he says that the ice is
breaking, the fact

24:43.082 --> 24:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that five or six Republican
senators are saying
now that they will meet with the
nominee shows

24:48.320 --> 24:53.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that there are many more
Republican senators
who are going to crack, because
it's just

24:53.092 --> 24:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
untenable that -- the position
they're taking.
That is sort of the hope that
Democrats are

24:57.129 --> 24:58.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
expressing right now.

24:58.964 --> 25:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's really going to be up
to the Senate
Democrats to try to keep this
issue alive,

25:03.402 --> 25:10.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially now we're going into
a two-week
recess. You know, it means
calling up press

25:10.242 --> 25:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
events. It means getting their
grassroots
efforts out there, continuing to
push this

25:15.681 --> 25:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the public eye, and getting
reporters
like me to keep writing about a
story -- about

25:20.386 --> 25:25.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this story, because if the story
ceases to
change, it's hard to keep
justifying coverage

25:25.224 --> 25:26.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

25:26.992 --> 25:30.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's an
unprecedented
situation, at least in our
modern -- in my

25:30.362 --> 25:32.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
memory. I don't remember
anything like this.

25:32.498 --> 25:36.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ailsa Chang with NPR, thank you
very much.

25:36.835 --> 25:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AILSA CHANG: You're welcome.

25:45.811 --> 25:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Millions of
viewers began tuning
into college basketball's March
Madness games

25:54.653 --> 25:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today. Billions of dollars are
paid for the
TV rights.

25:58.724 --> 26:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, an average of 11
million people
tuned in throughout the month.
And yet one

26:03.362 --> 26:08.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question looms larger than ever:
Should the
players be entitled to further
compensation?

26:08.667 --> 26:12.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
explores the issues this would
raise. It's

26:12.905 --> 26:16.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of his weekly Making Sense
report, which
airs Thursdays on the
"NewsHour."

26:16.809 --> 26:23.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ED O'BANNON, Former UCLA
Basketball Player:
I saw myself on a video game.

26:23.749 --> 26:28.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Former UCLA star Ed
O'Bannon,
MVP of the 1995 NCAA Finals.

26:28.654 --> 26:34.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: It was pretty cool
to watch.
I mean, the guy was left-handed,
bald-headed.

26:34.927 --> 26:39.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The jumper was good. So, I was
very pleased
about it.

26:39.331 --> 26:40.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:40.766 --> 26:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But the friend who
showed O'Bannon
the game was puzzled.

26:42.501 --> 26:47.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: What's funny about
it is, he
says, we paid X-amount of
dollars for it,

26:47.739 --> 26:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the video game, and you
didn't get one
penny.

26:49.875 --> 26:54.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: It was this
encounter that sparked
a famous firestorm, Ed
O'Bannon's eventual

26:54.980 --> 27:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2009 lawsuits against the NCAA
and video game
maker EA Sports for blatant and
unlawful use

27:04.556 --> 27:11.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of student athlete likenesses to
increase
sales and profits, while denying
college athletes

27:11.296 --> 27:16.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any share of the revenues they
generated,
besides a full-tuition sports
scholarship.

27:16.401 --> 27:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: Close to 15 years
later, and
they're still making money off
of my image.

27:23.842 --> 27:30.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just thought to myself,
there's got to be
something wrong about this. If I
was an entertainer

27:30.115 --> 27:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of any other sort, would I have
these same
things happened to me, you know?

27:38.557 --> 27:41.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No. You would get
royalties,
residuals.

27:41.727 --> 27:43.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ED O'BANNON: Absolutely.

27:43.529 --> 27:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We'd come to find
out what's
happened to Ed O'Bannon and his
suit, landing

27:47.866 --> 27:54.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Las Vegas, passing the Strip,
more decked-out
than ever, winding up in
Henderson, Nevada,

27:54.573 --> 27:59.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where O'Bannon works, lives, and
helps coach
basketball at Liberty High
School.

27:59.645 --> 28:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He now coaches the NCAA-ers of
tomorrow, who,
if they're absurdly good and
lucky, will play

28:06.518 --> 28:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a Final Four themselves
someday. The rights
paid to the NCAA to broadcast
the tournament

28:12.791 --> 28:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this year? Nearly a billion
dollars. The players'
take? Still zero.

28:20.232 --> 28:25.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York Times columnist Joe
Nocera has long
made the case for paying
so-called student

28:25.537 --> 28:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
athletes. It's starkly laid out
in his new
book, "Indentured."

28:28.807 --> 28:34.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOE NOCERA, Author,
"Indentured": They are
fundamentally exploited by a
system that makes

28:34.246 --> 28:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not millions of dollars, but
billions of dollars,
and that enriches everybody
around them except

28:42.254 --> 28:43.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

28:43.755 --> 28:48.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But athletes, if
they make it,
make millions of dollars.

28:48.460 --> 28:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE NOCERA: Sure. The very small
5 percent
who make it from college to the
pros will

28:57.202 --> 29:00.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get -- will get very rich. What
about the
other 95 percent?

29:00.906 --> 29:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: O'Bannon became one
of the 5
percent. And yet, in college, he
often went

29:06.178 --> 29:07.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hungry for lack of cash.

29:07.946 --> 29:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: There were many
nights when I
went through the night without
eating.

29:12.818 --> 29:13.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: You?

29:13.485 --> 29:15.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: Oh, absolutely.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It's simple, gentlemen. The
little things
is what's going to win us the
game.

29:17.489 --> 29:23.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Back at Liberty
High, the coaches
were prepping the Patriots for a
playoff game.

29:23.862 --> 29:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: Do what got us
here. Have some
fun. Keep us winning.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

29:32.571 --> 29:36.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Kyle Thaxton is one
of the team's
stars. Should college athletes
get paid?

29:37.009 --> 29:39.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE THAXTON, Student: If
they're the ones
playing and doing it on the
court, then they

29:39.745 --> 29:41.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be the ones getting paid
also. It shouldn't
just be the coaches.

29:41.747 --> 29:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Coaches who can
make $6 million
a year or more. And it's not
just pay.

29:46.351 --> 29:48.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RAMOGI HUMA, Former UCLA
Football Player:
In NCAA sports, you have players
who can be

29:48.954 --> 29:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stuck with sports-related
medical expenses.

29:50.789 --> 29:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ramogi Huma, who
played football
at UCLA, has been doing the
lonely work of

29:56.495 --> 29:58.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
organizing players.

29:58.263 --> 30:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMOGI HUMA: Injured players can
lose their
scholarships. Graduation rates
hover around

30:01.466 --> 30:06.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
50 percent amongst the sports
who are generating
this money, and the NCAA's
refusing to adopt

30:06.838 --> 30:10.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same concussion reforms that
the NFL has
adopted.

30:10.075 --> 30:13.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're not advocating for
professional salaries
and things like that, but we're
saying that,

30:13.612 --> 30:17.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look, some of that value should
be given in
the form of basic protections
like medical

30:17.749 --> 30:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
expenses and degree completion.

30:19.584 --> 30:24.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: NCAA President Mark
Emmert declined
an interview, but we caught up
with him at

30:24.222 --> 30:25.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a press conference.

30:25.657 --> 30:27.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why not pay college athletes?

30:27.459 --> 30:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK EMMERT, President, NCAA:
Because they're
students and they're not
employees. At the

30:31.396 --> 30:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of the day, you know, young
men and women
come to college because they
want to get an

30:34.933 --> 30:39.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
education, because they want to
participate
in their sport as part of that
educational

30:39.438 --> 30:40.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We relayed Emmert's
response
to Ed O'Bannon.

30:42.708 --> 30:46.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: The way that they
run their business
-- and that's what they're
doing, they are

30:46.445 --> 30:53.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running a business -- you can't
possibly do
that and think that your
employees, because

30:53.552 --> 31:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these athletes are employees,
they aren't
-- they shouldn't get paid. That
to me is

31:00.492 --> 31:02.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mind-boggling.

31:02.294 --> 31:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But it was time for
the tipoff.
In the playoff game, the home
team seemed

31:10.268 --> 31:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comfortably ahead. But big-time
college sports
is rarely comfortable, says Joe
Nocera.

31:15.974 --> 31:21.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE NOCERA: Really, being an
athlete on a
campus is a full-time job. The
NCAA rules

31:21.546 --> 31:28.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say it's only supposed to be 20
hours a week,
but if you go on a road trip,
they only count

31:28.954 --> 31:35.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time you're on the floor.
So, when you're
in the airplane, when you're in
the hotel,

31:35.160 --> 31:35.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that doesn't count.

31:35.827 --> 31:37.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And on campus:

31:37.596 --> 31:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOE NOCERA: You have
weightlifting in the
morning. Then you go to some
classes. Then

31:41.700 --> 31:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have got practice. Then you
have got more
strength training. Then you have
got enforced

31:46.805 --> 31:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
study hall. You know, you go to
bed at midnight,
you get up at 6:00, you do the
whole thing

31:51.009 --> 31:53.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all over. It's a full-time job.

31:53.245 --> 31:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And not only that. Let's be
honest. There's
a cartel that is suppressing the
wages of

31:59.317 --> 32:02.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a labor force, if you want to
think about
it in economic terms.

32:02.988 --> 32:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: "Cartel?" we asked
the NCAA's
Emmert.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK EMMERT: He's allowed his
opinions.

32:07.993 --> 32:13.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Turns out it's not
just the NCAA
that has a problem paying
players, though.

32:13.398 --> 32:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cardozo Law School Professor
Ekow Yankah:

32:15.233 --> 32:18.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EKOW YANKAH, Cardozo Law School:
The more
and more we treat them as young
minor league

32:18.804 --> 32:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
professional athletes, the
further they will
get from the other things that
we find valuable

32:24.442 --> 32:25.710 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about college.

32:25.744 --> 32:28.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or, as Liberty High
senior Kahlil
Derouen put it:

32:28.680 --> 32:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAHLIL DEROUEN, Student: We
don't want the
importance of being a student to
be diminished

32:32.150 --> 32:33.819 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

32:33.852 --> 32:38.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Moreover, Ekow
Yankah asks, if
you pay basketball, football and
baseball

32:38.690 --> 32:40.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
players:

32:40.559 --> 32:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EKOW YANKAH: What does that mean
for our water
polo team? What does that mean
for volleyball?

32:42.360 --> 32:47.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a dangerous line here
where the very
natural thing to do would be to
have three

32:47.365 --> 32:49.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
revenue-generating sports and
get rid of all
the others.

32:49.801 --> 32:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, Professor
Yankah has an alternative
for athletes who aren't
students.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EKOW YANKAH: If there are young
people who
are not at all interested in
being student

32:57.776 --> 33:03.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
athletes, and their life's
project is to develop
their particular athletic
talent, there ought

33:03.748 --> 33:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be professional developmental
leagues into
which they can go.

33:07.519 --> 33:11.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right now, of
course, the main
option for young basketball
players remains

33:11.523 --> 33:13.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to an NCAA college.

33:13.558 --> 33:17.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do almost all of them think they
are going
pro, that is, people who play in
Division

33:18.029 --> 33:18.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I college, let's say?

33:18.864 --> 33:20.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: In my experience,
yes.

33:20.098 --> 33:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it's a delusion
right?

33:22.100 --> 33:28.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: It's a delusion,
but I think
it's the right delusion. You
have to think

33:28.807 --> 33:31.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're going to go in order to
get there.

33:31.710 --> 33:39.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK, so what
happened to O'Bannon's
Liberty Patriots? Hoop dreams
dashed, theirs

33:39.351 --> 33:42.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and by this time ours, they
wound up losing
67-61.

33:42.787 --> 33:48.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ED O'BANNON: As the coaching
staff, we tip
our hats to you guys, because
you played hard

33:48.994 --> 33:50.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all season.

33:50.962 --> 33:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: What you guys did today and
these previous
four years, you will get to
further your education,

33:55.967 --> 33:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and get it paid for. That's the
goal.

33:58.336 --> 34:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And maybe even
getting paid extra
in cash.

34:03.041 --> 34:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, in the end, what's
happened to the
lawsuits? Well, EA Sports
actually settled

34:09.281 --> 34:14.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for roughly $60 million, with
thousands of
players, past and present,
getting, on average,

34:14.953 --> 34:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about $1,600 each, the money
finally awarded
just this week.

34:20.592 --> 34:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2014, the court ruled the
NCAA's refusal
to pay players was an antitrust
violation,

34:28.900 --> 34:35.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and also ordered up to $5,000
per student
athlete be put in trust for
using their likenesses.

34:35.674 --> 34:41.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the NCAA appealed, and the
money award
was reversed.

34:41.413 --> 34:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, this Tuesday, O'Bannon's
lawyers asked
the Supreme Court to review the
case.

34:49.187 --> 35:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Henderson, Nevada, this is
economics correspondent
Paul Solman for the "PBS
NewsHour."

35:01.566 --> 35:14.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The popular theme
park SeaWorld
has been under ever-growing
criticism for

35:14.679 --> 35:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way it breeds and shows its
popular orca
whales.

35:18.917 --> 35:22.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now SeaWorld is bowing to
pressure and making
a big change.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

35:24.823 --> 35:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Orca whales have
been entertaining
audiences at SeaWorld parks
since 1964. Once

35:33.498 --> 35:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feared -- they're commonly known
as killer
whales -- they have become
hugely popular

35:37.836 --> 35:39.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and even beloved.

35:39.571 --> 35:45.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's announcement, made with
the Humane
Society, means the era of public
exhibition

35:45.243 --> 35:47.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, gradually at least, coming
to an end.

35:47.412 --> 35:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL MANBY, CEO and President,
SeaWorld: Current
orcas under our care will be the
last generation

35:51.349 --> 35:54.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at SeaWorld. We're going to
phase out our
theatrical shows.

35:54.519 --> 35:59.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: SeaWorld is
ending its breeding
program for the animals, though
it's keeping

35:59.357 --> 36:01.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the whales it already has.

36:01.292 --> 36:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Orlando-based company
says the shows
will give way to what it calls
inspiring natural

36:07.298 --> 36:13.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
orca encounters. Animal rights
activists have
long criticized keeping the
animals in captivity.

36:13.605 --> 36:18.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Any of us would be
miserable if we
had to spend out life living in
a bathtub.

36:18.943 --> 36:23.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And orcas at SeaWorld are just
as miserable.
They spend their lives confined
to tiny tanks,

36:23.314 --> 36:26.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where they go mad from
confinement and boredom.

36:26.317 --> 36:32.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The parks came
under new scrutiny
in 2010 after one of the whales
drowned a

36:32.090 --> 36:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trainer. That attack later
became the peg
for 2013's "Blackfish," a
documentary examining

36:38.997 --> 36:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the effects of captivity on
killer whales.

36:42.067 --> 36:48.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The company also faced
regulatory and legislative
efforts to ban orca captivity.
And ticket

36:48.706 --> 36:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sales to the parks have dropped
significantly.

36:53.078 --> 36:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're joined now by the man
who made today's
announcement, SeaWorld CEO and
president Joel

36:57.382 --> 37:04.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manby, and by Wayne Pacelle, CEO
of the Humane
Society of the United States, a
longtime critic

37:04.055 --> 37:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of SeaWorld that worked with it
on the new
reform measures.

37:08.026 --> 37:08.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

37:08.860 --> 37:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Joel Manby, let me start with
you.

37:10.662 --> 37:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this an acknowledgment that
raising and
using the whales for public
exhibition has

37:14.899 --> 37:16.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been wrong?

37:16.835 --> 37:19.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL MANBY, CEO and President,
SeaWorld: Jeffrey,
what's really clear to me -- I
have been CEO

37:19.971 --> 37:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for about 11 months now -- is
that society
has shifted.

37:23.608 --> 37:30.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people's view of having
these majestic,
very large animals under human
care has changed

37:30.415 --> 37:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over time. And more and more
people are becoming
uncomfortable with it.

37:34.552 --> 37:38.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I had to make some difficult
decisions
to move the company forward, and
I felt that

37:38.957 --> 37:44.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the right thing to do for the
company and
all things considered is to end
our breeding

37:44.262 --> 37:46.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The right thing
to do for the
company, so should it be seen
mostly as a

37:49.033 --> 37:50.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
business decision?

37:50.869 --> 37:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL MANBY: You know what? I
think any business
in today's world has to be
connected to a

37:56.508 --> 37:58.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
core set of values.

37:58.309 --> 38:02.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our core set of values is to
help animals
in the wild. And a lot of people
don't maybe

38:02.914 --> 38:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
realize that about SeaWorld, but
we have the
best zoological organization, I
think, in

38:06.784 --> 38:11.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world. We're passionate
about animals.
We're passionate about animals
in the wild.

38:11.055 --> 38:17.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I felt that the orca issue
was an overhang
for us that was stopping our
incredible story

38:17.729 --> 38:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from being told to a country
that's changing.
And I think it's great that the
millennials,

38:23.201 --> 38:28.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the younger folks care about
conservation,
they care about animals. We do,
too, and I

38:28.606 --> 38:30.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wanted them to hear our story
more and more.

38:30.408 --> 38:34.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, so Wayne
Pacelle, as
I said, a longtime critic of
SeaWorld, now

38:34.712 --> 38:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working with them, what do you
see as the
importance of this move, and
what would a

38:38.416 --> 38:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
move towards a more educational
or more natural
approach be? What do you want to
see happen

38:44.556 --> 38:46.457 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now?

38:46.491 --> 38:48.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WAYNE PACELLE, President and
CEO, Humane Society
of the United States: Well, we
celebrate the

38:48.326 --> 38:53.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of breeding of orcas in
activity. This
has been a long-held aspiration
for the Humane

38:53.231 --> 38:56.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Society of the U.S. and so many
other groups
in our field.

38:56.801 --> 39:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, the atmospherics on
this issue
changed dramatically after the
airing of "Blackfish."

39:02.207 --> 39:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of these animals, they
are obviously
long-lived animals. They are
going to be around

39:07.712 --> 39:11.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if they are not released into
the wild. And
there are obviously a whole set
of challenges

39:11.916 --> 39:14.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if that were to be contemplated.

39:14.352 --> 39:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We obviously are very focused on
the idea
of an orca-centric experience,
that the trainers

39:20.592 --> 39:25.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are allowing them to exhibit
their natural
behaviors, that they're
exercised, that within

39:25.797 --> 39:28.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the captive setting, there's
enrichment.

39:28.132 --> 39:33.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a great challenge, with
these highly
intelligent, complex, sociable
animals who

39:33.404 --> 39:38.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
live in pods in the wild. We
think there's
a ceiling in terms of how much
can be done

39:38.543 --> 39:43.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for them, but obviously SeaWorld
and its staff
need to do their best to
accommodate their

39:43.781 --> 39:45.583 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
needs.

39:45.617 --> 39:47.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What about, Mr.
Pacelle, staying
with you, going -- I wonder if
you would go

39:47.585 --> 39:52.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
further, because your
organization has also
been critical of keeping
dolphins in captivity.

39:52.557 --> 39:57.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you pushing SeaWorld to go
there? Do you
expect this to continue to
something like

39:57.729 --> 39:59.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that any time soon?

39:59.597 --> 40:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WAYNE PACELLE: Well, we think
there's actually
a very artful solution, which
is, if SeaWorld

40:04.435 --> 40:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has continuing needs for animals
to populate
its expeditions, if they can get
animals who

40:11.709 --> 40:16.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are beached or otherwise in
distress from
the wild and those animals can
be brought

40:16.080 --> 40:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, rehabilitated and in some
cases, if they
cannot be re-released, then they
can meet

40:21.286 --> 40:23.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those needs.

40:23.121 --> 40:26.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that is a de facto
sanctuary. That's what
big cat sanctuaries and chimp
sanctuaries

40:26.824 --> 40:32.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and lots of other animal-based
sanctuaries
do. Some animals simply can't be
released

40:32.397 --> 40:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the wild again. And a lot
of very progressive
zoos and others are relying on
rescues to

40:39.070 --> 40:40.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
populate their exhibits.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we hope that's the direction
of SeaWorld
in the years ahead.

40:43.207 --> 40:44.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, what about
that, Mr.
Manby, because...

40:44.642 --> 40:46.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOEL MANBY: If I could....

40:46.444 --> 40:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, go ahead. I
want to get
your response on where you see
this going,

40:49.314 --> 40:53.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and why not, if there's cultural
shifts, move
to other animals like dolphins?

40:53.718 --> 40:58.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL MANBY: Well, a point that
Wayne made
that is very important -- a lot
of people

40:58.523 --> 41:05.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't realize it -- is that
there is a tremendous
need for rescue operations, and
the capacity

41:05.096 --> 41:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is much lower than the demand.

41:07.565 --> 41:12.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And one of the things I
announced today was,
SeaWorld is committing $50
million over the

41:12.403 --> 41:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next five years, with a goal of
being the
largest rescue organization in
the world.

41:17.842 --> 41:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just in the last year, we
rescue seven
animals a day, 1,000 dolphins
stranded last

41:24.782 --> 41:29.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year alone. There's hundreds and
hundreds
of sea lions in California that
we save.

41:29.787 --> 41:33.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This good work can't continue
unless SeaWorld
has the expertise and the
facilities.

41:34.025 --> 41:38.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is there, Mr.
Manby -- with
the orcas, you have said you --
it would be

41:38.796 --> 41:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dangerous to release the ones
you have.

41:40.932 --> 41:46.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What about, though, on a
case-by-case basis
or moving them, transferring
them to some

41:46.871 --> 41:48.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of transitional area?

41:48.539 --> 41:50.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOEL MANBY: Yes.

41:50.274 --> 41:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, this is something that
actually
Wayne and I have talked a lot
about. We don't

41:54.145 --> 41:58.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always agree on everything, and
we won't,
but we're trying to look for
common ground.

41:58.316 --> 42:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the truth is, any research
you read, any
peer-reviewed research, a whale
that's born

42:05.390 --> 42:08.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into human care is not a good
candidate for
release.

42:09.026 --> 42:14.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, in the history of
mankind, no whale
or dolphin born under human care
has been

42:15.032 --> 42:19.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
released successfully. The only
time it has
been done successfully, if
they're wild, they're

42:19.470 --> 42:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brought in for a short period of
time and
released.

42:21.439 --> 42:25.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have four whales that were
taken from the
wild over 35 years ago. They're
quite old

42:25.943 --> 42:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now. They have been under human
care for a
long, long time. We don't think
it's worth

42:30.581 --> 42:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the risk for those four whales.

42:32.450 --> 42:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mr. Pacelle, just
in our last
minute, I want to ask you about
the largest

42:36.487 --> 42:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
context here. Do you see this as
part of a
movement, in the way that zoos
and aquariums

42:42.960 --> 42:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and all look at the treatment of
animals,
movies, and so a much larger
cultural shift

42:48.666 --> 42:49.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here?

42:49.400 --> 42:51.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAYNE PACELLE: No question.

42:51.402 --> 42:55.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have got a book coming out
next month called
"The Humane Economy," and my
argument is that

42:55.940 --> 43:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business and commerce must marry
itself with
these emergent values about
animals and their

43:02.313 --> 43:04.215 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well-being.

43:04.248 --> 43:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was March last year we saw
Ringling Brothers
give up its traveling elephant
acts. We have

43:08.453 --> 43:12.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen movies migrate away from
live animals
to computer-generated imagery.
We're seeing

43:12.657 --> 43:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changes in the food sector,
where companies
like Wal-Mart or Kroger or
McDonald's are

43:17.795 --> 43:21.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now buying their products that
come from more
humane farms.

43:21.165 --> 43:28.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a cultural-wide shift.
And this happens
to be one manifestation, with a
live entertainment

43:28.039 --> 43:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
company like SeaWorld getting on
board. We're
happy about that, but we're very
happy about

43:31.876 --> 43:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the broader trends in society.

43:33.811 --> 43:38.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL MANBY: You think about, for
20 years,
we have been adversaries, really
monologuing

43:38.950 --> 43:41.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against each other. Now we're
dialoguing.

43:41.652 --> 43:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the winner is
animals in the wild
and in their habitats. And let's
focus there,

43:47.391 --> 43:51.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the crisis is bigger
than any organization
can handle. And we can do more
together than

43:51.963 --> 43:54.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if we fight all the time. So, I
think it's
a good move.

43:54.398 --> 43:57.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Joel Manby and
Wayne Pacelle,

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now an editorial
note.

44:12.450 --> 44:17.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In our report Tuesday night on a
North Carolina
family that's supporting Donald
Trump, we

44:17.522 --> 44:22.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were continuing a long
"NewsHour" tradition
of talking directly to voters.
We want to

44:22.393 --> 44:27.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear from them, in their own
voices, speaking
about what motivates their
political preferences.

44:27.598 --> 44:32.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regrettably, none of us at the
"NewsHour"
recognized the questions that
could arise

44:32.537 --> 44:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Grace Tilly's tattoos. And
we didn't
raise them with her until after
the report

44:38.075 --> 44:39.977 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
aired.

44:40.011 --> 44:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that point, our producer
contacted Ms.
Tilly, and she insisted the
tattoos are religious

44:44.515 --> 44:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in nature, and have nothing to
do with a neo-Nazi
theme or white supremacy.

44:50.588 --> 44:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We referenced her comments in an
editor's
note posted on our Web site.

44:54.692 --> 45:00.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Well, many of our online
commenters have since
let us know that they reject
that explanation.

45:00.731 --> 45:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're now posting this note as a
follow-up.

45:02.934 --> 45:08.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We at the "NewsHour" remain
committed to being
as transparent as possible in
covering this

45:08.506 --> 45:10.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will be back in just a
moment.

45:12.543 --> 45:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, we ask you to take
this time to
hear from your local PBS
station. It's a chance

45:17.748 --> 45:28.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to offer your support, which
helps keep programs
like ours on the air.
