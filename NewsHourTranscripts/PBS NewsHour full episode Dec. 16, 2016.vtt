00:05.472 --> 00:06.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'’m Judy Woodruff.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:07.474 --> 00:09.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

00:09.276 --> 00:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES:
Send clear message to Russia or
others not

00:12.880 --> 00:15.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do this to us, because we can
do stuff
to you.

00:15.749 --> 00:17.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEO CLIP)

00:17.684 --> 00:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: President Obama talks
about Russian
hacking, the crisis in Syria,
and what Democrats

00:21.889 --> 00:25.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
need to do differently, in his
final year-end
news conference.

00:25.859 --> 00:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, a global movement --
Italy's fastest
growing political party embraces
the anti-establishment

00:32.666 --> 00:35.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ideals becoming popular around
the world.

00:35.168 --> 00:36.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

00:36.870 --> 00:42.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is where
we see a
parallel with Brexit and the
United States.

00:42.109 --> 00:48.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is a sense of the
dispossessed, of the
disenfranchised, those who feel
they don't

00:48.548 --> 00:49.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really have a voice anymore.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEO CLIP)

00:51.785 --> 00:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And it's Friday, Mark
Shields and
Ramesh Ponnuru analyze a full
week of news.

00:57.124 --> 01:05.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour".

01:05.499 --> 01:09.036 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.069 --> 01:16.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: President Obama
strongly suggested
today that Russian President
Vladimir Putin

01:16.843 --> 01:21.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was at the heart of the computer
hacks on
the Democratic Party.

01:21.114 --> 01:25.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he defended his
administration's restrained
response in his year-end news
conference.

01:25.852 --> 01:27.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

01:27.154 --> 01:29.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
OBAMA: Hello, everybody.

01:29.056 --> 01:35.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: As expected, the issue
of alleged
Russian hacking of the U.S.
election dominated

01:35.195 --> 01:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama's last news
conference of
the year.

01:38.532 --> 01:44.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It came one day after
President-elect Trump
tweeted, "If Russia or some
other entity was

01:44.604 --> 01:48.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asking, why did the White House
wait so long
to act?

01:48.175 --> 01:51.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did they only complain after
Hillary lost?"

01:51.244 --> 01:56.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asked about that, Mr. Obama
pointed out that
the White House had told the
public about

01:56.216 --> 02:01.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia's role, and that he
personally had
told Vladimir Putin to, quote,
"cut it out,"

02:01.788 --> 02:03.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
but added:

02:03.657 --> 02:09.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OBAMA: How we approach an
appropriate response
that increases costs for them
for behavior

02:09.696 --> 02:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like this in the future, but
does not create
problems for us is something
that's worth

02:16.937 --> 02:19.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taking the time to think about
and figure
out.

02:19.206 --> 02:21.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's exactly what we've
done.

02:21.174 --> 02:26.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: All this comes just
days after reports
emerged that intelligence
officials concluded

02:26.913 --> 02:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
was directly
involved in efforts to influence
last month's

02:32.652 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
election in favor of Mr. Trump.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OBAMA: Not much happens in
Russia without
Vladimir Putin.

02:37.924 --> 02:44.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I will confirm that this
happened at the highest
levels of the Russian
government, and I will

02:44.331 --> 02:51.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let you make that determination
as to whether
there are high level Russian
officials who

02:51.438 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go off rogue and decide to
tamper with the
U.S. election process without
Vladimir Putin

02:57.310 --> 02:59.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
knowing about it.

02:59.212 --> 03:03.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Former Democratic
presidential candidate
Hillary Clinton told supporters
last night

03:03.483 --> 03:09.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the hack was the result of
Putin's, quote,
"personal beef" with her and
contributed to

03:09.056 --> 03:10.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her stunning loss.

03:10.857 --> 03:16.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Kremlin denied the
accusations today,
saying the U.S. has yet to
provide any proof

03:16.463 --> 03:18.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Russian involvement.

03:18.498 --> 03:22.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back at the White House,
President Obama was
careful when he was asked about
President-

03:22.803 --> 03:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elect Trump's perceived close
relationship
with Russia.

03:26.640 --> 03:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OBAMA: He was very complimentary
of Mr. Putin
personally.

03:32.379 --> 03:38.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, that wasn't news.

03:38.318 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president-elect during the
campaign said
so.

03:43.390 --> 03:52.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some folks who had made a
career out of
being anti-Russian didn't say
anything it.

03:52.165 --> 04:03.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over a third of Republican
voters approve
of Vladimir Putin, the former
head of KGB.

04:03.210 --> 04:05.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ronald Reagan would roll over in
his grave.

04:05.378 --> 04:10.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Turning to Syria, the
president
spoke of the fall of Aleppo and
the ongoing

04:10.350 --> 04:12.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
humanitarian crisis there.

04:12.652 --> 04:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He rejected criticism the
administration failed
to do enough to stop the civil
war.

04:18.325 --> 04:22.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBAMA: I cannot claim that we've
been successful.

04:22.529 --> 04:28.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, that'’s something that --
as is true
with a lot of issues and
problems around the

04:28.735 --> 04:34.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world -- I have to go to bed
with every night.

04:34.708 --> 04:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I continue to believe that
it was the
right approach given what
realistically we

04:39.312 --> 04:49.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
could get done, absent a
decision, as I said,
to go into in a much more
significant way.

04:49.256 --> 04:54.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And as for Hillary
Clinton's loss
and the future of the Democratic
Party, the

04:54.561 --> 05:00.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president said she was treated
unfairly, but
he had a thinly veiled criticism
of her campaign:

05:00.667 --> 05:03.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OBAMA: I can maybe give counsel
and advice
to the Democratic Party.

05:03.503 --> 05:09.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the thing that we have to
spend most time
on -- because it's the thing we
have the most

05:09.743 --> 05:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control over -- is how do we
make sure that
we are showing up in places
where I think

05:18.385 --> 05:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic policies are needed,
where they
are helping, where they are
making a difference,

05:23.990 --> 05:31.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but where people feel as if
they're not being
heard and where Democrats are
characterized

05:31.398 --> 05:41.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as coastal, liberal,
latte-sipping, you know,
politically correct out-of-touch
folks?

05:41.441 --> 05:46.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as coastal, liberal,
latte-sipping, you know,
politically correct out-of-touch
folks?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have to be in those
communities, OK?

05:48.848 --> 05:50.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, everybody.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.918 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mele Kalikimaka.

05:51.952 --> 05:55.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama now heads to
Hawaii to
spend the holidays with the
first family.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: After a week filled
with cabinet
announcements from
President-elect Trump,

06:01.161 --> 06:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it came to a close with a
controversial ambassadorial
nominee, and the last few
rallies for what

06:06.933 --> 06:08.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's calling his "thank you"
tour.

WILLIAM BRANGHAM, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT:
Hershey, Pennsylvania was Mr.
Trump's latest

06:12.405 --> 06:17.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stop last night, where he made a
point of
thanking African-American
supporters, albeit

06:17.344 --> 06:19.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in front of a largely white
audience.

06:19.145 --> 06:23.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
PRESIDENT-ELECT: I talk
about crime, I talk about lack
of education,

06:23.883 --> 06:28.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk about no jobs, and I'd say,
what the
hell do you have to lose, right?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's true.

06:30.457 --> 06:33.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're smart and they
picked up on it
like you wouldn't believe.

06:33.159 --> 06:34.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And you know what else?

06:34.628 --> 06:37.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They didn't come out to vote for
Hillary.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They didn't come out.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that was big -- so thank you
to the African-American
community.

06:41.768 --> 06:44.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: But exit polls tell a
different
story.

06:44.504 --> 06:50.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eight percent of blacks voted
for the president-elect;
88 percent went for Clinton.

06:50.043 --> 06:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The latest transition team
announcement was
Mr. Trump's pick for U.S.
ambassador to Israel

06:54.547 --> 06:58.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- David Friedman, who holds
controversial
positions on Israel.

06:58.852 --> 07:03.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FRIEDMAN, BANKRUPTCY
LAWYER: A Trump
administration will never
pressure Israel

07:03.290 --> 07:09.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a two-state solution or any
other solution
that is against the wishes of
the Israeli

07:09.162 --> 07:10.897 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

07:10.930 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRANGHAM: Friedman is a
bankruptcy lawyer
from New York who represented
Trump in the

07:13.667 --> 07:15.502 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
past.

07:15.535 --> 07:20.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He rejects the two-state
solution as a, quote,
"suicidal peace" and says Jews
who do support

07:20.173 --> 07:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it are worse than Holocaust
collaborators.

07:23.777 --> 07:28.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he says the U.S. State
Department -- where
he'll be an employee -- has a,
quote, "100

07:28.748 --> 07:30.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year history of anti-Semitism."

07:30.917 --> 07:35.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Friedman also supports the
highly controversial
idea of moving the American
embassy from Tel

07:35.822 --> 07:37.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Aviv to Jerusalem.

07:37.891 --> 07:42.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Mr. Trump held meetings
in New York,
including with President Obama's

the evacuation

12:18.338 --> 12:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turned into a scramble for
safety.

12:20.506 --> 12:31.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mortars had been fired and Red

It's a lot of chaos here, but
what's clear
is that there has been a
breakdown of this

12:41.561 --> 12:43.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ceasefire.

12:43.396 --> 12:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within minutes, Syrian soldiers

further towards rebel territory.

12:51.170 --> 12:56.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

17:19.438 --> 17:21.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

17:21.207 --> 17:25.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about the gap between
the numbers
here, the numbers the government
documented

17:25.411 --> 17:29.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the numbers you're able to
uncover in
your investigation.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What accounts for this?

17:31.083 --> 17:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERKES: Well, first of all, it's
the limitations
on government researchers.

17:37.690 --> 17:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the National Institute
for Occupational
Safety and Health, and they
track black lung

17:44.297 --> 17:48.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disease by bringing in miners
for x-rays.

17:48.367 --> 17:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're limited by law to
only testing
working miners, number one, and
the x-rays

17:55.675 --> 17:57.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are voluntary, number two.

17:57.677 --> 18:03.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they miss non-working
miners, people who've
retired, and they're also
missing a huge segment,

18:03.683 --> 18:08.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most miners, really, who avoid
getting tested
because they fear if there's a
positive test

18:08.521 --> 18:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for black lung, somehow their
mining company
will figure out and they will
lose their jobs.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: But that's illegal.

18:15.494 --> 18:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERKES: It's illegal but miners
widely believe
it.

18:20.166 --> 18:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every single miner I'’ve talked
to in Appalachia
in the last five years has said
the same thing.

18:26.305 --> 18:32.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they fear is just even
going to the NIOSH
Vans that come into their
communities with

18:33.012 --> 18:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
x-ray equipments and being seen
going into
the vans, just that could cause
the mining

18:38.851 --> 18:42.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
company to say this guy might
have black lung.

18:42.688 --> 18:47.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And mining -- the last mining
company you
worked for is the mining company
that saddled

18:47.093 --> 18:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with your black lung benefits
and your healthcare.

18:50.763 --> 18:55.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you could have worked
for another
mining company for 20 years, but
if you worked

18:55.134 --> 18:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the last one for a year,
they're the ones
that pay.

18:58.404 --> 19:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, miners believe that if
the mining
company finds out, they'll lose
their jobs,

19:02.942 --> 19:04.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so they don't get tested.

19:04.377 --> 19:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: This is also one of
the worst
forms of black lung.

19:07.780 --> 19:13.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there something different
that's happening
in the mining that's happening
now that'’s

19:13.085 --> 19:15.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
increasing the likelihood they
get the worst
form of it?

19:15.821 --> 19:21.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERKES: Well, for at least a
decade or so,
the big coal mining seams in
Appalachia have

19:21.961 --> 19:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
played out and there are thinner
seams now,
and those thinner seams have
coal mixed in

19:27.967 --> 19:29.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with rock.

19:29.802 --> 19:35.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That rock contains silica, and
they mine the
rock and coal together, and so,
their silica

19:35.441 --> 19:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dust mixed in with the coal
dust, with the
coal dust, and silica is
especially toxic

19:41.447 --> 19:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that is believed to be the
cause of this
very more serious stages of
disease that are

19:47.787 --> 19:49.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
affecting these miners.

19:49.622 --> 19:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also causing them to get
black lung a
lot younger than what was
typically used to

19:54.360 --> 19:57.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be when you would see miners
maybe in their
60s and 70s.

19:57.797 --> 20:03.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We'’ve talked to miners in their
30s and
40s who are now getting this
most serious

20:03.069 --> 20:04.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stage of black lung.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

20:05.304 --> 20:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what happens to a miner with
this sort
of the disease?

20:08.340 --> 20:13.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, who pays for it
especially when so
many small coal companies are
going bankrupt

20:13.412 --> 20:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the energy markets are
favoring natural
gas now?

20:16.582 --> 20:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERKES: Well, it's also very
large coal companies
going bankrupt.

20:21.620 --> 20:29.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the coal company is
self-insured and they
don't have enough assets, then
they're not

20:29.628 --> 20:33.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have enough money to
pay for the
benefits, and the coal company
is first in

20:33.933 --> 20:35.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
line to pay the benefits.

20:35.768 --> 20:40.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the coal company can't pay
the benefits
then it shifts to the Federal
Black Lung Trust

20:40.239 --> 20:42.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Fund, a federal program.

20:42.174 --> 20:48.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the problem is if you have
all the miners
coming into the system requiring
black lung

20:48.581 --> 20:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
benefits, coal companies are
unable to pay,
then that shifts to taxpayers.

20:54.386 --> 20:56.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: And there'’s an
Affordable Care
Act twist to this as well?

20:56.922 --> 21:00.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These are pre-existing
conditions if they
went to a different plan, but if
the Affordable

21:00.759 --> 21:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Care Act is repealed, would
these miners lose
these benefits?

21:05.531 --> 21:12.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERKES: Well, not only that,
there is in the
Affordable Care Act a specific
benefit for

21:12.471 --> 21:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coal miners with black lung that
makes it
easier for them to get black
lung benefits.

21:17.476 --> 21:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if the Affordable Care Act
is repealed,
it will be back to the old days
when it was

21:22.381 --> 21:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much more difficult to get
benefits in the
first place.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SREENIVASAN: All right.

21:48.908 --> 21:56.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a small publisher with a big
impact on literature;
and rethinking how we listen.

21:56.782 --> 22:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first, earlier this month,
Italian voters
rejected a referendum to alter
that nation's

22:02.188 --> 22:07.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constitution -- in what was a
stern rebuke
of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi,
who resigned

22:07.593 --> 22:09.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the aftermath.

22:09.361 --> 22:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vote was seen as the latest
instance of
a rising tide of populism both
in Europe,

22:14.099 --> 22:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and here, against elites and the
perceived
establishment.

CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY, PBS
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL
CORRESPONDENT: It started as
just another

22:24.076 --> 22:25.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
protest movement.

22:25.911 --> 22:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it could control the
Italian government
and many in Europe are
terrified.

22:31.650 --> 22:33.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's called the Five Star
Movement.

22:33.852 --> 22:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A foul-mouthed comedian named
Beppe Grillo
founded the group only seven
years ago.

22:38.724 --> 22:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the Five Star Movement is
Italy's fastest
growing party, picking off votes
from both

22:43.629 --> 22:49.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left and right, with a populist
message skewering
the political establishment amid
the punishing

22:49.635 --> 22:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
economic fallout of the euro
crisis.

22:53.806 --> 23:00.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The government has long
dismissed them as
anti-Euro nationalists -- done
so at their

now clear, and great peril.

This month, center-left Prime

Renzi, a staunch defender of the
European

23:08.387 --> 23:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union, was forced to resign when
he failed
in a referendum on
constitutional reforms

23:14.260 --> 23:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would have weakened the
powers of the
senate, in order to streamline
the legislative

23:18.330 --> 23:19.832 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

23:19.865 --> 23:23.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Five Star Movement
campaigned hardest
against Renzi.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New elections are expected early
next year.

23:25.904 --> 23:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

FRANCO PAVONCELLO, JOHN CABOT
UNIVERSITY IN
ROME: The Five Star Movement is
basically

23:38.684 --> 23:44.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a rejectionist party that feels
that the entire
political spectrum has been
disqualified by

23:44.423 --> 23:51.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decades of bad management,
corruption, economic
decline, where the people are
much poorer

23:51.130 --> 23:53.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than their grandparents.

23:53.198 --> 24:01.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is where we see a
parallel with Brexit
and the United States.

24:01.073 --> 24:07.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is a sense of the
dispossessed, of the
disenfranchised, those who feel
they don't

24:07.513 --> 24:09.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really have a voice anymore.

24:09.415 --> 24:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIVESAY: That voice is channeled
in parliament
by lawmakers like Manlio Di

ever done
so much for you?

MAGGI (translated): No.

25:58.624 --> 25:59.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Never.

It's never happened before.

LIVESAY: Stunts like these have
made the Five
Star Movement vulnerable to
charges of populism

26:06.465 --> 26:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- a charge they relish.

26:08.233 --> 26:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DI STEFANO: So, a lot of people
say to us,
this thing that you do makes you
a populist.

26:16.708 --> 26:21.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we always say, OK, if you
consider to
be populist just taking care of
people, we

26:21.547 --> 26:23.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are proud to be populist!

26:23.515 --> 26:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the truth is that everyone
in this building,
in parliament, should be a
little bit populist,

26:31.490 --> 26:34.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meaning they should consider the
people's
needs.

26:34.259 --> 26:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, you are doing your
own interests.

26:37.062 --> 26:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIVESAY: Populism is thriving
across Europe,
as economies in the common
market struggle,

26:42.868 --> 26:45.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and immigration booms.

26:45.270 --> 26:50.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While less extreme than other
European populists,
Five Star Movement leaders
insist migrants

26:50.709 --> 26:53.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
denied asylum should be
immediately deported.

26:53.745 --> 27:00.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, they've been accused of
circulating fake

PATRIZIO NISSIRIO, ANSA NEWS

such a danger that figures like
Pope francs

27:14.600 --> 27:18.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
warned the press not to spread.

27:18.036 --> 27:24.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He actually made a strong
parallel between

fake news
story accusing the government of

ballot boxes.

27:29.281 --> 27:32.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NISSIRIO: No, this is a
completely bogus story.

27:32.117 --> 27:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no reality about it.

27:34.152 --> 27:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the reaction on the social
network was
impressive.

27:38.123 --> 27:43.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Oh, Russia is the real winner of
all of this.

27:50.702 --> 27:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they kill the news
itself by creating
-- by flooding the market with
fake news.

27:55.407 --> 28:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, globally, wee have a
presidential candidate,
president-elect who told the
Russians, yes,

28:01.580 --> 28:07.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
please hack the Democratic

and release the emails, I want
you to release

28:07.819 --> 28:10.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the emails, inviting them
actually to the
party.

28:10.822 --> 28:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have Marie Le Pen, Madam Le

who asked the Russians to give
her $7 million

28:18.263 --> 28:20.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so she could run a campaign.

28:20.365 --> 28:24.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Five Stars here are
selecting these
kinds of news.

28:24.436 --> 28:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a national security threat,
what we're

CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY, PBS
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL
CORRESPONDENT: The Five Star
movement denies

28:29.041 --> 28:31.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it has a pro- Russian agenda.

28:31.476 --> 28:37.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But some of their policy
proposals would benefit
Russia, such as pushing for
Italy to leave

28:37.149 --> 28:42.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO, and for the E.U. to end
sanctions on
Russia for annexing Crimea in
2014.

28:42.421 --> 28:45.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MANLIO DI STEFANO, MEMBER OF

STAR MOVEMENT: We want to cut
these sanctions.

28:45.424 --> 28:49.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LIVESAY: You want to cut
European union sanctions
against Russia.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DI STEFANO: Yes.

28:50.462 --> 28:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only ones that are losing
money are the
European people.

28:53.465 --> 28:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They did something that was just
a demonstration
of power -- Europe against
Russia.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Russia is winning.

29:00.172 --> 29:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIVESAY: Indeed, it's the Five
Star movement's
Euro skepticism that's shaken
investors and

29:05.377 --> 29:06.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much of Europe.

29:07.012 --> 29:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If elected, they've promised to
hold a referendum
on abandoning the Euro currency.

29:11.750 --> 29:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the Eurozone's third-largest
economy, Italy's
exit could be disastrous.

29:17.656 --> 29:23.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government is now in the
hands of an interim
cabinet, and new elections must
be held.

29:23.495 --> 29:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to polls, the Five
Star Movement
won't win an all-out majority.

29:27.933 --> 29:32.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they're confident that the
polls are wrong
-- just as they were for another
political

29:32.871 --> 29:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
iconoclast: Donald Trump.

29:35.040 --> 29:45.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DI STEFANO: He made his campaign
having against
him the full establishment
system.

29:45.951 --> 29:49.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And everybody was really against
him.

29:49.488 --> 29:52.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are facing the same thing in
Italy.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will succeed like they
did.

29:55.861 --> 29:59.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as I said, we will really do
what we are
promising.

30:30.195 --> 30:31.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start out, Mark, by
talking about this
back and forth.

30:35.701 --> 30:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every day, there's a new piece
of information
about it did between what Donald
Trump is

30:40.338 --> 30:45.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
saying about whether the
Russians were involved
in this hacking of the
Democratic National

30:45.243 --> 30:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee and what the CIA and
now the FBI,
President Obama weighed in today
on this.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we to make of all this?

30:53.852 --> 30:56.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS, SYNDICATED
COLUMNIST: I think
what we're to make of it is, to
me what's

30:56.588 --> 31:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fascinating is not what Donald
Trump is in
no particular position to know,
but what's

31:04.496 --> 31:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most alarming to me is Donald
Trump will become
president of the United States,
he won the

31:09.367 --> 31:10.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

31:10.368 --> 31:11.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not about who won the
election.

31:11.703 --> 31:15.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He will become the 45th
president the 20th
of January.

31:15.907 --> 31:25.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
It is about whether the
sovereignty and
self-determination
of the United States was
compromised by an

31:25.050 --> 31:32.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organized at the highest Russian
levels, which
means the imprimatur of Mr.
Putin, espionage,

31:32.524 --> 31:34.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sabotage of the American
democratic system.

31:35.026 --> 31:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is an office in this
country that's
higher than that of president
and it's patriot,

31:39.998 --> 31:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and John McCain is filling that
right now,
and John McCain is saying, these
are questions

31:45.003 --> 31:49.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that must be answered, that
these are questions
that demand an answer.

31:49.641 --> 31:54.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the idea, as Mitch
McConnell, the Republican
Senate majority leader, says,
sending it to

31:54.579 --> 32:00.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Intelligence Committee is a
way of sending
it to limbo because we had -- we
spent $40

32:00.118 --> 32:05.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million in five years in the
Intelligence
Committee investigating torture
at Abu Ghraib,

32:05.157 --> 32:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have yet to get a report
about it.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That'’s a nice way of saying, oh,
it'’s
national security, we can'’ t
talk about

32:09.494 --> 32:10.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will not get a 9/11
Commission.

32:12.330 --> 32:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think John McCain and the
Armed Services
Committee with Jack Reed, the
Democrat, with

32:16.735 --> 32:21.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lindsey Graham and others, and
Tim Kaine in
a pretty damn good committee, I
think you

32:21.339 --> 32:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will get an honest hearing and
we need it.

32:23.809 --> 32:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea people are so concerned
about a $500,000
contribution to the Clinton
Foundation changing

32:30.182 --> 32:38.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and influencing American policy
somehow indirectly
and incurious about Russia's
involvement and

32:38.657 --> 32:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sabotaging an American election
is unforgivable
to me and irrational.

32:43.695 --> 32:46.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Ramesh, do you think
this will be
investigated thoroughly?

32:46.331 --> 32:51.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMESH PONNURU, NATIONAL REVIEW:
I think this
controversy is expanding in all
directions.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're going to have an
investigation.

32:53.071 --> 32:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're going to have a report
from the administration.

32:54.973 --> 33:00.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the a press conference,
President Obama
said there would be a report
tying loose ends,

33:00.478 --> 33:03.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tying it all together before he
leaves office.

33:03.081 --> 33:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you'’re going to have
the hearings
over the configuration of Trump
secretary

33:06.852 --> 33:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of state nominee, Rex Tillerson,
where I believe
the number one topic and
probably number two

33:12.791 --> 33:17.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
topic as well is going to be the
administration's
intentions toward Russia.

33:18.029 --> 33:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is going to be our third
president in
a row coming into office wanting
friendly

33:21.566 --> 33:23.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
relations with Russia.

33:23.101 --> 33:26.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, of course, this incredible
backdrop now
is going to color everything.

33:26.771 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, Mark, getting to
what both
of you are saying, this does
leave a cloud

33:31.910 --> 33:35.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- a dark cloud hanging over the
question
of our democracy.

33:36.014 --> 33:43.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if another nation,
unfriendly, to
put it I guess in the best
terms, can come

33:44.022 --> 33:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in and leak and get information
and have it
leaked at will, what does that
say about our

33:50.662 --> 33:52.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
system of government?

33:52.464 --> 33:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: Well, I mean, it says
-- no, I mean,
it says that, A, we're
vulnerable to such

33:54.399 --> 34:00.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks and, B, that we're
manipulated and
could be manipulated by Russia.

34:00.705 --> 34:03.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, Russia, this is not a
one-off for
Russia.

34:03.708 --> 34:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Russia'’s done it already
in Germany
and Italy and democracies in
Western Europe

34:09.881 --> 34:11.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Eurasia.

34:11.049 --> 34:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, and it'’s -- and they're
good at
it.

34:15.553 --> 34:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's be very blunt, it's not a
major investment
of time or money.

34:20.692 --> 34:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is of talent and skill, and
they have been
very good at it.

34:24.429 --> 34:32.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Judy, I mean, the question
is -- obviously,
it's on everybody's mind -- is
why did they

34:32.370 --> 34:38.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just reveal John Podesta's and
the Democratic
National Convention and Debbie
Wasserman Schultz

34:38.043 --> 34:39.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
--

34:39.044 --> 34:40.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Exactly.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: -- and the Democratic
campaigns,
and only attempt, according to
reports and

34:42.647 --> 34:49.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the best evidence, to get into
one Republican
staffer's email who had long
since left the

34:49.554 --> 34:50.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committee?

34:50.989 --> 34:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if, in fact, they did have
Republican
-- why that wasn't leaked?

34:54.726 --> 35:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it does raise questions
about where Putin's
affections and loyalties lay in
this election.

35:02.100 --> 35:06.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Ramesh, the president
was very careful
about the way he spoke about it
today.

35:06.338 --> 35:10.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He mentioned in his news
conference, but a
lot of people are just -- are
saying they're

35:10.308 --> 35:14.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now convinced that the Russians,
Vladimir
Putin was trying to hurt Hillary
Clinton and

35:14.379 --> 35:16.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
help Donald Trump.

35:16.214 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PONNURU: Well, yes, that does
seem to be the
view, at least based on the
latest reporting

35:20.185 --> 35:22.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the U.S. government.

35:22.153 --> 35:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, though, that one of the
things that
President Obama was trying to do
is to not

35:27.025 --> 35:32.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
allow that to be the
conversation that consumes
the Democrats as they figure out
what happened

35:32.864 --> 35:34.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this election.

35:34.566 --> 35:38.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also made a big point of
talking about
the mistakes the Democrats made,
although

35:38.236 --> 35:42.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was careful about that, too,
since he didn't
want to personally criticize
Hillary Clinton.

35:43.008 --> 35:48.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the Democrats obsess about
the Russian
role in this and they take their
eye off the

35:48.380 --> 35:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ball of some of the reforms they
need to undertake
themselves.

35:50.715 --> 35:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But it does -- again,
as both of
you were saying, the suggestion
is if, indeed

35:55.653 --> 35:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is known, if they conclude at
the end of
the investigation the Russians
were behind

35:59.224 --> 36:01.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this, something is going to have
to be done.

36:01.259 --> 36:06.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama said he told
Vladimir Putin,
Mark, to cut it out, but beyond
that we don't

36:06.464 --> 36:08.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know --

36:08.433 --> 36:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: No, something has to be
done, there'’s
no question, and whether it's
revealing Putin's

36:11.870 --> 36:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own financial situation, his
wheeling and
dealing, embarrassing him,
whatever form of

36:18.743 --> 36:20.478 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
retaliation.

36:20.512 --> 36:24.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I thought what was most
interesting, Judy,
was Donald Trump's official
response which

36:24.516 --> 36:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was an attack upon the CIA.

36:26.317 --> 36:31.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Donald Trump has never
spent time in
Washington, so he's never been
to Langley,

36:31.356 --> 36:33.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Virginia, where the whole CIA
headquarters.

36:33.725 --> 36:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would find on the wall of
stars 113 names
of American CIA operatives and
employees who

36:41.166 --> 36:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
died defending this country.

36:43.401 --> 36:49.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of them, Hugh Redmond,
was 19 years
a prisoner in Shanghai where he
was tortured

36:49.974 --> 36:52.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by the Chinese communists.

36:52.043 --> 36:56.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I should not get ahead of myself
because Donald
Trump doesn't like people who
were captured.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He likes people who weren't
captured.

36:58.216 --> 37:03.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, I mean -- but these are
patriots, these
are people who work hard and no
president

37:03.521 --> 37:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming in should ever disparage
or demean
or denigrate the heroic efforts
these people

37:09.727 --> 37:11.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
go to, to keep us safe.

37:11.763 --> 37:19.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Ramesh, Mark mentioned
Rex Tillerson
who is the choice by Donald
Trump to head

37:19.537 --> 37:20.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the State Department.

37:21.005 --> 37:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are going to be these
hearings, his
confirmation hearings.

37:24.809 --> 37:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think is going to
come out of
that?

37:26.644 --> 37:30.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think he's going to sail
through knowing
what we know now about his close
connections

37:30.849 --> 37:32.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Mr. Putin?

37:32.484 --> 37:37.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PONNURU: My suspicion is he will
not see this
process as one of sailing
through.

37:37.388 --> 37:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think there'’s going to be
tough questioning.

37:39.157 --> 37:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do think he comes with some
real advantages.

37:42.127 --> 37:46.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the Republicans, who, of
course, have
a majority in the Senate, tend
to think well

37:46.498 --> 37:49.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of businessmen, successful
businessmen which
he certainly is.

37:49.934 --> 37:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's got the support of some
leading Republican
foreign policy establishment
figures.

37:54.539 --> 37:59.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Apparently, former Vice
President Dick Cheney
is making calls on his behalf.

37:59.210 --> 38:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But absolutely, there are going
to be these
questions about the Russia
policy.

38:02.647 --> 38:08.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was saying how Trump will be
the third president
in a row coming in wanting
friendly relations.

38:08.253 --> 38:10.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It didn't work out for the
previous two.

38:10.321 --> 38:15.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one has to ask whether this
is an ambition
that makes sense for our country
right now.

38:15.627 --> 38:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What else about Mr.
Tillerson, Mark,
and then the other I guess
prominent appointee

38:21.266 --> 38:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this week is former Texas
Governor Rick Perry
to run the Energy Department.

38:27.205 --> 38:33.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're just about finished now
filling out
the Trump cabinet, at least
those he's nominating,

38:33.311 --> 38:35.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take these positions.

38:35.146 --> 38:38.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think we have a pretty
good sense of
where Donald Trump wants to take
the country

38:38.416 --> 38:39.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from looking at it?

38:39.417 --> 38:41.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHIELDS: I don't, Judy.

38:41.219 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Mr. Tillerson in all
likelihood will
be confirmed for all the reasons
that Ramesh

38:47.125 --> 38:48.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
addressed.

38:48.293 --> 38:50.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He'’s got a strong -- Bob Gates
recommended
him.

38:50.762 --> 38:58.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He'’s got Jim Baker and Condi
Rice weighing
in and it appears the Republican
establishment

38:58.269 --> 38:59.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is certainly.

38:59.971 --> 39:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He doesn't need Dick Cheney's
support now
as much as the Gates-Rice-Baker
backing.

39:07.745 --> 39:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that aside, there is always
a presumption
in favor of a president and the
cabinet because

39:13.718 --> 39:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president gets to choose the
cabinet is.

39:15.853 --> 39:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don'’t last -- unlike a
judge who's
appointed a life time, that this
greatest

39:20.892 --> 39:22.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
group may attach to.

39:22.894 --> 39:31.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rick Perry, irony of ironies,
who can forget
2011 in Auburn Hills, Michigan,
as every Republican

39:31.903 --> 39:35.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does in a presidential debate
talked about
all the agencies he was going to
get rid of

39:35.773 --> 39:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them, you recall there was
Education and there
was Commerce and that third one
-- whoops

39:44.782 --> 39:46.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- and it was Energy.

39:46.551 --> 39:49.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here he is and instead of
getting rid
of it -- maybe he's going to get
rid of it.

39:49.988 --> 39:56.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the irony, the man who
called Donald Trump
a cancer on the conservative
movement, who

39:56.394 --> 40:00.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to be excised, is now
nominated by Donald
Trump showing what a big person
Donald Trump

40:00.999 --> 40:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to be his secretary of
energy.

40:03.001 --> 40:06.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The last thing I want
to talk to
you about is Syria, President
Obama, Ramesh,

40:06.971 --> 40:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was asked about this today.

40:08.940 --> 40:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see Aleppo, which is the
rebel stronghold
finally all but completely
falling today to

40:14.178 --> 40:16.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Assad regime.

40:16.281 --> 40:19.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama says, yes, I
take responsibility.

40:19.250 --> 40:24.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I take responsibility for
everything that
happens on my watch, what -- I
mean, how do

40:24.856 --> 40:29.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you read the Obama
administration and the
story of what's happened in
Syria?

40:29.694 --> 40:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PONNURU: I don't see how this is
anything
other than a black mark on the
Obama administration's

40:35.333 --> 40:37.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
record.

40:37.201 --> 40:39.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, there is a temptation
for Americans
to think that everything that
happens in the

40:39.570 --> 40:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
world is somehow, you know, our
responsibility,
our fault or our credit.

40:43.841 --> 40:50.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here we have a situation
where the administration
pursued a policy that by his own
admission

40:50.114 --> 40:56.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today was ineffective and where
his continual,
even now he wants to work with
the United

40:56.387 --> 41:00.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nations while admitting the
Russians are going
to prevent the United Nations
from doing anything.

41:00.725 --> 41:02.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Mark?

41:02.460 --> 41:10.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: The villains of the
piece remain
Assad himself, Putin, Iran, al
Qaeda, and

41:10.134 --> 41:11.102 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ISIS.

41:11.135 --> 41:14.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you'’re talking about the
death.

41:14.539 --> 41:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the failure of the United
States to be
able to lead any kind of
movement, to save

41:21.079 --> 41:29.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the humanitarian tragedy, to
avoid and rescue
the innocent suffering there is
a failure,

41:30.021 --> 41:31.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a real failure.

41:31.389 --> 41:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it is -- Aleppo will be
in the same
category as Dresden.

41:35.393 --> 41:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will be remembered as a
humanitarian disaster.

41:39.297 --> 41:46.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the president gets
responsibility, the
Congress are the cowardly lions
in this.

41:46.104 --> 41:49.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, they talk a big game and
none of them
steps up.

41:49.307 --> 41:51.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very few.

41:51.075 --> 41:55.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there was Jeff Flake and
Tim Kaine
who were willing to lead an
authorization

41:55.913 --> 41:59.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of military force, but the
others talk a good
game.

41:59.384 --> 42:04.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as far as the "no fly" zone,
there wasn't
the will to impose it, let'’s be
honest,

42:04.489 --> 42:06.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and there wasn'’t the leadership.

42:06.324 --> 42:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And I was struck the
president said
today, every day, he thinks
about, you know,

42:09.527 --> 42:14.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what more he could have done and
in particularly,
I was struck by he spoke about
the children

42:14.866 --> 42:17.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who have died in Syria.

42:17.802 --> 42:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, it's great to have both of
you here.

42:20.805 --> 42:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ramesh Ponnuru and Mark Shields,
Friday night.

42:25.276 --> 42:27.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you both.

42:27.712 --> 42:30.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHIELDS: Thank you.

42:30.114 --> 42:32.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PONNURU: Thank you.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: OK.

42:34.152 --> 42:36.120 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

42:36.154 --> 42:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Now, the story of a
small, but influential
publisher that's succeeding at
making poetry

42:41.459 --> 42:45.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ever more relevant to the
problems and dynamics
of our time.

42:45.396 --> 42:46.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

JEFFREY BROWN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT:
Recommend encouraging --

42:49.534 --> 42:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Rejection.

42:50.535 --> 42:52.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BROWN: Rejection.

42:52.036 --> 42:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SHOTTS, EXECUTIVE EDITOR,
GRAYWOLF PRESS:
An encouraging rejection.

42:53.971 --> 42:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: An encouraging rejection
as opposed
to what?

42:57.842 --> 42:59.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHOTTS: An encouraging
rejection.

42:59.477 --> 43:02.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Jeff Shotts clearly loves
his job.

43:02.380 --> 43:08.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one part of it -- sorting
through thousands
of poetry manuscripts every year
-- and rejecting

43:08.352 --> 43:11.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
99 percent of them -- that's not
his favorite.

43:11.322 --> 43:14.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHOTTS: I don't want to be the
"rejection
guy".

43:14.692 --> 43:16.427 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:16.461 --> 43:20.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHOTTS: Jeffrey -- rejection is
part of the
equation of being an artist and
not just a

43:20.832 --> 43:22.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
poet.

43:22.200 --> 43:26.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, we're receiving
thousands of
poetry submissions.

43:26.471 --> 43:27.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BROWN: Yes, literally.

43:27.972 --> 43:29.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOTTS: Literally, every year.

43:29.907 --> 43:37.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're publishing about 10 to
12 poetry
books in a year.

43:37.048 --> 43:45.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the math of that is very
difficult I think
in one way for poets probably to
hear.

43:45.056 --> 43:48.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: I think I saw your
shoulders just slump
as you said it.

43:49.026 --> 43:51.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOTTS: A little bit, yes, yes.

43:51.062 --> 43:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Shotts is executive
editor at Graywolf
Press in Minneapolis, a small
but prominent

43:56.601 --> 43:57.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
literary publisher.

43:57.802 --> 43:59.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOTTS: What time was that?

43:59.637 --> 44:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: One of the hundreds of
sometimes tiny
cogs that keep the world of
poetry alive and

44:05.209 --> 44:07.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thriving.

44:07.211 --> 44:11.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those books Graywolf has
been publishing
-- of many poetic styles and
subjects -- are

44:11.983 --> 44:14.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting a lot of attention these
days.

44:14.652 --> 44:20.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Volumes like Claudia Rankine's
"Citizen",
examining overt and subtle
racism, which has

44:20.391 --> 44:24.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
won numerous prizes and garnered
huge sales.

44:24.061 --> 44:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And more recently, Solmaz
Sharif's "Look"
-- about war and violence -- was
on the short

44:29.100 --> 44:31.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
list for the national book
award.

44:31.169 --> 44:33.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two other Graywolf collections
made the long
list.

44:34.005 --> 44:40.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHOTTS: We want our poetry books
to be challenging
-- challenging the way that
these are poets

44:40.645 --> 44:44.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are engaging with important
social issues
in many cases.

44:44.949 --> 44:49.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BROWN: Do you think this
accounts in part
for the success -- the recent
success you've

44:49.687 --> 44:51.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
had?

44:51.455 --> 44:55.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHOTTS: I think there is
something about the
fact that so many of us in
American culture

44:55.359 --> 45:03.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are saturated with media,
saturated with social
media maybe in particular.

45:03.267 --> 45:11.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the idea of being able to
hold an object
in your hand, it is an
engagement, an individual

45:11.175 --> 45:16.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engagement with an individual
voice that I
don't think any other art form
than poetry

45:16.781 --> 45:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can provide in the same way.

45:18.916 --> 45:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Graywolf was started 42
years ago in
Washington state.

45:23.621 --> 45:27.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ten years in, the press came to
Minnesota,
where it found a welcoming home.

45:28.025 --> 45:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHOTTS: Books that are relevant
to what people
are thinking about.

45:31.996 --> 45:38.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: The Twin Cities have
developed a reputation
as a small press Mecca and big
book town.

45:38.135 --> 45:43.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We visited during its annual
festival of books
where indie locals, who punch
well above their

45:43.207 --> 45:50.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weight, sold their wares: coffee
house press,
rain taxi review, milkweed
editions, and many

45:50.448 --> 45:52.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

45:52.249 --> 45:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Graywolf's Jeff Shotts says
there's never
been a better time for poetry
publishing.

45:56.253 --> 46:02.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHOTTS: The vitality of poetry
right now I
think is at a pitch high.

46:02.526 --> 46:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there are more
people reading
it, engaging with it, performing
it, saying

46:09.834 --> 46:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it out loud, saying it in an
interior way
and making it part of their
daily lives.

46:16.507 --> 46:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: And a lot of people
writing it -- which
brings us back to that rejection
business.

46:22.146 --> 46:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This past summer, when Graywolf
put out a
call for manuscripts, nearly
2,000 were sent

46:27.151 --> 46:28.219 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

46:28.252 --> 46:30.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's cruel, but you like to see
the number
go down.

46:30.388 --> 46:32.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.

46:32.189 --> 46:36.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Shotts and colleagues
read every work
submitted, sorted them into yes
and, mostly,

46:36.894 --> 46:44.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no categories, but also drew
careful distinctions
between "no, not ever" and a
"no, but maybe

46:44.101 --> 46:45.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
someday".

46:45.503 --> 46:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHOTTS: You know, there was
something in this
that was exciting.

46:47.938 --> 46:55.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It didn't quite hit for us here,
but, you
know, let's keep in touch and is
there a conversation

46:55.513 --> 46:57.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that can happen?

46:57.381 --> 47:03.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something I'’m excited
about having
as an ongoing out here
conversation with poets

47:03.621 --> 47:04.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all over the world.

47:04.989 --> 47:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: You would reject people
several times,
but keep talking.

47:09.293 --> 47:10.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHOTTS: Absolutely.

47:10.394 --> 47:12.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: And then eventually
something would
come.

47:12.129 --> 47:17.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHOTTS: This has certainly
happened and we've
had marvelous books as a result
of it.

47:17.368 --> 47:20.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: And his advice to those
who don't make
the cut?

47:20.037 --> 47:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHOTTS: I don't think it makes
someone less
of a poet not to be published.

47:25.309 --> 47:27.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are still a poet.

47:27.478 --> 47:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there's publishing and then
there's poetry.

47:30.881 --> 47:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, those things can go hand in
hand in a
way to present particular kinds
of poetry.

47:37.722 --> 47:46.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But more often than not, poetry
is also meant
to be performed or spoken or
shared intimately.

47:46.230 --> 47:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is absolutely the place
where poetry
is inside our lives.

47:50.768 --> 47:58.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: From Minneapolis, I'’m

WOODRUFF: This fall, tensions
around free
speech and political
sensitivities have erupted

48:09.987 --> 48:11.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on several college campuses.

48:11.856 --> 48:17.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"New Yorker" writer Nathan
Heller wonders
if listening differently might
help.

48:17.161 --> 48:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Nathan brings us the
latest installment
in our series "#IMHO", "In My
Humble Opinion".

48:23.067 --> 48:24.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

48:24.802 --> 48:27.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATHAN HELLER, THE NEW YORKER:
We've been
hearing a lot about free speech
on campus,

48:27.938 --> 48:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet the crucial challenge now
isn't what we're
free to express.

48:32.276 --> 48:34.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's how we listen.

48:34.378 --> 48:40.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Solving college's problems
today, I believe,
paradoxically means listening
less like wise

48:40.217 --> 48:44.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
scholars and more like
travelers.

48:44.889 --> 48:48.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans who got out of town
this summer
might recall the feeling.

48:48.559 --> 48:50.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Around the house, we know what
we're listening
for.

48:51.028 --> 48:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An early clap on the porch means
that the
newspaper has arrived.

48:55.232 --> 49:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The dishwasher making that weird
sound again
calls for the usual repair.

49:00.671 --> 49:04.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We tune out the announcements on
the subway.

49:04.341 --> 49:08.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When we travel, however, we
listen differently.

49:08.179 --> 49:11.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We process everything with fresh
ears.

49:11.315 --> 49:16.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are no expectations, no
old scripts
to follow.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Part of the problem is language.

49:19.123 --> 49:25.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people get behind the same
abstract words,
and yet their meanings diverge
and harden.

49:25.629 --> 49:30.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about that worn-out word
"diversity,"
which recently emerged in a
dispute about

49:30.568 --> 49:33.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an old mural at Oberlin College.

49:33.037 --> 49:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The painting, a tableau of
several cultures,
including a black man playing
the saxophone

49:38.809 --> 49:44.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a South Asian man charming a
snake, had
been created to celebrate
diversity.

49:44.782 --> 49:51.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some current students
thought these caricatures
stood for the opposite of
diversity.

49:51.121 --> 49:54.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They made variety exotic.

49:54.859 --> 49:59.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The mural was eventually painted
over -- to
the alarm of others, who worried
about censorship

49:59.830 --> 50:01.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of art.

50:01.799 --> 50:08.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If all sides listened to the
debate like strangers
in a strange land, what might
they have heard?

50:08.272 --> 50:14.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They might have noticed that the
mural's right
to exist as art -- as a creative
work reflecting

50:14.044 --> 50:18.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its moment -- had never been in
question.

50:18.148 --> 50:22.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Instead, one side thought the
mural was racist.

50:22.386 --> 50:26.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another saw it as merely an
artifact of the
past.

50:26.123 --> 50:32.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Diversity," as a concept, had
been tossed
around so vaguely that it was
unclear which

50:32.096 --> 50:33.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was the case.

50:33.631 --> 50:37.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Travelers listening for the
first time might
not be so sure.

50:37.935 --> 50:43.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We expect new students to have
disorienting
experiences when they arrive on
campus.

50:43.474 --> 50:47.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet if higher education is
really going to
be worth the name, the listening
needs to

50:47.611 --> 50:51.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happen on a broader
institutional level, too.

50:51.749 --> 50:55.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Education, it's sometimes said,
is a journey.

50:55.219 --> 50:58.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's all make sure we hear
enough to make
the trip worthwhile.

51:32.623 --> 51:35.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they all could land on TSA's
Instagram
feed.

51:35.793 --> 51:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A click-bait worthy mix of
confiscated security
items and explosive-detecting
dogs, TSA'’s

51:42.800 --> 51:47.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instagram has been rated by
"Rolling Stone"
magazine as the app's fourth
best -- right

51:47.838 --> 51:49.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between pop stars Rihanna and
Beyonce.

51:49.974 --> 51:52.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB BURNS, LEAD SOCIAL MEDIA
SPECIALIST, TSA:
As a former musician, I always
wanted to make

51:52.776 --> 51:56.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Rolling Stone," and I never
imagined that
I would make it through social
media with

51:56.113 --> 51:57.081 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
TSA.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GRIFFIN: Bob Burns runs the
agency's feed.

51:59.316 --> 52:03.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BURNS: I think they find it
fascinating because
they can'’t believe people are
bringing items

52:03.554 --> 52:06.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the plane, like the guns and
the knives
and grenades.

52:06.590 --> 52:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRIFFIN: Some of the bizarre
highlights include:
a homemade avalanche charger,
this bag of

52:12.329 --> 52:19.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
live eels, a human skull hidden
in a clay
souvenir pot, and, of course,
canines at work

52:19.236 --> 52:20.204 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and at play.

52:20.237 --> 52:22.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BURNS: You can never go wrong
with the dogs.

52:22.573 --> 52:24.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GRIFFIN: But the most-liked
post?

52:24.742 --> 52:29.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This full-sized dummy corpse
from the film
"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."

52:29.113 --> 52:32.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BURNS: I don't know how they
worked it out,
if they had a ticket for him
with the airline,

52:32.683 --> 52:34.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but we had to screen through the
x-ray."

52:34.151 --> 52:38.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GRIFFIN: TSA's images mainly
come from security
check incident reports.

52:38.589 --> 52:44.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And while the stream of
explosives and weapons
might trigger alarm, Burns
contends it shows

52:44.661 --> 52:47.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the often-criticized agency is
getting the
job done.

52:48.032 --> 52:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BURNS: I think it acts as a
deterrent.

52:49.933 --> 52:53.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It shows that we're finding
these things,
and if anyone was thinking about
sneaking

52:53.103 --> 52:56.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something through, they're going
to say, "Well,
maybe I shouldn't, because
they're probably

52:56.106 --> 52:57.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to find it."

52:57.307 --> 53:00.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GRIFFIN: But the TSA's posts
also provide
travel tips.

53:00.978 --> 53:03.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Really need that five-blade mace
on your vacation?

53:03.580 --> 53:05.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Put it in your checked bag.

53:05.749 --> 53:09.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Want to know if you can carry-on
that mini
alligator head?

53:09.386 --> 53:11.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tweet @asktsa.

53:11.688 --> 53:15.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And need to make sure that
laptop you left
at Newark airport last month
gets returned?

53:15.993 --> 53:20.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BURNS: We recommend people place
their business
card or their contact
information on their

53:20.597 --> 53:22.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
laptop.

53:22.299 --> 53:25.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRIFFIN: For the "PBS NewsHour",
I'’m Julia
Griffin at Ronald Reagan
National Airport

53:25.669 --> 53:26.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Washington, D.C.

53:26.804 --> 53:28.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

53:28.138 --> 53:30.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: I'’m just glad they're
going through
it so carefully.

53:30.541 --> 53:35.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we'll be back, right here,
on Monday,
with a rare look inside Bruce
Springsteen,

53:35.813 --> 53:37.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the rock legend.

53:37.347 --> 53:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We'’ll talk about his life, his
music, and
his battles with depression.

53:39.983 --> 53:42.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:42.619 --> 53:43.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'’m Judy Woodruff.

53:43.620 --> 53:44.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:44.655 --> 53:52.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you and good night.
