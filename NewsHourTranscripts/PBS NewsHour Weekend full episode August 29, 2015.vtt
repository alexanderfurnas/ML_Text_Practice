I'D JUST MISS COMING HOME TO MY

08:15.929 --> 08:16.763
HOUSE.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.131
I MISS WALKING INSIDE AND

08:18.131 --> 08:19.632
PLOPPING DOWN IN FRONT OF THE

08:19.632 --> 08:20.600
TELEVISION, YOU KNOW, AND I JUST

08:20.600 --> 08:22.535
MISS HOME.

08:22.535 --> 08:23.536
YOU KNOW, BRINGING THE KIDS OUT

08:23.536 --> 08:24.571
IN THE BACKYARD TO PLAY ON THE

08:24.571 --> 08:25.872
SWING SET, YOU KNOW.

08:25.872 --> 08:28.408
JUST THE SMALL THINGS.

08:28.408 --> 08:30.944
BUT THERE'S NO WAY IN THE WORLD

08:30.944 --> 08:31.878
THAT, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GOING TO

08:31.878 --> 08:36.049
GO THROUGH GUTTING IT OUT.

08:36.049 --> 08:43.656
NO, WE'RE PRETTY MUCH DONE HERE.

08:43.656 --> 08:44.624
IT'S BEEN ALMOST TEN YEARS SINCE

08:44.624 --> 08:45.959
KATRINA, AND I'D SAY THAT MY

08:45.959 --> 08:46.793
LIFE IS-- MY LIFE IS STILL

08:46.793 --> 08:49.062
PRETTY DIFFICULT.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.897
MY WIFE AND I, FOR A LONG TIME,

08:50.897 --> 08:53.433
WERE DEALING WITH POST-TRAUMATIC

08:53.433 --> 08:55.402
STRESS, AND, YOU KNOW, WE'D SNAP

08:55.402 --> 08:58.238
AT EACH OTHER AND ARGUE AND JUST

08:58.238 --> 08:59.139
DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE FELT

08:59.139 --> 09:02.509
THE WAY THAT WE FELT.

09:02.509 --> 09:03.443
KATRINA, TO ME, IT WAS SORT OF

09:03.443 --> 09:06.679
LIKE OUR 9/11.

09:06.679 --> 09:21.928
IT JUST SHOOK US TO THE CORE.

09:21.928 --> 09:23.329
>> MY NAME IS JANNA FIRMIN, AND

09:23.329 --> 09:24.431
I LIVE IN PEARL RIVER,

09:24.431 --> 09:27.300
LOUISIANA, NOW.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.102
I RIGHT NOW LIVE WITH MY

09:29.102 --> 09:30.203
DAUGHTER MARLY, AND MY SON NOAH

09:30.203 --> 09:32.439
AND MY BOYFRIEND SEAN.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.239
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT TWO AND

09:33.239 --> 09:39.779
A HALF YEARS.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.115
I REALLY FEEL LIKE THIS

09:42.115 --> 09:43.450
APARTMENT IN PEARL RIVER, IT'S--

09:43.450 --> 09:45.385
IT'S A GROUNDING SPOT.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.253
AND THIS IS HONESTLY THE FIRST

09:47.253 --> 09:48.521
TIME THAT I'D FELT THAT SINCE

09:48.521 --> 09:53.293
KATRINA.

09:53.293 --> 09:54.227
I REALLY LIKE THE PEACEFULNESS

09:54.227 --> 09:55.328
OF PEARL RIVER.

09:55.328 --> 09:56.095
I REALLY LIKE THE QUIETNESS AND

09:56.095 --> 09:57.964
THE SERENITY.

09:57.964 --> 10:03.369
IT'S A BIG CHANGE FROM THE CITY.

10:03.369 --> 10:06.639
IT'S STILL EMPTY IN A LOT OF

10:06.639 --> 10:09.576
WAYS BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE LIFE

10:09.576 --> 10:11.077
THAT I KNEW IS NO MORE, AND I

10:11.077 --> 10:12.545
MISS THAT AND IT HURTS A LOT.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.414
GOD'S GIVEN ME A WHOLE LOT OF

10:14.414 --> 10:16.816
SECOND CHANCES, SO I REALLY

10:16.816 --> 10:18.351
APPRECIATE JUST THE SIMPLE

10:18.351 --> 10:19.686
THINGS, LIKE A QUIET CUP OF

10:19.686 --> 10:20.520
COFFEE IN THE MORNING WITH A

10:20.520 --> 10:26.426
SIMPLE BOOK IN THE EVENING.

10:26.426 --> 10:27.393
SHORTLY BEFORE KATRINA, MY DAD

10:27.393 --> 10:28.761
DIED.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.129
AND THEN KATRINA HAPPENED, AND

10:30.129 --> 10:32.098
THEN EVERYTHING THAT I KNEW, YOU

10:32.098 --> 10:33.466
KNOW-- SCHOOL, WORK, HOUSE,

10:33.466 --> 10:34.467
FAMILY-- LIKE, IT WAS JUST

10:34.467 --> 10:36.836
COMPLETELY ANNIHILATED.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.538
I FEEL LIKE I WAS BLINDSIDED.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.741
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.276
EVERYTHING WAS JUST RIPPED AWAY

10:43.276 --> 10:50.116
IN AN INSTANT.

10:50.116 --> 10:51.417
MY HOUSE WAS ONLY ABOUT A BLOCK

10:51.417 --> 10:52.719
AWAY FROM WHERE THE LEVEE HAD

10:52.719 --> 10:55.788
BROKE ON THE 17th STREET CANAL.

10:55.788 --> 10:56.856
I LIVED IN MY HOUSE WITH MY

10:56.856 --> 10:58.391
LITTLE GIRL MARLY, WHO'S SEVEN;

10:58.391 --> 10:59.259
AND MY LITTLE BOY RUSSELL, WHO'S

10:59.259 --> 11:00.994
TWO.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.028
AND I TOOK BASICALLY A BACKPACK

11:02.028 --> 11:03.062
OF CLOTHES FOR ME AND THE KIDS

11:03.062 --> 11:07.634
AND I LEFT.

11:07.634 --> 11:11.271
IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO BRING,

11:11.271 --> 11:13.673
BACK OUT.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.407
OKAY, THIS IS WHERE WE KIND OF

11:14.407 --> 11:16.376
HAVE TO GET IN.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.510
THIS IS WHAT I HEARD, ANYWAY;

11:17.510 --> 11:18.278
THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE TO GET

11:18.278 --> 11:19.746
IN.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.752
OH, MY GOD.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.994
WOW.

11:39.198 --> 11:41.501
OH, MY JEEZUM.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.835
LOOK AT MY ROOM!

11:42.835 --> 11:46.139
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET IN IT.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.608
HOLY-- HOLY, HOLY LORD.

11:48.608 --> 11:51.010
OH, MAN.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.313
>> OH, MY GOD.

11:53.313 --> 11:58.217
YOUR BATHROOM'S SOAKED.

11:58.217 --> 12:02.121
DAMN.

12:02.121 --> 12:05.325
>> OH, MY GRACIOUS.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.526
I CAN'T EVEN BEL-- BEGIN.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.327
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING IN

12:07.327 --> 12:09.095
THERE.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.464
WOW.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.799
WOW.

12:12.799 --> 12:13.566
>> I CAN'T EVEN GET IN HERE.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.267
LET ME GET OUT OF YOUR WAY.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.903
>> OKAY.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.271
THIS IS-- LIKE, I HONESTLY

12:18.271 --> 12:20.139
THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO BE ABLE

12:20.139 --> 12:21.274
TO GET MY DRESSER AND, LIKE,

12:21.274 --> 12:23.509
GRAB A COUPLE OF THINGS OFF THAT

12:23.509 --> 12:24.544
I HAD LEFT BACK HERE, LIKE A

12:24.544 --> 12:25.445
LITTLE TINY JEWELRY BOX AND

12:25.445 --> 12:26.579
WHATNOT.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.347
WAIT, LOOK.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.181
HERE'S THE JEWELRY BOX THAT I

12:28.181 --> 12:31.384
WANTED TO GET.

12:31.384 --> 12:32.585
I DON'T THINK I'LL BE WEARING

12:32.585 --> 12:34.887
ANY OF THAT JEWELRY ANYMORE.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.055
YEAH, MY DADDY GOT ME THAT

12:36.055 --> 12:36.756
JEWELRY BOX BEFORE HE PASSED

12:36.756 --> 12:37.323
AWAY.

12:37.323 --> 12:38.124
TOO BAD I DIDN'T TAKE IT WITH

12:38.124 --> 12:38.725
ME, HUH.

12:38.725 --> 12:39.525
HERE'S ANOTHER JEWELRY BOX THAT

12:39.525 --> 12:40.293
WAS ON MY DRESSER.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.861
WOO.

12:41.861 --> 12:43.696
OKAY.

12:43.696 --> 12:44.497
>> IF YOU FALL, I'M NOT PICKING

12:44.497 --> 12:46.299
YOU UP.

12:46.299 --> 12:47.467
>> MAN, I JUST-- I'M SO-- I

12:47.467 --> 12:48.368
CAN'T TAKE THIS STUFF BECAUSE

12:48.368 --> 12:49.569
IT'S JUST TOO TOXIC.

12:49.569 --> 12:52.105
I WOULD LOVE TO, BUT I CAN'T.

12:52.105 --> 12:56.876
I CAN'T DO IT.

12:56.876 --> 12:58.011
EVEN THOUGH IT'S JUST MATERIAL

12:58.011 --> 12:59.078
STUFF, IT IS A LOSS.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.279
IT'S ALMOST LIKE A DEATH.

13:00.279 --> 13:03.149
IT'S A HUGE LOSS THAT YOU HAVE

13:03.149 --> 13:04.784
TO FILTER AND DEAL WITH, AND

13:04.784 --> 13:06.519
IT'S REALLY WEIRD.

13:06.519 --> 13:07.720
IT'S HARD TO PROCESS ALL OF THIS

13:07.720 --> 13:11.457
STUFF.

13:11.457 --> 13:12.325
I HAVE TO ADMIT, THIS IS WAY

13:12.325 --> 13:12.992
WORSE THAN I THOUGHT IT WAS

13:12.992 --> 13:14.694
GOING TO BE.

13:14.694 --> 13:15.461
LIKE, I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE

13:15.461 --> 13:18.431
REALLY BAD, BUT WOW.

13:18.431 --> 13:19.866
I LEFT TOWN WITH A BOX OF

13:19.866 --> 13:22.435
PICTURES, A COUPLE OF POETRY

13:22.435 --> 13:23.436
BOOKS, AND THAT'S PRETTY MUCH

13:23.436 --> 13:25.204
IT.

13:25.204 --> 13:27.407
SO, I LOST EVERYTHING ELSE.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.810
GOOD GRACIOUS.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.778
STUFF THAT I HAD HANGING ON MY

13:31.778 --> 13:33.379
WALL IS IN MY BATHTUB.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.347
SHOES ARE IN MY BATHTUB.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.081
>> (INAUDIBLE)

13:35.081 --> 13:36.015
PICTURES ANYWAY.

13:36.015 --> 13:41.354
>> WOW.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.088
KATRINA IS DEFINITELY STILL

13:42.088 --> 13:42.955
HAUNTING.

13:42.955 --> 13:45.825
IT REALLY IS.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.794
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF IT WILL EVER

13:47.794 --> 13:49.362
COMPLETELY GO AWAY BECAUSE IT

13:49.362 --> 13:51.097
WAS VERY MUCH LIKE A DEATH, THE

13:51.097 --> 13:53.332
DEATH OF AN ENTIRE CITY ALMOST,

13:53.332 --> 13:56.703
AND EVERYTHING THAT I KNEW.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.604
YEAH, I'M STILL-- I STILL DON'T

13:58.604 --> 13:59.605
THINK, TEN YEARS LATER, THAT

13:59.605 --> 14:01.174
I'VE LEARNED TO DEAL WITH IT.

14:03.776 --> 14:04.644
>> Sreenivasan: HOW HURRICANE

14:04.644 --> 14:06.312
KATRINA PROMPTED CHANGES IN THE

14:06.312 --> 14:08.314
LAWS ABOUT EVACUATING PETS IN

14:08.314 --> 14:09.582
NATURAL DISASTERS.

14:09.582 --> 14:10.850
>> ONE OF THE REALLY REMARKABLE

14:10.850 --> 14:12.218
THINGS THAT CAME OUT OF THE

14:12.218 --> 14:14.821
STORM WAS JUST HOW MUCH PEOPLE

14:14.821 --> 14:16.789
REALIZED HOW MUCH EVERYBODY

14:16.789 --> 14:18.858
CARED SO MUCH FOR THEIR ANIMALS.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.177
>> Sreenivasan: IN THE AFTERMATH

14:38.177 --> 14:39.545
OF HURRICANE KATRINA, THE

14:39.545 --> 14:42.281
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

14:42.281 --> 14:43.649
AGENCY, FEMA, WAS WIDELY BLAMED

14:43.649 --> 14:45.785
FOR A LACK OF PREPAREDNESS AND

14:45.785 --> 14:47.787
AN INADEQUATE RESPONSE.

14:47.787 --> 14:49.322
FEMA WAS SLOW TO DELIVER FOOD

14:49.322 --> 14:50.623
AND SUPPLIES AND HOUSED

14:50.623 --> 14:51.290
DISPLACED RESIDENTS IN TOXIC

14:51.290 --> 14:52.759
TRAILERS.

14:52.759 --> 14:53.793
UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE PROFESSOR

14:53.793 --> 14:55.561
RICK SYLVES STUDIES FEMA AND

14:55.561 --> 14:56.562
JOINS ME NOW TO DISCUSS ITS

14:56.562 --> 14:58.030
CHANGES DURING THE PAST DECADE.

14:58.030 --> 14:58.798
I THINK THE QUESTION MOST PEOPLE

14:58.798 --> 15:00.366
ARE GOING TO WONDER IS HAS FEMA

15:00.366 --> 15:01.100
IMPROVED?

15:01.100 --> 15:02.101
AND IF SO, HOW?

15:02.101 --> 15:04.203
>> YES, THEY DO EXTREMELY GOOD

15:04.203 --> 15:07.173
JOBS ON RELATIVELY SMALL-SCALE

15:07.173 --> 15:07.840
DISASTERS.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.476
THEY'VE DONE A TREMENDOUSLY GOOD

15:10.476 --> 15:12.845
JOB IN ENHANCING THE CAPACITY OF

15:12.845 --> 15:14.747
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

15:14.747 --> 15:15.414
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.016
IF ANYTHING, THE FIELD OF

15:17.016 --> 15:19.352
EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT THAT'S

15:19.352 --> 15:21.020
GROWING EVEN ACADEMICALLY ACROSS

15:21.020 --> 15:23.389
THE COUNTRY OWES ITS ORIGINS TO

15:23.389 --> 15:25.158
FEMA, AND WE NEED TO THANK THAT

15:25.158 --> 15:26.626
AGENCY FOR THAT.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.661
IN ADDITION, FEW OTHER COUNTRIES

15:28.661 --> 15:30.763
HAVE FEMA-LIKE EMERGENCY

15:30.763 --> 15:32.632
MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATIONS.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.168
EVEN THE MOST DEVELOPED DON'T

15:35.168 --> 15:37.370
COME CLOSE TO PROVIDING, THROUGH

15:37.370 --> 15:41.140
AGENCIES LIKE FEMA, THE RANGE OF

15:41.140 --> 15:42.008
POST-DISASTER ASSISTANCE THAT

15:42.008 --> 15:43.209
THIS COUNTRY PROVIDES.

15:43.209 --> 15:43.876
>> Sreenivasan: AT THE SAME

15:43.876 --> 15:45.044
TIME, THIS IS STILL HOUSED

15:45.044 --> 15:45.645
INSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF

15:45.645 --> 15:46.746
HOMELAND SECURITY?

15:46.746 --> 15:47.480
>> YES.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.650
I THINK THIS HAS BEEN A

15:50.650 --> 15:52.084
PREDICAMENT EVER SINCE THAT--

15:52.084 --> 15:54.053
EVER SINCE IT WAS FOLDED INTO

15:54.053 --> 15:55.755
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

15:55.755 --> 15:57.023
IN 2002.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.125
ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT

15:59.125 --> 16:00.860
HOMELAND SECURITY'S MISSION IS

16:00.860 --> 16:03.196
TO COUNTER TERRORISM.

16:03.196 --> 16:07.466
AND FEMA'S JOB IS TO PROVIDE,

16:07.466 --> 16:10.837
REALLY, DISASTER ASSISTANCE AND

16:10.837 --> 16:11.704
PROVIDE FOR PREPARE

16:11.704 --> 16:13.039
UNDERSTANDNESS FOR DISASTERS.

16:13.039 --> 16:14.473
AND CLEARLY THERE ARE TERRORISM

16:14.473 --> 16:17.476
DUTIES THAT LEGITIMATELY FALL TO

16:17.476 --> 16:17.810
FEMA.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.011
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN THEY

16:19.011 --> 16:21.948
TAKE ON THESE DUTIES, THEY ALSO

16:21.948 --> 16:23.249
HAVE-- THEY TAKE ON REQUIREMENTS

16:23.249 --> 16:25.184
OF STATE SECRECY THAT MAKE THE

16:25.184 --> 16:27.720
AGENCY MUCH LESS TRANSPARENT

16:27.720 --> 16:29.155
THAN IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE,

16:29.155 --> 16:30.957
PARTICULARLY GIVEN ITS CIVILIAN

16:30.957 --> 16:32.992
RESPONSIBILITIES AND DISASTER

16:32.992 --> 16:33.559
CIRCUMSTANCES.

16:33.559 --> 16:34.794
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

16:34.794 --> 16:35.261
MONEY?

16:35.261 --> 16:36.696
HAS THE BUDGET FOR FEMA

16:36.696 --> 16:38.497
INCREASED OR FOR PREPAREDNESS

16:38.497 --> 16:40.199
AROUND THE COUNTRY IN CASE

16:40.199 --> 16:43.536
ANOTHER HURRICANE KATRINA OR A

16:43.536 --> 16:44.303
SUPERSTORM SANDY HAPPEN?

16:44.303 --> 16:46.505
>> THE MONEY HAS INCREASED

16:46.505 --> 16:47.173
SIGNIFICANTLY.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.708
THERE IS A PRESIDENT'S DISASTER

16:48.708 --> 16:50.710
FUND THAT IS THE MAIN RECEPTACLE

16:50.710 --> 16:52.545
FOR MONIES TO BE DISPENSED NOT

16:52.545 --> 16:54.814
ONLY TO FEMA BUT TO A GREAT MANY

16:54.814 --> 16:55.915
OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES THAT ARE

16:55.915 --> 16:57.483
CALLED INTO ACTION DURING

16:57.483 --> 16:59.252
PERIODS OF DISASTER.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.721
BUT YOU STILL FIND WHEN YOU HAVE

17:01.721 --> 17:05.925
A CATASTROPHIC DISASTER, EVEN

17:05.925 --> 17:07.727
THE GENEROUS INFUSE OF NEW FUNDS

17:07.727 --> 17:09.562
INTO THOSE ACCOUNT ISN'T ENOUGH

17:09.562 --> 17:11.264
TO MEET THE SPENDING DEMANDS.

17:11.264 --> 17:14.934
I THINK FOR KATRINA, $61 BILLION

17:14.934 --> 17:17.737
OF FEDERAL MONEY.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.438
SUPERSTORM SANDY, $48 BILLION.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.474
AND THESE NUMBERS AREN'T FIXED.

17:21.474 --> 17:22.909
THEY CONTINUE TO GO UP OVER TIME

17:22.909 --> 17:25.945
FOR BOTH OF THOSE DISASTERS.

17:25.945 --> 17:27.747
WHEN WE HAVE CATASTROPHIC

17:27.747 --> 17:29.382
DISASTERS, THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT

17:29.382 --> 17:31.751
FINANCIAL BURDEN IMPOSED ON THE

17:31.751 --> 17:33.152
NATIONAL TAXPAYER AND THE

17:33.152 --> 17:35.221
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS A

17:35.221 --> 17:35.821

17:39.058 --> 17:41.060

17:53.673 --> 17:55.474
KATRINA STRUCK, LEAH CHASE WAS

17:55.474 --> 17:57.043

18:08.321 --> 18:09.922
OWNED WASH AWAY, BUT SHE

18:09.922 --> 18:11.223
RESOLVED TO START OVER.

18:11.223 --> 18:12.892
LOUISIANA PUBLIC BROADCASTING

18:25.304 --> 22:00.252
CHASE, FOR NEARLY 70 YEARS.

22:00.252 --> 18:28.941
BUT TEN YEARS AGO, HURRICANE

18:28.941 --> 18:29.842
KATRINA DESTROYED HER

18:29.842 --> 18:32.845
LIVELIHOOD.

18:32.845 --> 18:34.880
>> NOBODY KNEW WHAT TO DO.

80% OF THE CITY UNDER WATER,

18:35.648 --> 18:36.482
WHAT YOU GONNA DO?

WHERE YOU GONNA GO?

18:38.284 --> 18:39.385
WHAT'S YOUR NEXT MOVE?

18:39.385 --> 18:40.987
YOU DON'T KNOW.

18:40.987 --> 18:43.322
SO, IT WAS FRIGHTENING.

WE USED TO STAY OPEN 'Â¡TIL 4:00

19:01.307 --> 19:03.943
IN THE MORNING.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.778

19:05.778 --> 19:07.880
THE MUSICIANS WHEN THEY GET OFF.

19:07.880 --> 19:08.681
LENA HORNE ALWAYS LIKED HER

19:08.681 --> 19:09.682
FRIED CHICKEN.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.550
SARAH VAUGHAN WAS A SWEETHEART,

19:11.550 --> 19:13.519
AND SHE LIKED STUFFED CRABS.

19:13.519 --> 19:15.321
WELL, YOU SEE, MY HUSBAND WAS A

19:15.321 --> 19:16.889
MUSICIAN, AND HE KNEW ALL I DID

19:16.889 --> 19:17.890
WAS FEED THOSE PEOPLE WHEN THEY

CAME THROUGH.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.963
>> Reporter: IN THE SEGREGATED

19:25.164 --> 19:25.898
FOR CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVISTS TO

19:25.898 --> 19:27.900
MEET.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.336
>> PEOPLE CAME BEFORE

19:30.336 --> 19:31.771
INTEGRATION BECAUSE IF THEY HAD

19:31.771 --> 19:33.939
TO MEET WITH BLACK PEOPLE, THEY

19:33.939 --> 19:34.673
EITHER MET IN CHURCH OR THEY MET

19:34.673 --> 19:36.742
HERE.

19:36.742 --> 19:37.977
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU CAN DO A

19:37.977 --> 19:39.578
LOT OVER FOOD.

19:39.578 --> 19:40.679
IN NEW ORLEANS, WE DO A LOT OVER

19:40.679 --> 19:43.482
FOOD.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.418
>> Reporter: KATRINA WAS THE

WORST STORM THE CITY AND CHASE

19:47.153 --> 19:51.624
EXPERIENCED IN 40 YEARS.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.559
>> IN 1965, WHEN WE HAD BESSIE,

19:53.559 --> 19:54.260
I SAW THAT DOWN THERE; IT WAS

19:54.260 --> 19:56.562
TERRIBLE.

19:56.562 --> 19:59.698
BUT THAT WAS ONE SECTION.

19:59.698 --> 20:00.399
THIS TIME, THERE WAS WATER ALL

20:00.399 --> 20:02.234
OVER.

20:02.234 --> 20:04.637
I HAD NEVER IN MY LIFE SEEN

20:04.637 --> 20:07.706
ANYTHING LIKE THIS.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.042
BEFORE THE HURRICANE CAME, WE

20:10.042 --> 20:11.010
WERE WORKING HARD, REALLY

20:11.010 --> 20:13.312
WORKING HARD.

20:13.312 --> 20:15.247
AND HERE COMES KATRINA, AND NOW

20:15.247 --> 20:19.118
OVERNIGHT YOU HAVE NO PLACE.

20:19.118 --> 20:20.920
>> Reporter: CHASE, HER CHILDREN

20:22.688 --> 20:23.989
BUILDINGS ACROSS THE STREET FROM

20:23.989 --> 20:25.891
THE RESTAURANT WERE BOARDED UP.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.525
CHASE DECIDED TO STAY AND

20:26.525 --> 20:29.995
REBUILD.

WHAT'S THERE TO DO?"

20:35.267 --> 20:36.035
YOU KNOW, WE HAD TO BUILD THIS

20:36.035 --> 20:37.336
CITY BACK.

20:37.336 --> 20:38.904
I HAD NOWHERE ELSE TO LIVE.

20:38.904 --> 20:39.672
THANK GOODNESS THEY GAVE ME A

20:39.672 --> 20:41.307
TRAILER.

20:41.307 --> 20:44.076
AT LEAST I HAD A PLACE TO SLEEP.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.444
YOU KNOW, THE TRAILER WASN'T THE

20:45.444 --> 20:47.746
BEST THING IN THE WORLD, BUT,

20:47.746 --> 20:49.448
YOU KNOW, I CAME THROUGH THE

20:49.448 --> 20:51.550
DEPRESSION, HONEY, SO, YOU KNOW,

20:51.550 --> 20:52.952
ANYTHING IS GOOD.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.954
I CAN LAY MY HEAD ANYWHERE AS

20:54.954 --> 20:56.822
LONG AS I HAD SHELTER OVER IT.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.126
FIVE FEET OF WATER, THE

21:00.126 --> 21:02.261
RESTAURANT CLOSED FOR TWO YEARS.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.762
IT NEVER CROSSED CHASE'S MIND

21:03.762 --> 21:06.332
NOT TO REOPEN.

21:06.332 --> 21:08.167
BUT IT COST $500,000, AND

21:08.167 --> 21:09.001
INSURANCE COVERED ONLY PART OF

21:09.001 --> 21:10.669
THE TAB.

21:10.669 --> 21:13.172
DONATIONS COVERED THE REST.

21:13.172 --> 21:14.540
>> THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WAS

21:14.540 --> 21:16.642
GETTING THIS WORK DONE.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.444
I THOUGHT I COULD NEVER GET IT

21:18.444 --> 21:19.211
DONE, BUT I HAD A WHOLE LOT OF

21:19.211 --> 21:22.181
HELP.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.917
AND I'M SO BLESSED BECAUSE A LOT

21:24.917 --> 21:27.019
OF PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THAT HELP.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.388
FIND HER IN THE KITCHEN AT 8:00

21:29.388 --> 21:30.823
IN THE MORNING.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.625
IF YOU HAVE THE ENERGY, SHE

21:32.625 --> 21:34.059
SAYS, YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO WORK

21:34.059 --> 21:37.897
AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

21:37.897 --> 21:41.300
>> YOU LEARN WHAT'S IMPORTANT.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.902
YOU LEARN HOW TO LIVE, HOW TO

21:42.902 --> 21:45.471
LIVE WITH ONE ANOTHER.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.705
YOU LEARN HOW TO DO THINGS WHEN

YOU HAVE TO DO THEM.

21:58.751 --> 22:00.252
THE PRESIDENT GAVE CHASE A WARM

22:00.252 --> 22:01.053
GREETING.

22:01.053 --> 22:02.688
HE SAMPLED HER GUMBO AND FRIED

22:02.688 --> 22:04.356
CHICKEN BACK IN 2008 BUT DID NOT

22:04.356 --> 22:05.691
HAVE TIME TO EAT THERE THIS

22:05.691 --> 22:06.325
TIME.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.293
CHASE TOLD THE NEWSHOUR SHE

22:22.041 --> 22:22.942
TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHANGING

22:22.942 --> 22:24.276
NATURE OF WORK IN THE NEW

22:24.276 --> 22:24.810
ECONOMY.

22:24.810 --> 22:25.744
THIS WEEK, THE NATIONAL LABOR

22:25.744 --> 22:27.079
RELATIONS BOARD MADE A RULING

22:27.079 --> 22:29.381
THAT COULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT

22:29.381 --> 22:30.649
ROLE, STATING THAT AN EMPLOYER

22:30.649 --> 22:31.750
IS LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR

22:31.750 --> 22:33.118
EMPLOYEES EVEN WHEN THEY ARE

22:33.118 --> 22:35.087
HIRED THROUGH SUBCONTRACTORS OR

22:35.087 --> 22:36.355
BY THEIR INDEPENDENTLY-OWNED

22:36.355 --> 22:38.190
FRANCHISES.

22:38.190 --> 22:39.725
MANY OF THOSE WORKERS ARE LOW-

22:39.725 --> 22:40.826
WAGE, PART-TIME OR TEMPORARY.

22:40.826 --> 22:41.760
JOINING ME NOW IS REPORTER

MELANIE TROTTMAN OF THE "WALL

22:42.461 --> 22:43.562
STREET JOURNAL."

22:43.562 --> 22:44.330
SO WHAT'S AT THE CORE OF THIS

22:44.330 --> 22:45.130
CASE HERE?

22:45.130 --> 22:46.465
>> HOW MUCH CONTROL DOES A

22:46.465 --> 22:49.902
COMPANY HAVE OVER THE WORKERS IN

22:49.902 --> 22:50.569
QUESTION?

22:50.569 --> 22:51.837
SO McDONALD'S, FOR EXAMPLE.

22:51.837 --> 22:53.539
DO THEY CONTROL THE WAGES AND

22:53.539 --> 22:55.374
WORKING CONDITIONS AT AN

22:55.374 --> 22:56.408
INDEPENDENTLY OWNED STORE IN

22:56.408 --> 22:57.076
IOWA?

22:57.076 --> 22:59.378
IT USED TO BE THAT YOU HAD TO

22:59.378 --> 23:00.779
HAVE DIRECT CONTROL TO BE

23:00.779 --> 23:03.215
CONSIDERED A JOINT EMPLOYER.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.817
THAT MEANT YOU WOULD

23:04.817 --> 23:05.651
CO-DETERMINE THINGS LIKE WAGES

23:05.651 --> 23:07.353
AND WORKING CONDITIONS.

23:07.353 --> 23:09.655
WELL NOW THE BOARD SAYS EVEN

23:09.655 --> 23:11.790
INDIRECT CONTROL, YOU RESERVE

23:11.790 --> 23:12.791
THE RIGHT TO HAVE CONTROL OVER

23:12.791 --> 23:13.792
THE WORKERS.

23:13.792 --> 23:14.727
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE THE

23:14.727 --> 23:16.462
RIPPLE EFFECTS HERE?

23:16.462 --> 23:17.896
DOES THAT MEAN McDONALD'S CORP

23:17.896 --> 23:19.765
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE WAGES OR

23:19.765 --> 23:21.367
WHETHER OR NOT THESE EMPLOYEES

23:21.367 --> 23:22.234
CAN UNIONIZE?

23:22.234 --> 23:24.103
>> WELL, WHAT IT MEANS IS A

23:24.103 --> 23:26.272
McDONALD'S CORP OR A COMPANY

23:26.272 --> 23:28.674
THAT SUBCONTRACTS WORKERS

23:28.674 --> 23:31.477
COULD BE DRAWN INTO COLLECTIVE

23:31.477 --> 23:32.711
BARGAINING TALKS WITH WORKERS AT

23:32.711 --> 23:34.513
A RESTAURANT OR WORKERS AT A

23:34.513 --> 23:35.614
TEMPORARY STAFFING COMPANY WHO

23:35.614 --> 23:36.815
WANT TO UNIONIZE.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.484
AND THE RATIONALE IS UNIONS SAY,

23:38.484 --> 23:39.885
LOOK, THESE COMPANIES AFFECT THE

23:39.885 --> 23:40.986
WAGES AND WORKING CONDITIONS OF

23:40.986 --> 23:42.521
THESE WORKERS, AND SO THE

23:42.521 --> 23:43.522
COMPANIES NEED TO BE AT THE

23:43.522 --> 23:44.957
TABLE FOR US TO BARGAIN

23:44.957 --> 23:46.659
EFFECTIVELY FOR THE WORKER.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.493
>> Sreenivasan: THIS HAS GOT

23:47.493 --> 23:49.361
TO BE GETTING SOME PUSH-BACK

23:49.361 --> 23:50.562
FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY,

23:50.562 --> 23:52.264
SAYING, "IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER

23:52.264 --> 23:53.966
FOR ME TO EMPLOY PEOPLE.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.734
IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR ME

23:55.734 --> 23:56.802
TO NEGOTIATE EVERY TIME."

23:56.802 --> 23:58.137
>> WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS, "THIS

23:58.137 --> 23:59.672
IS GOING TO UNDERMINE THE

23:59.672 --> 24:01.607
EFFICIENCY OF CONTRACTING AND

24:01.607 --> 24:02.274
FRANCHISING.

24:02.274 --> 24:03.042
WE IS THE OUR BUSINESSES UP THIS

24:03.042 --> 24:05.010
WAY TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY AND, YOU

24:05.010 --> 24:07.513
KNOW, THIS COULD RESULT IN LESS

24:07.513 --> 24:07.980
FLEXIBILITY.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.815
IT COULD RAISE OUR COSTS.

24:09.815 --> 24:10.549
IT COULD CAUSE MAJOR PROBLEMS."
