THEIR POPULATION WOULD MANDATE.

21:10.936 --> 21:12.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

EQUAL REPRESENTATION IN THE

21:35.294 --> 21:36.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ONLY PART OF THE CONSTITUTION

21:38.364 --> 21:39.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CAN'T BE AMENDED.

21:39.565 --> 21:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S RIGHT THERE IN ARTICLE V.

21:41.066 --> 21:42.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT THIS OBVIOUSLY

21:45.237 --> 21:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IS THERE A HARD AND FAST

21:47.239 --> 21:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RULE THAT WILL TELL YOU WHAT'S

21:48.040 --> 21:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAIR?

21:49.708 --> 21:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY, IN PRACTICE, THERE IS.

CANDIDATE WE WANT TO WIN IS

21:57.416 --> 22:01.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
