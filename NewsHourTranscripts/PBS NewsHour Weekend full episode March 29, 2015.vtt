01:35.796 --> 01:37.197
STICKING POINTS APPARENTLY

01:37.197 --> 01:38.398
HOLDING UP A FINAL DEAL IS HOW

01:38.398 --> 01:39.666
QUICKLY WESTERN ECONOMIC

01:39.666 --> 01:41.068
SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN WILL BE

01:41.068 --> 01:42.769

02:19.539 --> 02:20.540
HIS NATION MIGHT SEND GROUND

02:20.540 --> 02:21.541
TROOPS INTO YEMEN.

02:21.541 --> 02:22.876

03:18.799 --> 03:20.434
FROM BOKO HARAM ISLAMIC

03:20.434 --> 03:21.701
MILITANTS.

WEEKEND IN THE NORTHEAST CORNER

03:24.171 --> 03:25.672
OF THE NATION, WHERE THE

03:25.672 --> 03:26.873
MILITANT GROUP REGULARLY

03:26.873 --> 03:27.908
LAUNCHES ATTACKS.

03:27.908 --> 03:29.009
DESPITE THOSE ATTACKS AND

03:29.009 --> 03:30.377
TECHNICAL GLITCHES, MILLIONS

03:30.377 --> 03:31.812
CAST THEIR VOTE IN AN ELECTION

03:31.812 --> 03:33.046
THAT COULD SEE THE NATION'S

03:33.046 --> 03:34.181
FIRST DEMOCRATIC TRANSFER OF

03:34.181 --> 03:35.382
POWER.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.716
RESULTS ARE EXPECTED IN THE NEXT

03:36.716 --> 03:37.984
48 HOURS.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.252

03:39.252 --> 03:40.387
THE EBOLA OUTBREAK IN WEST

03:40.387 --> 03:41.621
AFRICA IS FAR FROM OVER.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.023
THE GOVERNMENT OF GUINEA

03:43.023 --> 03:44.724
DECLARED A HEALTH EMERGENCY IN

03:47.627 --> 03:48.962

03:50.831 --> 03:52.199
IN NEIGHBORING SIERRA LEONE, A

03:52.199 --> 03:53.433
THREE-DAY LOCKDOWN WENT INTO

03:53.433 --> 03:54.568
EFFECT FRIDAY.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.269
BUT SOME RESIDENTS THERE LEFT

03:56.269 --> 03:57.804
THEIR HOMES TO GET FOOD.

03:57.804 --> 03:59.139
POLICE LATER FIRED TEAR GAS INTO

03:59.139 --> 04:00.740
A CROWD OF PEOPLE TO TRY TO GET

04:00.740 --> 04:01.842
THEM TO LEAVE.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.810
BACK IN THIS COUNTRY, INDIANA

04:03.810 --> 04:05.178
GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE SAYS HE

04:05.178 --> 04:06.379
WOULD SUPPORT ADDITIONAL

04:06.379 --> 04:07.881
LEGISLATION TO QUOTE, "CLARIFY"

04:07.881 --> 04:09.549
THE INTENT OF A BILL PASSED JUST

04:09.549 --> 04:11.017
DAYS AGO THAT CRITICS SAY WILL

04:11.017 --> 04:12.719
ALLOW BUSINESS TO DISCRIMINATE

04:12.719 --> 04:13.820
AGAINST HOMOSEXUALS.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.489
SINCE THE BILL WAS APPROVED, THE

04:15.489 --> 04:17.057
MAYORS OF SAN FRANCISCO AND

04:17.057 --> 04:18.658
SEATTLE HAVE BARRED CITY-FUNDED

04:18.658 --> 04:20.026
TRAVEL TO INDIANA, AND SEVERAL

04:20.026 --> 04:21.895
CORPORATIONS ARE CONSIDERING

04:21.895 --> 04:23.330
REDUCING BUSINESS DEALINGS

04:23.330 --> 04:24.664
THERE.

04:24.664 --> 04:25.966
PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND

04:25.966 --> 04:27.467
FARMERS IN MINNESOTA ARE

04:27.467 --> 04:29.035
SLAUGHTERING TENS OF THOUSANDS

04:29.035 --> 04:30.770
OF TURKEYS TO TRY TO CONTAIN AN

04:30.770 --> 04:32.139
OUTBREAK OF THE DEADLY BIRD FLU

04:32.139 --> 04:33.173
THERE.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.508
MINNESOTA IS THE NATION'S

04:34.508 --> 04:35.909
BIGGEST PRODUCER OF TURKEYS, AND

04:35.909 --> 04:37.344
MORE THAN FORTY NATIONS HAVE

04:37.344 --> 04:38.678
BANNED POULTRY IMPORTS FROM THAT

04:38.678 --> 04:40.480
STATE SINCE THE OUTBREAK BEGAN

04:40.480 --> 04:41.848
EARLIER THIS MONTH.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.283
OFFICIALS SAY THIS PARTICULAR

04:43.283 --> 04:44.518
STRAIN, WHICH ALSO HAS BEEN

04:44.518 --> 04:46.386
DISCOVERED IN ARKANSAS, MISSOURI

04:46.386 --> 04:47.754
AND KANSAS, POSES NO IMMEDIATE

04:47.754 --> 04:48.955
THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.858
SOME GOOD NEWS FOR THOSE OF YOU

04:51.858 --> 04:53.527
WHO ENJOY BOTH ALCOHOL AND

04:53.527 --> 04:55.328
COFFEE.

04:55.328 --> 04:56.863
IT'S LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT HAVING

04:56.863 --> 04:59.099
SEVERAL DRINKS A DAY INCREASES

04:59.099 --> 05:00.734
THE RISK OF LIVER CANCER.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.435
BUT A RECENT ANALYSIS BY THE

05:02.435 --> 05:03.837
WORLD CANCER RESEARCH FUND FINDS

05:03.837 --> 05:05.338
THAT REGULARLY DRINKING COFFEE

05:05.338 --> 05:06.606
CAN HELP REDUCE THAT CANCER

05:06.606 --> 05:07.707
RISK.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.042
RESEARCHERS SAID ITS NOT CLEAR

05:09.042 --> 05:10.410
WHY COFFEE LOWERS THE LIVER

05:10.410 --> 05:11.611
CANCER RISK, AND CALLED FOR

05:11.611 --> 05:12.712
FURTHER STUDY.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.147
AND FINALLY, A PENNY SAVED IS A

05:14.147 --> 05:15.448
PENNY EARNED.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.716
UNLESS OF COURSE YOU HAVE A

05:16.716 --> 05:17.817
BIRCH PENNY, ONE OF THE FIRST

05:17.817 --> 05:20.253
PENNIES EVER MINTED IN THE

05:20.253 --> 05:22.822
ONE OF THOSE JUST SOLD AT

05:22.822 --> 05:24.090
AUCTION THIS WEEK FOR ALMOST

05:24.090 --> 05:25.192
$1.2 MILLION.

05:25.192 --> 05:26.493
THERE ARE FEWER THAN A DOZEN

05:26.493 --> 05:27.761
BIRCH PENNIES KNOWN TO EXIST.

05:27.761 --> 05:28.962
THE COIN, THE SIZE OF A MODERN-

05:28.962 --> 05:40.240
DAY QUARTER, WAS MADE IN 1792.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.742
THE DECISION TODAY BY THE 21

05:42.742 --> 05:43.977
NATIONS OF THE ARAB LEAGUE TO

05:43.977 --> 05:45.912
CREATE A JOINT MILITARY FORCE

05:45.912 --> 05:47.747
BECAUSE OF THE CRISIS IN YEMEN

05:47.747 --> 05:49.316
RAISES THE QUESTION: WHY DIDN'T

05:49.316 --> 05:50.984
THE ORGANIZATION MOBILIZE THE

05:50.984 --> 05:52.385
SAME WAY TO FIGHT ISIS IN IRAQ?

05:52.385 --> 05:53.653
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS AND FOR THE

05:53.653 --> 05:55.689
LATEST ON THE MILITARY SITUATION

05:55.689 --> 05:57.023
IN IRAQ, WE ARE JOINED VIA SKYPE

05:57.023 --> 05:59.159
IN IRAQ NOW BY MATT BRADLEY OF

05:59.159 --> 06:01.895
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

06:01.895 --> 06:02.963
SO WHY IS IT THAT

06:02.963 --> 06:04.764
THE ARAB STATES VERY QUICKLY

06:04.764 --> 06:06.132
GOT INVOLVED IN YEMEN.

06:06.132 --> 06:07.867
IT'S ALMOST A PROXY WAR FOR

06:07.867 --> 06:09.336
SHI'A AND SUNNI STATES BUT

06:09.336 --> 06:10.804
THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN IRAQ?

06:10.804 --> 06:11.905
>> WELL, THEY DID GET

06:11.905 --> 06:12.405
INVOLVED.

06:12.405 --> 06:13.773
RATHER QUICKLY IN IRAQ.

06:13.773 --> 06:16.042
THE PROBLEM WAS THAT IRAQ

06:16.042 --> 06:17.811
WAS LEAD AT THE TIME ON JUNE

06:17.811 --> 06:20.280
150th WHEN ISLAMIC STATE RAM

06:20.280 --> 06:21.381
TAGGED THROUGH NORTHERN

06:21.381 --> 06:22.382
IRAQ.

06:22.382 --> 06:25.819
IRAQ WAS LEAD BY AL-MALIKI

06:25.819 --> 06:27.587
WHO WAS A PERSONAL PROBLEM

06:27.587 --> 06:29.522
FOR MANY OF THE SUNNI ARAB

06:29.522 --> 06:30.557
LEADERS IN THE REGION.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.925
SO HE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE

06:31.925 --> 06:33.526
VERY CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH

06:33.526 --> 06:35.128
IRAN BUT ALSO A LOT OF THE

06:35.128 --> 06:36.796
SUNNI LEADERS IN THE REGION

06:36.796 --> 06:37.797
SIMPLY DIDN'T LIKE HIM AND

06:37.797 --> 06:39.199
DIDN'T CONSIDER HIM TO BE A

06:39.199 --> 06:40.233
RELIABLE PARTNER.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.401
AND NOW IT'S PART OF THE

06:41.401 --> 06:42.869
REASON WHY SOME OF THE SUNNI

06:42.869 --> 06:45.639
STATES SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA WERE

06:45.639 --> 06:48.808
SO RELUCTANT TO GET BEHIND

06:48.808 --> 06:50.510
MALIKI EFFORT TO REPEL AN

06:50.510 --> 06:52.045
ISLAMIC STATE AND IN SOME WAYS

06:52.045 --> 06:53.980
SORT OF TACITLY BACKED THE

06:53.980 --> 06:55.315
ISLAMIC STATE UNTIL THEY FOUND

06:55.315 --> 06:56.283
OUT THE TRUE NATURE OF THE

06:56.283 --> 06:57.484
THREAT.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.985
>> Sreenivasan: IN IRAQ HOW

06:58.985 --> 07:00.353
LIKELY WILL WE TO SEE GROUND

07:00.353 --> 07:01.388
FORCES FROM THE ARAB LEAGUE

07:01.388 --> 07:03.123
OR EVEN PART OF THE U.S.

07:03.123 --> 07:03.490
COALITION?

07:03.490 --> 07:04.424
>> IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

07:04.424 --> 07:05.959
THERE WILL BE GROUND FORCES

07:05.959 --> 07:07.494
FROM THE ARAB LEAGUE ANY

07:07.494 --> 07:08.094
TIME SOON.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.963
THE ARAB LEAGUE GROUND

07:09.963 --> 07:12.299
FORCES IS NOT-- IS NOT A

07:12.299 --> 07:13.600
FULLY DEVELOPED FORCE QUITE

07:13.600 --> 07:14.267
YET.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.902
AND SO THAT WOULD HAVE

07:15.902 --> 07:17.304
TO-- IF THAT WERE TO BE

07:17.304 --> 07:18.505
DEPLOYED, IT WOULD BE QUITE

07:18.505 --> 07:20.140
A LONG TIME IN THE FUTURE.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.641
I DON'T THINK THAT THE

07:21.641 --> 07:23.376
UNITED STATES OR THE IRAQIS

07:23.376 --> 07:25.211
OR THE IRANIANS FOR THAT

07:25.211 --> 07:26.413
MATTER HAVE THE KIND OF

07:26.413 --> 07:28.381
PATIENCE TO WAIT FOR A FULLY

07:28.381 --> 07:29.849
DEVELOPED ARAB LEAGUE FOR US

07:29.849 --> 07:32.085
TO COME TOGETHER STRENGTHLY,

07:32.085 --> 07:33.353
MILITARILY, AND LEGALLY TO

07:33.353 --> 07:34.854
FORM THAT KIND OF LEGAL APP

07:34.854 --> 07:36.323
RAT IS THAT WOULD BUILD AN

07:36.323 --> 07:37.857
ARAB ARMY THAT HAS LONG BEEN

07:37.857 --> 07:39.225
THE DREAM OF MANY OF THE

07:39.225 --> 07:40.593
SUNNI ARAB STATES.

07:40.593 --> 07:43.129
AND THEY WANT TO MOVE TO

07:43.129 --> 07:45.665
MOSUL LATER THIS YEAR AND WE

07:45.665 --> 07:48.568
TAKE IRAQ SECRETARY ISLAMIC

07:48.568 --> 07:49.869
CITY BEFORE THAT CITY STAYS

07:49.869 --> 07:51.504
TOO LONG UNDER ISLAMIC STATE

07:51.504 --> 07:53.206
CONTROL AND REALLY ATROPHIES

07:53.206 --> 07:54.207
ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.141
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT IS

07:55.141 --> 07:56.209
AN UPDATE ON THE FIGHTING IN

07:56.209 --> 07:59.045
THE BATTLE FOR TIKRIT?

07:59.045 --> 08:01.981
>> WELL, TIKRIT IS NOW

08:01.981 --> 08:02.916
ENTERING, TOMORROW IT WILL

08:02.916 --> 08:04.684
BE ENTERING THE FOURTH WEEK

08:04.684 --> 08:06.886
ON THE ASSAULT ON TIKRIT.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.321
WHAT WAS SO UNUSUAL WERE

08:08.321 --> 08:11.624
THERE IS THESE IRANIAN BACK

08:11.624 --> 08:13.927
MILITIA STARTED THE FIGHT ON

08:13.927 --> 08:14.594
MARCH.

08:14.594 --> 08:16.296
THEY DIDN'T WARN THE U.S. OR

08:16.296 --> 08:20.900
MAKE AN EFFORT TO WORK WITH --

08:20.900 --> 08:23.002
>> ESPECIALLY IN KOBANI

08:23.002 --> 08:24.471
WHERE THE UNITED STATES WAS

08:24.471 --> 08:25.672
REALLY FLOGGING ISLAMIC

08:25.672 --> 08:27.173
STATES SO FOR THE FIRST TWO

08:27.173 --> 08:29.109
WEEKS, THESE IRANIAN-BACKED

08:29.109 --> 08:31.177
SHI'A MILITIAS WERE ABLE TO

08:31.177 --> 08:33.012
REPEL ISLAMIC STATES OUTSIDE

08:33.012 --> 08:35.081
OF TIKRIT BUT ONCE IT

08:35.081 --> 08:36.416
ENTERED THE THIRD WEEK THE

08:36.416 --> 08:37.684
FIGHT SORT OF STALLED AND

08:37.684 --> 08:38.918
THAT IS WHEN AFTER A COUPLE

08:38.918 --> 08:40.520
OF DAYS OF THAT IMPASSE,

08:40.520 --> 08:41.921
BEING DAD WENT TO THE UNITED

08:41.921 --> 08:43.022
STATES AND ASKED THEM TO

08:43.022 --> 08:43.957
INTERVENE.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.058
SO THE UNITED STATES SAID WE

08:45.058 --> 08:47.127
WILL INTERVENE AS LONG AS

08:47.127 --> 08:50.063
THESE SHIITE MILITIAS TAKE

08:50.063 --> 08:51.431
A BACKSEAT RULE IN THE

08:51.431 --> 08:53.233
CONTINUING FIGHTING IN

08:53.233 --> 08:54.267
TIKRIT SO WE ARE SEEING A

08:54.267 --> 08:55.602
DIFFICULT MOMENT WHERE THE

08:55.602 --> 08:56.870
SHIITE MILITIAS HAVE BEEN

08:56.870 --> 08:58.071
ASKED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE

08:58.071 --> 08:59.205
FRONT LINES AS THE UNITED

08:59.205 --> 09:00.106
STATES MOVES FORWARD.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.142
BUT WITHOUT THESE SHIITE

09:02.142 --> 09:04.944
MILITIAS BACKED BY IRAN IN

09:04.944 --> 09:06.146
TIKRIT, THE UNITED STATES

09:06.146 --> 09:07.313
DOES NOT A STRONG RELIABLE

09:07.313 --> 09:08.415
ON THE GROUND PARTNER

09:08.415 --> 09:10.116
CAPABLE OF MOVING IN AND

09:10.116 --> 09:11.384
REALLY LIBERATING IT FROM

09:11.384 --> 09:12.318
ISLAMIC STATE.

09:12.318 --> 09:13.286
>> Sreenivasan: MATT BRADLEY

09:13.286 --> 09:14.320
OF "THE WALL STREET JOURNAL,"

09:14.320 --> 09:15.755
THANKS SO MUCH.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.991

09:28.468 --> 09:29.636
REGULARLY SCHEDULED TIME?

09:29.636 --> 09:31.070
IF YOU'RE OF A "CERTAIN AGE" YOU

09:31.070 --> 09:32.605
MIGHT BE WATCHING THIS NEXT

09:32.605 --> 09:37.210
STORY ON A PHONE OR A TABLET,

09:37.210 --> 09:38.478
TIME-SHIFTING IT THROUGH A DVR

09:38.478 --> 09:39.646
TO WATCH IT WHEN YOU WANT, YOU

09:39.646 --> 09:41.181
MIGHT NOT EVEN OWN A TELEVISION

09:41.181 --> 09:44.417
OR HAVE A CONNECTION TO A CABLE

09:44.417 --> 09:47.620
OR SATELLITE SERVICE.

09:47.620 --> 09:48.655
IN FACT, CUTTING THE CORD IS AN

09:48.655 --> 09:50.023
ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO PAYING

09:50.023 --> 09:52.659
A MONTHLY CABLE BILL FOR A

09:52.659 --> 09:55.595
GROWING NUMBER OF PEOPLE.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.696
IT'S A WAY TO SAVE UP TO $60 OR

09:56.696 --> 09:58.264
$80 A MONTH.

09:58.264 --> 09:59.499
BUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

09:59.499 --> 10:00.533
DEFINITION OF TELEVISION AS OUR

10:00.533 --> 10:01.234
VIEWING PATTERNS CHANGE?

10:01.234 --> 10:02.669
THAT'S THE TOPIC OF OUR

10:02.669 --> 10:03.870

SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT JEFF

10:05.038 --> 10:05.805
GREENFIELD REPORTS.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.240
>> Reporter: THIS WAS THE

10:07.240 --> 10:08.341
AMERICAN CITYSCAPE WHEN

10:08.341 --> 10:09.375
TELEVISION WAS NEW: FORESTS OF

10:09.375 --> 10:11.010
ROOFTOP ANTENNAS, CAPTURING

10:11.010 --> 10:12.412
SIGNALS OVER THE AIR FROM A

10:12.412 --> 10:13.713
HALF-DOZEN CHANNELS THAT FOUGHT

10:13.713 --> 10:15.148
FOR SPACE ON A CROWDED BROADCAST

10:15.148 --> 10:16.149
SPECTRUM.

10:16.149 --> 10:18.051
TURNING THOSE SIGNALS INTO

TELEVISION COMES TO US THROUGH

10:24.491 --> 10:25.592

10:25.592 --> 10:26.860
SATELLITE.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.294
OUR CABLE BILLS BRING US A SO-

10:28.294 --> 10:29.829
CALLED "BUNDLE" OF MORE THAN 900

10:29.829 --> 10:31.431
CHANNELS.

10:31.431 --> 10:32.632
BUT MOST OF US WATCH AN AVERAGE

10:32.632 --> 10:34.567
OF ONLY 17.

10:34.567 --> 10:36.269
AND NOW, MORE AND MORE VIEWERS,

10:36.269 --> 10:38.371
UNWILLING TO PAY EVER-HIGHER

10:38.371 --> 10:39.939
FEES FOR A HUGE "BUNDLE" OF

10:39.939 --> 10:41.774
CHOICES THEY RARELY USE, ARE

10:41.774 --> 10:43.576
TURNING TO A NEW TECHNOLOGY THAT

10:43.576 --> 10:45.211
MAY THREATEN THE VERY FOUNDATION

10:45.211 --> 10:48.781
OF THE CABLE TV INDUSTRY.

10:48.781 --> 10:50.550
OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, 3.8

10:50.550 --> 10:52.051
MILLION AMERICAN HOMES HAVE "CUT

11:00.660 --> 11:02.061
REJECTING THE COST OF A MONTHLY

11:02.061 --> 11:07.534

11:07.534 --> 11:10.837
INSTEAD TO BROADBAND, HIGH SPEED

11:10.837 --> 11:11.938

11:24.117 --> 11:25.318
PIECE.

11:25.318 --> 11:26.920
AND SHE'S A TV PRODUCER,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.454
REMEMBER, SHE DOESN'T HAVE A

11:28.454 --> 11:29.489
TELEVISION SET.

11:29.489 --> 11:30.757
WHY ARE YOU NOT TEMPTED, DO YOU

11:30.757 --> 11:32.091
THINK, TO BUY YOURSELF A

11:32.091 --> 11:33.092
TELEVISION SET AND HOOK UP TO

11:33.092 --> 11:34.227
CABLE?

11:34.227 --> 11:35.495

11:35.495 --> 11:36.863
ALREADY HAVE WAYS TO WATCH WHAT

11:36.863 --> 11:37.997
I WANT TO WATCH WITHOUT A

GO OUT OF MY WAY TO BUY A TV,

13:53.599 --> 13:54.801
KEY QUESTION ARISES: DOES THIS

13:54.801 --> 13:56.002
PORTEND "THE DEATH OF TV?"

13:56.002 --> 13:57.003
WILL THIS MEDIUM GO THE WAY OF

13:57.003 --> 13:58.638
MUSIC, WHERE RECORDS AND C.D.'S

13:58.638 --> 13:59.839
ARE ALL BUT EXTINCT, OR

13:59.839 --> 14:01.240
NEWSPAPERS, FINDING IT EVER

14:01.240 --> 14:03.443
HARDER TO SURVIVE IN PRINT?

14:03.443 --> 14:05.511
WELL, IT DEPENDS WHO YOU ASK,

14:05.511 --> 14:09.649
AND WHAT YOU MEAN BY DEATH.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.018
EARLIER THIS MONTH HBO'S CHIEF,

14:12.018 --> 14:14.587
RICHARD PLEPLER ANNOUNCED A $15-

14:14.587 --> 14:15.855

14:15.855 --> 14:17.557
DELIVERED THROUGH APPLE DEVICES,

14:17.557 --> 14:19.692
THAT SET ALARM BELLS RINGING.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.061
WHEN HBO ANNOUNCED THAT YOU WERE

14:22.061 --> 14:24.263
GOING TO BRING THIS NEW SERVICE

14:24.263 --> 14:28.768
TO THE PUBLIC, ONE OF THE FIRST

14:28.768 --> 14:30.269
REACTIONS OUT THERE WAS, "A-HA,

14:30.269 --> 14:31.637
THIS IS THE CANARY IN THE COAL

14:31.637 --> 14:32.505
MINE.

14:32.505 --> 14:33.673
THE CORD IS BEING CUT.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.108
THIS PRESAGES THE ULTIMATE DEATH

14:35.108 --> 14:36.809
OF CABLE."

14:36.809 --> 14:37.410
TRUE?

14:37.410 --> 14:39.779
>> NO, HIGHLY OVERWROUGHT.

14:39.779 --> 14:40.980
LISTEN, THERE ARE 70 MILLION

14:40.980 --> 14:45.418
HOMES IN THE U.S. THAT DON'T

14:45.418 --> 14:46.753
TAKE HBO AND ONE OF THE

14:46.753 --> 14:48.087
THINGS WE THINK ABOUT ALL THE

14:48.087 --> 14:49.288
TIME IS HOW DO WE GO AND BRING

14:49.288 --> 14:52.759
THOSE 70 MILLION HOMES INTO THE

14:52.759 --> 14:54.026
HBO FAMILY?

14:54.026 --> 14:55.328
SO WE WANNA DO THAT THROUGH,

14:55.328 --> 14:56.963
KIND OF MULTILATERAL APPROACH.

14:56.963 --> 14:58.231
WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH OUR CABLE

14:58.231 --> 14:59.065
OPERATORS.

14:59.065 --> 14:59.999
WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH OUR

SATELLITE DISTRIBUTORS.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.468
WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH OUR TELCO

15:02.468 --> 15:04.070
DISTRIBUTORS.

15:04.070 --> 15:05.838
AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD DIGITAL

15:05.838 --> 15:06.973

15:08.407 --> 15:13.546
MILLION CABLE AND SATELLITE TV

15:13.546 --> 15:16.115
HOMES SUBSCRIBING TO HBO,

15:16.115 --> 15:17.650
THERE'S A HUGE ECONOMIC

15:17.650 --> 15:19.152
INCENTIVE FOR THE NETWORK TO

15:19.152 --> 15:20.419
STAY WITH CABLE.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.721
IT'S THE SAME LOGIC FOR SPORTS

15:21.721 --> 15:24.690
GIANT ESPN, WHICH EARNS SOME

15:24.690 --> 15:26.125
$6.5 BILLION DOLLARS YEAR JUST

15:26.125 --> 15:28.427
FROM CABLE SUBSCRIBER FEES.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.029
THAT IS A POWERFUL REASON TO

15:30.029 --> 15:31.631
REMAIN IN THE CABLE UNIVERSE.

15:31.631 --> 15:33.065
>> Reporter: AS FOR THOSE WHO

15:33.065 --> 15:34.333

15:34.333 --> 15:36.235
DUMPING A CABLE PACKAGE, THE

15:36.235 --> 15:41.741
ADVANTAGE TO CORD-CUTTING MAY

15:41.741 --> 15:42.742
NOT BE ALL THAT CLEAR, SAYS "THE

ATLANTIC'S" DEREK THOMPSON.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.812
EVEN IN CUTTING THE CORD,

15:45.812 --> 15:46.979
THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE PAYING

15:46.979 --> 15:48.347
$40 A MONTH, SAY, TO TIME WARNER

15:48.347 --> 15:49.448
JUST FOR THE INTERNET.

15:49.448 --> 15:53.986
>> RIGHT.

15:53.986 --> 15:55.188
>> Reporter: BUT NOW YOU ADD

15:55.188 --> 15:55.955
SLING.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.123
THAT'S $20 A MONTH, I MEAN, WHEN

15:57.123 --> 15:58.324
YOU START ADDING THIS STUFF UP,

15:58.324 --> 15:59.525
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THESE CORD

15:59.525 --> 16:00.760
CUTTERS ARE GONNA BE SAVING ANY

16:00.760 --> 16:02.028
MONEY.

16:02.028 --> 16:02.962
THEY MIGHT ACTUALLY END UP

16:02.962 --> 16:04.931
SPENDING MORE MONEY.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.365
>> SOME PEOPLE ARE NOT GOING TO

16:06.365 --> 16:07.466
SAVE MONEY.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.501
SOME PEOPLE SURELY ARE GOING TO

16:08.501 --> 16:10.102
THINK THAT THEY'RE BEATING A

16:10.102 --> 16:11.437
SYSTEM BUT IRONICALLY ARE GOING

16:11.437 --> 16:12.471
TO PAY MORE FOR IT.

16:12.471 --> 16:13.673
BUT THERE'S A LOTTA PEOPLE AND

16:13.673 --> 16:15.107
THEY'RE GONNA SAY, "I DON'T

16:15.107 --> 16:16.776
WANNA SPEND $100 A MONTH ON

16:16.776 --> 16:17.977

ABOUT $10 A MONTH.

16:23.015 --> 16:24.517
>> Reporter: THERE IS, HOWEVER,

16:24.517 --> 16:25.785

16:39.632 --> 16:40.933
MILLENNIALS ARE ACTUALLY OFTEN

WATCHING SOMETHING VERY

16:42.401 --> 16:43.870
DIFFERENT.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.938

16:47.206 --> 16:48.641
OPERATES ENTIRELY OUTSIDE OF THE

PAY TV SYSTEM THAT WE KNOW

16:50.243 --> 16:51.611
TODAY.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.112
IT'S CONTENT THAT'S DEVELOPED

16:53.112 --> 16:54.347
FOR 1/10 THE COST PER HOUR OF

16:54.347 --> 16:55.381

16:58.417 --> 16:59.619
IT'S DISTRIBUTED BY SOCIAL MEDIA

16:59.619 --> 17:00.853

17:00.853 --> 17:03.923

17:03.923 --> 17:05.024
ABOUT VIDEOS THAT YOU CAN WATCH

17:05.024 --> 17:06.425
WITHOUT A TV, LIKE "BETWEEN TWO

17:22.775 --> 17:24.110

17:26.045 --> 17:29.348
DAILY HALF-HOUR NEWSCAST FROM

17:35.054 --> 17:36.455
THREE YEARS AGO AND SAID, "WHAT

17:36.455 --> 17:37.757
HAPPENS WHEN THE MILLENNIALS GO

17:37.757 --> 17:39.458
THROUGH A LIFE STAGE CHANGE,

WHEN THEY HAVE CHILDREN, WHEN

17:40.826 --> 17:42.194
THEY GET MARRIED?"

17:42.194 --> 17:43.462

THEY'RE NOT SO SURE ANYMORE.

17:47.366 --> 17:49.335
MILLENNIALS ARE DISENGAGED FROM

17:49.335 --> 17:50.836
THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM.

MAKE THEM SUDDENLY ABANDON

17:54.173 --> 17:56.142

18:15.528 --> 18:16.896
WITH ANY CONVERSATION AROUND THE

18:16.896 --> 18:18.531
DEATH OF ANYTHING, YOU HAVE TO

18:18.531 --> 18:19.632
KEEP IN MIND WHAT THE "DEATH"

18:19.632 --> 18:20.633
REALLY MEANS.

18:20.633 --> 18:21.901
IT DOESN'T MEAN IT GOES TO ZERO,

18:21.901 --> 18:23.269
AND GOES AWAY, AND DISAPPEARS

18:23.269 --> 18:24.303
ENTIRELY.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.738
WHAT IT MEANS IS IT PROBABLY

18:25.738 --> 18:27.006
GOES INTO DECLINE, OR IT GOES

18:27.006 --> 18:27.873
FLAT, IT GOES SIDEWAYS.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.676
THAT TV AS WE KNOW IT WON'T BE

18:30.676 --> 18:32.178
AROUND TEN OR EVEN TWENTY YEARS

18:32.178 --> 18:33.379
FROM NOW, YOU'D LIKELY LOSE THAT

18:33.379 --> 18:34.714
BET.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.148
AND THE GIANTS LIKE ESPN OR HBO

18:36.148 --> 18:37.516

HOW THEIR SIGNALS COME INTO OUR

18:41.787 --> 18:43.122
FROM THE "CABLE BUNDLE", IT'S A

18:43.122 --> 18:44.757
VERY GOOD BET THAT MANY OF THE

TAKE IT OR PAY IT BACK, THEY

PICK UP ANOTHER LOAN?

20:08.674 --> 20:10.376
>> YEAH, THAT TENDS TO BE

20:10.376 --> 20:11.911
THE BIGGEST HAZARD.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.379
IT'S THAT THESE LOANS ARE

TWO WEEKS.

20:46.645 --> 20:49.014

20:49.014 --> 20:50.082
>> SO WHAT IS THE BUREAU

20:50.082 --> 20:52.151
GOING TO DO OR WANT TO DO TO

20:52.151 --> 20:53.552
TRY TO PREVENT THIS FROM

20:53.552 --> 20:54.720
HAPPENING?

20:54.720 --> 20:56.922
>> WELL, THEY'RE GOING AFTER

20:56.922 --> 20:58.457
THIS-- IN A COUPLE DIFFERENT

20:58.457 --> 20:58.858
WAYS.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.159
AND IT DOES GET COMPLICATED

21:00.159 --> 21:01.727
BUT I THINK THE KEY THING,

21:01.727 --> 21:03.429
THE PILLAR IN THIS WHOLE

21:03.429 --> 21:05.564
STRATEGY IS A CAP THAT WILL

21:05.564 --> 21:07.700
COME AFTER THE THIRD LOAN.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.268
SO LET'S SAY YOU TAKE OUT A

21:09.268 --> 21:12.171
LOAN, RENEW IT TWICE, NOW A

21:12.171 --> 21:13.706

21:13.706 --> 21:15.474

21:15.474 --> 21:17.276

21:25.084 --> 21:25.885
PERIOD OF TIME THAT YOU

21:25.885 --> 21:26.685
WANT?

21:26.685 --> 21:28.454
>> SO WHEN DO THESE PROPOSED

21:28.454 --> 21:29.555
RULES GO INTO EFFECT?

21:29.555 --> 21:31.357
>> WELL, IT'S STILL GOING TO

21:31.357 --> 21:32.825
BE QUITE A LONG PERIOD OF

21:32.825 --> 21:33.692
DELIBERATION.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.694
I WOULD SUSPECT THAT BY

21:35.694 --> 21:36.595
SOMETIME NEXT YEAR THESE

21:36.595 --> 21:37.696
RULES OR A VERSION OF THEM

21:37.696 --> 21:38.430
WILL GO INTO EFFECT.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.032
>> AND WHAT IS THE INITIAL

21:40.032 --> 21:40.866
RESPONSE FROM THE LENDING

21:40.866 --> 21:41.534
INDUSTRY ABOUT THIS?

21:41.534 --> 21:43.068
>> ALMOST EVERYBODY I HAVE

21:43.068 --> 21:44.236
TALKED TO IN THE PAYDAY

21:44.236 --> 21:45.004
INDUSTRY MADE IT CLEAR

21:45.004 --> 21:46.438
THIS WITH FAR MORE STRICT

21:46.438 --> 21:47.339
THAN EXPECTED.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.108
AND THE OUTCOME, OR THE

21:49.108 --> 21:50.709

21:54.713 --> 21:57.016
SAYING THAT THIS WILL REALLY

21:57.016 --> 21:58.184
JEOPARDIZE OUR BUSINESS.

21:58.184 --> 21:59.318
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, THIS

21:59.318 --> 22:01.153
IS THEIR WORDS, THIS WILL

22:01.153 --> 22:02.755
JEOPARDIZE THE ABILITY OF

22:02.755 --> 22:04.356
LOW INCOME PEOPLE TO GET

22:04.356 --> 22:05.958
CREDIT WHEN THEY'RE

SENSE DIFFERENT FROM

23:20.099 --> 23:21.333
ANYTHING WE'VE SEEN BEFORE.

23:21.333 --> 23:22.635
THESE COMPANIES HAVE FOUND A

23:22.635 --> 23:23.836
NEW WAY TO DO IT WHICH IS

23:23.836 --> 23:26.338
PUTTING UP SOME LITTLE RID
