HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.407 --> 00:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On tonight's "PBS NewsHour":
Violence continues
to trail Donald Trump, as
supporters and protesters

00:12.880 --> 00:15.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
clash at the Republican
candidate's rallies.

00:15.749 --> 00:21.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: The Chicago police
release videos
of 101 open cases where
civilians were harmed

00:22.022 --> 00:26.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by officers. We look at how that
may affect
the police department's already
strained relations

00:27.027 --> 00:28.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the community.

00:28.896 --> 00:34.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, New York chef Eddie Huang
talks growing
up in Orlando, Florida, as the
son of Taiwanese

00:34.334 --> 00:37.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigrants, and how that's
influenced his
take on food and culture.

00:37.771 --> 00:42.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG, Author, "Double Cup
Love": I
think all my work is really
rebelling against

00:42.109 --> 00:48.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the matrix that's trying to
normalize us,
and create monoculture. And the
funniest,

00:48.949 --> 00:52.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most rewarding part about it is,
all I have
to do is be myself.

00:52.152 --> 00:56.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's
Friday. Mark Shields
and David Brooks are here to
analyze the week's

00:56.290 --> 00:57.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
news.

00:57.291 --> 01:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:03.597 --> 01:06.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.400 --> 01:15.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
presidential candidates
are in California heading into
the last weekend

01:15.742 --> 01:17.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of campaigning before Tuesday's
primary.

01:17.844 --> 01:20.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And last night, campaign trail
violence followed.

01:20.614 --> 01:23.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has the story.

01:23.550 --> 01:32.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Police in riot
gear, campaign
hats on fire, and bloodied
faces, that was

01:32.125 --> 01:36.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the scene last night outside a
Donald Trump
rally in San Jose, California.

01:36.096 --> 01:41.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, increasingly, it's the
picture of campaign
2016. Where one side sees
organized, violent

01:42.002 --> 01:46.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protesters, the other says it
all started
with the candidate himself.

01:46.306 --> 01:49.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
So if you see somebody getting
ready to throw

01:49.676 --> 01:56.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a tomato, knock the crap out of
them, would
you? Seriously, OK? Just knock
the hell -- I

01:56.116 --> 02:01.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
promise you, I will pay for the
legal fees.
I promise. I promise.

02:01.088 --> 02:06.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But, today, a
different tone.
Trump insisted he has pushed for
calm.

02:06.259 --> 02:10.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: When we have a
protester inside,
which even isn't very often, I
say, be very

02:10.897 --> 02:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gentle, please don't hurt him,
take care of
him, if he wants to shout, if he
punches you

02:18.572 --> 02:20.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the face, smile.

02:20.474 --> 02:24.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democratic
front-runner Hillary
Clinton reacted to last night's
violence in

02:24.945 --> 02:26.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a CNN interview today.

02:26.847 --> 02:29.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
And Trump has lowered the bar.
And now is

02:29.349 --> 02:34.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it a surprise that people who
don't like him
are stepping over that low bar?
I don't think

02:34.454 --> 02:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is. He needs to condemn all
violence by
everyone. I already have. I will
continue

02:39.493 --> 02:41.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do so.

02:41.361 --> 02:44.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Neil Levesque
of Saint Anselm
College says the incivility has
risen on both

02:44.564 --> 02:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sides and so has the volume.

02:46.500 --> 02:49.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL LEVESQUE, Saint Anselm
College: Well,
Trump certainly has escalated
the amount of

02:49.202 --> 02:55.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vitriol from the podium itself,
yelling at
reporters, personally attacking
them, personally

02:55.242 --> 02:57.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attacking judges.

02:57.044 --> 03:04.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is sort of unprecedented.
And I'm sure
that it has raised the level of
disruption,

03:04.418 --> 03:11.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of amount of anger that's out
there. And I
believe it has contributed to
the bad situation

03:11.625 --> 03:14.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's taken place outside of
some of these
rallies.

03:14.194 --> 03:18.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It has happened
at many Trump
events since last year. These
are just a few.

03:18.632 --> 03:23.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But things escalated in March,
with a canceled
rally in Chicago, dozens of
arrests in Saint

03:23.937 --> 03:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Louis and a protester getting
punched in Tucson.

03:27.374 --> 03:32.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recently, violence has turned to
more physical
damage, with protesters smashing
police cars

03:32.546 --> 03:38.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near L.A., items thrown at
police horses in
Albuquerque, and then punches
thrown on both

03:38.118 --> 03:39.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sides last night.

03:40.020 --> 03:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Larry O'Connor is a talk host
and conservative
in Washington. He says the
protesters are

03:44.758 --> 03:46.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blocking democracy.

03:46.626 --> 03:49.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY O'CONNOR, Talk Show Host:
What we saw
last night in San Jose was a
group of American

03:49.229 --> 03:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens, peacefully assembling
for a political
rally, and they were violently
attacked. That's

03:55.469 --> 03:57.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anti-free speech. It's
anti-American.

03:57.270 --> 04:01.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Conservatives
charge that
organizations on the left like
MoveOn.org

04:01.441 --> 04:05.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are behind the protests and
violence. MoveOn
has said it did promote and
print signs for

04:06.012 --> 04:10.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Chicago protest in March,
but it insists
it is not violent and there's no
evidence

04:10.717 --> 04:12.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
connecting it to violence.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they blame Trump for the
escalation.

04:15.388 --> 04:17.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Karine Jean-Pierre is with
MoveOn.org.

04:17.257 --> 04:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, MoveOn.org:
He is responsible.
He is standing on stage, behind
a podium,

04:21.695 --> 04:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he's applying for the job of
the United
States. And what he's doing is
saying it's

04:26.733 --> 04:32.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
OK to punch a peaceful
protester. And this
is not OK. It is a problem. And
this is hatred

04:32.739 --> 04:36.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and bigotry and racism that he's
putting out
there.

04:36.042 --> 04:41.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Trump
supporters insist
they are the victims of hatred
from protesters.

04:41.348 --> 04:46.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some see it all as something
more than politics,
but a kind of cultural anger
spilling over

04:46.319 --> 04:47.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at campaign events.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Again, Levesque:

04:49.556 --> 04:54.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL LEVESQUE: The tragedy here
is that Americans
need to be able to talk to each
other. They

04:54.828 --> 04:59.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need to be able to listen to
each other, and
when you have civic events that
really cannot

04:59.199 --> 05:03.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take place anymore, it's really
harmful to
our republic.

05:03.036 --> 05:07.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today's Trump
rally at an
airport in Redding, California,
was notably

05:07.941 --> 05:08.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
calmer.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

05:10.710 --> 05:14.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will talk
more about
security issues on the campaign,
as well as

05:14.848 --> 05:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the week in politics, with
Shields and Brooks
later in the program.

05:18.652 --> 05:22.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: U.S.
hiring plunged
to its lowest level in more than
five years.

05:22.989 --> 05:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Labor Department reported
U.S. employers
added just 38,000 jobs in May.
At the same

05:27.894 --> 05:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, unemployment fell from 5
percent to
4.7 percent, but that was
largely because

05:33.533 --> 05:38.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about half-a-million unemployed
Americans
stopped looking for work. We
will take a closer

05:38.405 --> 05:41.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look at the weak jobs report
right after this
news summary.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hiring slowdown pushed
stocks lower on
Wall Street today. The Dow Jones
industrial

05:45.745 --> 05:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average lost 31 points to close
at 17807.
The Nasdaq fell nearly 29
points, and the

05:50.917 --> 05:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
S&amp;P 500 dropped six. For the
week, both the
Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 gained a
fraction of

05:56.223 --> 05:59.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a percent, while the Dow lost a
fraction of
a percent.

05:59.626 --> 06:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Central Texas, the search for
four missing
Fort Hood soldiers intensified,
a day after

06:04.664 --> 06:09.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their truck overturned in a
flooded creek.
Five soldiers died, and three
others were

06:09.469 --> 06:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rescued and hospitalized. It
happened as soldiers
from the Army post were being
trained to operate

06:14.975 --> 06:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 2.5-ton truck. Aerial and
ground crews
are painstakingly searching the
20-mile creek.

06:21.081 --> 06:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAJ. GEN. JOHN UBERTI, U.S.
Army: Our priority
has been, since the first report
of this incident,

06:26.786 --> 06:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and continues to be the search
for our four
missing teammates. The entire
leadership team

06:33.927 --> 06:41.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is focused on making sure we're
providing
the support and counseling for
the families,

06:41.501 --> 06:47.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friends and soldiers as we work
through the
notification and grieving
process.

06:47.641 --> 06:52.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than half
of the state
of Texas remained under flood
watches or warnings

06:52.679 --> 06:57.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. A new batch of storms
dumped more rain
and worsened flooding caused by
waterways

06:57.250 --> 06:59.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rising to record levels.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flooding is also wreaking havoc
in Paris,
where the River Seine rose more
than 18 feet

07:03.723 --> 07:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
above normal. Many popular
landmarks across
the city have been forced to
close. French

07:08.094 --> 07:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
authorities are also activating
a preliminary
emergency plan to transfer
government functions

07:13.933 --> 07:17.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to secure places if the river
continues to
swell.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Matt Frei of Independent
Television News reports.

07:19.806 --> 07:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT FREI: The statue of the
Zouave soldier
on the iconic Alma Bridge, but
when he's up

07:26.513 --> 07:32.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to his hips in the Seine, Paris
knows it's
in trouble.

07:32.152 --> 07:38.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"It's pretty impressive," he
admits. "Let's
hope the rains don't continue.
Otherwise,

07:38.224 --> 07:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we will have a catastrophe."

07:41.261 --> 07:46.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The water is already almost five
meters above
its usual level. That's still
three meters

07:46.232 --> 07:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
short of the record set over a
century ago,
but high enough to force tens of
thousands

07:52.806 --> 07:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Parisians to be evacuated.
The army was
quick to take people to safety.

07:57.677 --> 08:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It
scared me terribly.
I was really panicked. I have
never seen this

08:04.451 --> 08:07.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in my life and it's shocking.
It's really
shocking.

08:07.153 --> 08:10.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm really sorry. Closed
today. We have
to evacuate the masterpieces
that are in the

08:10.123 --> 08:12.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
basement.

08:12.726 --> 08:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT FREI: The Louvre has been
turned into
a waiting room for nude
masterpieces evacuated

08:22.035 --> 08:29.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the first time since World
War II. A quarter-of-a-million
treasures are all trying to stay
dry. The

08:29.342 --> 08:31.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
water has left its mark on
Germany too.

08:31.878 --> 08:38.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was Zimba Hamen (ph) on the
Austrian
border from the air, and this
was it on the

08:38.184 --> 08:43.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ground. The floods have left
nine people dead
here and the spring clean from
hell.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At least 13
people have
died in the flooding across
Europe in the

08:47.027 --> 08:48.795 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last week.

08:48.828 --> 08:51.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was another deadly day in the
Mediterranean.
The Libyan coast guard recovered
more than

08:51.631 --> 08:57.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
110 bodies after a smuggling
boat sank. Most
of the victims were from African
countries.

08:57.470 --> 09:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Geneva, migration
officials
warned of a new wave heading
toward Greece,

09:02.876 --> 09:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after a ship carrying some 700
migrants sank
near the island of Crete today;
340 people

09:09.115 --> 09:10.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were rescued.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL MILLMAN, International
Organization for
Migration: Crete is opening up
as a kind of

09:12.719 --> 09:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new destination. We have had
several hundred
in the last three days. We
understand that

09:19.058 --> 09:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they sail from Turkey, not from
Africa, and
that they fit the profile that
we saw from

09:26.699 --> 09:32.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Balkan route most of the
past 12 months,
which is Afghans, Syrians and
Iraqis.

09:32.572 --> 09:39.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The European
Union signed
a deal to close the route from
Turkey.

09:39.679 --> 09:44.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In India, a police operation to
clear a protest
camp erupted into a volley of
gunfire, leaving

09:44.184 --> 09:49.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
at least 24 people dead.
Thousands of demonstrators
had occupied a makeshift camp in
the northern

09:49.055 --> 09:54.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city of Mathura for two years,
demanding a
laundry list of political and
economic reforms.

09:54.327 --> 09:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police approached the site
last night
on court orders to evict the
protesters. They

09:58.965 --> 10:02.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were met by gunfire, and a blaze
broke out.

10:02.168 --> 10:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): A
police patrolling
team was in the area to check
the arrangements

10:07.807 --> 10:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the anti-encroachment drive.
The encroachers
attacked them. Our
superintendent got injured

10:12.846 --> 10:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and later succumbed to his
injuries. They
had explosives, grenades, and
rifles, which

10:17.050 --> 10:18.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they used to fire at us.

10:18.785 --> 10:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than a
hundred people
were injured in the clashes, and
some 370

10:22.489 --> 10:24.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
others were arrested.

10:24.257 --> 10:28.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
World soccer's governing body
says its top
officials awarded themselves pay
bumps and

10:28.561 --> 10:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bonuses totaling $80 million. An
internal
FIFA investigation showed
ex-president Sepp

10:33.766 --> 10:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Blatter and two others received
the money
over their last five years in
office. Blatter

10:39.005 --> 10:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got a $12 million bonus after
the 2014 World
Cup in Brazil. It's just the
latest development

10:45.378 --> 10:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the sweeping FIFA corruption
scandal.

10:47.647 --> 10:52.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the U.S. women's
soccer team can't
stop work to protest. A judge
ruled that the

10:52.986 --> 10:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world champions cannot strike
for better conditions
and pay, which they argue is
four times less

10:59.225 --> 11:04.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than their male counterparts.
The judge said
the team is bound by a no-strike
clause in

11:04.764 --> 11:07.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an earlier agreement with the
U.S. Soccer
Federation.

11:07.700 --> 11:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what a dismal
jobs report says about the state
of the economy;

11:13.239 --> 11:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than a hundred Chicago
police videos
released to the public; Mark
Shields and David

11:17.410 --> 11:24.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brooks take on the week's news;
and much more.

11:24.984 --> 11:34.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The monthly jobs report may only
provide a
snapshot of the economy, but
that picture

11:34.627 --> 11:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in May was grim, and the photo
album of the
past three months is not such a
good look.

11:39.766 --> 11:44.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just under 40,000 new jobs last
month, that's
abnormally low during this long
recovery.

11:45.004 --> 11:50.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even if the numbers are off,
the last
quarter shows a slowdown, just
115,000 jobs

11:50.710 --> 11:52.545 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a month.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's break this all down with
David Wessel.
He's the director of the
Brookings Institution's

11:54.714 --> 11:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hutchins Center on Fiscal and
Monetary policy,
and a contributing correspondent
to The Wall

11:59.185 --> 12:00.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Street Journal.

12:00.987 --> 12:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thirty-eight thousand jobs,
everybody's kind
of stunned by that. Some of
those had to be

12:04.357 --> 12:06.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Verizon workers and the
strike.

12:06.159 --> 12:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL, The Wall Street
Journal: Right.
It would have been twice as many
jobs if it

12:08.094 --> 12:14.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hadn't been for the Verizon
strike, but, still,
that 115,000 jobs a month over
the past three

12:14.567 --> 12:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
months is much slower than we
have been seeing.

12:16.703 --> 12:19.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have been seeing over 200,000
jobs a month.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, as we
were talking
about, that the unemployment
rate decreased,

12:22.909 --> 12:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it was the worst kind of
decrease you
want.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We like it when the unemployment
rate declines
because more people find work.
We don't like

12:29.582 --> 12:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it when people drop out of the
work force.
As I said earlier, about
half-a-million people

12:33.853 --> 12:39.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dropped out of the work force, a
lot of whom
were in the over age 55 group, a
lot of increase

12:39.592 --> 12:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in -- a lot of dropouts in the
high school
dropout class. So that's really
troubling.

12:44.731 --> 12:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it reverses a trend we had
been seeing
over the past few months of more
people coming

12:49.068 --> 12:50.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the job market.

12:51.004 --> 12:53.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, there's a
stronger correlation
between higher education and
unemployment?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: That's right.

12:55.642 --> 13:01.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if you're a college
graduate, the unemployment
rate is about 2.1 percent in
May, the new

13:01.848 --> 13:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
numbers out. If you're a high
school dropout,
it's half of what it was during
the recession,

13:06.586 --> 13:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it's still 7 percent, much
higher.

13:08.354 --> 13:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And then when
you break
it down by race, there are wild
fluctuations

13:11.724 --> 13:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in unemployment that way?

13:13.660 --> 13:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Right. As always,
about -- unemployment
for black people in America is
twice that

13:16.262 --> 13:18.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for white people.

13:18.131 --> 13:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think what's really
important is here,
is that it's not that the
economy is getting

13:22.035 --> 13:26.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worse. It's just that it's
getting better
much more slowly. And that's the
disappointing

13:26.839 --> 13:30.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part. We weren't ready for this
recovery to
start losing steam.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes. When we
talk about
those chunks of time that we're
looking at

13:33.680 --> 13:38.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the jobs report, quarter by
quarter, and as
slow as this has been, do we
know if this

13:38.651 --> 13:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a bad patch or if this is a
major kind
of sea shift in how much slower
our growth

13:44.390 --> 13:45.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is happening?

13:45.692 --> 13:47.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: We don't know. And
that's really
the question.

13:47.927 --> 13:52.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this a few months of bad
patch and things
will pick up later in the year,
as happened

13:52.231 --> 13:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the past couple of years?
People are saying,
the forecasters, for what it's
worth, say

13:57.437 --> 14:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the economy should do
better in the second
quarter than the very lousy
first quarter.

14:01.874 --> 14:07.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are some worrisome
signs. Auto sales
have been weak. Businesses seem
to be squeezed

14:07.747 --> 14:12.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on their profits, and they're a
little uncertain
about what his happening to
policy, so they're

14:12.952 --> 14:14.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not investing.

14:14.754 --> 14:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's really one of those
moments where
we could look back on this say
just it was

14:18.391 --> 14:21.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bad patch, but we could look
back and say
this was an inflection point.

14:21.828 --> 14:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, one
group of
people who study this report
this very closely,

14:25.131 --> 14:30.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Fed, and they're meeting
soon. What does
this mean? Is this sort of
enough of an indicator

14:31.003 --> 14:32.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where maybe we shouldn't make
any changes?

14:32.905 --> 14:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: I think that it
looks like the
Fed will not raise interest
rates on June

14:36.909 --> 14:38.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
15.

14:38.711 --> 14:41.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The markets had been expecting
them to raise
rates. After these numbers came
out today,

14:41.547 --> 14:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the market has changed its mind,
and Governor
Lael Brainard of the Federal
Reserve Board

14:45.618 --> 14:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was pretty gloomy about what she
saw in the
numbers. So, the guessing now is
maybe they

14:51.057 --> 14:55.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
raise rates in July, maybe they
wait until
September, but certainly not in
June.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's a
sliver of a silver
lining here, which is the hourly
rates.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

15:00.700 --> 15:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only silver lining in this
otherwise dismal
report was that wages are going
up. Wages

15:06.372 --> 15:10.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have risen about 2.5 percent
average hourly
earnings over the past 12
months. And the

15:10.843 --> 15:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House was quick to point
out that, if
you just look over the first
four or five

15:14.781 --> 15:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months of 2016, wages have been
going up at
better than a 3 percent annual
rate.

15:20.286 --> 15:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that is encouraging and that
is important
because it means that there's --
the labor

15:24.490 --> 15:29.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
market is tightening and
consumers will have
money to spend, and so that's
encouraging

15:29.762 --> 15:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sign and one I think people
weren't expecting.

15:32.131 --> 15:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And is there a
distinction
between part-time workers
looking for work,

15:36.002 --> 15:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
full-time workers looking for
work? How does
that fit in?

15:38.070 --> 15:40.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Yes.

15:40.039 --> 15:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the things that has
been disturbing
about the recovery is a very,
very large fraction

15:43.209 --> 15:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of workers by historic standards
have been
working part-time, but they tell
government

15:47.680 --> 15:51.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
survey people, we really wish we
were looking
for a full-time job.

15:51.083 --> 15:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that number has come down
quite a bit
since the recession, but it
still remains

15:55.454 --> 16:00.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much worse than it was before
the recession.
So that's one of the worrisome
signs. We don't

16:00.927 --> 16:05.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want the recovery to run out of
steam before
all those part-time workers who
want full-time

16:05.464 --> 16:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jobs can get them.

16:07.200 --> 16:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
David Wessel
from the Brookings Institution,
thanks so

16:07.500 --> 16:08.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

16:08.201 --> 16:13.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome.

16:13.840 --> 16:24.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now: a major
release of
video exposing the police force
in Chicago.

16:24.517 --> 16:28.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The relationship between many
residents, the
police and the mayor has been
extremely tense

16:28.287 --> 16:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for months now, leading to
protests and suspicion,
especially after a nearly
two-year delay in

16:33.759 --> 16:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the release of a video involving
a police
shooting.

16:36.896 --> 16:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city has traditionally
withheld these
kind of videos until
investigations were complete,

16:41.133 --> 16:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but, under pressure, the policy
has changed
and Chicago now appears to be
the largest

16:45.838 --> 16:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American city to release videos
showing potentially
excessive force.

16:50.910 --> 16:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our report.

16:52.278 --> 16:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: Some of the
images in this
story may be disturbing.

16:55.281 --> 17:00.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a stunning
release for
its sheer size and scope. Today,
Chicago's

17:00.519 --> 17:06.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Independent Police Review Board
released scores
of recordings related to 101
cases involving

17:06.959 --> 17:12.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officer-related shootings and
other incidents
in which civilians were injured
or killed.

17:12.164 --> 17:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The videos came from dashboard
cameras and
other sources. They involve
alleged misconduct

17:17.370 --> 17:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in cases that remain under
investigation.
In one video, an unarmed man was
shot by police

17:22.909 --> 17:27.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after he allegedly caused a
disturbance on
a bus and struck a driver.

17:27.179 --> 17:31.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another, shot on a cell phone,
shows police
hitting someone after arriving
at a scene

17:31.717 --> 17:33.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where there was open alcohol.

17:33.953 --> 17:38.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Sharon Fairley, chief
administrator
of the review authority, said
the release

17:38.791 --> 17:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is part of an effort to make the
department
more open.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHARON FAIRLEY, Chicago
Independent Police
Review Authority: These past few
months, as

17:43.529 --> 17:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the city has struggled with so
many questions
about policing and about police
accountability,

17:50.403 --> 17:56.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it has been clear that we all
agree that there's
a lack of trust and that
increased transparency

17:56.409 --> 17:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is essential to rebuilding that
trust.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Fairley added,
though, that
the videos only show so much.

18:02.615 --> 18:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHARON FAIRLEY: It's really
important for
you to keep in mind that these
materials may

18:07.753 --> 18:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not convey all of the facts and
considerations
that are relevant to an
investigation of an

18:13.659 --> 18:15.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
officer's conduct.

18:15.628 --> 18:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For its part, the
police union
called today's release of the
videos irresponsible.

18:19.532 --> 18:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anger and frustration with the
police department
came to a head last year after a
video was

18:25.137 --> 18:30.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
released showing a white officer
killing black
teenager Laquan McDonald. The
event occurred

18:30.643 --> 18:32.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2014.

18:32.511 --> 18:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Facing a firestorm, Mayor Rahm
Emanuel sacked
the police superintendent,
replacing him with

18:37.316 --> 18:40.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a new chief, veteran Eddie
Johnson.

18:40.286 --> 18:45.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's go to Chicago for
reactions to these
videos from Lori Lightfoot,
former chair of

18:45.224 --> 18:49.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the city's Police Accountability
Task Force.
It was formed by the mayor after
criticism

18:49.562 --> 18:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the department and his
office. She's now
president of the Chicago Police
Board, an

18:54.266 --> 18:56.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
independent civilian group
appointed by the
mayor.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

18:58.904 --> 19:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your task force had called for
this kind of
thing, the release of videos.
Why was it important

19:03.676 --> 19:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and why has it finally happened?

19:05.778 --> 19:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT, President,
Chicago Police
Board: Well, it's important
because this information

19:10.282 --> 19:13.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from these incidents is
something that people
in the community care a lot
about.

19:14.020 --> 19:18.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to know what happened.
They want
to know what specific actions
police officers

19:18.057 --> 19:22.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have taken, and whether or not
those actions
are consistent with law, ethics
and respectful

19:22.828 --> 19:25.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of community engagement.

19:25.131 --> 19:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So moving this process forward
to this point
with the release of video, audio
and also

19:30.336 --> 19:36.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police reports is a very, very
important step
towards accountability and
really restoring

19:36.242 --> 19:40.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
legitimacy of the police
department in a lot
of communities across Chicago.

19:40.279 --> 19:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is it possible to
say yet what
we have learned today from these
recordings,

19:44.116 --> 19:48.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
either in terms of individual
cases or some
larger patterns or themes?

19:48.721 --> 19:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: I think it's too
soon to tell
that.

19:51.924 --> 19:58.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the lead-in said, this is 101
cases. It's
a significant volume of data,
but I know people

19:58.164 --> 20:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to be spending time
going through
that, and I think we will learn
more about

20:01.767 --> 20:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it in the coming days. But I
think we should
focused on and emphasize the
point that Chicago

20:07.406 --> 20:11.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
now becomes a leader in
transparency and putting
this kind of information out.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a very big and important
moment in our
history.

20:14.914 --> 20:19.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We heard -- you
heard Sharon
Fairley talk about the
limitations of these

20:20.019 --> 20:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
videos, in terms of how -- in
some cases how
much or how little it shows us.
Do you agree

20:25.157 --> 20:27.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with that, that we should be
careful in watching
them?

20:27.693 --> 20:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: I do agree with
that, because
the videos by definition are
going to capture

20:32.331 --> 20:36.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a particular snapshot in time
from a particular
perspective. They're not going
to tell the

20:36.635 --> 20:38.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
entire story.

20:38.504 --> 20:42.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, many times, those videos
and the audio
will be meaningful and giving
the public an

20:42.475 --> 20:47.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understanding of what has
happened when. But
Sharon, I think, is 100 percent
right that

20:47.713 --> 20:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the public, while I think it's
important for
them to see this information,
see it in a

20:52.351 --> 20:57.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
timely fashion, they have to
recognize that
it's not going to tell the
entire story in

20:57.456 --> 20:59.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
every single case.

20:59.325 --> 21:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What kind of
initial feedback,
if any, are you getting at this
point in the

21:02.228 --> 21:05.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community that was so eager for
something
like this?

21:05.097 --> 21:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: Well, I think
very positive.

21:08.300 --> 21:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the folks who, frankly,
have been
the most critical of the police
department

21:12.438 --> 21:18.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the city for not being
transparent, for
forcing folks to file either
FOIA requests

21:18.043 --> 21:22.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or, worse, lawsuits, I think,
are surprised
at the scope and the breadth of
this.

21:22.715 --> 21:27.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We announced this policy back in
February.
We're now at this moment, many
months later,

21:27.086 --> 21:33.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the policy has actually
been given life.
And I hope that, on a
going-forward basis,

21:33.125 --> 21:39.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people recognize that once this
information
now becomes in the public view
on a regular

21:39.698 --> 21:45.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basis, that they will understand
better the
complexities and the nuances of
police encounters

21:45.437 --> 21:47.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in these very challenging
circumstances.

21:47.506 --> 21:51.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The police union,
as we said
in our setup, is not happy with
this. I read

21:51.977 --> 21:55.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a quote to you from the head of
the union.

21:55.481 --> 21:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The concern is that they're
putting this
out there and the officers' kids
and neighbors

21:59.852 --> 22:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going to see it and we're
not getting
the entire incident."

22:03.255 --> 22:05.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Your reaction?

22:05.257 --> 22:11.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: Well, Dean
Angelo, unfortunately,
has been on the wrong side of
change and reform

22:11.964 --> 22:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really since the last six
months.

22:14.667 --> 22:19.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He made a lot of, I think,
unfortunate comments
about the release of the task
force report

22:19.371 --> 22:26.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and our recommendations. And I
think he's
wrong about this. In the long
run, being transparent

22:26.378 --> 22:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is something that actually, in
my view, will
aid the officers out there on
the street.

22:31.016 --> 22:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will give the public context
for the tough
job that they have, the work
that they're

22:35.221 --> 22:40.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing and, frankly, will be a
teaching moment
and opportunity for young
officers to look

22:40.859 --> 22:45.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at what their peers are doing in
different
circumstances and to really
learn from that

22:45.297 --> 22:47.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going forward.

22:47.099 --> 22:52.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's unfortunate Dean Angelo and
the FOP really
seem fundamentally resistant to
change and

22:52.104 --> 22:56.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reform, but this is happening.
And it's going
happen whether or not they're on
the bus or

22:56.809 --> 23:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether on the back end of the
bus or on the
street, but reform and change
has got to come.

23:01.413 --> 23:05.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just very
briefly, in 30 seconds,
if you could, your task force
had called for

23:05.351 --> 23:11.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- had been very critical of the
police force.
Do you see changes taking place
yet?

23:11.190 --> 23:14.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: We see some
small steps in
the direction.

23:14.727 --> 23:19.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this is a really big,
important step,
but there is a lot more that
needs to be done.

23:19.398 --> 23:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with anything that comes,
there's got
to be public engagement, there's
got to be

23:25.437 --> 23:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transparency, so that people
understand exactly
what's happening, they have an
opportunity

23:30.342 --> 23:34.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to give input. And that's the
only way legitimacy
is going to be established.

23:34.179 --> 23:38.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Lori Lightfoot,
thank you very
much.

23:38.584 --> 23:49.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: Thank you.

23:49.728 --> 23:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

23:56.068 --> 24:00.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
controversial
tax to restore California's
wetlands; and

24:00.973 --> 24:04.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a restaurateur's journey in
discovering what
it means to be Asian-American.

24:04.710 --> 24:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, to the analysis of
Shields and
Brooks. That's syndicated
columnist Mark Shields

24:08.781 --> 24:13.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and New York Times columnist
David Brooks,
our captains of civility, those
who disagree

24:13.285 --> 24:14.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agreeably.

24:14.753 --> 24:16.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome back.

24:16.522 --> 24:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, so, first, there is
the story we
had about the longer-term kind
of pattern

24:20.859 --> 24:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of violence that is happening in
this presidential
campaign, and also the blame
game that's being

24:26.165 --> 24:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
played by Trump supporters and
the protesters
outside, right, saying -- well,
what about

24:31.837 --> 24:33.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the political dimensions of
this?

24:33.772 --> 24:41.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think,
taken most immediately
San Jose last night and the
protest/violence

24:41.513 --> 24:48.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the rally, the -- everything
I have been
able to find out, the
protesters, those who

24:48.153 --> 24:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are critical of Trump were the
ones -- certainly
not all of them -- but the
people who were

24:53.092 --> 24:59.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
guilty of the violence, of
putting police
at risk, of trashing property
and so forth

25:00.032 --> 25:03.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were the protesters, the
anti-Trump people.

25:03.602 --> 25:08.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, politically, the
consequence of this
is that they make Donald Trump
and his supporters

25:08.841 --> 25:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the victims, and it hurts
-- quote -- "their
cause," if they have a cause, if
it's an anti-Trump

25:15.781 --> 25:23.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political cause. They end up
helping him,
because his hope is that it
creates sort of

25:23.922 --> 25:28.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this sense of things being out
of control,
events being out of control.

25:28.560 --> 25:33.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the recipe: I'm the
strong man,
the authoritarian figure that
you need to

25:33.365 --> 25:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bring order to America.

25:34.767 --> 25:38.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I guess I
semi-halfway
disagree.

25:38.604 --> 25:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree that the victims were
the Trump supporters.
That's clear from the videos
that we have

25:43.275 --> 25:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen. Whether -- who it helps
and hurts, I
suspect it won't have a big
effect either

25:47.446 --> 25:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way, but you can argue it both
ways.

25:49.415 --> 25:53.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Trump supporters, for people
who are pre-convinced
to support Donald Trump, it
vindicates a lot

25:53.385 --> 25:56.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of their world view. And so it
will solidify
his support.

25:56.655 --> 25:59.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the only time I can really
think of political
violence really having a
political effect

25:59.691 --> 26:00.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was 1968 in Chicago.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Very much so.

26:02.628 --> 26:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And in that case,
it was sort
of intra-left, but it certainly
hurt the Democrats,

26:07.466 --> 26:09.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because there was an aura of
disarray.

26:09.701 --> 26:13.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so one can see among
independent voters
and who are just nervous about
Trump as a

26:13.639 --> 26:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
phenomenon, the fact that there
is all this
violence and all this drama
surrounding the

26:17.142 --> 26:22.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole Trump phenomenon could be
nervous-making
and it could drive some people.
I doubt, either

26:22.648 --> 26:24.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way, it will have a massive
effect.

26:24.249 --> 26:28.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's just a bunch of young
thugs who like
to punch somebody.

26:28.253 --> 26:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have always
had protests
as part of the political
discourse.

26:30.889 --> 26:32.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Oh, yes.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Every national
-- every
four years, there is the little
section for

26:35.027 --> 26:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the protesters at whatever
convention. This
just seems different.

26:39.097 --> 26:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think it is.

26:41.934 --> 26:48.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think Donald Trump,
it's part of
his shtick, is he plays to the
audience and

26:48.407 --> 26:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to those who do protest inside,
and don't
-- help him out, get him out of
here, that

26:54.313 --> 26:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is part of his routine, his
political routine,
and part of his political
appeal.

26:59.251 --> 27:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that in no way justifies or
vindicates
putting police officers at risk
or attacking

27:06.625 --> 27:08.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other people physically.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: This is a little
more like soccer
hooliganism to me. It's a group
of people

27:10.262 --> 27:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who like violence. They tend to
be young men.
And Trump happens to generate
this sort of

27:14.766 --> 27:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
excitement that gives them a
pretext.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

27:18.403 --> 27:20.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Earlier in the program, we had a
conversation
about the weak jobs report, the
weak recovery.

27:20.606 --> 27:24.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was actually an
interesting clip
that I want to play from the
town hall that

27:24.309 --> 27:27.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gwen Ifill moderated with the
president in
Elkhart, Indiana.

27:27.846 --> 27:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he was asked by someone,
insightfully,
if there's something that you
could change,

27:31.550 --> 27:33.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what would you change, here's
what he said.

27:33.418 --> 27:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I think the thing I would have
probably done

27:38.757 --> 27:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
differently is, I would have
tried to describe
earlier to the American people
how serious

27:50.402 --> 27:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the recession was going to be,
which is -- which
would have hopefully allowed us
to have an

27:57.476 --> 28:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even bigger response than we
did.

28:00.512 --> 28:01.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark?

28:01.413 --> 28:03.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think he's
right.

28:03.515 --> 28:09.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the 21st century,
the first
eight years of the 21st century,
by Barack

28:09.521 --> 28:14.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama's election, there was a
net loss in
the creation of private jobs in
the United

28:14.293 --> 28:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States. I mean, so, for him to
really make
the case then, what we were
addressing then

28:19.798 --> 28:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the crisis, the financial
crisis, people
losing their homes, in addition
to losing

28:24.002 --> 28:28.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their jobs and losing their life
savings,
but there was something
seriously wrong with

28:28.440 --> 28:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy, and it probably --
it was the
time when he could make the case
-- or should

28:32.344 --> 28:39.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have made the case -- for a
massive infrastructure,
for great public works
initiatives, to really

28:39.451 --> 28:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generate the economy in a
bigger, far more
bold way than he did.

28:43.922 --> 28:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Politically,
was that even
possible at the time?

28:46.224 --> 28:49.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I don't think so.
I think the
country cared as much as it
could over the

28:49.695 --> 28:51.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stimulus package.

28:51.463 --> 28:54.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we all knew how serious
it was at
the time. Everyone was in a
full-bore panic

28:54.132 --> 29:01.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2008, 2009. I do think they
could have
targeted the stimulus a little
differently.

29:01.573 --> 29:06.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we're dealing with
now is this
long-term lack of people in the
labor force,

29:06.812 --> 29:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as David Wessel was saying. And
so there's
a lot of people who just not --
are not in

29:09.948 --> 29:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the habit of getting up, whose
skills have
become rusty.

29:12.718 --> 29:16.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when you have got people
who want to
hire, they still can't find
anybody. And if

29:16.688 --> 29:21.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we had taken some of the
stimulus money and
done some long-term investments
in that, maybe

29:21.159 --> 29:24.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would have had some effect
on the labor
market, given people a few more
skills.

29:24.630 --> 29:30.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have to say, overall,
everyone had criticism
about the stimulus, the Fed's
reaction. Compared

29:30.469 --> 29:36.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to real-world countries, the
United States
got out of the recession faster
and better

29:36.141 --> 29:37.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than just about every other
country.

29:37.976 --> 29:41.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think historians will look
back -- and
we all have criticisms -- and
think that both

29:41.380 --> 29:45.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Bush administration, the
Obama administration,
and the Fed did a realistically
decent job.

29:45.917 --> 29:47.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

29:47.786 --> 29:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, a must-read was this
tiny paper
from Janesville, Wisconsin, I
think, a gazette,

29:52.257 --> 29:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right, where there was an op-ed.
This is where
-- I think we have a quote we
can put up on

29:56.361 --> 29:58.330 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
screen.

29:58.363 --> 30:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Paul Ryan finally gave
his endorsement:
"It's no secret that he and I
have our differences,

30:02.000 --> 30:05.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the reality is, on the
issues that make
up our agenda, we have more
common ground

30:05.203 --> 30:07.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than disagreement."

30:07.039 --> 30:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is somebody who was almost,
looks like,
kicked dragging and screaming
into this word,

30:11.543 --> 30:15.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endorsement. And at the same
time, the next
day, today, he comes out and
says, listen,

30:15.781 --> 30:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't agree with what the
presumptive nominee
is doing and saying about a
judge in a case

30:21.319 --> 30:22.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's being litigated.

30:23.021 --> 30:30.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Paul Ryan
obviously cares more
about the House majority than he
does his

30:30.662 --> 30:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legacy as a disciple of Jack
Kemp and the
-- his mentor and in many
respects his idol

30:37.469 --> 30:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
politically. I think that's the
calculation
he has made.

30:42.841 --> 30:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a man who is
close to Mitt
Romney. Donald Trump calls Mitt
Romney a loser,

30:48.847 --> 30:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
walks like a penguin, ridicules
him, just
terribly offensive and vulgar
stuff about

30:54.352 --> 30:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him. But Paul Ryan knows that,
if there's
going to be a Republican
majority -- or is

30:59.858 --> 31:04.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convinced if there is going to
be a Republican
majority next January, that the
only way to

31:04.329 --> 31:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do it, he needs Trump voters to
vote for Republican
candidates.

31:07.966 --> 31:15.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's made this deal, sadly
for him, because
he's going to be spending the
next five months

31:15.507 --> 31:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- speaker of the judge case, do
you agree
with what Donald Trump said
today in Boise,

31:20.545 --> 31:24.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Idaho? Did you agree what he
said yesterday
in Hartford, Connecticut? That's
-- he has

31:24.349 --> 31:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got a steady diet of answering
phone calls
and questions about does he
agree and where

31:29.121 --> 31:30.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he does disagree.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have heard
that Karl
Rove had a meeting with Trump.

31:32.557 --> 31:35.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Does this just mean that
basically the Republicans
are all just going to get in
line and say,

31:35.694 --> 31:37.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all right, this is our guy,
we're going to
have to back him?

31:37.529 --> 31:40.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, it looks like
-- it looks
that way. They won't be happen,
but they will

31:40.866 --> 31:42.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, morally, it was a sad
day for Paul
Ryan to do that. I don't think
his principles

31:45.537 --> 31:50.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are there in what he said. I
think, politically,
it was also a sad day. If Donald
Trump hangs

31:50.075 --> 31:54.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in and is competitive in the
fall, then maybe
what Paul Ryan did will be good
for the House

31:54.479 --> 31:56.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

31:56.314 --> 32:00.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But Donald Trump is the
definition of downside.
Lots of bad things could happen,
and he could

32:00.452 --> 32:04.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do horribly. And if he does
horribly in the
fall, it would have been nice if
Republicans

32:04.923 --> 32:07.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could say, we have got some
distance between
us and that guy.

32:07.859 --> 32:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you could get a lot of
people who would
not vote for Donald Trump be a
lot happier

32:11.830 --> 32:14.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about voting for Republicans
down-ballot.
So, I think some distance would
have been

32:14.733 --> 32:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
better than this plea for unity.

32:16.568 --> 32:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I would just
add one thing,
Hari. And that is, I don't think
Republicans

32:20.672 --> 32:22.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are falling in.

32:22.474 --> 32:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there was sort of a post
his victory
lap. And people -- I think you
have seen a

32:28.246 --> 32:34.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deafening silence this week
among Republicans.
After Senator -- Secretary
Clinton's speech,

32:34.786 --> 32:39.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was no rush of surrogates
to defend
him. There was no Chairman Bob
Corker of the

32:39.491 --> 32:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Foreign Relations Committee come
out saying,
this is unfair, Donald Trump
makes sense.

32:43.695 --> 32:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is very much the lone ranger
on the judge.
I mean, there has been nobody
who has stood

32:48.233 --> 32:55.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with him as he has accused this
judge of having
Mexican heritage somehow
influencing his rulings

32:55.073 --> 32:57.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the Trump University case.

32:57.542 --> 33:01.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a man who was a federal
prosecutor.
There was a death contract put
on him, or

33:01.947 --> 33:08.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a kill contract, by a drug
cartel he was prosecuting
before his appointment to the
judgeship.

33:08.653 --> 33:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He -- I think Trump is basically
by himself
this week among other
Republicans.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: The Republicans
have eyes.

33:16.628 --> 33:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has had a very bad week, a
really bad
week, the Trump University,
those comments,

33:21.099 --> 33:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the riots, the Hillary Clinton
speech. This
is not a guy who's sort of on
the offensive

33:25.804 --> 33:28.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anymore. And Republicans can see
that. But
that doesn't mean they're not
going to say,

33:28.974 --> 33:32.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oh, yes, I'm basically endorsing
him, even
if they do it from a small

HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's take a
-- that speech
that you guys are referencing
seemed like

33:36.214 --> 33:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new line of attack that the
Clinton campaign
has picked up on, because
previous attacks

33:41.253 --> 33:43.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and I don't know if this is
going to be
effective or not -- but didn't
seem to work

33:43.855 --> 33:45.156 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

33:45.190 --> 33:48.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's take a look at the video.

33:48.059 --> 33:50.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
This is not someone who should
ever have the

33:50.562 --> 33:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear codes, because it's not
hard to imagine
Donald Trump leading us into a
war just because

33:57.936 --> 34:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
somebody got under his very thin
skin.

34:00.839 --> 34:01.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

34:01.940 --> 34:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Will this
work?

34:03.675 --> 34:05.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think it will
work.

34:05.844 --> 34:10.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, first of all, Secretary
Clinton was
better yesterday than I have
seen her in the

34:10.248 --> 34:13.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entire campaign. She seemed more
comfortable
doing it.

34:13.785 --> 34:19.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She -- if you recall, John Kerry
was put on
the defensive in the '04
campaign by saying,

34:19.658 --> 34:26.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually, I did vote for the $87
billion in
aid to Afghanistan and Iraq
before I voted

34:26.097 --> 34:27.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against it.

34:27.933 --> 34:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's nothing like hanging
someone on their
own words. Mitt Romney had 47
percent people,

34:31.937 --> 34:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't have to worry about them
because they're
dependent on the government, in
2012.

34:37.075 --> 34:39.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's what she did it
yesterday. And she
did it effectively. She did it
with Trump's

34:39.678 --> 34:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own words. And I don't think
there's any question
she elevated the spirits of
dispirited Democrats.

34:46.351 --> 34:53.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's an alarm, an
exhortation to Sanders
voters that this campaign is
very important.

34:53.959 --> 34:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it probably also reaches
to California
primary voters, where she's in a
-- the fight

34:59.664 --> 35:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of her life for California next
Tuesday.

35:02.434 --> 35:07.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, she got under
Donald Trump's
skin. So, I think, on all four
counts, it

35:07.672 --> 35:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably was a very positive day
for Secretary
Clinton.

35:11.042 --> 35:13.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I agree it
was her best
speech of the campaign, I
thought.

35:13.678 --> 35:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would add a few more
counts. It was
very good for independent
voters, because

35:17.515 --> 35:21.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it is not an ideological
left-right attack
on Trump. It's, this guy's
unstable. And that's

35:21.920 --> 35:24.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something -- doesn't matter what
you believe.
You can buy that argument.

35:25.023 --> 35:29.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she did it in a way without
sinking to
his level. And that was
something -- a problem

35:29.627 --> 35:33.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Marco Rubio and other
opponents have
had. They get in the gutter with
him. But

35:33.398 --> 35:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she did it from a haughty,
contemptuous, serious
way, really. And so I thought it
was quite

35:38.470 --> 35:40.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a compelling speech.

35:40.238 --> 35:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Technically,
that's the
kind of -- the meta look, is,
essentially,

35:42.674 --> 35:47.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you have to change the tone
of the debate,
does it have to become more
coarse, does it

35:47.112 --> 35:48.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have to become more personal?

35:48.913 --> 35:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is technically before
they're both
presumptive nominees or leaders.
But they're

35:53.685 --> 35:57.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not even the candidates yet, and
we're already
seeing this basically go
negative.

35:57.188 --> 36:00.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, we're going
to see that
when you have two unpopular
candidates, as

36:00.191 --> 36:02.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we're going to see.

36:02.093 --> 36:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how you go negative and
whether she would
get dragged down was the real
challenge. And

36:04.596 --> 36:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she struck the right note. In
politics, the
lows are lower than the highs
are highs. When

36:08.767 --> 36:13.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody makes a mistake, it's
much worse
than the benefits when they do
something right.

36:13.304 --> 36:19.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so people, voters are very
nervous about
politicians who seem unstable
and disordered.

36:19.177 --> 36:22.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Trump -- she's painting
Trump as unstable
and disordered. And that plucks
at something

36:22.447 --> 36:25.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that genuinely has had a lot of
resonance
in fall elections.

36:25.617 --> 36:26.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

36:28.553 --> 36:32.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, I think it's going to be
that kind of
a campaign. It's -- you want the
focus on

36:32.057 --> 36:36.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
your opponent and your
opponent's shortcomings.
And I think she put it squarely
there yesterday.

36:36.194 --> 36:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Mark Shields,
David Brooks, thanks so much.

36:49.441 --> 36:53.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Next Tuesday, San Francisco
residents will
vote on a ballot measure
regarding funding

36:53.311 --> 36:56.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to preserve and restore Bay Area
wetlands.

36:56.181 --> 37:00.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Many in the tech and
environmental communities,
including youth volunteers, have
lined up

37:00.285 --> 37:05.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to support the bill. However,
not all voters
believe that the proposed tax is
the solution.

37:05.824 --> 37:10.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

37:29.547 --> 37:33.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
native plants into this area of

37:33.251 --> 37:39.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONIA ARONSON: They are here

37:39.390 --> 37:44.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
community to restore the
thousands of acres
of wetlands surrounding the bay.

37:45.029 --> 37:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also educate volunteers and
student groups
like this one about the crucial
role that

37:51.069 --> 37:53.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wetlands play in sustaining the
bay.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS LA: We should be connected
to our environment,
because that's what we should be
worried about

37:59.310 --> 38:05.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first. Without the world,
without nature,
we wouldn't be here. And we're
slowly doing

38:05.450 --> 38:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a better job at sustaining
ourselves, but,
so far, we kind of screwed up
over the last

38:12.223 --> 38:13.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
200 years.

38:13.925 --> 38:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONIA ARONSON: In that time, the
wetlands
that surround the bay have been
disappearing

38:18.163 --> 38:23.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at an alarming rate, which could
endanger
not just the local ecosystem,
but the worldwide

38:23.768 --> 38:27.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effort to address global warming
and sea level
rise.

38:27.472 --> 38:33.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY OIKAWA, University of
California, Berkeley:
So, originally, this was all
wetlands. About

38:33.444 --> 38:40.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
150 years ago, people came in
and drained
those wetlands and started
growing crops like

38:40.385 --> 38:42.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
corn and alfalfa.

38:42.187 --> 38:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONIA ARONSON: Patty Oikawa, a
postdoctoral
researcher at U.C. Berkeley, is
studying the

38:46.257 --> 38:51.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unique ability of wetlands to
store carbon,
a trait that can offset the
effects of climate

38:51.996 --> 38:52.931 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATTY OIKAWA: It's definitely
carbon-rich.

38:54.799 --> 38:58.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONIA ARONSON: Oikawa and her
team are here
in the San Joaquin River Delta
east of San

38:58.536 --> 39:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Francisco measuring levels of
carbon beneath
the surface of this wetland.

39:03.141 --> 39:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the process, they are getting
a sense of
just how effective this
ecosystem can be.

39:07.712 --> 39:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY OIKAWA: What we can now
say is that
we're taking up approximately
400 or 500 grams

39:15.620 --> 39:22.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of carbon per square meter per
year. And that's
a really high amount of carbon
storage, equivalent

39:22.160 --> 39:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to like a tropical rain forest
even. It's
extremely productive.

39:25.997 --> 39:30.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONIA ARONSON: Oikawa's research
shows how
the wetlands play a crucial role
in sustaining

39:30.201 --> 39:35.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the health of coastal areas, but
due to continued
development, these wetlands are
in greater

39:35.273 --> 39:36.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
danger than ever.

39:37.008 --> 39:42.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY OIKAWA: These systems tend
to be near
rivers or near the coast, which
are areas

39:42.413 --> 39:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are highly impacted by
people in California,
highly developed areas, which is
why we have

39:48.319 --> 39:49.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lost 90 percent of them.

39:49.988 --> 39:54.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONIA ARONSON: Today, San
Francisco Bay is
only one-third its original size
and only

39:54.592 --> 39:57.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a fraction of the original
wetlands remain.

39:57.962 --> 40:02.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this degradation has not
gone unnoticed.
A new ballot initiative being
pushed by local

40:02.967 --> 40:10.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
environmental and business
groups may help.
This June, voters in nine Bay
Area counties

40:10.174 --> 40:15.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will vote on Measure AA, a
proposed parcel
tax to raise funds for wetlands
restoration

40:15.780 --> 40:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and other work to protect the
bay.

40:18.650 --> 40:25.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Save the Bay is one of the
organizations pushing
this idea. David Lewis is Save
the Bay's executive

40:25.056 --> 40:26.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
director:

40:26.791 --> 40:28.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID LEWIS, Executive Director,
Save the
Bay: We have more than 30,000
acres that are

40:28.593 --> 40:32.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waiting to be restored to tidal
marsh. And
the missing ingredient is
funding. With the

40:32.897 --> 40:39.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funds generated from this parcel
tax, from
Measure AA, we will be able to
accelerate

40:39.370 --> 40:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wetland restoration and get all
these benefits
in the next 10 or 20 years.

40:44.375 --> 40:49.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONIA ARONSON: Measure AA
proposes a $12-per-year
property tax on each parcel of
land in the

40:49.681 --> 40:52.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nine counties surrounding the
San Francisco
Bay.

40:52.850 --> 40:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would raise $500 million for
bay restoration
over the next 20 years. The
measure requires

40:59.590 --> 41:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a two-thirds majority to pass, a
high bar
for a new tax, but a broad
coalition of support

41:05.396 --> 41:11.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has gathered behind the measure,
including
some of the biggest companies in
Silicon Valley.

The Silicon Valley Leadership
Group, a trade

more than 390

41:16.207 --> 41:21.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
businesses, including Apple and
Google, is
advocating for passage of the
parcel tax.

41:21.913 --> 41:26.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some groups believe that the
parcel tax
doesn't represent the diverse
interests of

41:26.250 --> 41:27.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

WENDY LACK, Contra Costa
Taxpayers Association:
We don't believe it's good value
for taxpayers.

41:36.227 --> 41:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lack of oversight
regarding how
the funds would be spent. In
fact, we don't

41:41.699 --> 41:48.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know how it will be spent. And
it expands
regional government. We believe
that government

41:48.172 --> 41:54.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is best when it's local,
accessible, directly
elected, and available to
people.

point out that
the $12 parcel tax would make a

42:00.051 --> 42:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay the same amount as the owner
of a San
Francisco high-rise, or a
Silicon Valley corporate

42:05.390 --> 42:07.291 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

42:07.325 --> 42:11.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But local government officials,
such as Libby
Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland,
say voters should

42:11.496 --> 42:14.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support Measure AA for the
benefit of future
generations.

42:14.399 --> 42:18.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIBBY SCHAAF, Mayor of Oakland,
California:
We have got to pay attention to
our wetlands

42:18.603 --> 42:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how it sustains an ecosystem
that is critical
not just for environmental
health, but for

42:25.977 --> 42:32.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our health, and particularly for
the future
generations that deserve to
inherit a Bay

42:32.583 --> 42:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Area that is a healthy Bay Area.

42:36.120 --> 42:42.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONIA ARONSON: Back at the Save
the Bay work
day, youth are already working
to create a

42:42.360 --> 42:45.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
healthier bay, one native plant
at a time.

42:45.396 --> 42:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS LA: I know that a lot of
people are
passionate, especially young
people. We can't

42:50.134 --> 42:54.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reverse what we have done, but
what can slow
it down, and maybe find a
solution.

42:54.305 --> 43:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SONIA ARONSON: I'm Sonia Aronson
for the "PBS
NewsHour" Student Reporting Labs
in Oakland,

43:02.780 --> 43:06.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
California.

43:06.050 --> 43:16.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight: on food,
family, and knowing who you are,
a "NewsHour"

43:16.227 --> 43:18.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bookshelf conversation with chef
Eddie Huang.

43:18.629 --> 43:20.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown is back to get a
taste.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what do we
have here?

43:21.999 --> 43:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG, Author, "Double Cup
Love": This
is a new bao. This is our
dumpling bao, which

43:25.303 --> 43:31.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I like a lot. So you could try
that one. Then
this is the Chairman Bao that
we're most known

43:31.576 --> 43:33.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for.

43:33.311 --> 43:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: These days, Eddie
Huang is
known for a lot of things. His
hole-in-the-wall

43:36.814 --> 43:42.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
restaurant in downtown
Manhattan, Baohaus,
packs in crowds for lunch and
late into the

43:42.720 --> 43:48.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evening. The specialty here is
pork buns,
or baos, but Huang says it's
really about

43:48.759 --> 43:50.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

43:50.561 --> 43:53.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: I know the food's
great and I
love it and it represents so
much of who I

43:53.965 --> 43:59.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
am, but what I'm really pushing
is community
in New York, because I think the
purpose of

43:59.437 --> 44:01.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restaurants is to distribute
culture.

44:01.606 --> 44:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Distribute
culture?

44:02.807 --> 44:03.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EDDIE HUANG: Yes.

44:03.741 --> 44:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which means food
and more.

44:05.576 --> 44:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: Food and, you know,
just personality
and values and the way we're
treating each

44:11.716 --> 44:13.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other.

44:13.518 --> 44:18.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: He's now
exploring global food
culture on a global scale, Eddie
style, in

44:18.623 --> 44:23.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Viceland TV show called
"Huang's World."

44:23.261 --> 44:26.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Outside the restaurant recently,
we talked
about Eddie Huang's world.

44:26.297 --> 44:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: I think all my work
is really
rebelling against the matrix
that's trying

44:31.602 --> 44:38.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to normalize us and create
monoculture. And
the funniest, most rewarding
part about it

44:38.676 --> 44:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, all I have to do is be
myself. And that's
all anybody has to do.
Everybody's kind of

44:43.180 --> 44:44.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
strange, you know?

44:44.448 --> 44:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But when you were
growing up,
that was hard.

44:46.183 --> 44:47.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: It's very hard.

44:47.118 --> 44:48.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because you were
different.

44:48.786 --> 44:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: Yes, it's very hard
when you
are in a community that doesn't
allow you

44:54.158 --> 44:55.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be yourself.

44:56.027 --> 44:59.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Huang grew up in
Orlando, Florida,
the son of Taiwanese immigrants
who opened

44:59.497 --> 45:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Western-style steakhouse and
other restaurants.

45:02.733 --> 45:07.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On one Vice episode, he went
back home to
celebrate Chinese new year.

45:07.038 --> 45:12.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: Everything I
learned is from
my mom. I said to myself when I
was like 12

45:12.410 --> 45:16.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or 13, man, I have got to start
learning all
these dishes and remembering
them.

45:16.113 --> 45:19.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I don't teach him. He
steal from me.

45:19.483 --> 45:21.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
EDDIE HUANG: Oh!

45:21.252 --> 45:24.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He wrote of his
childhood in
the memoir "Fresh Off the Boat,"
but there

45:25.022 --> 45:28.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was much darkness along with the
humor, as
he struggled for acceptance.

45:28.893 --> 45:33.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: In Orlando growing
up, it was
extremely hard. I had to fight
just to like

45:33.531 --> 45:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stand up on my own two feet. I
got pushed
down in school. People always
wanted to fight

45:38.736 --> 45:41.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me. People always had something
to say about
Chinamen.

45:41.305 --> 45:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember playing little league
baseball
and these kids, after every
practice and game,

45:46.243 --> 45:50.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would run in a circle around me
saying ching-chong,
Eddie Huang sitting on a jungle
gong. And

45:50.781 --> 45:54.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like, you know, everybody
laughed. And I was
like, this sucks.

45:54.885 --> 46:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The ABC sitcom
based on the
book was mostly played for
laughs, too much

46:01.258 --> 46:06.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so for Huang, who was involved
early on, but
later publicly criticized the
program.

46:06.230 --> 46:11.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: I wasn't happy with
the sitcom.
Even sometimes now, when I just
read about

46:11.569 --> 46:18.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sitcom and the references
they're using,
you know, it -- it will bother
me at times,

46:18.743 --> 46:22.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but I have been able to
understand the purpose
that that show serves.

46:22.713 --> 46:24.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which is what?

46:24.849 --> 46:30.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: We just needed to
get on base.
You know, we needed to get on
base. There

46:30.321 --> 46:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't a sitcom with Asians that
you could
watch anywhere on American
television.

46:37.061 --> 46:44.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't have representation.
And while a
sitcom isn't the end-all/be-all
of identity

46:44.201 --> 46:46.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and representation in America,
it's a big
step.

46:46.570 --> 46:51.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Huang traveled to
China for
his new book, a second memoir,
"Double Cup

46:51.475 --> 46:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Love." The subtitle says it all,
"On the Trail
of Family, Food, and Broken
Hearts in China."

46:57.381 --> 47:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: I kind of wanted to
go home and
see if I was actually Chinese.

47:03.454 --> 47:06.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You wanted to see
if you were
Chinese?

47:06.123 --> 47:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: I wanted to go back
to the motherland
and see, like, if I fit their
definition of

47:10.594 --> 47:13.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what it meant to be Chinese.
Like, would I
be accepted?

47:13.631 --> 47:18.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a lot of ways, too, it's like
cooking engagement
chicken for your, like,
ancestral history.

47:19.003 --> 47:24.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know what I mean? Like, it
was my proposal
to my Chinese identity. Like, am
I good enough?

47:24.642 --> 47:25.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Will you have me?

47:25.810 --> 47:27.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what
happened? What did
you find?

47:27.178 --> 47:29.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: A funny thing
happened.

47:29.080 --> 47:36.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a very Jedi maneuver that
China pulled
on me, which is, when you ask a
question,

47:36.053 --> 47:40.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it didn't give you an answer.
The answer was,
really, you're asking the wrong
question.

47:40.257 --> 47:43.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every dish you make, it's almost
problem-solving,
right?

47:43.661 --> 47:47.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was almost asking, like,
am I solving
this problem like a Chinese
person?

47:47.064 --> 47:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:48.866 --> 47:51.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: It's like, dude,
you are -- you
are Chinese. The problem is, how
do I make

47:51.635 --> 47:56.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beef noodle soup? You came up
with your solution.
It's delicious, it's great, and
it's unlike

47:56.107 --> 48:00.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anybody else's solution here in
China, because
your experience has been
different.

48:00.111 --> 48:06.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, you even
say: I'm Chinese,
but I grew up in America. What
if I'm a fraud?

48:06.350 --> 48:11.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why is that such a theme for
you?

48:11.355 --> 48:14.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: Because, in a lot
of ways, I
feel like this generation of
Asian-Americans

48:14.425 --> 48:16.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are frontiersmen.

48:16.260 --> 48:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're the first generation, a
lot of times,
that's been born here and has to
deal with

48:22.933 --> 48:31.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not growing up in your ancestral
homeland
or something close to it and
trying to reconcile

48:32.009 --> 48:36.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. And because you don't have
role models,
because you don't have people,
you know, that

48:36.947 --> 48:40.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have done it before you, there's
a bit of
fear.

48:40.684 --> 48:46.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a bit of like, am I
doing this right?
Am I a fraud? And I think it is
one of those

48:46.624 --> 48:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essential questions that every
Asian-American
kid this generation asks
themselves.

48:50.194 --> 48:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Where do you see
the portrayal
of Asian-Americans in popular
culture in the

48:56.801 --> 48:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
media today? Has that improved?

48:59.203 --> 49:06.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: I think that we're
finally starting
to ask very important questions
about accuracy,

49:06.911 --> 49:09.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
authenticity, and specificity.

49:09.046 --> 49:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're a writer,
cook, television
personality, I guess. How do you
-- how do

49:16.220 --> 49:17.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you define yourself these days?

49:17.988 --> 49:21.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE HUANG: yes, I tell people
a lot like
I really love Emerson's
"American Scholar."

49:22.026 --> 49:23.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I learned a lot from it.

49:23.160 --> 49:24.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Ralph Waldo
Emerson.

49:24.161 --> 49:25.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EDDIE HUANG: Yes.

49:25.963 --> 49:30.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I remember he said, you're
not a farmer,
you're a man farming. And so I
have never

49:30.267 --> 49:35.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowed people to identify me
as, you're a
chef, or you're a writer, or
you're a host.

49:35.673 --> 49:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's not pigeonhole me. And I
hope other
people will do that as well for
themselves,

49:42.246 --> 49:47.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because you're much more than
just the things
that you do, much more than just
the work,

49:47.051 --> 49:48.819 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know?

49:48.853 --> 49:56.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: From Baohaus in
Lower Manhattan,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

49:56.827 --> 50:05.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A quick news
update before
we go tonight.

50:05.769 --> 50:09.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that the family of
boxing legend
Muhammad Ali is gathering at his
bedside at

50:09.974 --> 50:15.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Phoenix area hospital. The
74-year-old former
heavyweight champion was
hospitalized Thursday

50:15.045 --> 50:19.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a respiratory condition
complicated by
the Parkinson's disease he's
been battling

50:19.516 --> 50:21.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for three decades.

50:21.452 --> 50:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Some 125
American troops lost their lives
in two offensives

50:27.391 --> 50:32.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the city of Fallujah in 2004.
Now a much
smaller number of U.S. forces
are back for

50:32.763 --> 50:37.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what promises to be another ugly
battle. Foreign
affairs correspondent Margaret
Warner examines

50:37.334 --> 50:41.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why the return to Fallujah has
provoked some
anger and frustration.

50:41.972 --> 50:46.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

50:46.310 --> 50:50.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington
Week," which airs tonight on
PBS, and has

50:50.414 --> 50:51.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this preview -- Gwen.

50:51.815 --> 50:54.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Hari.

50:54.151 --> 50:59.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we dig deep into the
state of the
2016 race, what Hillary Clinton
is saying

50:59.223 --> 51:03.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Donald Trump, what Trump
has to say
about Clinton, and what Bernie
Sanders has

51:03.594 --> 51:08.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say about them both. Does any
of it matter?
Plus, more on my conversation
with President

51:08.766 --> 51:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama this week in Elkhart,
Indiana -- all
that tonight on "Washington
Week" -- Hari.

51:13.971 --> 51:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Gwen.

51:15.706 --> 51:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend"
tomorrow: inside
the growing economy of the
world's largest

51:20.978 --> 51:22.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syrian refugee camp.

51:22.947 --> 51:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: An hour's drive from
Jordan's capital
of Amman, this family-owned
pastry shop called

51:29.753 --> 51:33.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Farouk Sweets (ph) looks like a
typical Middle
Eastern bakery.

51:33.791 --> 51:40.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Customers stock up on pastries
for the weekend.
In the back, five bakers are
busy filling

51:40.064 --> 51:47.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
large wedding orders. What's
unusual is that
this shop is inside Zaatari, the
largest Syrian

51:47.438 --> 51:52.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
refugee camp in the world,
spread over three
square miles of desert.

51:52.943 --> 51:57.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When they first arrived,
refugees thought
it would be for just a few
weeks, maybe a

51:57.114 --> 52:03.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
month. But that stay has lasted
longer than
anyone expected, five years and
counting.

52:04.021 --> 52:10.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means, for many, opening up
small businesses,
just like they did back home.
There's a supermarket,

52:10.995 --> 52:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a pizza place, a falafel stand,
a gardening
shop, and a store to rent bridal
gowns.

52:16.600 --> 52:19.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's
tomorrow night on
"PBS NewsHour Weekend."

52:20.004 --> 52:25.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday with
a look at the new kicks on Route
66, the iconic

52:25.209 --> 52:27.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. highway from Chicago to
Santa Monica.

52:27.578 --> 52:31.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Hari
Sreenivasan. Have a great
weekend. Thank you,

52:31.181 --> 52:36.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and good night.

52:36.520 --> 52:41.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and good night.
