called Inside Putin's
Russia with the help of the
Pulitzer Center on Crisis

Reporting producer Zac Fannin
and I travel to more than a
dozen cities, conducted 40

00:13.166 --> 00:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interviews and were arrested
twice will report on
Russian propaganda Russia's

00:17.800 --> 00:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposition Russians who join
Isis and a tense relationship
with the US our first

00:24.666 --> 00:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
story explores a new
Russian identity it's a
combination of religion old

00:27.233 --> 00:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Russian traditions and
rediscovered patriotism
this new identity helps

00:31.666 --> 00:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
explain a lot about how
today's Russia thinks how
President Putin acts and why

00:36.200 --> 00:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he remains popular we begin
our series in the southern
city of Krassner it is

00:46.366 --> 00:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sunday morning and Russia's
conservative South more
than 70 percent of Russians

00:51.033 --> 00:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or Orthodox Christian and
under President Vladimir
Putin the church has

00:54.633 --> 00:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
been revitalized arch
priest Ivan garmisch
is known as father John

01:01.633 --> 01:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he tells parishioners
there's only one way to be
a true Christian and he says

01:05.033 --> 01:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being a true Christian is the
only way to be a true Russian

01:07.800 --> 01:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so ghusl Moscow the state
and my faith are united
they can't be separated the

01:14.766 --> 01:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
values of the church and
the state coincide in
Russia faith is patriotic

01:20.266 --> 01:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Orthodox Church
criticizes liberal Western
values as heresies while

01:24.933 --> 01:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Orthodox priests bless
Russian weapons and endorse
Putin politically and

01:28.566 --> 01:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
personally the president's
faith increases his
popularity well he is a

01:35.500 --> 01:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
religious man and he
takes part in the divine
worship with the people in

01:37.266 --> 01:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
churches what the
president is doing what
the government is doing

01:41.000 --> 01:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of course we support it
because he acts conscientiously
and truthfully today's

01:47.966 --> 01:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
re-energized Orthodox
Church helps create pride
in the shared religion

01:51.366 --> 01:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is an historic Russian
symbols like Cossacks help
create pride and shared

01:59.400 --> 02:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
traditions 500 years ago
Cossacks became the Russian
Czars henchmen they were

02:06.333 --> 02:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
famous and feared and
helped police the Russian
empires borders the Soviets

02:12.300 --> 02:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Russia restores them Cossacks

an annual parade I believe
Russia should be governed by

02:22.100 --> 02:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tradition not the rule
of law not of only the
nation that has kept its

02:29.100 --> 02:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
traditions and honors them
more than the law deserves
respect the strength of the

02:34.866 --> 02:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nation is in its traditions
for 17 years Vladimir Gromov
led the regional Cossack

if it wasn't for President
Putin Russia as a state

03:01.700 --> 03:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be struggling through
the toughest times now and
possibly may have ceased

03:04.633 --> 03:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to exist only Putin has
saved the state from total
collapse and in return

03:10.733 --> 03:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cossacks do what
they feel saves putin

80% of his eyesight well
our generation if the

03:50.266 --> 03:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime can't suppress
civil protest through
legal means they punish the

03:54.100 --> 03:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people through affiliated
associations like the
Cossacks the regime acts

03:58.366 --> 04:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through them why have the
authorities crack down so
much what I see in Russia

04:05.300 --> 04:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statehood comes first and
human rights come last
they use any means to prove

04:11.566 --> 04:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state is the most
important more important than
a human the idea that the

04:17.033 --> 04:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state is more important
than the people is actually
not new Russians have long

04:19.033 --> 04:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had a collective identity
for us the men is collective
concept we consider

04:26.000 --> 04:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ourselves to be the part of
the whole so to be Russian
means to share the same

Alexandra Dugan inspired
the Kremlin ideology he
says Russia's collective

04:43.733 --> 04:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
identity comes from
patriotism projection of

rules Hooten taps into

diesel is organic it is not

04:55.733 --> 05:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
artificial Empire or
state is not something
additional artificial

05:02.166 --> 05:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it is our breasts our
skin our organic way of life

05:08.566 --> 05:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today's kremlin uses that
patriotism to try and
unite the population and

05:11.533 --> 05:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
convince them only a powerful

more than just exactly as

05:44.666 --> 05:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
usual it's exactly
what you are supporting

supporting any kind of

05:52.666 --> 05:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against Putin my words
are a fear of what you are
doing it is near and you

05:59.800 --> 06:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are right so much
because you are doing
the same thing against us

Crimea Russia helped install
separatist leaders who

rushed through a referendum
that led to Crimea's

patriotism and imperial
history he said the West
had been subjugating

Russia and Russia was finally
demanding respect yes or
no for assuming if you

06:46.233 --> 06:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
compress the spring all the

snap back hard Russia is

06:49.100 --> 06:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an independent active
participant in international
affairs like other

06:53.100 --> 06:56.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
countries it has its own
national interest that
need to be taken into

06:56.533 --> 07:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
account and respected it
is impossible to overstate
how transformative eastern

07:06.033 --> 07:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ukraine and here Crimea
have been in recent Russian
memory after the Crimea

07:10.933 --> 07:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
annexation Putin's
popularity spiked to nearly
90 percent Russians told

07:15.600 --> 07:19.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

they felt like a superpower

intense battle mortars and
shells are raining in our
direction Solomon went to

07:39.333 --> 07:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

those are the people with

there was a lot of information
about how people were

08:16.166 --> 08:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
simply getting beaten and
killed but as anyway I must
Russian media exaggerated

08:20.800 --> 08:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yes even using an actress
to play a victim we
know she was an actress

08:25.500 --> 08:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because she appeared in
unrelated pro-russian
stories as three entirely

08:29.200 --> 08:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different people that
disinformation campaign
convinces the Kremlin's critics

08:36.166 --> 08:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the new Russian identity
is manufactured a product
of deception and repression

08:41.300 --> 08:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes that repression
shows up in masks guns

good the film is together
so this all together
we call one big act of

09:10.033 --> 09:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
intimidation the purpose
is to silence some and keep
others ignorant turn them

09:14.233 --> 09:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into zombies so they think
the same thing these are
the necessary conditions

09:17.966 --> 09:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in order for the people to
be loyal to their government
but do you acknowledge

09:21.200 --> 09:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that that is the majority of the
population who feels that way

09:25.266 --> 09:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
career synchronously of
course of course we can't
say that this is a stupid

09:29.366 --> 09:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
population or stupid people
they're just living in a
constellation of fear and

09:33.700 --> 09:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the propaganda machine
rolls over them like a
steamroller Umarov may accuse

09:38.566 --> 09:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin of manipulating the
population but under Putin
Russia has revitalized

09:42.866 --> 09:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
majority religion brought
back historic tradition

09:49.833 --> 09:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and projects power so until
there's an alternative
he'd considered the creator

09:54.766 --> 09:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and will remain the caretaker
of the new Russian identity
for years the Kremlin

10:01.066 --> 10:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the media it controls
have waged a multifaceted
information and

10:04.866 --> 10:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disinformation campaign
inside Russia and pointed
externally and it's

10:09.266 --> 10:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perceived adversaries and last
year that effort crescendoed
here during the u.s.

10:13.933 --> 10:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential campaign
so our second story is about the

publishing Dogu Sudarsan
in russia whoever controls

the media controls the
country and Saturday
night sir sir Gabriel EOS

10:25.900 --> 10:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Russia one if the country's

10:29.966 --> 10:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
most popular channel and
its state-owned do you think
that that means that you

10:33.933 --> 10:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a Russian perspective
when you report the
Russian perspective these a

12:41.933 --> 12:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against us I was getting
like hundreds of personal

12:49.133 --> 12:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me that then all the major

12:56.100 --> 13:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had to switch us off within

does not exist our system is

13:23.700 --> 13:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much more stable because
we we have much more much

if not the most qualified
but this isn't only about

13:37.200 --> 13:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shaping Russian opinion
guess we all considers

13:49.466 --> 13:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in let's think about
what's better to kill or
to persuade because if you

13:54.433 --> 13:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
weren't able to persuade
then you'll have to
kill if the politics of

13:58.800 --> 14:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

if you look at any station
you will see that what

14:26.733 --> 14:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people are reporting comes
from what they believe
in where they stand their

15:17.566 --> 15:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lie we're never trying

if we do have people

that are later found out
to be Holocaust deniers or

anything like that we
in middle immediately
put them onto a list of

15:33.933 --> 15:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people have rapport forbidden
from the air you are
telling me that people in

well believe me most of the

the west of the threat for
the West the biggest threat
in terms of information

15:45.266 --> 15:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes from that building
that is the headquarters
of the FSB successor to the

15:49.533 --> 15:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KGB during Soviet times
the KGB launched deliberate
disinformation campaign like

15:55.966 --> 15:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
planting the idea that President
Kennedy was killed by the CIA

15:58.133 --> 16:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today Western governments
accused the FSB of
launching the same kinds of

16:01.900 --> 16:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaigns except instead
of offering communism as
an ideological alternative

16:05.633 --> 16:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're waging a kind of

with more than a week of
embarrassing daily revelations
thanks to WikiLeaks

16:46.400 --> 16:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now these wiki leak release
have rocked the campaign
WikiLeaks has released what

16:50.933 --> 16:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appears to be transcripts

16:55.633 --> 17:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

anti-clinton talking points
and many of those talking

17:00.266 --> 17:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

18:54.033 --> 18:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you pretend it's not your

in Russian society all

18:58.133 --> 19:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the different parts of your

and what you're doing is

19:01.566 --> 19:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're pushing out in dozen
different languages on all
the different platforms

19:04.533 --> 19:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are one story and

dellavedova say to yourself
in January 2016 it was a
fake story that a Russian

German teenager had been
abducted and raped by Muslim

19:21.033 --> 19:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TV apparatus repeatedly
reporting false claims after
the German police had come

19:26.300 --> 19:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out and said there was no
abduction and there was no
rape but if the fake story

19:32.433 --> 19:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helps parts real protests
against German Chancellor
Merkel a frequent Putin

19:35.133 --> 19:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
critic but even though it
was fake Foreign Minister
Sergey Lavrov used it

19:39.100 --> 19:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to criticize one of Russia's
taught adversaries the
motivation behind the

19:42.633 --> 19:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign as a whole was
precisely to weaken Merkel
by amplifying this this

19:47.233 --> 19:50.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
very personalized story
about crimes committed
by in a vertical most

mackerels migrants we
investigate the stories
misrepresented by the mainstream

19:54.733 --> 19:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Russian propaganda machine
exploited a research

psychologist who argued
Google was manipulating
its results to favor

20:02.233 --> 20:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton so this is a
gentleman called dr. Robert
Epstein he came out with a

20:06.233 --> 20:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paper which said that by
altering the results of
a search engine you could

20:14.566 --> 20:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potentially alter people's
voting choices and Google
support for Clinton

20:18.566 --> 20:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is is really very strong
it was quickly debunked but
the different parts of the

20:25.500 --> 20:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian propaganda machine
echoed the story from
RT to State on website

20:29.366 --> 20:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sputnik to Russian trolls
this was a classic example
in which the different

20:33.533 --> 20:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parts of the machine were
amplifying each other
what you then had was the

20:37.566 --> 20:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
claim being picked up by a
number of larger conservative
media in the US it

20:44.533 --> 20:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Google is in the tank

20:51.000 --> 20:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well you've laundered you
literally I know that says
that the source has been

20:53.766 --> 20:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
laundered then candidate

now we don't know where he
got that from but we know

21:11.733 --> 21:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that to be an assertion
point for that story
were they crammed in this

21:15.666 --> 21:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information at that for
any purveyor of propaganda
your dream is to have some

high-value amplifier
amplifying you especially
if you can contrive that in

21:29.000 --> 21:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
such a way that you were
divorced from it how about
oh how about that next we

21:34.266 --> 21:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Americans might know
Dagestan because the Boston

by one estimate as many
as 5,000 Dagestan E's
or fighting for Isis we

22:03.866 --> 22:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
traveled to Dagestan to
try and understand why
so many Dagestan E's are

his wife Rashida understand

23:28.700 --> 23:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years ago her daughter
Miriam and her son Alyoshka
told her they were going on

vacation instead they
traveled with Miriam's

Isis who told mom they lied
to me about going there
I was so disappointed and

23:41.900 --> 23:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then I became afraid about
what could happen to them
she says this town is

23:46.433 --> 23:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pious but wasn't really
just enough for her daughter
did she feel judged by

23:53.033 --> 23:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
people in this society
the closest weapon yes
they gave her looks they

23:56.233 --> 23:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't like how she was
dressing they wanted her
to dress like everyone else

23:59.733 --> 24:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she wanted to dress the way
it's written for a Muslim
woman to dress kondakova

24:06.366 --> 24:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
believes that judgement
drove her daughter away
she reluctantly admits

24:09.166 --> 24:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that in Mosul her daughter
is happy raising her

25:55.033 --> 25:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
which creates waves of

has to be some sort of

26:28.400 --> 26:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
keeping people safe
requires limiting rights
and freedoms of certain

individuals it's probably worth
it my brother died in 1990

26:36.333 --> 26:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when someone threw a

know the freedom of one man

26:40.066 --> 26:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ends where the freedom of
another starts today the
violence is diminished but

26:47.033 --> 26:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's still religious
Muslims whose freedoms are
most often restricted this

26:53.266 --> 26:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mosque practices an austere and
aggressive form of Islam

26:55.366 --> 27:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it also rails against
government policy and that
makes it a police target after

27:02.066 --> 27:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
prayers police set up a
checkpoint officers must
meet a monthly quota of

27:05.200 --> 27:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
arrests leading to what
many call indiscriminate
- tensions including of

27:09.600 --> 27:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalists trying to tell
the mosque story we were
filming that scene from

27:14.466 --> 27:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the street - standing
on the sidewalk for only
about 90 seconds when

27:18.533 --> 27:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police came up and arrested
US they threw us into
their car they drove us to

27:22.200 --> 27:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the precinct they refused
to tell us why they were
arresting it and when we were

27:29.200 --> 27:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the station we thought
dozens of men have been
in that mock before also

27:33.333 --> 27:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arrested that is simply
how police here act thirty

Magomedov is the mosque

you saw yourself they arrest

27:43.500 --> 27:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people not because they're
suspicious but only because
they came to a mosque

27:47.100 --> 27:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you think that the
tactics that the police used
can help radicalize young

27:51.200 --> 27:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people here there is - of
course this is the thing
that provokes people since

27:56.066 --> 28:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
literally everyone can
be arrested not on the
basis of actual cause but

28:00.366 --> 28:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something totally subjective
then of course that
irritates and that helped

28:05.033 --> 28:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lead so many to Isis the

28:25.000 --> 28:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Syria this first of Allah
brothers doing it was the
right thing to do since

28:29.333 --> 28:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the moment these people
left Dagestan for Syria
local terrorism dropped

28:33.300 --> 28:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dramatically if they had
stayed there would have
been terror attacks there

28:37.233 --> 28:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would have been human
casualties who helped you
leave who facilitated your

28:41.566 --> 28:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
departure one of those who
was pushed is this 27 year
old Dagestan who now lives

28:45.833 --> 28:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Turkey we agreed to hide

Rugel river holes of people
who were on the federal
wanted list could somehow

28:53.700 --> 28:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get a passport and leave
the country some security
officers said to them will

28:57.233 --> 29:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
either kill you or you
can leave the country the
way I was helped was that

29:00.766 --> 29:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
every time I went to my
local government office I
was taken by the police and

29:04.433 --> 29:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interrogated but when I went
to get a passport nobody
stopped me and after the

29:08.366 --> 29:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dagestan he's left Russia
made sure they never came
back we're apostles they

29:13.300 --> 29:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
simply said that if I come
back they'll do bad things
to me so I won't ever go

29:17.300 --> 29:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back many dagestanis
who fought for Isis have
died in Syria and they're

29:24.166 --> 29:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
celebrated by Isis propaganda
but some managed to escape
often to the port city

29:29.433 --> 29:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Odessa Ukraine former
Isis fighter Marat agreed
to talk to us if we didn't

29:34.633 --> 29:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show his face well since
the majority went to Syria

29:36.600 --> 29:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the notion of jihad
that Assad was repressing
Muslims and we needed to help

29:39.666 --> 29:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them really we've actually
already met marajó

29:43.033 --> 29:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's the son of Kazim Norma
Gannett off because neem
is often in Odessa to visit

29:47.266 --> 29:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is she oh-hoh she says
we consider our family
lucky he is back alive and

29:54.233 --> 29:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
healthy and realized that
where he ended up wasn't
what he thought it was when

29:57.400 --> 30:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his son left for Syria kazeem
didn't sit back and let
him die he traveled to the

30:01.533 --> 30:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outskirts of Aleppo and
saw the destruction he
helps convince Murad he'd

30:05.500 --> 30:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made a mistake Marat
finally left when he thought
about his own son the more

30:12.433 --> 30:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thoughtful I was thinking
about him constantly hoping
that I could leave and

30:14.366 --> 30:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see my child I was always
thinking about what
a big mistake I made

30:17.200 --> 30:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thank God I was able to
leave there alive because
practically everyone I

30:20.733 --> 30:25.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
knew there no one is
left alive they all died
there Marat will never

30:27.733 --> 30:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
return here to Dagestan
and that's what's inspired
Kazim to speak on camera

accountability may well be
the only thing that will
make them think twice a

little more than two years
later Nemtsov was assassinated
a few hundred feet from

33:05.566 --> 33:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Kremlin walls his death
was brazen and shocking this

33:09.700 --> 33:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the spot where Boris
Nemtsov was killed and you
can see the corner of the

33:13.166 --> 33:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kremlin right there just hundred
yards away and you can see the

33:16.700 --> 33:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
memorial for him that's on
this bridge today in Moscow
a court sentenced five

33:21.666 --> 33:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people in themselves
murder whether or not they
were the mastermind they

33:25.300 --> 33:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
permanently silenced them
sobs outspoken criticism you
live in car Mirza believed

33:29.833 --> 33:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
someone used poison to
silence him too I started
suddenly feeling really really

33:36.833 --> 33:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sick and within the space
of 15 to 20 minutes I
went from feeling could be

33:39.133 --> 33:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
normal like I am now to
having a really rapid heart
rate sweating palpitations

33:45.600 --> 33:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
started vomiting and then
I just lost consciousness

33:47.700 --> 33:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kidneys I think one first
and it was the heart the
lungs the stomach the liver

33:54.733 --> 33:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything everything just
shutdowns I have no doubt
that this was deliberate

33:57.400 --> 34:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attempt to murder based
on my political activities
motivated by my activities in

34:04.366 --> 34:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russian opposition
there are people working
as opposition who are not

34:09.666 --> 34:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
targeted what is the line
that you apparently crossed
there's a clear line

34:15.066 --> 34:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between just saying things
that are against the
regime and it's a totally

34:17.233 --> 34:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different thing to go
off to their own personal
interests after their pockets

the history of assassination

walking down the street in

34:48.666 --> 34:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kiev when a gunman shot him
three times his body bled

34:53.066 --> 34:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
middle of the day Maria

was reading about my first

34:59.966 --> 35:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spring and Keith was
beneath I was screaming so
desperately first I thought

35:05.333 --> 35:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's very nuts to be born at
all when you lose something like

35:08.933 --> 35:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
moxa Cova lives in kiev
where she's raising

35:12.866 --> 35:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she and Lauren in Cabo
lawmakers allied with Putin
and they enjoyed the spoils

35:16.700 --> 35:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that come from power but he'd
also been an investigator
who uncovered corruption

35:20.733 --> 35:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Russian intelligence
agency the FSB who do you
think killed your husband

35:24.833 --> 35:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he had certain enemies and
these enemies are in the
FSB the anti-corruption

35:31.366 --> 35:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
schemes that he would
investigate from here

35:35.766 --> 35:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that is lots of money
and lots of influence
lots of of everything

35:44.233 --> 35:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
physicians and that is
something that they would
not let him do Russia calls

35:48.966 --> 35:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her claim a fabrication
but his death fits a
pattern a once loyal family

35:52.933 --> 35:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
member becomes an outspoken
opponent and ends up dead
my family you can be born

35:57.600 --> 36:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in truth it can be adopted
inted can't believe it
voluntarily people who have

36:02.133 --> 36:05.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tried to leave the Putin
family voluntarily have
not fared very well

propaganda law it helped
condone homophobia and attacks

36:41.866 --> 36:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on gay Russians and Gessen
argues the law explains
how Putin rules the

36:46.600 --> 36:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
autocrat needs everybody
out in the street would

people in your back pocket and

37:04.133 --> 37:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then pull them out and you
need them again and Gessen
says above it all is a

37:08.333 --> 37:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
boss served by loyal
lieutenants who don't need
explicit instructions to

launch attacks let a

37:22.100 --> 37:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the Kremlin kill is

37:26.366 --> 37:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kremlin denied our interview

a member of Putin's

37:30.233 --> 37:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
party and Russia's national

with the assassinated

37:38.133 --> 37:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposition leader Boris
Nemtsov who organized his

that it's terroristic

is about the portrait of a man

who could it's not for a

41:37.366 --> 41:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want him to continue
to do what he thinks is
important what he thinks is

41:45.166 --> 41:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right and her fate allows
car Mirza to keep his faith

system he says after recovering
he'll go back to Russia

knock them down and build
high-rises as always police

46:05.666 --> 46:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who owes us they build an
authoritarian regime that
doesn't give anything back

46:09.800 --> 46:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his rallies are unusual
in a country where retail
campaigning is almost

46:14.033 --> 46:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unheard of the crowds are
young and he talks like
them Lorna she says they

46:18.433 --> 46:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think we have no right to

tell us you and we have to

his anti-corruption message
resonates with me and I
think that he is a very

46:37.600 --> 46:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charismatic politician 23
year old cyril Kozlovsky
and anyone in the crowd who

46:43.600 --> 46:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wanted one got a photo
with Navalny Kozlowski
promptly posted it to his

46:46.000 --> 46:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
profile on VK russia's
equivalent of facebook
Kozlovsky acknowledges that

46:50.400 --> 46:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin has brought relative
prosperity to Russia he's
not even old enough to

46:54.166 --> 46:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remember the political and
economic chaos that Putin
helped end when he came

46:57.966 --> 47:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to power in 1999 what would
you say to your parents
or grandparents who say

47:01.833 --> 47:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look things were a lot worse
for us before President
Putin in the 18 years

47:06.466 --> 47:11.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that have passed he and
his team could have done
a lot more to help the

47:13.433 --> 47:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
situation a lot more to
make it better and he didn't
so did the blame for this

47:18.900 --> 47:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Cheboksary 375 miles
east of Moscow the local
government made sure no one in

47:24.633 --> 47:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the city center would rent
space to the Navalny campaign
so as gatherings take

by ellicott we are
constantly fighting with the

48:09.433 --> 48:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
authorities and it's always
one-sided because when it
comes to election season

48:14.066 --> 48:19.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they make it impossible

him if he thought he'd be

48:35.766 --> 48:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arrested for protesting
if Navalny were president
yeah absolutely beautiful

48:39.666 --> 48:43.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
couplet I'm absolutely
certain this would not
happen because under Alexei

48:43.866 --> 48:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Navalny the country will
be more open Alexia's for
transparency and only with

48:50.700 --> 48:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transparency can we overpower

50:32.233 --> 50:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more Navalny x' poll numbers
remain low but he's changing
public opinion 2/3 of

50:39.066 --> 50:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russians now identify
corruption as the country's
number one problem

50:42.300 --> 50:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Putin
avoids responding to
Navalny substantively

50:45.733 --> 50:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the Navalny effect
means at a town hall in
moscow where questions are

50:49.666 --> 50:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
usually screened in
advance this teenager
dared to ask Putin about

50:53.400 --> 50:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
corrupt officials undermining
the public's faith in
government but for the

50:57.300 --> 51:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dominions oh how are you
planning to solve this problem

51:00.266 --> 51:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin responded and venules
digital applause pathetic
you read your question

51:04.166 --> 51:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did you prepare it yourself
or did someone put you
up to it little life

51:08.733 --> 51:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
prepared me for this question

51:13.833 --> 51:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hey that's vastly while
he's inspired the younger
generation some fellow Putin

51:19.233 --> 51:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opponents criticized Navalny
for being a nativist six
years ago he released

51:21.966 --> 51:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
videos comparing immigrants who
work in Russia to cockroaches

51:28.666 --> 51:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if only stands by the videos
instead he wants to appeal
the Nationalists which

51:32.233 --> 51:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is why he rarely criticizes
Putin's muscular and
popular foreign policy in

51:36.200 --> 51:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ukraine and Syria Navalny
turns down interview requests

51:39.800 --> 51:43.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
including ours and tries
to keep the focus on
corruption you save your

51:43.900 --> 51:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harshest criticism of the
president for his domestic
policy obviously not his

51:48.633 --> 51:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign policy in fact
you don't talk very much
about its foreign policy is

51:52.233 --> 51:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that because you agree
with most available
avenues two-party system I

51:55.833 --> 51:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't talk a lot about
foreign policy because here
everyone is interested in

51:59.633 --> 52:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wages income and bad roads
he tries to feed populism
to an audience that's

52:06.566 --> 52:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hungry he highlights
government corruption to
people who feel they have

52:08.633 --> 52:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nothing to lose and he's
trying to convince a
generation and perhaps the

52:13.500 --> 52:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country that politics
requires participation
and finally the us-russia

52:21.200 --> 52:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship to say it's been
tense is an understatement

52:24.900 --> 52:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so next we try and
understand how Washington
sees Russia and how Russia

52:28.700 --> 52:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sees the United States on
Russia's most patriotic
holiday Russians of all ages

52:36.566 --> 52:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remember what they consider
their finest moment they
mark the anniversary of

52:41.033 --> 52:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
victory in World War
two by honoring the dead
Korea nom nom ovitch his

52:45.833 --> 52:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
grandfather fought the
Nazis he says Russian
the US were once allies

52:49.600 --> 52:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and should be again we can
finally read what you really
want to love you and be

52:54.333 --> 52:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
friends with you we are
waiting for you to finally
meet us halfway for Russians

53:01.300 --> 53:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's the u.s. who's
unwilling to come halfway
many here believe President

53:03.966 --> 53:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump wants to improve
things but is being blocked
by what Dmitri sheikin

53:07.600 --> 53:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calls the American establishment
we'll go area by Lee to
cool Trump wants to do

53:14.466 --> 53:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something but he's forced
to follow the general
political line Donald Trump is

53:18.000 --> 53:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the most right-wing
candidate of the Republican
Party perhaps nobody

53:22.466 --> 53:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
expressed more hope in
Trump's and Alexander
Dugan a right-wing TV

53:26.133 --> 53:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
firebrand and philosopher
who's helped inspire the
Kremlin's ideology really we

53:30.666 --> 53:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supported trumpism which
supported our agenda Dugan says

53:35.633 --> 53:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Kremlin saw Trump is
a kindred spirit who vowed
not to meddle in turn

53:39.266 --> 53:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ash
we supported this choice of

53:41.800 --> 53:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
anti-establishment conservative
America revolution that
changed when President

53:48.700 --> 53:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump ordered a missile
strike on Russia ally Syria
and Teddy felt he must

53:52.600 --> 53:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
respond to a chemical weapons
attack as long as America
stands for justice then

54:00.266 --> 54:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
peace and harmony will
in the end prevail we
trusted not in trump as

54:07.100 --> 54:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pro-russian figure we
trusted in trump realist
and we are disappointed the

54:13.100 --> 54:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disappointment and tensions
have been growing last
month over the Baltic Sea a

54:16.400 --> 54:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian jet flew within
5 feet of a US Air Force
reconnaissance plane that same

54:20.700 --> 54:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week a NATO Jets shadowed
the Russian defense
ministers plane and a Russian

54:24.433 --> 54:29.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
jet came up and rocked
its wings demonstrated
was armed last year the

54:31.333 --> 54:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama administration accused
Russia of hacking the
election and then seized

54:33.366 --> 54:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian properties and
increased sanctions all
of that has led to Russian

54:38.066 --> 54:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frustration Maria Zakharova
is the Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman we were

54:42.066 --> 54:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to establish normal
relationship normal didn't
know this word normal

54:49.033 --> 54:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationship what is wrong
with food president and
I have been discussing

54:54.833 --> 54:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
various things going very
well last week the u.s. took
steps toward normalization

55:00.000 --> 55:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidents Trump and Putin
announced a deal on Syria

55:02.533 --> 55:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both presidents called their
meeting the first step to
warming the relationship

55:05.933 --> 55:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
asturias if we develop our
relations in the same way
there is every reason to

55:12.866 --> 55:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe that we would be
able to at least partially
restore the level of

55:16.533 --> 55:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interaction that we need
the president echoed that
hope on sunday he tweeted he

55:21.200 --> 55:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wouldn't dwell on 2016
hacking and wrote now is
the time to move forward and

55:25.266 --> 55:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working constructively with
russia foaming-at-the-mouth
this is not the

55:29.233 --> 55:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
language other Trump
administration officials use
about Russia on Syria how

55:33.400 --> 55:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many more children have
to die before Russia cares
now is the my view on

55:39.833 --> 55:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ukraine
we do call on Russia to exercise

55:42.700 --> 55:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
influence over this
separatist in the region
whom they do hold complete

55:47.400 --> 55:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
control over and on
potent personally this is
a man for whom veracity

55:54.366 --> 55:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
translated into English the
one senior administration
official who's declined

55:56.933 --> 56:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to echo that criticism is
Donald Trump if candidate
and president wouldn't it

56:01.300 --> 56:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be a great thing if we could
actually get along with
Russia with nothing sir

56:05.200 --> 56:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a respect vote is a strong
leader I can tell you that
unlike what we have we

56:09.500 --> 56:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a pathetic leader
Putin C kill'uh a lot of
killers get a lot of killers

56:15.966 --> 56:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while you think our country's so
innocent and last week in Warsaw

56:18.833 --> 56:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump once
again questioned the US
intelligence community's

56:22.233 --> 56:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unanimous assessment that
Russia hacked the 2016
election I think it was Russia

56:29.166 --> 56:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but I think it was probably
other people and or countries
and I see nothing wrong

56:34.266 --> 56:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with that statement nobody
really knows at the very
least giving the president

56:37.533 --> 56:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the benefit of a doubt
this is very bizarre behavior
Democratic Senator Mark

56:42.066 --> 56:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Warner is the vice
chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee we are

56:45.200 --> 56:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeking to determine if
there is an actual fire
but there is clearly a lot

56:52.133 --> 56:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of smoke Warner's
helping lead the Senate's
investigation into Russian

56:54.533 --> 56:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interference in the 2016
election and whether President
Trump or his campaign

56:58.300 --> 57:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colluded with Russia's
attempts to sway the election
we first interviewed him

57:02.233 --> 57:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three weeks ago it is
very strange that any
presidential candidates and in

57:09.100 --> 57:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particular Republican
presidential candidate
would pair it so much of the

57:16.000 --> 57:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian line Republican
Senator James Lankford is
also on the Intelligence

57:18.166 --> 57:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Committee in some ways as
president Trump aligned
himself with the ideals

57:22.433 --> 57:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expressed by Russia yeah
he's pushing out the
messages that are consistent

57:25.933 --> 57:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Kremlin policies
and I would tell you every
opportunity that I have I

57:28.966 --> 57:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
try to articulate very
clearly there's no question
that the Russians were

57:31.733 --> 57:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to hack into her
election there's no question
that we should have a strong

57:34.800 --> 57:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATO and the United States
should be a part of that
NATO alliance do you

57:37.800 --> 57:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe that he's not
echoing that because the
Russians have compromising

57:41.133 --> 57:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
material on him I don't
know I hope not but the goal
of this investigation is

57:49.400 --> 57:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not only reconfirm Russian
intervention and explain
that to the American public

57:56.033 --> 57:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but to also see if there
was any contacts between
the Trump campaign and

57:59.700 --> 58:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Russians and just
this week we learned that
last June Donald Trump jr.

58:03.833 --> 58:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
met with lawyer Natalia
Vissel MIT skya and

58:06.466 --> 58:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lobbyists Rinat Akhmetov
both believed to have ties
to the Russian government I

58:10.566 --> 58:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spoke to Senator Warner again
last night this indication
that they were willing

58:14.866 --> 58:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to accept this information
from Russians and it was
part of an overall Russian

58:21.933 --> 58:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government effort to help
Trump and to hurt Clinton
I think this is the first

58:24.233 --> 58:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time the American public
has seen that in black and
white much of this town has

58:28.500 --> 58:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
been worried about
Trump in Russia since he
became president current

58:32.033 --> 58:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
administration officials
tell Newshour the White
House drafted an executive

58:34.833 --> 58:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
order that would have
lifted sanctions imposed on
Russia over Ukraine senior

58:39.266 --> 58:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
administration officials
and the intelligence
community successfully

58:42.433 --> 58:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lobbied against it and
this spring senators
passed a bill that would

58:45.466 --> 58:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
restrict the president's
ability to lift those sanctions
the bill is not yet a

58:49.133 --> 58:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law but it was designed
to be a nearly unanimous
message to the President and

58:52.733 --> 58:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Putin we believe
strongly that what Russia
continues to do they will

58:57.000 --> 59:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
threaten Ukraine threaten
its neighbors threaten NATO
to continue to pry into

59:01.166 --> 59:04.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not only our elections
but other elections is
destabilizing it in a

59:04.666 --> 59:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
demands a response what they've
yet to have a consequence
for what they did in

59:08.366 --> 59:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the election time and they
should in some ways the
president has fallen in

59:11.900 --> 59:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
line on Sunday he tweeted
he wouldn't lift sanctions
on Russia over Ukraine

59:15.466 --> 59:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until Ukrainian and Syrian
problems are solved and
last week he also endorsed

59:22.366 --> 59:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
article 5 NATO's collective
dissents the United States
has demonstrated not

59:27.533 --> 59:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
merely with words but with
its actions that we stand
firmly behind article 5

59:32.500 --> 59:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mutual defense
commitment that convinces
many in Moscow that the

59:38.533 --> 59:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
u.s. establishment is
making sure the US remains

and Russia is simply

targeting the US with whatever
tool it can I'm sure that
the Russians have been

1:00:08.633 --> 1:00:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking at things I've been
hacking things have been
using the material that

1:00:15.666 --> 1:00:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they've hacked my are you

protect against that
