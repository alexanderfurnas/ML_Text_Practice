JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.474 --> 00:13.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: It's
the last Super
Tuesday of the primary election
season. Six

00:13.180 --> 00:19.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states cast their votes, just as
Hillary Clinton
crosses the delegate threshold.
But Bernie

00:19.286 --> 00:22.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sanders says it's still not
over.

00:22.322 --> 00:23.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Also ahead this Tuesday:

00:23.290 --> 00:24.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you believe he's fit to be
president?

00:25.092 --> 00:27.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
The American people are going to
make that

00:27.327 --> 00:29.162 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decision.

00:29.263 --> 00:32.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I sit down with
Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell to talk
about Donald

00:32.432 --> 00:37.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, the race for the White
House, and the
Kentucky senator's new book.

00:37.838 --> 00:43.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as states battle the federal
government
over which bathrooms transgender
people should

00:43.143 --> 00:47.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
use, one student is pushing her
school to
be on the frontier of change.

00:47.514 --> 00:51.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADDIE DALTON, Student, Atherton
High School:
It all comes down to being
respected as a

00:51.785 --> 00:58.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person. Now, that's all relying
on the fundamental
assumption that you respect
being transgender

00:58.425 --> 01:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a legitimate, like, concept,
as a legitimate
thing.

01:02.462 --> 01:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:06.066 --> 01:09.269 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.369 --> 01:23.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's the last
Super Tuesday
of the 2016 primary season, and
it's something

01:23.884 --> 01:29.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an anticlimax. According to
new delegate
counts, Hillary Clinton wrapped
up the Democratic

01:29.389 --> 01:34.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nomination overnight, hours
before polls opened
in six states.

01:34.594 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Republican Donald
Trump was the
center of a firestorm in his own
party over

01:39.833 --> 01:45.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his comments about a federal
judge of Mexican
descent. We will have a full
report after

01:45.539 --> 01:47.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the news summary.

01:47.474 --> 01:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: A car
bombing killed
11 people and wounded 36 in
Istanbul, Turkey.

01:53.380 --> 01:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The target was a police vehicle,
and seven
of the dead were officers. The
blast shook

01:58.719 --> 02:04.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a neighborhood that houses
universities and
ancient Roman sites. It was the
city's fourth

02:04.691 --> 02:08.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
attack this year, but the
Turkish president
vowed not to be intimidated.

02:08.762 --> 02:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): These terrorist
activities, these

02:13.800 --> 02:19.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steps are being taken against
those responsible
for providing security. This is
unforgivable,

02:19.306 --> 02:23.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inexcusable. We will continue
our struggle
against the terrorists until the
end, fearlessly

02:23.610 --> 02:25.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and tirelessly.

02:25.445 --> 02:30.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The escalation in
violence
is blamed mostly on Kurdish
rebels and Islamic

02:30.217 --> 02:32.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
State militants.

02:32.219 --> 02:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leaders of the world's two
largest democracies
met today, with climate change
high on the

02:36.923 --> 02:42.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agenda. President Obama welcomed
India's Prime
Minister Narendra Modi to the
White House.

02:42.896 --> 02:48.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They discussed getting India to
join a landmark
climate change agreement this
year, among

02:48.101 --> 02:55.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other things. India is the
world's third largest
carbon emitter, after China and
the U.S.

02:55.409 --> 03:00.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another set of high-level talks
between the
U.S. and China wrapped up today
in Beijing.

03:00.981 --> 03:06.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State John Kerry
urged the Chinese
to reduce barriers for foreign
businesses.

03:06.553 --> 03:12.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Chinese, in turn, agreed to
stop flooding
global markets with excess
steel. There was

03:12.225 --> 03:17.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
no progress reported on
territorial disputes
in the South China Sea.

03:17.931 --> 03:24.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in the U.S., the Pacific
Northwest kicked
off a major earthquake and
tsunami drill today.

03:24.471 --> 03:31.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The four-day event dubbed
Cascadia Rising
assumes a catastrophic quake
just 95 miles

03:31.244 --> 03:36.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
off the Oregon coast. The
affected area would
include the cities of Seattle
and Portland.

03:36.983 --> 03:40.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both U.S. and Canadian agencies
are taking
part in the drill.

03:40.754 --> 03:46.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENNETH MURPHY, FEMA: These type
of events
are survivable. If you take the
time to make

03:46.927 --> 03:51.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some personal preparations, and
work with
your family and how you're going
to communicate,

03:52.032 --> 03:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then how you're going to
help your neighbors
and your community and so forth,
that will

03:57.838 --> 03:59.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make probably the biggest
difference.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some 20,000
people will be
involved in the exercise.

04:04.544 --> 04:09.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained about 18 points
to close at

04:09.716 --> 04:18.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
17938. The Nasdaq fell seven
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added two. And oil
closed above $50

04:19.092 --> 04:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a barrel for the first time
since July.

04:22.295 --> 04:30.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the last surviving 9/11
search dog has
died in Texas at age 16. In
2001, Bretagne,

04:30.303 --> 04:36.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a golden retriever, helped hunt
for human
remains at the World Trade
Center site. She

04:36.276 --> 04:42.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was euthanized Monday at a
clinic outside
Houston, after suffering kidney
failure. First-responders

04:42.949 --> 04:48.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lined the sidewalk and draped an
American
flag over Bretagne's coffin.

04:48.288 --> 04:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
six states
vote as Hillary Clinton crosses
the delegate

04:53.293 --> 05:00.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threshold; Mitch McConnell on
whether Donald
Trump is fit to be president;
mafia-linked

05:00.133 --> 05:15.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
businesses exploiting migrants
in Italy; and
much more.

05:15.582 --> 05:18.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First up: the 2016 contest for
president.

05:18.652 --> 05:24.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From one end of the country to
the other,
it was a day for voting, for
delegate-counting,

05:24.124 --> 05:25.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
distancing, and a little
explaining.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: You think you're going
here today?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I think we got a shot.

05:29.629 --> 05:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Bernie
Sanders making
one last push in California this
morning,

05:34.201 --> 05:40.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in San Francisco, hoping not
just for votes,
but for an argument to keep his
campaign going.

05:40.407 --> 05:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overnight, the Associated Press
declared Hillary
Clinton now has enough delegates
to nail down

05:46.646 --> 05:52.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic nomination. She
touted the
news in Long Beach, but urged
her supporters

05:52.652 --> 05:54.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not to relax.

05:54.654 --> 05:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I got to tell you, according to
the news,

05:57.224 --> 06:01.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
we are in the brink of a
historic, historic,
unprecedented moment.

06:01.494 --> 06:03.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:03.430 --> 06:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: But we
still have
work to do, don't we?

06:08.602 --> 06:15.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All told, another
694 delegates
are at stake in the states
voting today.

06:15.842 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders appealed to his
voters to disregard
the delegate count.

06:20.013 --> 06:24.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: That's
really not accurate.
And that's not me talking. That
is the Democratic

06:24.251 --> 06:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Committee, who says
that the media
shouldn't lump together the
pledged delegates,

06:29.489 --> 06:35.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which are real delegates pledged
to a candidate,
and superdelegates, who will not
be voting

06:35.629 --> 06:39.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until July 25, and who have the
right to change
their mind.

06:39.232 --> 06:44.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But any way you
count delegates,
Clinton was well ahead going
into the day's

06:44.804 --> 06:49.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primaries. Significantly, if you
look at just
pledged delegates, the one
Sanders sees as

06:49.576 --> 06:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
real delegates, Clinton led
Sanders by 291
this afternoon.

06:55.348 --> 07:03.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When superdelegates are
included, the Associated
Press had Clinton at the magic
number, 2,383,

07:03.423 --> 07:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than 800 ahead. One of the
most prominent
superdelegates lined up behind
her this morning.

07:10.297 --> 07:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Minority Leader Nancy
Pelosi of California
officially ended her neutrality
on ABC.

07:16.569 --> 07:20.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
I have voted for Hillary Clinton
for president

07:20.473 --> 07:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States, and proud
to endorse
her for that position.

07:23.443 --> 07:29.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is history
eight years to
the day since Clinton conceded
the nomination

07:29.716 --> 07:32.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in 2008 to then-Senator Barack
Obama.

07:32.452 --> 07:40.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as camp Clinton celebrated
today, Republican
Donald Trump came under intense
new criticism

07:40.226 --> 07:47.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from within his own party, at
issue, his claim
that a Latino judge overseeing a
lawsuit against

07:47.534 --> 07:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump University is biased
against him and
his claim days later that Muslim
judges could

07:54.741 --> 07:56.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also be biased.

07:56.609 --> 08:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, House Speaker
Paul Ryan took
Trump to task, but stopped short
of rejecting

08:02.882 --> 08:04.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the presumptive nominee.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
I disavow these comments. I
regrets those

08:06.319 --> 08:08.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comments that he made.

08:08.221 --> 08:12.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think -- claiming a
person can't do
the job because of their race is
sort of like

08:12.792 --> 08:17.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the textbook definition of a
racist comment.
I think that should be
absolutely disavowed.

08:17.297 --> 08:22.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's absolutely unacceptable.
But do I believe
that Hillary Clinton is the
answer? No, I

08:22.202 --> 08:23.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do not.

08:24.037 --> 08:26.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do I believe that Hillary
Clinton is going
to be the answer to solving
these problems?

08:26.373 --> 08:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do not. I believe that we have
more common
ground on the policy issues of
the day and

08:31.111 --> 08:35.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have more likelihood of
getting our policies
enacted with him than we do with
her.

08:35.248 --> 08:40.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A former Trump
rival, South
Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham,
went further,

08:40.720 --> 08:46.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in The New York Times. He said:
"This is the
most un-American thing from a
politician since

08:46.526 --> 08:51.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joe McCarthy. If anybody was
looking for an
off-ramp, this is probably it."

08:51.931 --> 08:58.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in New Jersey, Governor
Chris Christie,
another former rival and now a
Trump backer,

08:58.138 --> 08:59.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
came to his defense.

09:00.073 --> 09:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), New
Jersey: Donald
Trump is not a racist. And so
the allegations

09:03.576 --> 09:08.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that he is are absolutely
contrary to every
experience I have had with him
over the last

09:08.114 --> 09:09.816 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
14 years.

09:09.916 --> 09:13.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late this
afternoon, Trump
himself defended his criticism
of Judge Curiel,

09:13.686 --> 09:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying in a statement that his
comments had
been -- quote -- "misconstrued
as a categorical

09:18.792 --> 09:21.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack against people of Mexican
heritage."

09:21.961 --> 09:28.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This even as Republican U.S.
Senator Mark
Kirk of Illinois reversed his
earlier endorsement

09:28.168 --> 09:31.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the presumptive nominee,
announcing that
he had -- quote -- "concluded
that Donald

09:32.005 --> 09:37.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has not demonstrated the
temperament
necessary to assume the greatest
office in

09:37.577 --> 09:39.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the world" -- end quote.

09:39.512 --> 09:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, now we turn back to the
Democrats, with
our John Yang in Santa Monica,
California,

09:44.384 --> 09:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and political director Lisa
Desjardins. She
is in Brooklyn, New York.

09:48.521 --> 09:50.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thanks to both of you for being
here.

09:50.390 --> 09:55.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa, to you first. It is a
historic moment
for Hillary Clinton, but, as we
reported,

09:55.762 --> 10:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she is telling her supporters
not to relax.
Is that a real worry for them?

10:00.366 --> 10:04.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton doesn't
seem worried
about clinching the nomination.
In fact, on

10:05.038 --> 10:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
background, her staff has told
me that they
think tonight is the night, an
historic night.

10:09.242 --> 10:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will proclaim themselves as
having clinched
the nomination tonight on this
stage behind

10:13.513 --> 10:17.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me. But, Judy, they want to win
California.
They want to go into the general
election

10:17.750 --> 10:22.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a sign of strength. Losing
California,
that wouldn't be such a sign of
strength.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, they're pivoting to
going after
Trump even more.

10:25.725 --> 10:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On her schedule, the next two
public events
are in Ohio and in Pennsylvania
in one week.

10:31.898 --> 10:35.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's significant about those
states? Oh,
a little thing called swing
voters. Those

10:35.835 --> 10:39.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two states will be critical to
whomever wins
the presidential election this
year in the

10:39.672 --> 10:41.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fall.

10:41.608 --> 10:47.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, in
California, shoe
on the other foot, how concerned
are the Sanders

10:47.113 --> 10:51.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- is the Sanders camp that
their supporters
may just fade away if they think
this contest

10:52.085 --> 10:53.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is over?

10:53.887 --> 10:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, Judy, if you go
by social
media, it may have done the
other -- gone

10:57.657 --> 10:59.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the other way.

10:59.526 --> 11:05.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overnight, Facebook, Twitter
full of messages
accusing the media of conspiring
to suppress

11:05.565 --> 11:11.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Sanders vote here in
California. Whether
that translates into a big surge
or a big

11:11.671 --> 11:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turnout for Sanders remains to
be seen.

11:14.340 --> 11:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are about -- it's hard to
judge from
the polling places. The
estimates are that

11:18.545 --> 11:24.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than half the ballots cast
in today's
primary will have been mail-in
ballots, mail-in

11:24.651 --> 11:32.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes. A check -- I have been
calling around
to -- very random, unscientific
check of polling

11:32.191 --> 11:37.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places, of poll observers in
Northern California,
here in the Los Angeles area,
here in Santa

11:37.797 --> 11:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Monica, say that the polls have
been slower
than they were even four years
ago, when there

11:45.772 --> 11:50.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was no real Democratic contest,
in the renomination
of Barack Obama.

11:50.176 --> 11:54.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we will know in a few hours
what the effect
is -- Judy.

11:54.581 --> 11:56.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Interesting.

11:56.115 --> 12:00.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lisa, you were saying the
Clinton folks
focused on what's next.

12:00.820 --> 12:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are you learning about
whether her message
is changing, given the fact that
we're at

12:05.892 --> 12:07.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this turning point in the
campaign?

12:07.694 --> 12:13.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, Judy,
tonight, Hillary
Clinton is going to go all in on
the women

12:13.499 --> 12:15.335 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
message.

12:15.435 --> 12:18.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's going to debut a video
which shows repeated
images of women. In fact,
looking at this

12:18.805 --> 12:23.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
video, there's almost no images
of men, where
she's talking about being a
woman, promoting

12:23.610 --> 12:26.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women, and about this historic
moment tonight
for her.

12:26.913 --> 12:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's no secret she wants to win
the presidency
with women and also in this
video minorities.

12:33.286 --> 12:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, she is pivoting fully that
way, which
is different than in 2008, Judy,
you remember,

12:38.625 --> 12:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where she said, I happen to be a
woman, but
I'm not running as a woman.

12:42.128 --> 12:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems tonight, Judy, they're
launching
a message where she's running
full stop as

12:47.100 --> 12:50.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a woman, no doubt about it. And
it's a little
different. I remember being at
that speech

12:50.937 --> 12:54.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
eight years ago where she
conceded to Barack
Obama. The campaign tonight
feels like they

12:54.907 --> 12:57.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
want to really flex their
muscles.

12:57.377 --> 13:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to be honest, Judy, they are
expecting
Senator Sanders eventually to be
magnanimous.

13:02.248 --> 13:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they will reach out to
Sanders voters,
but no decision yet on whether
he will be

13:06.452 --> 13:10.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mentioned by name, at least when
I talked
to staff recently, tonight or
not. We will

13:10.790 --> 13:12.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have to wait and see.

13:12.725 --> 13:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, what
are Sanders
people saying about what comes
next? Everybody

13:15.628 --> 13:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wants to know, is he taking this
all the way
to the convention or not?

13:19.032 --> 13:23.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Well, they
acknowledge their only
path to a nomination is if they
can convince

13:23.603 --> 13:28.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
superdelegates to switch from
Hillary Clinton
to support Senator Sanders, and
that their

13:28.975 --> 13:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
argument would be that he is the
stronger
candidate against Donald Trump
in the fall.

13:34.714 --> 13:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also acknowledge that no
superdelegates
-- they cannot name a single
superdelegate

13:39.886 --> 13:46.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has switched. They say that
they were
hoping obviously for a win in
California to

13:46.959 --> 13:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bolster that argument. They
would also argue
that they had a West Coast
sweep, winning

13:52.265 --> 13:57.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington, Oregon state as
well, but they
also say that no decisions are
going to be

13:57.270 --> 14:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made about how to keep going
forward until
tomorrow, after the votes are --
the results

14:02.875 --> 14:04.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are known here.

14:04.711 --> 14:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also say that the campaigns
have been
talking, the two campaigns have
been talking

14:08.448 --> 14:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the staff level about the way
to move forward,
and they acknowledge those talks
will intensify

14:15.088 --> 14:16.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after tomorrow -- Judy.

14:16.989 --> 14:20.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, whatever
the delegate
count at this point, we are all
on the edge

14:20.526 --> 14:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our seats, and we will be
talking to both
of you through the night.

14:23.763 --> 14:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang, Lisa Desjardins,
thanks.

14:37.643 --> 14:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a different take on the 2016
presidential
election.

14:41.447 --> 14:46.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It comes from the Senate
majority leader,
Republican Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky. He

14:46.385 --> 14:52.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has just published his memoir,
"The Long Game,"
after five terms in the U.S.
Senate. He is

14:52.425 --> 14:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the longest-serving senator in
Kentucky history.

14:55.061 --> 15:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I sat down with the senator this
morning at
the offices of the National
Republican Senatorial

15:00.366 --> 15:03.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Committee here in Washington.

15:03.169 --> 15:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Mitch McConnell, thank
you very much
for talking with us.

15:05.471 --> 15:06.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
Glad to be with you.

15:06.973 --> 15:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're here to
talk about your
memoir, "The Long Game."

15:09.375 --> 15:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot going on right now
at this moment
politically. And I want to get
to that.

15:13.679 --> 15:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You write about the people who
influenced
you, of course, your mother,
your father.

15:17.283 --> 15:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You write about a senator from
Kentucky, John
Sherman Cooper, Mike Mansfield.

15:24.123 --> 15:28.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you think about these
people and their
influence in your life, how does
Donald Trump

15:28.961 --> 15:30.730 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
compare?

15:30.830 --> 15:35.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, he's
certainly
a different kind of person in
politics, totally

15:35.968 --> 15:37.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
different.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican voters wanted
somebody from
outside, and they picked
somebody from outside.

15:40.740 --> 15:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will see in the end whether
that works
out. They don't seem to be happy
with either

15:45.778 --> 15:49.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate. They don't care for
Hillary Clinton
and they don't care for Donald
Trump, but

15:49.582 --> 15:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the American people, at least in
the Republican
primaries and caucuses, clearly
wanted somebody

15:54.954 --> 15:57.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
totally different. And that's
who they nominated.

15:57.123 --> 16:02.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and you
mentioned Hillary
Clinton. Today, we learned that
she apparently

16:02.895 --> 16:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has done something historic,
become the first
woman to clinch enough delegates
to become

16:09.335 --> 16:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the nominee of a major political
party in
this country.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know her. What do you think
of her?

16:14.941 --> 16:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well,
Hillary Clinton
is a very, very experienced
insider.

16:20.146 --> 16:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you're going to have a race
between the
ultimate outsider and a
long-term insider.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the American people, I
think, are going
to have to make a big decision
about whether

16:30.857 --> 16:36.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're satisfied where the
country is now.
If they are, then I think
Hillary Clinton

16:36.596 --> 16:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would get another four years,
and it would
be very similar to the last
eight.

16:40.700 --> 16:45.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If, on the other hand the
country, wants to
dramatically go in a different
direction,

16:45.838 --> 16:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're certainly going to have
the opportunity
by voting for Donald Trump.

16:48.474 --> 16:51.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You do write
also, Senator,
throughout the book about your
commitment

16:52.078 --> 16:57.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to racial diversity, among other
things, about
your marriage to Elaine Chao,
who happens

16:57.116 --> 17:00.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be of Chinese heritage.

17:00.319 --> 17:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have been asked in the last
few days about
what Donald Trump said about the
judge, federal

17:05.157 --> 17:13.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judge of Mexican heritage, and
his denouncing
him. You have said you don't in
any way accept

17:13.299 --> 17:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Donald Trump has said, but
when you were
asked if it was racist, you
didn't answer.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now that you have had some time
to think...

17:21.440 --> 17:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, what
he said was
-- it was outrageous and
inappropriate. And

17:24.443 --> 17:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I couldn't more strongly condemn
that.

17:27.747 --> 17:32.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The implication here is that
those who came
to America legally over the
years are somehow

17:33.019 --> 17:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
second-class citizens. My wife
came here at
age 8 not speaking a word of
English and ended

17:38.891 --> 17:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up in the president's Cabinet.

17:41.394 --> 17:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We all got here from somewhere
else going
back in our lineage. And I think
these gratuitous

17:48.034 --> 17:55.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks on Americans who got
here recently
or whose parents got here
recently need to

17:55.107 --> 17:56.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stop.

17:56.876 --> 18:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At this point,
Donald Trump
is doubling down on that
statement. He is

18:00.646 --> 18:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not backing off of it. If he
doesn't back
off, what are the implications?

18:04.884 --> 18:08.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, he
needs to back
off. This is a time he ought to
be reaching

18:08.921 --> 18:13.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out and talking about things
that the American
people are consumed with, like
the slow growth

18:13.859 --> 18:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the country, the lack of
opportunity for
all of us, the fact that they're
falling behind.

18:19.031 --> 18:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are plenty of things he
ought to be
talking about, rather than
taking shots at

18:23.402 --> 18:25.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans because of their
ethnicity.

18:25.705 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, again, if he
doesn't back
off of this and say that it was
a mistake,

18:32.211 --> 18:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what are the implications?

18:33.746 --> 18:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well, he
needs to -- he
needs to quit doing this.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not the way to bring
America together.
It's not the way to unify the
Republican Party,

18:39.385 --> 18:40.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it's not the way to win the
fall election.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what if he
doesn't?

18:42.822 --> 18:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: It's not
the way to
win the fall election by doing
what he's been

18:46.726 --> 18:48.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doing. It needs to stop.

18:48.561 --> 18:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Washington
Post columnist
Eugene Robinson wrote today that
you don't

18:53.065 --> 18:56.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe Donald Trump is fit to
be president.
Do you believe he's fit to be
president?

18:56.535 --> 18:59.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: The
American people
are going to make that decision.
And they're

18:59.405 --> 19:05.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the process of determining
who the next
president is going to be.

19:05.211 --> 19:10.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, you know, it's been
pretty clear
that, in the right-of-center
world, that is,

19:10.683 --> 19:16.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the primaries and caucuses,
conducted among
Republicans, they wanted to do
something different,

19:17.089 --> 19:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that's our nominee, and in
the fall, we
will see what the American
people decide.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think he's
fit to be
president?

19:23.329 --> 19:26.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: I think we
need to respect
the wishes of voters.

19:26.432 --> 19:31.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been busily at work
making these
decisions in primary after
primary after primary.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will find out in the fall.

19:33.739 --> 19:38.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you believe,
Senator, there's
any chance the Republicans could
choose another

19:38.177 --> 19:40.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominee at the convention in
Cleveland?

19:40.279 --> 19:44.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: I think
the nomination
fight is over, and our nominee
ought to accept

19:44.950 --> 19:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that graciously and begin to
reach out to
other members of our party who
didn't support

19:49.655 --> 19:55.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him and pull them together and
discontinue
these attacks on citizens based
on their ethnicity.

19:55.728 --> 19:58.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What has his
nomination done
to the Republican Party?

19:58.731 --> 20:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well,
right now, we're
in great shape. We have a record
number of

20:04.036 --> 20:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. House members, 54 senators,
31 governors,
more legislators and control of
legislatures,

20:08.841 --> 20:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too, that at any time since the
'20s.

20:11.444 --> 20:15.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we'd like the keep it that
way. The way
to finish changing America is to
win the White

20:16.082 --> 20:17.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House. And I hope we can do it
this fall.

20:18.017 --> 20:21.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, people
are looking
at the character of their two
choices this

20:21.520 --> 20:24.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fall, Hillary Clinton and Donald
Trump. What
do they see? What should they
see?

20:24.590 --> 20:27.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Well,
we're going the
find out this fall. The American
people have

20:27.726 --> 20:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a big decision to make. We
couldn't have two
more different candidates than
these two.

20:34.967 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neither one of them are very
popular, so it's
going to be for many Americans a
difficult

20:39.538 --> 20:41.273 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
choice.

20:41.373 --> 20:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Senator,
let's talk
about this remarkable book. You
write very

20:44.477 --> 20:51.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poignantly about when you were
very young,
having polio. Your mother
lovingly took care

20:51.183 --> 20:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of you. You got through that.
And you refer
back to it throughout the book.
How has that

20:56.255 --> 20:58.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affected your political life and
your philosophy?

20:58.457 --> 21:00.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: It's bound
to have had
a huge impact.

21:00.526 --> 21:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, my mother was confronted
with the
following situation. Her husband
was in Europe

21:05.231 --> 21:12.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighting the Germans. She was --
moved to
be with her sister in a rural
community in

21:12.771 --> 21:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alabama. And there was a big
polio epidemic,
I subsequently found out, in
1944. And I was

21:19.145 --> 21:21.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one of them.

21:21.113 --> 21:25.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it hits you like the flu,
and then, when
the flu went away, you could
have all different

21:25.818 --> 21:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kinds of outcomes, from dying to
complete
recovery. Happily enough, we
were one hour's

21:30.956 --> 21:36.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drive from Warm Springs, where
President Roosevelt
had set up the polio treatment
center.

21:36.896 --> 21:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My mother took me over there.
They trained
her how to do a physical therapy
regimen and

21:41.667 --> 21:46.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said, do it four times a day.
The hard part
was, don't let him start trying
to walk.

21:46.839 --> 21:53.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And can you imagine dealing with
a 2-year-old
and subsequently a 3-year-old,
keeping him

21:53.846 --> 21:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off his feet? My first memory in
life was
the last visit to Warm Springs,
where they

21:58.617 --> 22:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told my mother I was going to be
OK, I wouldn't
have to wear a brace, and I
would have a normal

22:04.023 --> 22:05.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
childhood.

22:05.925 --> 22:10.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it was a -- it had
to have been
an early lesson that tenacity
and hard work

22:10.829 --> 22:17.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and sticking to it that I
learned from my
mother, and I have tried --
applied that over

22:17.469 --> 22:19.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and over again throughout my
life.

22:19.338 --> 22:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Mitch
McConnell, the
Senate majority leader, the book
is "The Long

22:23.142 --> 22:26.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Game." It's a memoir and really
a wonderful
read.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, Senator.

22:28.814 --> 22:37.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL: Thank you.
Appreciate
it.

22:37.456 --> 22:40.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:40.793 --> 22:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
growing outrage
over a Stanford University
student's six-month

22:45.864 --> 22:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sentence for sexual assault; and
how the debate
over transgender students is
playing out in

22:51.704 --> 22:53.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one Kentucky school.

22:53.839 --> 23:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: Europe's problems in
coping with
the refugee crisis have taken a
new, ominous

23:00.112 --> 23:02.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
twist, the involvement of the
mafia.

23:02.648 --> 23:08.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Authorities in Sicily have
uncovered a $4
billion fraud scheme involving a
reception

23:08.420 --> 23:14.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center for migrants. This comes
as humanitarian
groups predict a grim summer in
the Western

23:14.159 --> 23:19.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mediterranean, as thousands of
migrants and
refugees attempt to reach
Europe. Many have

23:19.932 --> 23:21.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
already died.

23:21.567 --> 23:24.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Sicily, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports.

23:25.037 --> 23:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This Norwegian
tanker pulling
into the Sicilian port of
Augusta is a lifesaver.

23:31.910 --> 23:37.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Its crew rescued 220 people
whose overcrowded
vessel sank off the southern
Greek island

23:37.683 --> 23:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Crete after setting off from
Egypt.

23:40.419 --> 23:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As many as 300 others are feared
to have drowned,
among them, the mothers of two
Egyptian girls

23:45.924 --> 23:52.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aged 3 and 7. Eighty of those on
board the
tanker were children. The
ruthlessness of

23:52.831 --> 23:57.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people smugglers in North
Africa dismays
Giovanna Di Benedetto of Save
the Children.

23:57.670 --> 24:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIOVANNA DI BENEDETTO, Save the
Children:
It's all very dangerous because
people traffickers

24:02.341 --> 24:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't have any respect for human
beings, for
human life, for pregnant women
or children

24:09.715 --> 24:17.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or babies. So these people are
forced to do
this travel in very dangerous
boats.

24:17.189 --> 24:21.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Having survived
the perilous
crossing from North Africa,
these unaccompanied

24:21.827 --> 24:28.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children are attempting to phone
home to let
their relatives know they are
safe.

24:29.001 --> 24:39.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This Eritrean boy begged to use
a mobile phone
to call his brother in Holland;
17-year-old

24:39.578 --> 24:44.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eliyas Bahra from Eritrea was
with six friends
on board an unpowered boat that
was being

24:44.917 --> 24:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
towed by another craft. When it
began to take
on water, the line was cut. This
was just

24:50.489 --> 24:55.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one disaster that made May this
year one of
the deadliest months on record,
as this footage

24:55.761 --> 24:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the Italian navy shows.

24:57.563 --> 25:04.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIYAS BAHRA, Refugee: The first
boat had
a motor. Our boat not have a
motor. This water

25:04.203 --> 25:11.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full -- our boat is full of
water. Me and
six friends are not dead. Me and
six friends,

25:11.710 --> 25:18.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
altogether seven, seven not
dead, 450 person
dead, people.

25:18.484 --> 25:23.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: These teenagers
from Gambia
in West Africa are exploring a
town near the

25:23.589 --> 25:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center where they are living
while their asylum
cases are being considered;
17-year-old Alieu

25:28.994 --> 25:33.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kah has dreams of furthering his
education
and following in the footsteps
of Italian

25:33.665 --> 25:37.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soccer star Francesco Totti.
They have all
witnessed too much.

25:37.603 --> 25:42.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALIEU KAH, Refugee: I saw people
shouting
inside the river, shouting,
"Help, help."

25:42.174 --> 25:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we couldn't help them,
because our own
boat is full. It's around 120
people in one

25:49.415 --> 25:55.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boat, 120 people. I feel very
sad, because
my fellow human beings are
dying, and we cannot

25:55.754 --> 25:57.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
help. It's very sad. It made me
very sad.

25:57.589 --> 26:04.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The journey to
reach Sicily
was perilous on land, as well as
sea. They

26:04.163 --> 26:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
traveled from Gambia, through
Senegal, Mali,
Burkina Faso, to Niger, and then
they had

26:10.536 --> 26:15.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cross the Sahara Desert to
Libya, where
they encountered violent
smugglers, who forced

26:15.908 --> 26:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the migrants onto overcrowded
boats.

26:17.876 --> 26:22.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALIEU KAH: Libyan people, some
are good, but
some are not good. They shot
many of our friends

26:22.781 --> 26:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their legs. They would break
all their
legs.

26:25.717 --> 26:30.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Giuseppe
Bonanno Conti wants
to stop the influx. He's a
regional leader

26:30.689 --> 26:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a right-wing party called New
Force, and
is urging Europe to emulate the
uncompromising

26:36.195 --> 26:42.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tactics of Australia, which
turned back migrants
vessels and eventually deterred
boat people

26:42.434 --> 26:44.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coming from South Asia.

26:44.369 --> 26:48.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GIUSEPPE BONANNO CONTI, New
Force (through
translator): Our navy should act
like Australia's,

26:48.874 --> 26:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close our sea and not allow
anyone in, so
that people traffickers realize
that no one

26:53.178 --> 26:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can enter Italy anymore. There
would no longer
be mass immigration, and we
would save human

26:58.250 --> 27:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lives. In such an awful way,
these people
are fed to the fish in the
Mediterranean.

27:02.921 --> 27:08.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Listening into
the conversation
was Vincenzo Rizzo, who's
concerned that Sicily

27:08.560 --> 27:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has the highest unemployment
rate in the European
Union.

27:12.030 --> 27:17.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VINCENZO RIZZO, Italy (through
translator):
The only thing that's planned is
for refugees,

27:17.436 --> 27:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslims, and Africans. There are
no longer
laws for Italians, nothing to

MALCOLM BRABANT: But these
Africans feel anything
but privileged. The younger ones
spend their

27:32.251 --> 27:37.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
days cycling around the
countryside near Europe's
largest permanent refugee camp,
where some

27:37.589 --> 27:42.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them have been waiting three
or four years
to find out whether they can
stay or will

27:42.561 --> 27:44.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be deported.

27:44.463 --> 27:49.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a history of trouble
here, because
frustrations occasionally boil
over. The guards

27:49.468 --> 27:51.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are heavily armed.

MADIL SANO, Refugee (through

This place is appalling. It's
like hell. It's

28:02.514 --> 28:07.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a huge prison. They believe that
Africans
are illiterate, that we don't
understand anything,

28:07.119 --> 28:10.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that we're like animals.

up the iconic "Godfather" theme
to remind

28:18.997 --> 28:22.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tourists of Sicily's deep-rooted
mafia connections.

28:22.901 --> 28:28.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Across the island, small
businesses have to

alternative is to

28:28.407 --> 28:33.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have their livelihoods
extinguished. There's
no doubt that the mafia is
involved in most,

28:34.012 --> 28:38.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if not all aspects of
immigration. This week,
the authorities closed down this
reception

28:38.417 --> 28:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center because they discovered
links between
the so-called nonprofit
organization running

28:42.988 --> 28:45.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it and well-known mafia
families.

FRANCESCO PAOLO GIORDANO, Chief

(through translator): The mafia
has total

29:06.211 --> 29:10.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control of the territory. It
would be absurd
not to think they have
infiltrated the business

29:10.482 --> 29:12.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of clandestine immigration.

29:12.584 --> 29:18.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The mafia
aside, Europe is
struggling to cope with the
strain of the

29:18.523 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
migration crisis and is doing
what it can
to stop a repeat of last year's
record influx,

29:23.996 --> 29:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when a million people cross the

ANGELA LUPO, Italian Council for

(through translator): There will
be more and

29:38.977 --> 29:43.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more deaths. The people
traffickers are reorganizing
themselves to make the highest
profit, which

29:43.782 --> 29:45.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is fundamental to them.

29:45.817 --> 29:48.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Some migration
experts believe
that these latest disasters in
the Mediterranean

29:49.021 --> 29:53.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are a direct consequence of the
European Union's
deal with Turkey, which has so
far stemmed

29:53.759 --> 29:56.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the flow of migrants and
refugees to Greece.

29:56.728 --> 30:01.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the pressure to reach Europe
has not diminished.
And so traffickers and their
desperate clientele

30:01.199 --> 30:05.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are being forced to find
different and more
dangerous routes.

30:05.504 --> 30:09.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fate has been kind to these
people. After
being saved from the deep, they
have the gift

30:10.008 --> 30:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of life. But Europe's internal
borders are
being tightened with every
passing day. Their

30:15.747 --> 30:18.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struggle for a new existence is
just beginning.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: the
sentencing in a sexual
assault case at Stanford
University attracting

30:37.803 --> 30:39.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
international outrage.

30:39.805 --> 30:45.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, 20-year-old Brock
Turner was sentenced
to six months in jail for the
assault of an

30:45.143 --> 30:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unconscious woman. Turner, who
was a competitive
swimmer with Olympic hopes, was
convicted

30:50.615 --> 30:56.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on three felony counts,
including intent to
commit rape of an intoxicated
woman.

30:56.455 --> 31:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge, who said he weighed
Turner's lack
of criminal history and
remorsefulness, gave

31:01.660 --> 31:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him a lenient sentence. The
unidentified victim
read a letter in court that she
later released

31:07.632 --> 31:11.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the news Web site BuzzFeed.
It went viral.

31:11.503 --> 31:17.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In it, she wrote -- quote --
"How fast Brock
swims does not lessen the
severity of what

31:17.642 --> 31:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened to me, and should not
lessen the
severity of his punishment. If a
first-time

31:22.180 --> 31:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offender from an underprivileged
background
was accused of three felonies
and displayed

31:27.185 --> 31:31.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
no accountability for his
actions other than
drinking, what would his
sentence be?"

31:31.690 --> 31:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And joining us now is Michelle
Anderson. She's
the dean of the School of Law at
the City

University of New York.

31:39.264 --> 31:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dean Anderson, thank you very
much for being
here.

31:41.867 --> 31:47.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to read just a part of
what Brock Turner's
father wrote in a letter to the
judge.

31:47.806 --> 31:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said -- quote -- "This is a
steep price
to pay for 20 minutes of action
out of his

31:54.246 --> 31:56.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
20-plus years of life."

31:57.082 --> 32:02.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does the sentence that
20-year-old Brock
Turner receive compare to other
sexual assault

32:02.988 --> 32:07.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- people who were convicted of
sexual assault
in similar circumstances? How do
they compare?

32:08.093 --> 32:12.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE ANDERSON, Dean, CUNY
School of Law:
Well, it's a challenging
question, because

32:12.197 --> 32:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courts are really all over the
map in terms
of how they sentence sexual
assault.

32:17.369 --> 32:23.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cases like this not infrequently
receive very
light sentences. Sometimes, if
the circumstances

32:23.742 --> 32:26.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are different, they receive
heavier sentences.

32:27.045 --> 32:31.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's interesting about this
case is that
it's an unusual case, in that
it's not a he

32:31.216 --> 32:37.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said/she said. It's a case in
which the two
witnesses found the incident
happening as

32:38.023 --> 32:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was occurring, and chased the
defendant
down, and held him until the
police came.

32:44.296 --> 32:49.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was physical evidence
corroborating
the victim's story. So, it was
unusual in

32:49.634 --> 32:51.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that sense.

32:51.570 --> 32:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The district
attorney had argued
for six years. As we said, the
judge said

32:57.542 --> 32:59.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
six months.

32:59.144 --> 33:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does a judge take into
consideration
in coming up with sentencing?

33:02.681 --> 33:09.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE ANDERSON: So, judges
frequently take
into consideration obviously the
prior history

33:09.354 --> 33:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the defendant, whether or not
he or she
has been convicted of other
offenses, sometimes,

33:14.926 --> 33:22.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the age of a defendant and the
circumstances
of the offense, how much
violence was used

33:22.734 --> 33:24.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the time.

33:24.636 --> 33:29.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are the kinds of factors
that are taken
into account. And so taking
those factors

33:29.841 --> 33:36.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into account is not unusual.
Taking into account
the duration of time that the
father mentioned

33:36.681 --> 33:41.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his statement wouldn't be
something that
would necessarily be part of --
would be an

33:41.653 --> 33:43.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ordinary factor that would be
assessed.

33:43.588 --> 33:48.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about
the fact that
this 20-year-old man comes from
what appears

33:48.460 --> 33:50.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be an upper-middle-class
background?

33:50.629 --> 33:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELLE ANDERSON: So, that's an
interesting
element of this case.

33:56.234 --> 34:01.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What you have got is a
circumstance that doesn't
comport with the stereotype of
what many people

34:01.940 --> 34:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believe rape is like. It's a
white defendant,
someone who is -- comes from a
privileged

34:07.812 --> 34:12.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
background. Whatever his
financial status
before he attended Stanford, he
certainly

34:12.150 --> 34:22.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes from an elite institution,
was considered
an All-American swimmer, an
athlete of great

34:22.627 --> 34:29.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
import to the Stanford
community, and with
hopes of becoming an Olympic
athlete.

34:29.768 --> 34:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, those are the kinds of
factors, I think,
that color the way that the
media and the

34:35.607 --> 34:40.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public have responded to this
case, someone
who comes from extraordinary
privilege, in

34:40.879 --> 34:49.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a case that's fairly
straightforward, from
a -- from the -- given the fact
that there

34:49.654 --> 34:56.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were witnesses and the evidence
in the form
of corroborative evidence on the
victim's

34:56.594 --> 34:58.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
body.

34:58.496 --> 35:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are unusual aspects of the
case. And
the disparity in privilege
between the defendant

35:02.334 --> 35:08.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the victim is also --
heightens the interest
in this kind of a case.

35:08.640 --> 35:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask you
finally about
the letter the victim read to
the accused.

35:14.212 --> 35:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We haven't identified -- she
hasn't been identified,
but she read out loud in the
courtroom to

35:19.751 --> 35:23.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the accused man. She said -- and
this is part
of it -- she said: "I want to
show people

35:23.855 --> 35:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that one night of drinking can
ruin two lives,
you and me. You are the cause, I
am the effect.

35:30.428 --> 35:34.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have dragged me through this
hell with
you, dipped me back into that
night again

35:34.366 --> 35:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and again. If you think I was
spared, came
out unscathed, that today I ride
off into

35:39.404 --> 35:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sunset, while you suffer the
greatest blow,
you are mistaken."

35:43.908 --> 35:49.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are we left with? We know
most victims
don't speak out like this. What
do we -- what

35:49.514 --> 35:51.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should we take away from this?

35:51.416 --> 35:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE ANDERSON: Well, the
case is unusual
because of the extraordinary
articulateness

35:55.787 --> 36:02.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this particular victim, and
the fact that
she used the opportunity to say
some important

36:02.527 --> 36:05.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
things about how rape is
experienced by its
victims.

36:05.897 --> 36:11.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The part of the victim's
statement that really
hit home with me and I think
with many other

36:11.102 --> 36:15.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people is the part where she
says, "I didn't
want my body anymore."

36:15.373 --> 36:25.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that rape and sexual
assault can
be an invasion of privacy. It
can be something

36:25.116 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that degrades somebody and takes
away their
dignity. But the notion that it
takes away

36:30.288 --> 36:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one's possession of one's own
body and that
one wants to reject one's own
body, I found

36:35.193 --> 36:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that very powerful, and that
quotation has
come up and been reposted again
and again.

36:40.198 --> 36:44.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is
certainly -- this
is a case that has certainly
left, I think,

36:44.669 --> 36:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an impact on many, many people.

discrimination and can be
grounds for withholding

37:18.703 --> 37:20.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
funding.

37:20.538 --> 37:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that directive has set off
some angry
reaction. Kentucky is one state
where many

37:24.476 --> 37:29.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders don't agree with the
president. And
we look at how one school in
Louisville decided

37:29.380 --> 37:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to act proactively before the
bigger debate
began.

37:33.451 --> 37:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Yasmeen
Qureshi of Education
Week has the story. It's part of
our weekly

37:38.189 --> 37:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education series, Making the
Grade.

37:41.092 --> 37:43.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: What's it like
to question
your gender?

37:43.995 --> 37:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADDIE DALTON, Student, Atherton
High School:
It's a little bit scary in the
very beginning,

37:49.467 --> 37:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I suppose, because you know that
you're going
to have to face a lot of
discrimination.

37:54.038 --> 38:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, go through the YouTube
comments on any
video about trans people, and
you will see,

38:02.347 --> 38:07.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like, just how many people are
still, like,
openly hostile to this idea.

38:07.785 --> 38:13.625 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
YASMEEN QURESHI:
Seventeen-year-old Maddie
Dalton is transgender. She says
she's always

38:13.725 --> 38:15.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been a girl, but didn't know it.

38:15.894 --> 38:17.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CASSANDRA KASEY, Parent:
Forever, she had
that little widow's peak.

38:17.929 --> 38:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: She came out to
her parents
when she was 15 years old.

38:21.766 --> 38:25.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CASSANDRA KASEY: It was chaotic
at first.

38:25.303 --> 38:28.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the way I felt it in the
very beginning,
when I was still coming to terms
with it,

38:28.806 --> 38:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was, if I had a friend who came
to me and
said that their child had come
out to them

38:32.343 --> 38:36.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as transgender, I would have
thought, hooray.
You know, your -- this young
person is becoming

38:36.915 --> 38:38.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who they are.

38:38.850 --> 38:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why would I not afford my
own child that
same -- that same blessing? So,
even though

38:43.321 --> 38:46.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was difficult, it was the
only right thing
to do.

38:46.791 --> 38:52.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: Maddie is a
junior at Atherton
High School in Louisville,
Kentucky. She was

38:52.497 --> 38:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first openly transgender
student at the
school.

38:55.800 --> 39:02.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADDIE DALTON: I was a little
bit hesitant
right at first, but I knew that,
being at

39:02.807 --> 39:06.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Atherton, I would be -- I would
be pretty
safe.

39:06.244 --> 39:11.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: A public high
school with
about 1,300 students, Atherton
is one of the

39:11.249 --> 39:16.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
highest-ranked schools in the
state. It's
known for its international
studies program

39:16.454 --> 39:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and as a place where diversity
is embraced.

39:19.624 --> 39:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY PRINCE, Teacher, Atherton
High School:
Developing a safe climate for
students is

39:28.766 --> 39:35.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fundamental. And I think that we
did -- we
were doing that here before we
ever started

39:35.740 --> 39:37.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the transgender issue.

39:37.709 --> 39:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: Humanities
teacher Tony Prince
supervises the school's LGBT
student group.

39:43.381 --> 39:46.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maddie confided in him about her
newly realized
gender identity.

39:46.951 --> 39:51.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY PRINCE: I asked her what
that means.
You know, what would the school
look like

39:51.956 --> 39:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to her if it were accepting of
her as a transgender
person? And so she wrote a
little list of

39:58.363 --> 40:00.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

40:00.164 --> 40:06.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADDIE DALTON: I wanted it to be
enforced
that students and teachers
should use my name

40:06.504 --> 40:13.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and pronouns and to use the
space that I identify
with, so bathrooms and locker
rooms.

40:13.211 --> 40:17.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: Atherton didn't
have a protocol
for transgender students. The
decision was

40:17.749 --> 40:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left to principal Dr. Thomas
Aberli.

40:19.717 --> 40:23.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. THOMAS ABERLI, Principal,
Atherton High
School: Our school protects all
students,

40:24.022 --> 40:29.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that the issue of gender
identity has
simply been a demonstration of
the school's

40:29.861 --> 40:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
commitment to respecting all
individuals in
our school.

40:33.131 --> 40:37.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: Aberli agreed
to Maddie's
requests and, after much
consideration, so

40:37.835 --> 40:43.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did the school council, making
it the first
school in Kentucky to adopt an
official policy

40:43.541 --> 40:45.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for transgender students.

40:45.543 --> 40:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: This policy is completely
disregarding
the privacy of all of their
students.

40:49.147 --> 40:53.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: A group of
parents, students
and community members publicly
objected and

40:53.918 --> 40:56.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hired an attorney to appeal the
decision.

40:56.321 --> 41:01.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: The girls at this school
expect to
be able to go into a restroom
and feel safe.

41:01.225 --> 41:03.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because of this policy, we no
longer have
that assurance.

41:03.561 --> 41:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: The group
called for transgender
students to use a private or
unisex bathroom.

41:08.933 --> 41:10.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why would that be a problem for
you?

41:10.802 --> 41:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADDIE DALTON: First of all, it
makes you
a target for bullying and, like,
harassment.

41:17.742 --> 41:23.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It puts it in everyone's minds
that you are
different, and you are something
to be looked

41:23.448 --> 41:32.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at, not as, like, a person, but
as whatever
characteristic is
differentiating you, like

41:32.557 --> 41:34.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
being trans.

41:34.359 --> 41:37.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: After months of
debate at
Atherton High School, the policy
was upheld,

41:37.895 --> 41:39.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but the opposition didn't stop
there.

41:39.797 --> 41:43.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KENT OSTRANDER, Executive
Director, The Family
Foundation: Young ladies, girls,
may not want

41:43.468 --> 41:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a biological male in their
bathroom. That's
kind of the traditional way we
have done things

41:49.607 --> 41:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since the founding of this
nation.

41:51.709 --> 41:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: Kent Ostrander
is the director
of The Family Foundation of
Kentucky, a conservative

41:56.481 --> 42:02.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advocacy organization. Last
year, it supported
a statewide bill that would have
overturned

42:02.186 --> 42:05.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Atherton's policy. But it was
never passed
into law.

42:05.556 --> 42:11.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENT OSTRANDER: The legislation
simply said
that schools could do all kinds
of accommodations

42:11.763 --> 42:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for their students, including
transgender
students. But the one thing that
they could

42:16.100 --> 42:24.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not do is put -- is mix the
biological sexes
in a bathroom, a locker room at
the same time.

42:24.575 --> 42:27.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUZANNE ECKES, Indiana
University: According
to guidelines coming from the
U.S. Department

42:27.879 --> 42:30.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of education and the U.S.
Department of Justice,
that is discrimination.

42:31.015 --> 42:35.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: Education
policy professor
Suzanne Eckes is referring to a
letter the

42:35.920 --> 42:42.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama administration sent to
schools last
month. It directed them to allow
transgender

42:42.527 --> 42:46.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students access to bathrooms and
locker rooms
based on their gender identity.

42:46.764 --> 42:53.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZANNE ECKES: The department
has interpreted
gender identity to fall under
the Title IX

42:54.005 --> 42:58.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
law, which prohibits
discrimination based
on sex. We don't have a lot of
court guidance

42:58.943 --> 43:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on it. So, if you're in a state
that has no
litigation on this particular
topic, the only

43:05.116 --> 43:08.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing you really have to go on
is the recent
"Dear Colleague" letter.

43:08.386 --> 43:13.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YASMEEN QURESHI: However,
several Republican
state leaders are advising
schools to ignore

43:13.157 --> 43:16.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the guidance, putting them at
risk of losing
federal funding.

43:16.727 --> 43:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KENT OSTRANDER: Why does there
have to be
a new federal government law
telling everybody

43:21.866 --> 43:26.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how they're going to do the
bathrooms? That's
just crazy. Why is the federal
government

43:26.604 --> 43:28.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interested in bathrooms?

43:28.773 --> 43:32.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because states can make that
decision on their
own. Parents can make that
decision.

43:32.543 --> 43:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUZANNE ECKES: I don't think
this is a Democrat
or Republican or liberal or
conservative issue.

43:37.882 --> 43:41.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a civil rights issue.
This isn't a
states' rights issue. This is a
civil rights

43:41.819 --> 43:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue. Transgender students, for
years, have
been ostracized in public
schools.

43:47.325 --> 43:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: Nearly half of
transgender
teens report having suicidal
thoughts. And

43:52.830 --> 43:57.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their rates of depression and
anxiety are
far higher than the average.

43:57.301 --> 44:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Good morning, Atherton High
School.

44:00.738 --> 44:06.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: It's been over
two years
since Atherton High School
adopted its bathroom

44:06.210 --> 44:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy, and several students at
the school
have since come out as
transgender.

44:13.284 --> 44:17.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Principal Aberli says that,
despite early
objections to the policy, most
students have

44:17.889 --> 44:19.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
embraced it.

44:19.757 --> 44:22.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NATALIE STASTNY, Student,
Atherton High School:
It's just going to the bathroom.
You go do

44:22.960 --> 44:27.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your business, then you wash
your hands, and
then you leave. It's just
simple. And when

44:27.498 --> 44:30.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people make a big deal about it,
it just kind
of gets blown out of proportion.

44:30.601 --> 44:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIJA MACKEY, Student, Atherton
High School:
Coming from, like, a religious
background,

44:33.271 --> 44:38.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, I am Christian, and people
don't necessarily
agree with that type of stuff.
But I have

44:38.843 --> 44:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been going to this school for
two years, and
it's just routine. Like,
everyone gets to

44:44.482 --> 44:48.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the restroom, everyone gets out.
It's nothing,
nothing. It's not a big deal.

44:48.686 --> 44:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. THOMAS ABERLI: Something I
struggled with
originally was just
understanding the difference

44:52.590 --> 44:57.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
between what it meant to
discriminate vs.
accommodate when it came to this
issue. If

44:58.095 --> 45:02.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any student said that they were
uncomfortable
with using a restroom, then they
can choose

45:02.867 --> 45:04.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an alternate restroom.

45:04.902 --> 45:10.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're not to compel other
people to act
differently just because they
make someone

45:10.508 --> 45:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else feel uncomfortable. That is
not what
our country is about. That is
not a right

45:15.613 --> 45:21.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to privacy.
YASMEEN QURESHI: The school
provides access
to private faculty restrooms for
any student

45:21.819 --> 45:23.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who requests it.

45:23.654 --> 45:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MADDIE DALTON: It all comes down
to being
respected as a person and
accepted. Now, that's

45:31.095 --> 45:37.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all relying on the fundamental
assumption
that you respect being
transgender as a legitimate,

45:37.468 --> 45:43.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like, concept, as a legitimate
thing. And
I think that's where most of the
trouble comes

45:43.441 --> 45:45.142 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

45:45.242 --> 45:48.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YASMEEN QURESHI: In Louisville,
Kentucky,
this is Yasmeen Qureshi of

back in a moment.

45:53.818 --> 45:58.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, take this time to
hear from your
local PBS station. It's a chance
to offer

45:58.422 --> 46:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your support, which helps keep
programs like
ours on the air.

46:06.197 --> 46:10.735 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

46:10.835 --> 46:33.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
