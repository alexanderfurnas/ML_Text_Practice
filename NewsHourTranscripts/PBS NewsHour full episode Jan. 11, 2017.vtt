JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.806 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.807 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And I'm Steve
Inskeep.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:09.076 --> 00:10.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I saw the
information.

00:10.077 --> 00:12.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I read the information outside
of that meeting.

00:12.913 --> 00:14.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's all fake news.

00:14.581 --> 00:18.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In his first news
conference
as president-elect, Donald Trump
takes on

00:18.385 --> 00:23.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports of Russian spying,
questions over
conflicts of interest with his
business, and

00:23.590 --> 00:25.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much more.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Also ahead: His
choice for
secretary of state faced
questions at a confirmation

00:27.961 --> 00:29.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hearing.

00:29.396 --> 00:32.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rex Tillerson was asked if
Russia's Vladimir
Putin is a war criminal.

00:32.232 --> 00:37.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, we continue
our series
The Obama Years with a look at
the president's

00:37.137 --> 00:38.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
efforts to fight climate change.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL BROWNER, Former Assistant
to the President
for Energy and Climate Change: I
think that

00:40.908 --> 00:45.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this president believes that
climate change
is real.

00:45.445 --> 00:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He believes there is a moral and
ethical imperative
to act.

00:49.850 --> 00:56.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.490 --> 00:58.525 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:58.558 --> 01:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

01:06.867 --> 01:11.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are having some guests join
me here at
the "NewsHour" anchor desk in
the coming weeks.

01:11.305 --> 01:15.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, it is Steve Inskeep,
who many of
you recognize from NPR's
"Morning Edition."

01:15.709 --> 01:16.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Steve.

01:16.710 --> 01:17.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: I'm delighted to
be here.

01:17.711 --> 01:18.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's an honor.

01:18.712 --> 01:19.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're so glad to
have you.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we are devoting much of
tonight's program
to our lead story, and that is
the Donald

01:23.417 --> 01:25.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump news conference today.

01:25.385 --> 01:29.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It came amid a swirl of stories
about the
president-elect and Russia.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: It's all
fake news.

01:32.592 --> 01:33.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's phony stuff.

01:33.660 --> 01:35.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It didn't happen.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was gotten by opponents
of ours.

01:38.398 --> 01:43.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At his first news
conference
since the election, Donald Trump
flatly denied

01:43.971 --> 01:47.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the Russians have any
compromising information
on him.

01:47.674 --> 01:51.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: But it should
never have been
released, but I read what was
released.

01:51.712 --> 01:53.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think it's a disgrace.

01:53.146 --> 01:54.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's an absolute
disgrace.

01:54.982 --> 02:00.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The bombshell
burst Tuesday
evening, when CNN reported the
president-elect

02:00.487 --> 02:04.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and President Obama were briefed
on the matter
last week.

02:04.524 --> 02:10.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The report included
unsubstantiated claims
that Russian intelligence
compiled a dossier

02:10.731 --> 02:14.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Mr. Trump during visits to
Moscow.

02:14.167 --> 02:21.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Web site BuzzFeed then
published a 35-page
cache of memos from the alleged
dossier, including

02:21.641 --> 02:28.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a claim of sexual activity
caught on a Moscow
hotel room surveillance camera.

02:28.248 --> 02:33.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times and other
major news organizations
said they had been aware of the
information

02:33.420 --> 02:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for months, but could not verify
the claims.

02:36.857 --> 02:41.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Mr. Trump insisted he
wouldn't put
himself in such a position.

02:41.361 --> 02:47.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I told many
people, be careful,
because you don't want to see
yourself on

02:47.534 --> 02:49.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
television.

02:49.202 --> 02:52.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are cameras all over the
place, and,
again, not just Russia, all
over.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does anyone really believe that
story?

02:55.008 --> 02:59.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm also very much of a
germaphobe, by the
way, believe me.

02:59.079 --> 03:03.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From there, the
president-elect
lit into the news media again.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He condemned BuzzFeed.

03:04.518 --> 03:09.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's a failing
pile of garbage
writing it.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they're going to suffer
the consequences.

03:11.191 --> 03:16.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he accused
CNN of being
fake news, and brushed off
persistent attempts

03:16.630 --> 03:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by its correspondent to ask a
question.

03:19.466 --> 03:25.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, CNN's parent company,
Time Warner,
defended its reporting, and
BuzzFeed said

03:25.605 --> 03:29.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it published what it called a
newsworthy document.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
As for the leak itself:

03:31.144 --> 03:36.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think it was
disgraceful,
disgraceful that the
intelligence agencies

03:36.049 --> 03:41.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allowed any information that
turned out to
be so false and fake out.

03:41.521 --> 03:44.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's a disgrace, and I
say that.

03:44.124 --> 03:47.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something that Nazi
Germany would
have done, and did do.

03:47.627 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On Russian
hacking more broadly,
the president-elect suggested an
upside to

03:52.799 --> 03:55.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the probing of Democratic Party
computers
and e-mails.

03:55.936 --> 04:00.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The hacking is bad
and it shouldn't
be done.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But look at the things that were
hacked.

04:02.375 --> 04:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look at what was learned from
that hacking,
that Hillary Clinton got the
questions to

04:07.180 --> 04:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the debate and didn't report it?

04:10.217 --> 04:12.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's a horrible thing.

04:12.052 --> 04:15.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Likewise, he
acknowledged the
intelligence verdict that
President Vladimir

04:15.655 --> 04:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin ordered the hacking, but
he didn't leave
it there.

04:18.859 --> 04:24.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think it was
Russia, but I
think we also get hacked by
other countries

04:24.431 --> 04:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and other people.

04:26.199 --> 04:30.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And looking
ahead, Mr. Trump
suggested the hacking will not
necessarily

04:30.537 --> 04:32.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hinder future cooperation with
Putin.

04:32.639 --> 04:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If Putin likes
Donald Trump,
guess what, folks?

04:37.077 --> 04:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's called an asset, not a
liability.

04:39.146 --> 04:46.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Russia will have much
greater respect
for our country when I'm leading
it than when

04:46.086 --> 04:48.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other people have led it.

04:48.188 --> 04:49.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You will see that.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia will respect our country
more.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He shouldn't have done it.

04:54.161 --> 04:55.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't believe he will be doing
it more.

04:56.029 --> 05:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There were also
questions about
the Trump Organization's
business ties to

05:00.901 --> 05:02.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia, and he denied there are
any.

05:03.003 --> 05:05.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We could make
deals in Russia
very easily if we wanted to.

05:06.006 --> 05:08.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just don't want to, because I
think that
would be a conflict.

05:08.708 --> 05:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I have no loans, no dealings
and no current
pending deals.

05:13.446 --> 05:18.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump has not
released
tax returns to verify his
claims, and he said

05:18.652 --> 05:23.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again he won't do so until a
federal audit
is finished.

05:23.456 --> 05:29.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also declined to say whether
his associates
or campaign staff had contact
with Russian

05:29.563 --> 05:32.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
officials during the campaign.

05:32.165 --> 05:39.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An ABC reporter tweeted later
that the president-elect
denied any such contact after
the news conference

05:39.239 --> 05:41.374 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ended.

05:41.408 --> 05:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a closer look at Russia,
the president-elect,
and these latest revelations
with former attorney

05:47.514 --> 05:49.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the National Security Agency
Susan Hennessey.

05:49.916 --> 05:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is now a fellow at the
Brookings Institution
and is managing editor for the
Web site Lawfare

05:55.956 --> 05:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the intersection of the
law and national
security.

05:59.426 --> 06:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And John Sipher, he served
almost 30 years
at the CIA, both in the agency's
clandestine

06:05.165 --> 06:07.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
service and executive ranks.

06:07.367 --> 06:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was stationed in Moscow in
the 1990s and
he ran the CIA's Russia program
for three

06:13.240 --> 06:14.207 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

06:14.241 --> 06:17.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's now at CrossLead, a
consulting firm.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.045 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

06:19.079 --> 06:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So let's start, Susan Hennessey,
but I just
want to ask both of you in
brief, what do

06:22.148 --> 06:23.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you make of this report?

06:23.183 --> 06:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN HENNESSEY, Brookings
Institution: Right.

06:24.884 --> 06:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for the moment, the real
story is the
allegations themselves are
unverified.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're obviously quite
salacious in nature.

06:31.758 --> 06:35.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real story is that the
intelligence community
thought it was appropriate to
brief the president

06:35.862 --> 06:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United States and the
president-elect.

06:37.464 --> 06:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means that serious people
are taking
this seriously.

06:40.934 --> 06:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's different than saying
that the intelligence
community believes the
allegations or has

06:45.705 --> 06:47.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
substantiated them.

06:47.474 --> 06:51.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is a matter that is not
just simply
a matter of fake news or
something that we

06:51.511 --> 06:52.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should disregard.

06:52.746 --> 06:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It clearly passes some degree of
preliminary
credibility.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Sipher, your
take?

06:57.484 --> 07:00.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER, Former CIA Officer:
I think the
question is, is this real?

07:00.487 --> 07:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are things on the
positive side
and the negative side on that.

07:03.857 --> 07:08.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the positive side, for those
of us who
have lived and worked and worked
in Russia

07:08.061 --> 07:09.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and against the Russians, it
does feel right.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It does feel like the kind of
thing that Russians
do.

07:12.465 --> 07:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of those details fit.

07:14.100 --> 07:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, I think, the author has
some credibility,
which is on the positive side.

07:18.405 --> 07:20.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the
former British
intelligence officer.

07:20.974 --> 07:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: That's right.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.743 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

07:23.777 --> 07:26.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the negative side, it really
is hard to
make a distinction if we don't
know who those

07:26.446 --> 07:27.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sources are.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talks about his sources
providing various
information.

07:30.617 --> 07:34.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the CIA, before we would put
out a report
like that, an intelligence
report, there could

07:34.454 --> 07:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be, you know, hundreds of pages
of information
on that person's access, on
their suitability,

07:38.858 --> 07:39.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on their personality.

07:39.893 --> 07:41.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't have that.

07:41.728 --> 07:45.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, secondly, the fact that a
lot of this
reporting is the presidential
administration

07:45.899 --> 07:49.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Russia and the Kremlin is a
little bit
worrying, because, I mean,
that's essentially

07:50.003 --> 07:51.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a hard nut to crack.

07:51.838 --> 07:54.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And U.S. intelligence agencies
have been trying
to do that for years, and the
fact that he

07:54.574 --> 07:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has this much data about them
does put it
into question a little bit.

07:58.178 --> 08:01.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Hennessey,
let's talk
about your organization,
Lawfare.

08:01.881 --> 08:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had a copy of this, what,
several weeks
ago.

08:05.018 --> 08:10.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you started looking into it,
decided not
to put it out, but you did look
into it.

08:10.256 --> 08:15.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How did you go about figuring
out or trying
to figure out what's real and
what isn't here?

08:15.562 --> 08:17.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: Right.

08:17.397 --> 08:22.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the document was shared with
us to -- so
that we could provide some
professional input

08:22.135 --> 08:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as to whether or not it was
credible.

08:24.437 --> 08:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we were satisfied that the
relevant government
entities were aware of the
documents, and

08:31.010 --> 08:36.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then like everybody else, we
attempted to
talk to people in various
communities to see

08:36.516 --> 08:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether or not the allegations
seemed credible
to them.

08:41.321 --> 08:46.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the point that we're at
now, it's
really not about our
organization or anyone

08:46.626 --> 08:48.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
else verifying the specific
facts.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The FBI is conducting an
investigation.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will expect -- there are very
specific
allegations in this document.

08:55.335 --> 08:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those allegations can either be
proven true
or proven false.

08:58.772 --> 09:03.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we should expect some
answers that
provide some additional clarity.

09:03.843 --> 09:07.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One important note is just
because a single
fact in the document is true, it
doesn't mean

09:07.647 --> 09:09.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the rest of the document is
true.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just because a single fact
in the document
is false, that doesn't mean the
rest of the

09:12.919 --> 09:13.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
document is false.

09:13.920 --> 09:15.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That the entire
thing is false.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, John Sipher, let's go back
to what you
said a minute ago.

09:16.990 --> 09:21.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You said there are parts of this
that are
credible, and you said it's the
way the Russians

09:21.060 --> 09:22.028 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
operate.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you mean by that?

09:23.496 --> 09:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: It must look odd to
views or
anybody who has read this thing.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's such a different world.

09:28.735 --> 09:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But Russia is a police state.

09:29.969 --> 09:33.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia has been a police state
for much of
its history.

09:33.206 --> 09:35.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is the way they often
do business.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They collect blackmail on
people.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I lived there, we had audio
and video
in our houses.

09:39.879 --> 09:43.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We were followed all the time.

09:43.249 --> 09:48.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Restaurants and places, hotels
like this are
-- have video and audio in them.

09:48.488 --> 09:50.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They collect this.

09:50.290 --> 09:53.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They do psychological profiling
of people
to try to see who might be
sources for them.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is just the way the
Russians operate.

09:55.328 --> 10:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So when you read this, it smacks
of the kind
of thing that we would believe
is credible.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That doesn't mean it is.

10:01.267 --> 10:02.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The methods.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: Right, the methods,
right, and
the -- right.

10:04.270 --> 10:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you went on
to say that
the precise details in here are
not borne

10:10.109 --> 10:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, are not verified by any
individuals outside
of this report, the British --
the British

10:15.482 --> 10:16.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.117 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: Right.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in that sense, it's
difficult because
of the hyperpartisan atmosphere
here.

10:20.153 --> 10:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that this is now in the
public is
going to spin up on the
salacious details

10:24.424 --> 10:29.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and these type of things,
whereas I think
the FBI does have a lot of
experience doing

10:29.462 --> 10:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very sensitive investigations
like this, working
with partners overseas and
others to try to

10:35.668 --> 10:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put this together, because there
are a lot
of details that we as citizens
can't follow

10:38.872 --> 10:39.839 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up on.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did people travel during those
certain days?

10:42.542 --> 10:44.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who are these people?

10:44.210 --> 10:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the kind of stuff
that we just
can't do, and the FBI can and
will.

10:47.146 --> 10:51.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For example,
Susan Hennessey,
there's a reference in here to
an attempt

10:51.718 --> 10:59.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get the FISA court, the court
that has
to OK investigations,
surveillance of individuals,

10:59.526 --> 11:04.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
permission for them to look at
four different
people who were working for the
Trump campaign,

11:04.297 --> 11:05.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Trump Organization.

11:05.965 --> 11:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How unusual would something like
that be?

11:08.101 --> 11:12.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: So, certainly,
it's highly
unusual in the context of a
political campaign

11:13.006 --> 11:16.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or a presidential election.

11:16.409 --> 11:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, there is news reports
that perhaps
there were additional attempts
to secure a

11:20.547 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FISA warrant, and that the FBI
reportedly
obtained one in October.

11:26.886 --> 11:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the allegations in the
documents are true,
are accurate, those are the
kinds of things

11:32.225 --> 11:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that would fall within FISA.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the type of warrant that
the government
would pursue.

11:39.933 --> 11:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, just like everything
else, we're
a step away from actually
verifying the substance

11:45.405 --> 11:46.372 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Verifying.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Sipher, if you're in charge
of the investigation
to figure out what is and what
isn't right,

11:51.210 --> 11:54.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if anything is accurate in here,
what do you
need to do now?

11:54.380 --> 11:59.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: What you need to do
is take each
piece of this document and run
it to ground.

11:59.419 --> 12:04.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you need to find out -- they
talk -- the
issue here is not the salacious
details, the

12:04.123 --> 12:05.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
blackmail piece.

12:05.892 --> 12:10.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The issue here is the criminal
behavior if
people in the Trump campaign
were working

12:10.063 --> 12:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Russian intelligence to
collect information
on Americans.

12:12.398 --> 12:15.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that's the case, there's a
lot of detail
in there that needs to be
verified.

12:15.468 --> 12:20.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to find out, did the
people travel
on the days they said they
traveled, those

12:20.273 --> 12:21.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
type of things?

12:21.975 --> 12:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there are a lot of things to
run down
that you can run down with your
partners and

12:25.178 --> 12:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information that you can collect
as part of
an investigation in U.S. travel
records, all

12:29.282 --> 12:30.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these type of things.

12:30.516 --> 12:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Hennessey,
what would
you add to that?

12:32.352 --> 12:38.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you were involved in trying
to determine
if any parts of this are
accurate or to verify

12:38.524 --> 12:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they're not accurate, how
would do you
that?

12:40.893 --> 12:42.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: Right.

12:42.729 --> 12:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, certainly, the FBI is going
to be calling
on all of their resources to
investigate the

12:46.399 --> 12:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specific allegations, things
like travel records,
things like financial documents.

12:51.638 --> 12:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're also going to need to
draw on intelligence
sources.

12:54.040 --> 13:01.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there are specific sort
of comments
about meetings between Putin and
others, very

13:01.080 --> 13:03.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of high-level, high-value
intelligence
targets.

13:03.850 --> 13:09.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They would really need to reach
very deeply
into their intelligence networks
and the networks

13:09.989 --> 13:15.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of allied intelligence agencies
in order to
see if anything to lend
credibility or substantiate

13:15.728 --> 13:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these very serious allegations.

13:17.664 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Sipher, we
saw that Senator
John McCain had a role, the
Republican senator,

13:21.634 --> 13:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of course, from Arizona, had a
role in this.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did he come into this, and
does that tell
us anything?

13:27.206 --> 13:31.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: Well, Senator
McCain, obviously,
has a lot of experience working
with the government

13:31.377 --> 13:35.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on sensitive things and has
always been a
hawk on Russia issues.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I'm supportive of that.

13:36.115 --> 13:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think he's been good in that
case.

13:39.052 --> 13:43.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My understanding is the author
of this himself
provided information, this
information to

13:43.823 --> 13:47.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get to the FBI, through Mr.
McCain, who got
the information through the FBI.

13:47.727 --> 13:50.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, obviously, other news
places had it.

13:50.963 --> 13:55.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's interesting is President
Trump, president-elect
Trump seems to think that the
intelligence

13:55.535 --> 13:59.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agencies themselves leaked this
information,
whereas it doesn't seem to me
that that's

13:59.572 --> 14:01.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the case.

14:01.407 --> 14:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that you and others
have had this
for so long and actually held
off on putting

14:04.911 --> 14:10.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it suggests to me that this
information has
been out there for a while, and
I think that's

14:11.017 --> 14:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why General Clapper and others
briefed the
president-elect on this last
Friday.

14:15.588 --> 14:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would you
add to that?

14:16.989 --> 14:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: So, I think
this is an incredibly
important point.

14:19.425 --> 14:23.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when President-elect Trump
today seemed
to suggest that he believes the
intelligence

14:23.329 --> 14:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community leaked this, saying it
would be
a blot if they had done so,
there's absolutely

14:28.134 --> 14:32.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
no indication that the
intelligence community
is the source of the documents.

14:32.472 --> 14:37.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BuzzFeed, the organization that
published
this document, this is actually
not even an

14:37.577 --> 14:38.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intelligence community document.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a private company.

14:39.846 --> 14:42.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not even classified
material.

14:42.548 --> 14:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a little bit, there is a
suspicion
that once again Donald Trump is
using his

14:48.121 --> 14:52.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
personal attacks on the
intelligence community
a little bit to divert attention
away from

14:52.558 --> 14:54.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the substance of the
allegations.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly to
both of you,
how confident are you that we're
going to

14:56.829 --> 15:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know eventually whether this is
-- whether
any of this is accurate?

15:00.266 --> 15:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN SIPHER: I have confidence.

15:02.301 --> 15:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, I have confidence that the
FBI is going
to follow this through.

15:06.439 --> 15:09.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My nervousness is that these
kind of things
are going to dribble and drabble
out for the

15:09.575 --> 15:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next several years and cause a
real problem
for this administration going
forward.

15:13.579 --> 15:17.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN HENNESSEY: Because this is
so important
to the credibility of the
president, we would

15:17.283 --> 15:21.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really want to see him establish
some kind
of independent commission or
council in order

15:21.254 --> 15:25.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to really get to the bottom of
these facts
and provide some reassurance to
the American

15:25.558 --> 15:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people, not only that this is
being investigated,
but also that president-elect
Trump himself

15:30.062 --> 15:31.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is taking this matter very
seriously.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Hennessey,
John Sipher,
we thank you both.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN SIPHER: Thank you.

15:37.904 --> 15:50.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Now, during his
press conference,
the president-elect said
something that no

15:51.017 --> 15:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president-elect may have said
before.

15:53.186 --> 15:56.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he had just turned down
a multibillion-dollar
business deal.

15:56.989 --> 16:03.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: Over the
weekend, I was offered $2
billion to do a

16:03.095 --> 16:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal in Dubai with a very, very,
very amazing
man, a great, great developer
from the Middle

16:09.936 --> 16:15.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
East, Hussain Damac, a friend of
mine, great
guy.

16:15.942 --> 16:25.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was offered $2 billion to
do a deal
in Dubai, a number of deals.

16:25.952 --> 16:27.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I turned it down.

16:27.687 --> 16:31.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Now, $2 billion,
his friend
Hussain Damac was apparently a
man with a

16:31.858 --> 16:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different last name, who runs a
company called
DAMAC Group.

16:34.727 --> 16:39.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, nevertheless, the talk of a
deal in a
key Persian Gulf nation, days
before he moves

16:40.032 --> 16:46.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the White House, suggests
the clash between
the president's duties and his
worldwide business.

16:46.138 --> 16:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect says he has
a plan to
manage those conflicts, which
we're going

16:49.242 --> 16:51.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to evaluate this evening.

16:51.210 --> 16:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That plan includes turning the
business over
to his two older sons, plus a
business executive.

16:56.315 --> 16:59.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His sons aren't supposed to tell
him what
they're doing.

16:59.085 --> 17:04.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president-elect will
step back from
management, but remain the owner
of Trump

17:04.223 --> 17:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Organization, and the company
will avoid new
overseas business deals.

17:08.494 --> 17:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump said he's doing this,
even though
the law would allow him to keep
making deals

17:12.765 --> 17:14.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as president.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I don't like the
way that looks,
but I would be able to do that
if I wanted

17:17.803 --> 17:19.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

17:19.038 --> 17:19.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would be the only one that
would be able
to do that.

17:19.972 --> 17:21.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't do that in any other
capacity.

17:21.707 --> 17:26.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as a president, I could run
the Trump
Organization, great, great
company, and I

17:26.913 --> 17:28.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could run the company -- the
country.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would do a very good job, but
I don't want
to do that.

17:31.017 --> 17:35.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: The
president-elect is correct
that a federal conflict of
interest law excludes

17:35.454 --> 17:37.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president, but what about
all the other
issues?

17:37.757 --> 17:41.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have brought in two lawyers
who managed
ethics issues for two
presidents.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richard Painter did it for
President George
W. Bush.

17:44.563 --> 17:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Norm Eisen did it for President
Obama.

17:46.832 --> 17:48.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, Mr. Eisen, let's start with
you.

17:48.634 --> 17:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president-elect suggests he
is going above
and beyond.

17:52.238 --> 17:53.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Is he?

17:53.539 --> 17:55.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORMAN EISEN, Former Special
Counsel to President
Obama: No.

17:55.374 --> 18:03.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going beneath and below the
minimum floor
that's required by law, that's
required by

18:03.482 --> 18:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our most fundamental law, the
Constitution,
that is established by what
every president

18:09.889 --> 18:16.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for four decades has done, that
ethics require
and that common sense requires,
Steve.

18:16.696 --> 18:18.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This was a sad day.

18:19.031 --> 18:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wasn't happy to see what
happened here.

18:22.601 --> 18:28.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what the president has
announced fails
every aspect of the bipartisan
consensus that

18:28.874 --> 18:35.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has emerged on what he should
do, and it's
going to lead to scandal and
corruption and

18:35.181 --> 18:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a constitutional crisis from the
moment he's
sworn in.

18:38.584 --> 18:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: OK, you mentioned
the law.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You mentioned common sense.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about common sense
here a little
bit here, Richard Painter.

18:43.522 --> 18:45.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will get to the law.

18:45.257 --> 18:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is wrong with turning over
management
of the company to his sons, who
it is said

18:50.696 --> 18:52.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
will act independently of him?

18:52.465 --> 18:53.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD PAINTER, Former
Associate Counsel
to President George W. Bush:
Well, he will

18:53.065 --> 18:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still own the company.

18:54.734 --> 19:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the problem is the company,
the Trump
Organization, has business deals
all over

19:00.339 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

19:01.774 --> 19:05.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some may be getting turned
down, although
some might get accepted.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are already deals in
place.

19:08.114 --> 19:16.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are deals with powerful
politicians
in Indonesia, with oligarchs in
the Philippines,

19:16.155 --> 19:17.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deals in Turkey.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, these are parts of the
world where
there's very important issues to
be dealt

19:20.993 --> 19:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with on behalf of the United
States and strategic
concerns.

19:24.330 --> 19:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can't have the president have
substantial
economic exposure himself in
these countries

19:31.837 --> 19:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and business partners who may be
in league
with foreign governments.

19:36.942 --> 19:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is an enormous conflict of
interests.

19:39.678 --> 19:44.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also have the president of
the president's
name being on buildings around
the world in

19:44.083 --> 19:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
places where it's questionable
whether these
other countries can protect
those buildings.

19:49.655 --> 19:54.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have the Obama Tower in
downtown
Paris or Nairobi or some place.

19:54.293 --> 19:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we couldn't protect it.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then we put the Trump name
up.

19:57.930 --> 20:01.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's going to be jeopardizing
the lives
of the people who live in those
buildings

20:01.567 --> 20:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and could drag the United States
into a conflict.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's only the beginnings of
the problems.

20:07.373 --> 20:11.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have potential mixing Trump
business with
United States government
business.

20:11.377 --> 20:14.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that would trigger a bribery
investigation.

20:14.680 --> 20:18.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we, of course, have
those payments
coming in from foreign
governments and companies

20:18.350 --> 20:22.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
controlled by foreign
governments that violate
the Constitution, unless they
sweep all of

20:22.955 --> 20:25.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
those out of the Trump
Organization as of
January 20.

20:25.658 --> 20:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they don't have the time to
do it.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: You mentioned
also the Constitution,
and I definitely want to get to
that, but

20:29.528 --> 20:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let's just refer to something
else that Norm
Eisen mentioned.

20:32.765 --> 20:38.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Norm Eisen said that this
arrangement violates
the bipartisan consensus about
ethics for

20:38.370 --> 20:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president of the United
States in recent
decades.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect, however,
brought out
a lawyer -- Sheri Dillon is her
name -- at

20:44.410 --> 20:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this press conference, and she
dismissed some
of the more conventional
solutions.

20:49.281 --> 20:51.117 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's watch.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERI DILLON, Attorney for
Donald Trump: Some
people have suggested a blind
trust, but you

20:52.985 --> 20:57.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cannot have a totally blind
trust with operating
businesses.

20:57.656 --> 21:01.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump can't un-know he
owns Trump
Tower.

21:01.694 --> 21:05.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the press will make sure
that any new
developments at the Trump
Organization are

21:05.865 --> 21:07.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well publicized.

21:07.633 --> 21:13.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Further, it would be impossible
to find an
institutional trustee that would
be competent

21:13.405 --> 21:16.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to run the Trump Organization.

21:16.575 --> 21:21.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The approach he is taking allows
Don and Eric
to preserve this great company
and its iconic

21:21.413 --> 21:23.149 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
assets.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Norm Eisen, I
have actually
heard this from a lot of people,
who said,

21:25.217 --> 21:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
blind trust, how can that be
possible, because
his assets are so visible?

21:29.455 --> 21:30.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His name is on buildings.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The name itself is the asset.

21:32.658 --> 21:35.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is she right that a blind trust
isn't going
to work?

21:35.161 --> 21:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NORMAN EISEN: No, she's wrong on
all three
of those points.

21:38.697 --> 21:47.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the first point, if it's a
problem that
he would still know things in a
blind trust,

21:47.740 --> 21:55.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much more of a problem is it
now, where
he has this completely
unprecedented continuing

21:55.781 --> 22:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ownership interest, and very
weak protections
that were outlined today for
communications

22:02.254 --> 22:04.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between and among his sons?

22:04.323 --> 22:08.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does anybody really believe that
they're not
going to be talking about the
business?

22:08.727 --> 22:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, number two, it actually
would be simple
to do this.

22:13.532 --> 22:20.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All Trump needs to do -- this is
not complicated
-- find an independent
professional trustee.

22:20.039 --> 22:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are plenty out there who
have dealt
with far more complications.

22:23.075 --> 22:28.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is -- the Trump
Organization is just
a big international family
business.

22:28.714 --> 22:30.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump signs it over.

22:30.216 --> 22:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is what we hoped in a
bipartisan way
and prayed would happen today.

22:33.552 --> 22:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He signs it over to the trustee.

22:35.154 --> 22:37.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The trustee figures out, what
can I sell?

22:37.790 --> 22:38.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do I sell it?

22:38.791 --> 22:40.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What can I borrow?

22:40.559 --> 22:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe I do a public equity, so
if it's not
sold on the market, the
executives buy it,

22:45.531 --> 22:50.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
package the less-indebted
properties with
the more-indebted properties.

22:50.636 --> 22:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump has enough to worry
about without
thinking about that.

22:53.405 --> 22:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, on the third point of
destroying
the business, the Donald Trump
name is at

22:57.843 --> 22:59.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an all-time high.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the best time to make
these moves.

23:01.580 --> 23:07.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the corruptions and the
scandals start
to flow, it's going to be much
harder.

23:07.386 --> 23:12.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is going to have to do
it, because
those negative consequences are
sure to follow.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: OK, just very
briefly here
now, the law.

23:15.494 --> 23:16.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You mentioned the law.

23:16.495 --> 23:18.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You mentioned the Constitution.

23:18.364 --> 23:22.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have said that the president
would violate
the Constitution if he continues
on this course.

23:22.468 --> 23:24.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Emoluments Clause is what
you're talking
about.

23:24.370 --> 23:26.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It prohibits gifts from a
foreign government.

23:26.705 --> 23:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president-elect's lawyer
says nobody
has defined a gift before for
that purpose.

23:31.110 --> 23:34.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she says the president doing
business
is not a gift.

23:34.246 --> 23:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERI DILLON: No one would have
thought, when
the Constitution was written,
that paying

23:38.017 --> 23:40.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your hotel bill was an
emolument.

23:40.386 --> 23:45.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, it would have been
thought of as
a value-for-value exchange, not
a gift, not

23:45.991 --> 23:48.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a title, and not an emolument.

23:48.460 --> 23:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But since president-elect Trump
has been elected,
some people want to define
emoluments to cover

23:53.465 --> 23:58.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
routine business transactions
like paying
for hotel rooms.

23:58.137 --> 24:03.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They suggest that the
Constitution prohibits
the businesses from even
arm's-length transactions

24:03.142 --> 24:08.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president-elect has
absolutely nothing
to do with and isn't even aware
of.

24:08.080 --> 24:09.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These people are wrong.

24:09.782 --> 24:12.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is not what the
Constitution says.

24:12.451 --> 24:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paying for a hotel room is not a
gift or a
present, and it has nothing to
do with an

24:17.089 --> 24:18.057 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
office.

24:18.090 --> 24:19.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not an emolument.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Richard Painter,
what's wrong
with that logic?

24:21.260 --> 24:22.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's routine business.

24:22.261 --> 24:26.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER: This is a
for-profit hotel.

24:26.165 --> 24:30.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is making profits over
dealing with foreign
governments.

24:30.536 --> 24:34.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Same with the loans from foreign
government-owned
banks.

24:34.206 --> 24:37.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are for a for-profit
business.

24:37.176 --> 24:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is prohibited under the
Emoluments Clause
of the Constitution.

24:41.046 --> 24:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, she's right on one point,
that you can't
take the Trump Tower, put it in
a trust, and

24:45.718 --> 24:47.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pretend you don't have it.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, the trustee will have
to sell the
Trump Tower.

24:50.656 --> 24:57.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He needs to make a decision,
does he wants
to be president, or does he want
to be a landlord

24:57.830 --> 24:59.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and a hotel owner?

24:59.531 --> 25:02.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has nine days to make that
decision.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I thought he'd already made it.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's what this is about.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He just doesn't want to give up
the hotel.

25:09.007 --> 25:13.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He doesn't want to give Trump
Tower to his
son or sell it.

25:13.545 --> 25:18.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is not that difficult to
sell a nice
building like that on Fifth
Avenue.

25:18.283 --> 25:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Norm Eisen, very
briefly, can
the president-elect resolve some
of these

25:21.553 --> 25:25.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concerns just by being a lot
more transparent
about who is paying what for
what?

25:25.958 --> 25:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN EISEN: Well, Professor
Painter and
I laid out yesterday a scorecard
of five criteria.

25:32.831 --> 25:37.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of them was to have
strong ethics
provisions with strong
transparency around

25:37.903 --> 25:39.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them, an ethics firewall.

25:39.505 --> 25:42.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we made the point that alone
is not enough.

25:42.241 --> 25:46.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is going to be -- as
Professor Painter
says, emoluments covers all of
the different

25:46.979 --> 25:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
benefits that he's getting,
loans, permits,
trademarks, other things outside
the hotel,

25:54.186 --> 25:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
selling apartments to foreign
government agents
and sovereigns.

25:58.924 --> 26:03.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to be in violation of
the Constitution
on day one, and no amount of
transparency

26:03.962 --> 26:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can cure that offense against
our founding
document.

26:07.900 --> 26:12.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Could they solve
some of this
problem by releasing the
president-elect's

26:12.438 --> 26:14.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax return?

26:14.273 --> 26:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORMAN EISEN: It's critical that
the tax returns
come out, particularly today,
when there's

26:18.410 --> 26:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been so much talk about Russia,
Steve.

26:21.213 --> 26:27.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Professor Painter and I wrote
during the campaign
that there's an enormous amount
of information

26:27.319 --> 26:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about foreign governments,
gifts, payments,
partnerships, even business
expenses, possibly,

26:37.129 --> 26:39.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in deductions taken.

26:39.331 --> 26:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Given the nature of the Russia
allegations,
we need to see that.

26:43.535 --> 26:50.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Richard and I said today
that all Russia-related
aspects of the tax returns
should be released.

26:50.843 --> 26:55.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Intelligence Committees
should get
the full tax returns to put
these Russia allegations

26:55.914 --> 26:57.416 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to bed.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Norm Eisen was
the top ethics
lawyer for President Obama.

27:00.185 --> 27:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Richard Painter was the top
ethics lawyers
for President George W. Bush.

27:02.988 --> 27:05.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, thanks to you both.

27:05.657 --> 27:10.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORMAN EISEN: Thanks, Steve.

27:10.395 --> 27:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD PAINTER: Thank you.

27:15.100 --> 27:21.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
president-elect made news
on a number of other fronts
today.

27:21.273 --> 27:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our John Yang was in the room
this morning,
and he joins us now from Trump
Tower.

27:25.878 --> 27:30.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, John, as we said before,
it's been a long
time since Mr. Trump had had a
news conference,

27:30.249 --> 27:31.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
almost six months.

27:31.917 --> 27:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before you tell us what more he
said, give
us a sense of the room, the
scene.

27:36.421 --> 27:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It was in the lobby
here of Trump
Tower, the pink marble lobby of
the tower.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was standing room only.

27:44.363 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two hours before the session
began, all the
seats had already been claimed,
reporters,

27:50.035 --> 27:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
photographers, camera crews from
all around
the globe.

27:53.705 --> 27:58.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was if there was a
pent-up demand to
ask questions of the
president-elect.

27:58.644 --> 28:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Mr. Trump didn't disappoint.

28:01.246 --> 28:04.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to all the big
headlines that
you have already talked about,
he made news

28:04.983 --> 28:08.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on some other fronts, on
Obamacare, for example.

28:08.120 --> 28:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he wants to move quickly
to repeal
and replace at the same time,
even though

28:13.926 --> 28:18.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some key lawmakers of his own
party say that
may be hard to do.

28:18.997 --> 28:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he's going to unveil his
own proposal
as a replacement as soon as
Representative

28:24.503 --> 28:28.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Price is confirmed as his
health and human
services secretary.

28:28.674 --> 28:31.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: So, the
easiest thing would be to let it
implode in

28:31.910 --> 28:33.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
'17.

28:33.145 --> 28:36.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, believe me, we'd get pretty
much whatever
we wanted.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it would take a long time.

28:38.183 --> 28:46.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to be submitting, as
soon as our
secretary is approved, almost
simultaneously,

28:46.158 --> 28:50.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shortly thereafter, a plan.

28:50.095 --> 28:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It will be repeal and replace.

28:54.366 --> 28:57.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It will be essentially
simultaneously.

28:58.003 --> 29:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be various segments, you
understand,
but will most likely be on the
same day or

29:03.408 --> 29:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same week, but probably the
same day.

29:05.410 --> 29:10.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now, that Price
nomination has
run into some headwinds over
questions about

29:10.415 --> 29:15.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his selling and trading health
care-related
stocks while he sits on the Ways
and Means

29:15.420 --> 29:17.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

29:17.055 --> 29:19.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some Democrats say they want to
know if he
profited from insider
information.

29:19.591 --> 29:23.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, another area
where he
made news had to do with filling
that vacancy

29:23.729 --> 29:29.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Supreme Court after the
death of Justice
Antonin Scalia almost a year
ago, during which

29:29.601 --> 29:34.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time Republicans didn't go along
with President
Obama's nominee.

29:34.072 --> 29:35.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: That's right.

29:35.807 --> 29:39.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And folks may remember that, in
September,
during the campaign, Mr. Trump
released a

29:39.711 --> 29:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
list of 21 possible nominees.

29:42.981 --> 29:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said today that he's already
begun interviewing
some of those candidates, and he
said he will

29:47.786 --> 29:54.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make his nomination to fill the
court vacancy
within two weeks after he's
inaugurated.

29:54.459 --> 29:59.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John, he also
spoke about the
issue that really helped launch
his campaign,

29:59.898 --> 30:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
building the border wall with
Mexico.

30:02.200 --> 30:06.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's right, that
signature issue
of the campaign.

30:06.872 --> 30:11.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said that Mexico is going to
pay for it
one way or another.

30:11.143 --> 30:16.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he doesn't want to wait
and negotiate
with Mexico about how they're
going to pick

30:16.081 --> 30:17.282 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up the tab.

30:17.315 --> 30:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he wants to start
building right away.

30:20.052 --> 30:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Vice President Mike Pence is
in charge
of making that happen.

30:24.122 --> 30:28.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, he says, he will
negotiate with
Mexico on picking up the tab.

30:28.427 --> 30:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
John, he and
his press spokesman had plenty
to say about

30:32.197 --> 30:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the press, about -- in the wake
of the story
today about the Russian intel
report on him.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That's right, Judy.

30:39.838 --> 30:43.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wouldn't be a Trump press
conference without
a little press bashing.

30:43.442 --> 30:47.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Interestingly enough, he started
out by saying
how glad he was to be there
holding a press

30:47.779 --> 30:48.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conference.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He sounded almost nostalgic for
news conferences.

30:50.515 --> 30:54.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He even credited news
conferences for winning
the nomination for him.

30:54.853 --> 31:00.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then things turned tense
later in the
session when he refused to take
a question

31:00.258 --> 31:02.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Jim Acosta of CNN.

31:02.527 --> 31:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CNN has been reporting very
aggressively on
this allegation that Russia has
compromising

31:09.234 --> 31:11.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
information about the
president-elect.

31:11.203 --> 31:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: CNN going out of
their way to
build it up, it's a disgrace.

31:18.176 --> 31:22.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM ACOSTA, CNN: Sir, since
you're attacking
us, can you give us a question?

31:22.647 --> 31:23.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mr. President-elect...

31:23.648 --> 31:24.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead.

31:26.318 --> 31:26.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM ACOSTA: Mr. President-elect,
since you
are attacking our news
organization...

31:26.952 --> 31:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, not you.

31:27.886 --> 31:28.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIM ACOSTA: ... can you give us
a chance?

31:28.854 --> 31:29.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Your organization
is terrible.

31:29.988 --> 31:30.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIM ACOSTA: You are attacking
our news organization.

31:30.956 --> 31:32.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Your organization
is terrible.

31:32.257 --> 31:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM ACOSTA: Can you give us a
chance to ask
a question, sir?

31:32.691 --> 31:33.625 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sir, can you...

31:33.658 --> 31:34.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Go ahead.

31:34.659 --> 31:35.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Quiet.

31:35.660 --> 31:36.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Quiet.

31:36.661 --> 31:37.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIM ACOSTA: Mr. President-elect,
can you say...

31:37.662 --> 31:38.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

31:38.663 --> 31:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: She's asking a
question.

31:39.664 --> 31:40.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't be rude.

31:40.665 --> 31:42.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't be rude.

31:42.067 --> 31:42.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM ACOSTA: Can you give us a
question since
you're attacking us?

31:42.734 --> 31:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Can you give us a question?

31:43.668 --> 31:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Don't be rude.

31:44.669 --> 31:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, I'm not going to give you a
question.

31:45.670 --> 31:46.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not going to give you a
question.

31:46.671 --> 31:47.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JIM ACOSTA: Can you state...

31:47.672 --> 31:48.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You are fake news.

31:48.673 --> 31:49.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Go ahead.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JIM ACOSTA: Sir, can you...

31:51.476 --> 31:53.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Since then, CNN has
pointed out
that they have refrained from
reporting on

31:53.211 --> 31:55.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the details of the alleged
dossier, unlike
BuzzFeed, because CNN hasn't
been able to

31:55.247 --> 31:57.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
independently verify any of the
information.

31:57.816 --> 32:01.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in any case, Judy, it looks
lie it's
going to be an interesting four
years in the

32:01.887 --> 32:03.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
White House Briefing Room.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's right,
John.

32:04.990 --> 32:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president-elect had strong
words for both
BuzzFeed and CNN.

32:10.228 --> 32:16.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang reporting from just
outside Trump
Tower, thank you.

32:16.935 --> 32:27.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: The
president-elect, as we
have heard, took some questions
about his

32:27.779 --> 32:29.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relationship with Russia.

32:29.414 --> 32:32.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many more questions today
went to his
choice for secretary of

32:32.617 --> 32:34.252 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Margaret Warner has been
watching the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee
hearing.

32:37.455 --> 32:43.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Rex Tillerson
was nearly
obscured by the mob of cameras
as he settled

32:43.295 --> 32:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in for the marathon session.

32:45.831 --> 32:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senators quickly focused on the
topic of Russia.

32:48.633 --> 32:54.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did Tillerson, as chairman and
CEO of ExxonMobil,
have too cozy a relationship
with Russian

32:54.606 --> 32:56.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Vladimir Putin?

32:56.942 --> 32:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Florida Republican Marco Rubio:

32:58.376 --> 32:59.611 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCO RUBIO (R), Florida: Is
Vladimir Putin
a war criminal?

33:01.112 --> 33:03.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, Secretary of
State Nominee:
I wouldn't use that term.

33:03.281 --> 33:05.217 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:05.250 --> 33:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCO RUBIO: In Aleppo, Mr.
Putin has directed
his military to conduct a
devastating campaign.

33:08.186 --> 33:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's targeted schools, markets.

33:10.021 --> 33:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's resulted in the death of
thousands of
civilians.

33:13.225 --> 33:16.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not the first time Mr.
Putin is involved
in campaigns of this kind.

33:16.661 --> 33:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: Those are very,
very serious
charges to make, and I would
want to have

33:21.399 --> 33:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much more information before
reaching a conclusion.

33:26.671 --> 33:28.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

33:28.306 --> 33:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: I would want to
be fully informed
before advising the president.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCO RUBIO: Well, are you aware
that people
who oppose Vladimir Putin wind
up dead all

33:34.613 --> 33:37.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the world, poisoned, shot
in the back
of the head?

33:37.649 --> 33:41.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And do you think that was
coincidental, or
do you think that it is quite
possible or

33:41.720 --> 33:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely, as I believe, that they
were a part
of an effort to murder his
political opponents?

33:45.790 --> 33:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: Well, people who
speak up for
freedom in regimes that are
repressive are

33:52.097 --> 33:55.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
often at threat, and these
things happen to
them.

33:55.700 --> 34:00.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of assigning specific
responsibilities,
I would have to have more
information.

34:00.539 --> 34:01.706 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCO RUBIO: None of this is
classified, Mr.
Tillerson.

34:02.941 --> 34:04.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These people are dead.

34:04.809 --> 34:09.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Tillerson, at
ExxonMobil,
brokered multibillion-dollar
deals with Russia,

34:09.447 --> 34:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meeting with Putin multiple
times.

34:11.516 --> 34:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2013, he received the Order
of Friendship
award from Putin himself.

34:16.755 --> 34:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Tillerson today said he'd
support continuing
sanctions against Russia for
now.

34:21.660 --> 34:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also implied his intimate
knowledge of
Russia meant he understood its
strategy, and

34:26.498 --> 34:29.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could anticipate its moves, to
America's benefit.

34:29.267 --> 34:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: Do you want this
to get worse?

34:32.170 --> 34:35.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Or does Russia desire a
different relationship?

34:35.307 --> 34:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not likely to ever be
friends.

34:38.576 --> 34:51.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I also know the Russian
people, because
of having spent so many years in
Russia.

34:51.823 --> 34:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is scope to define a
different relationship
that can bring down the
temperature around

34:58.997 --> 35:00.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the conflicts we have today.

35:00.865 --> 35:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Outside the
hearing and inside,
protesters called on senators to
reject the

35:06.271 --> 35:09.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nominee for his big oil ties.

35:09.107 --> 35:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tillerson promised to recuse
himself for a
year from any decisions that
would affect

35:13.345 --> 35:15.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ExxonMobil.

35:15.213 --> 35:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: My love of
country and my patriotism
is going to dictate that I serve
no one's

35:19.584 --> 35:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interests but that of the
American people
in advancing our own national
security.

35:23.655 --> 35:26.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Climate change
was also at
issue.

35:26.491 --> 35:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As candidate, president-elect
Trump called
it a hoax, and promised to pull
out of the

35:30.996 --> 35:34.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
new Paris agreement on
greenhouse gas emissions.

35:34.132 --> 35:39.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Exxon, Tillerson did oversee
the company's
shift from vigorously denying
climate change

35:39.971 --> 35:41.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to acknowledging it.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, he did the same, with a
caveat.

35:43.508 --> 35:47.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: I came to the
conclusion a
few years ago that the risk of
climate change

35:47.278 --> 35:48.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
does exist.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.081 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BOB CORKER (R), Tennessee: You
believe that
human activity, based on your
belief and the

35:52.050 --> 35:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
science, is contributing to
climate change?

35:54.419 --> 36:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: The increase in
the greenhouse
gas concentrations in the
atmosphere are having

36:00.425 --> 36:01.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an effect.

36:01.726 --> 36:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our ability to predict that
effect is very
limited.

36:05.797 --> 36:11.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: At steps along
the way, Tillerson
showed he diverges with Mr.
Trump, as here

36:11.036 --> 36:15.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on NATO's response following
Russia's annexation
of Crimea from Ukraine.

36:15.206 --> 36:17.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

36:17.142 --> 36:21.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEN CARDIN (D), Maryland: So,
your recommendation
would have been to do a more
robust supply

36:21.413 --> 36:22.447 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of military?

36:22.480 --> 36:24.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REX TILLERSON: Yes, sir.

36:24.849 --> 36:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what -- I think what Russian
leadership would
have understood is a powerful
response that

36:30.488 --> 36:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
indicated a, yes, you took the
Crimea, but
this stops right here.

36:35.960 --> 36:37.729 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

36:37.762 --> 36:38.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BEN CARDIN: And that's
encouraging to me to
hear you say that, because it's
not exactly

36:38.763 --> 36:41.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consistent with what Mr. Trump
has been saying.

36:41.166 --> 36:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Tillerson said
if Russia

36:48.273 --> 36:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had some tough words on
China, too, equating
its island-building in the South
China Sea

36:53.011 --> 36:55.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Russia's annexation of
Crimea.

36:55.914 --> 36:59.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump's penchant for
announcing policy
on Twitter also came up.

REP.

37:01.086 --> 37:04.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TODD YOUNG (R), Indiana: So, how
do you finesse
this?

37:04.089 --> 37:10.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How would you ensure the legs
are not cut
out from underneath you as the
nation's chief

37:10.495 --> 37:12.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
diplomat?

37:12.263 --> 37:16.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REX TILLERSON: Well, if
confirmed, and I am
able to serve this
president-elect, I don't

37:16.534 --> 37:20.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think I'm going to be telling
the boss how
he ought to communicate with
American people.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's going to be his choice.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.607 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

37:22.640 --> 37:26.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TODD YOUNG: Do you have in mind
any contingency
plans to address...

37:26.277 --> 37:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: Yes, I have his
cell phone
number.

37:30.148 --> 37:31.116 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

37:31.149 --> 37:32.283 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TODD YOUNG: OK.

37:32.317 --> 37:35.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: And he's promised
me he will
answer.

37:35.987 --> 37:40.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Tillerson's
confirmation
hearing is set to continue
tomorrow morning.

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

37:45.997 --> 37:57.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
a look back on President Obama's
struggle

37:57.041 --> 38:00.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to cement his legacy on climate
change.

38:00.411 --> 38:06.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first, in the rest of the
day's news:
This was the second and final
day of the confirmation

38:06.417 --> 38:10.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearing for Jeff Sessions, the
Trump nominee
to be attorney general.

38:10.722 --> 38:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Black leaders have strongly
criticized the
Alabama senator.

38:13.825 --> 38:17.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, as William Brangham
reports, their views
got a full airing today.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.464 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

38:19.497 --> 38:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORY BOOKER (D), New Jersey: I
know it is
exceptional for a senator to
testify against

38:22.100 --> 38:23.835 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
another senator

38:23.868 --> 38:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jeff Sessions
wasn't in
the room to hear it, but his
nomination drew

38:26.804 --> 38:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a rare rebuke from a Senate
colleague, Democrat
Cory Booker of New Jersey.

38:31.176 --> 38:33.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

38:33.077 --> 38:36.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORY BOOKER: He will be expected
to defend
the equal rights of gay and
lesbian and transgender

38:36.714 --> 38:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans, but his record
indicates that he
won't.

38:39.317 --> 38:44.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will be expected to defend
voting rights,
but his record indicates that he
won't.

38:44.122 --> 38:48.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Georgia
Congressman and
civil rights icon John Lewis
also spoke against

38:48.660 --> 38:49.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the nomination.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

38:51.462 --> 38:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LEWIS (D), Georgia: It
doesn't matter
how Senator Sessions may smile,
how friendly

38:55.366 --> 39:04.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he may be, how he may speak to
you, but we
need someone who's going to
stand up, speak

39:04.576 --> 39:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, and speak out for the people
that need
help, for people who have been
discriminated

39:13.384 --> 39:15.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
against.

39:15.186 --> 39:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Three black
officials who
worked with Sessions in the past
gave their

39:16.888 --> 39:18.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
support to the attorney
general-designate.

39:18.623 --> 39:22.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: Senator Sessions is
unquestionably qualified
for the job.

39:22.427 --> 39:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And a former
attorney general,
Michael Mukasey, came to his
defense as well.

39:27.165 --> 39:31.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY, Former U.S.
Attorney General:
Principled, intelligent,
knowledgeable, thorough,

39:31.970 --> 39:36.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
modest, and thoroughly dedicated
to the rule
of law and to the mission of the
department,

39:36.507 --> 39:39.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is to enforce the law and
to preserve
our freedoms.

39:39.110 --> 39:43.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sessions is
ultimately expected
to win easy confirmation in the
Senate.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

39:45.450 --> 39:49.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVE INSKEEP: Amid the
president's Cabinet
choices from outside Washington,
there are

39:49.921 --> 39:52.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some from well inside.

39:52.156 --> 39:55.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His choice for transportation
secretary is
Elaine Chao.

39:55.093 --> 39:56.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She served two previous
presidents.

39:56.995 --> 40:00.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she testified today with her
husband Mitch
McConnell behind her.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She spoke of using private money
to build
up public infrastructure.

40:03.968 --> 40:09.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELAINE CHAO, Secretary of
Transportation-Designate:
We all know that the government
doesn't have

40:09.073 --> 40:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the resources to do it all.

40:12.610 --> 40:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also important to recognize
that the
way we build and deliver
projects is just

40:18.650 --> 40:21.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as important as how much we
invest.

40:21.853 --> 40:25.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Now, Chao's words
hint at a
potential political conflict.

40:25.657 --> 40:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect says he
wants big spending
on roads and bridges and
airports.

40:29.994 --> 40:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats do too, but some
Republicans fought
that spending when President
Obama wanted

40:34.666 --> 40:37.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, and they don't agree yet on
how to pay
for it.

40:37.201 --> 40:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Trump also
today announced his nominee for
secretary

40:41.005 --> 40:42.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Veterans Affairs.

40:42.840 --> 40:48.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Shulkin is currently the
department's
top health official, managing
1,700 facilities

40:49.013 --> 40:51.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that treat nine million
veterans.

40:51.282 --> 40:56.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, Shulkin said he
is eager to
begin reforming a system plagued
by long wait

40:56.821 --> 40:58.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lines -- times.

40:58.656 --> 41:03.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: A federal judge
today formally
sentenced Dylann Roof to death
for killing

41:03.561 --> 41:06.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nine black worshipers at a
church in Charleston,
South Carolina.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A jury agreed on the sentence
yesterday.

41:08.366 --> 41:14.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Roof stared straight ahead
today as relatives
of some of the victims said they
forgive him,

41:14.138 --> 41:18.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but one called his name and
finally shouted
in frustration, "I wish you
would look at

41:18.476 --> 41:20.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
me, boy."

41:20.378 --> 41:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Afghanistan,
the death toll
climbed past 50 in Tuesday's
bombings in Kabul

41:25.116 --> 41:26.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Kandahar.

41:26.684 --> 41:30.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five diplomats from the United
Arab Emirates
died in the attack in Kandahar.

41:30.755 --> 41:34.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Persian Gulf state's
ambassador was among
the wounded.

41:34.425 --> 41:38.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Taliban claimed the Kabul
bombing, but
there's been no claim in the
Kandahar incident.

41:38.930 --> 41:43.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: In other news,
Volkswagen agreed
today to plead guilty to
criminal charges.

41:43.501 --> 41:48.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company will also pay $4.3
billion in
fines for cheating on emissions.

41:48.373 --> 41:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of a plea bargain with
the U.S.
Justice Department.

41:50.875 --> 41:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A grand jury has indicted six
high-ranking
V.W. employees for allegedly
lying to regulators

41:56.714 --> 41:59.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and destroying evidence, among
other charges.

41:59.917 --> 42:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal prosecutors say at least
40 people
took part in the fraud and the
cover-up.

42:03.054 --> 42:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORETTA LYNCH, U.S. Attorney
General: This
is a case that illustrates a
company that

42:09.293 --> 42:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at very high levels knew of this
problem and
deliberately chose to continue
with this fraudulent

42:15.600 --> 42:17.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behavior.

42:17.535 --> 42:21.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one reason why the
actions taken
here are so severe and do
devolve on individuals.

42:21.973 --> 42:26.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: We should mention
that Volkswagen
already settled civil charges
related to the

42:26.544 --> 42:28.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emissions cheating for $15
billion.

42:28.513 --> 42:33.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Eastern Europe is
struggling
to cope with a blast of bitter
cold and heavy

42:33.551 --> 42:34.719 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
snow.

42:34.752 --> 42:38.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials report at least 73
deaths in recent
days.

42:38.489 --> 42:43.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Temperatures have hit minus-14
in parts of
the Balkans, the coldest in more
than 50 years.

42:43.728 --> 42:49.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in Greece, medical
officials warned of
inhuman conditions at migrant
camps.

42:49.634 --> 42:54.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, in Northern
California, rescue
crews used boats to reach
stranded people

42:55.006 --> 42:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after the heaviest rain in a
decade.

42:57.475 --> 43:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands more have been urged
to evacuate
ahead of the floods.

43:00.845 --> 43:04.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And on Wall
Street, oil prices
went up, and so did stocks.

43:04.715 --> 43:08.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For weeks now, people have been
waiting for
the Dow to climb over 20000.

43:08.753 --> 43:10.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It hasn't quite happened yet.

43:10.288 --> 43:15.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It gained 98 points today to
close at 19954.

43:15.326 --> 43:21.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 11 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added six.

43:24.302 --> 43:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And finally
tonight, we continue
our series about The Obama
Years.

43:33.644 --> 43:38.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his farewell address last
night, the president
spoke of his actions against
climate change,

43:38.449 --> 43:41.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including a global accord to
reduce emissions.

43:41.786 --> 43:46.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did more as his time in
office went on,
despite opponents who criticized
the costs

43:46.057 --> 43:47.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or doubted the science.

43:48.025 --> 43:52.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien reports, as part
of our weekly

BARACK OBAMA, President of the

And that's why I invited Luther,
my anger

translator, to join me here
tonight.

heated debate
over global warming, this was a
night to remember.

44:05.543 --> 44:09.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: But we do need to
stay focused
on some big challenges, like
climate change.

44:09.614 --> 44:14.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY, Actor: Hey,
listen, you
all, if you haven't noticed,
California is

44:14.185 --> 44:16.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bone-dry.

44:16.087 --> 44:20.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: At the White
House Correspondents
Dinner in 2015, Barack Obama
became the first

44:20.491 --> 44:27.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president to openly scorn
climate change deniers,
with the help of comedian
Keegan-Michael Key

44:27.298 --> 44:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
playing the president's anger
translator,
Luther.

44:29.667 --> 44:33.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Instead of doing
anything about
it, we have got elected
officials throwing

44:33.504 --> 44:34.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
snowballs in the Senate.

44:34.939 --> 44:35.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY: OK.

44:35.940 --> 44:36.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

44:36.941 --> 44:37.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

44:37.942 --> 44:38.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think I got it, bro.

44:38.943 --> 44:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: It is crazy.

44:39.944 --> 44:41.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What about our kids?

44:41.178 --> 44:42.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What kind of stupid,
shortsighted, irresponsible
bull...

44:42.313 --> 44:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa,
whoa!

44:44.315 --> 44:45.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hey!

44:45.316 --> 44:46.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:46.884 --> 44:53.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: By all accounts,
the president's
frustration and anger were real.

44:53.324 --> 44:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL BROWNER, Former Assistant
to the President
for Energy and Climate Change: I
think that

44:54.892 --> 44:59.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this president believes that
climate change
is real.

44:59.530 --> 45:04.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He believes there is a moral and
ethical imperative
to act.

45:04.502 --> 45:09.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he has taken the laws on the
books and
implemented them to their
fullest.

45:09.473 --> 45:14.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Carol Browner ran
the Environmental
Protection Agency in the '90s.

45:14.912 --> 45:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She joined the Obama White House
as a senior
adviser.

45:18.649 --> 45:23.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She helped guide the
administration as it
aggressively employed existing
laws to reduce

45:23.854 --> 45:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
greenhouse gas emissions.

45:26.390 --> 45:31.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They raised the bar on mileage
for automakers,
made appliances more efficient
and tried to

45:31.896 --> 45:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control carbon dioxide emissions
at power
plants as if it were any other
kind of pollutant.

45:37.835 --> 45:42.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL BROWNER: He said, "This is
a serious
problem, and I am committed to
taking every

45:42.373 --> 45:43.874 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
step."

45:43.908 --> 45:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But, for Browner,
the rule
changes were a consolation
prize.

45:48.012 --> 45:52.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She came to the White House to
shepherd a
sweeping climate change bill
through Congress.

45:52.717 --> 45:57.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL BROWNER: We had looked
economy-wide
to look at all sources of carbon
pollution.

45:57.622 --> 46:01.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, it really seemed
like the thoughtful
and wise thing to do, because,
obviously,

46:01.993 --> 46:03.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this is an economy-wide problem.

46:03.761 --> 46:08.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: She envisioned an
economy-wide
cap-and-trade system that would
have set a

46:08.633 --> 46:13.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nationwide limit, or cap, on
greenhouse gas
emissions.

46:13.304 --> 46:18.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Companies would be granted
allowances to produce
these climate-altering gases.

46:18.309 --> 46:23.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those that produced less than
their allowance
could sell or trade permits to
emit more to

46:23.581 --> 46:26.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies that could not reach
the goal.

46:26.217 --> 46:32.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the American Clean Energy
and Security
Act of 2009, sponsored by
Democrats Henry

46:32.323 --> 46:37.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Waxman and Ed Markey, ran into a
political
buzz saw.

46:37.061 --> 46:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin is
the president
of the American Action Forum and
a veteran

46:43.100 --> 46:45.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the John McCain presidential
campaign.

46:45.336 --> 46:47.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, Former
Congressional
Budget Office Director: It was a
very intrusive,

46:47.605 --> 46:53.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heavily regulatory bill, where
literally,
at the key moment, John Boehner
literally

46:53.444 --> 46:57.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went to the podium, started
flipping through
and reading pages randomly, and
he could find

46:57.348 --> 46:58.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something bad on everyone.

46:58.416 --> 47:00.184 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

47:00.217 --> 47:01.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH), House
Minority Leader:
Twenty percent of the
electricity that goes

47:01.952 --> 47:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into every federal agency has to
come from
renewable sources.

47:06.757 --> 47:10.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do we have any idea whether this
is possible?

47:10.161 --> 47:12.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can't find the answer here.

47:12.496 --> 47:16.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The money that
would change
hands in cap-and-trade was
supposed to stay

47:16.867 --> 47:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the private sector, not go to
the U.S.
Treasury.

47:20.604 --> 47:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in its first budget message
to Congress,
the administration implied it
would auction

47:25.676 --> 47:29.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the emission allowances to
companies, making
it look like a tax.

47:29.714 --> 47:34.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT STAVINS, Harvard
University: Some staffers
on the Hill or someone saw that,
and within

47:34.985 --> 47:39.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
six months, cap-and-trade became
labeled as
cap-and-tax.

47:39.590 --> 47:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Robert Stavins is
the director
of the Environmental Economics
Program at

47:44.829 --> 47:46.664 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Harvard.

47:46.697 --> 47:51.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT STAVINS: And that was the
theme that
conservative Republicans and
coal state Democrats

47:51.168 --> 47:56.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
used to fight against
Waxman-Markey in the
House of Representatives and to
stop it in

47:56.707 --> 47:58.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Senate.

47:58.476 --> 48:04.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I sued the EPA, and I will
take dead
aim at the cap-and-trade bill,
because it's

48:04.915 --> 48:06.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bad for West Virginia.

48:06.417 --> 48:10.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The cap-and-trade
climate bill
passed in the House in 2009.

48:10.221 --> 48:13.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: The bill is passed.

48:13.224 --> 48:17.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But it never even
reached the
floor of the Senate for a vote.

48:17.895 --> 48:21.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN: Had they
scaled it back
and answered the question, what
can we get

48:22.032 --> 48:25.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the votes for, that would have
been very different
than Waxman-Markey.

48:25.102 --> 48:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: After Democrats
lost control
of the House in the 2010 midterm
elections,

48:30.307 --> 48:33.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the administration's lawmaking
prospects were
fading.

48:33.844 --> 48:40.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Mr. Obama started issuing
executive orders
aimed at reducing greenhouse
gases.

48:40.718 --> 48:42.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Holdren is the president's
science adviser.

48:42.887 --> 48:44.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HOLDREN, Director, White
House Office
of Science and Technology
Policy: I think

48:44.755 --> 48:48.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it was the only sensible
decision to make,
to ask, what can we do using
executive authority

48:48.793 --> 48:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to carry us until we get a
Congress that's
more willing to consider these
kinds of actions?

48:55.933 --> 48:59.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The biggest of
these rule-making
steps was the Clean Power Plan.

48:59.804 --> 49:05.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The single most
important step
America has ever taken in the
fight against

49:05.109 --> 49:06.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
global climate change.

49:06.310 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

49:08.112 --> 49:14.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It uses the Clean
Air Act,
first enacted in 1963, to
control other pollutants

49:14.752 --> 49:19.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to encourage states to reduce
carbon dioxide
emissions generated by the
electric utilities.

49:19.523 --> 49:23.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHELSEA HENDERSON, republicEn: I
think it
was his only chess move, at that
point.

49:23.394 --> 49:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Chelsea Henderson
is with an
organization called republicEn,
conservatives

49:28.966 --> 49:31.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are seeking government
action on climate
change.

49:31.735 --> 49:36.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHELSEA HENDERSON: In the end, I
would have
liked to have seen him overreach
earlier in

49:36.874 --> 49:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the legislative process, rather
than on the
regulatory side.

49:40.611 --> 49:45.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Twenty-seven
states took the
Obama administration to court to
try and stop

49:45.416 --> 49:46.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the plan.

49:46.884 --> 49:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Early last year, the Supreme
Court ordered
the EPA not to enforce it.

49:50.921 --> 49:55.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HOLDREN: I think the
president did the
best he had with the tools he
had, which were

49:55.726 --> 49:57.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the tools of executive
authority.

49:57.261 --> 50:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think he exceeded the
legal extent
of those tools.

50:03.200 --> 50:07.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those are questions that
will continue
to be tested in the courts
obviously, and

50:07.338 --> 50:09.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of them may be tested in
the Congress.

50:09.306 --> 50:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And, of course,
executive orders
that can be enacted with the
stroke of a presidential

50:13.477 --> 50:16.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pen can be undone in similar
fashion.

50:16.981 --> 50:23.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Mr. Obama's defenders say
changing existing
rules was a more nimble tool
than passing

50:23.254 --> 50:25.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
new laws.

50:25.055 --> 50:28.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL BROWNER: If we had waited
to start the
existing law, cars wouldn't have
gotten more

50:28.559 --> 50:30.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
efficient for at least another
year or two.

50:30.761 --> 50:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, more importantly, the
president wouldn't
have had the kind of efficiency
standards,

50:35.499 --> 50:43.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the proposal on power plants
that then allowed
us to go to Paris and really
establish our

50:43.073 --> 50:44.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leadership.

50:44.909 --> 50:49.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Paris, the site
of a pivotal
meeting of 195 nations that led
to an agreement

50:49.513 --> 50:54.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to curb greenhouse gas
emissions, limiting
the increase in the global
average temperature

50:54.985 --> 51:03.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to two degrees Celsius or below,
it is the
first comprehensive climate
agreement in history.

51:03.594 --> 51:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN HOLDREN: It happened only
because the
United States and China stood up
together.

51:09.833 --> 51:13.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama and President Xi
in Beijing
in November 2014 stood up, said:
We're the

51:13.637 --> 51:16.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two biggest economies, we're the
two biggest
emitters.

51:16.507 --> 51:17.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a huge problem.

51:17.942 --> 51:19.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are jointly going to lead.

51:19.677 --> 51:25.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: U.S.
participation in the Paris
agreement cannot be quickly
revoked.

51:25.149 --> 51:30.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A withdrawal has to be announced
three years
in advance, and then it takes
another year

51:30.220 --> 51:32.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for it to become official.

51:32.489 --> 51:37.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the agreement is voluntary,
with no teeth,
besides global peer pressure.

51:37.995 --> 51:39.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there is a loophole.

51:39.797 --> 51:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT STAVINS: If the Trump
administration
decided instead not just to
remove itself

51:43.067 --> 51:48.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from the Paris climate
agreement, but from
the overall U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate

51:48.739 --> 51:54.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Change that goes back to 1992,
ratified by
the Senate, signed by Republican
President

51:54.111 --> 51:57.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
George H.W. Bush, that takes
only one-year
delay.

51:57.548 --> 52:03.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Barack Obama
leaves a climate
legacy that is bold, yet
fragile.

52:03.287 --> 52:09.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
History will likely remember him
as the first
climate president, but, in
today's political

52:09.593 --> 52:15.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
climate, that moniker could very
quickly become
a footnote.

52:15.199 --> 52:23.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Washington.

52:23.073 --> 52:29.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

52:29.313 --> 52:30.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Steve Inskeep.

52:30.347 --> 52:31.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's great to
have you
here.

52:31.348 --> 52:32.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVE INSKEEP: Thank you.

52:32.349 --> 52:34.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

52:34.184 --> 52:37.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is -- we're going to tell you
all to join
