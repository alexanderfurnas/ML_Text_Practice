00:02.033 --> 00:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tonight, we
begin the first in a series of
conversations focusing on the

00:04.066 --> 00:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
future of the Democratic
Party, now out of power in the
House, in the Senate, and the

00:08.866 --> 00:10.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

00:10.966 --> 00:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining us now, the co-chair
of the House Democratic Policy
and Communications Committee.

00:14.766 --> 00:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is Congresswoman
Cheri Bustos of Illinois.

00:17.366 --> 00:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's the only member of the
House Democratic leadership
team from the Midwest.

00:21.033 --> 00:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Representative Bustos,
welcome to the program.

00:22.300 --> 00:23.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:23.700 --> 00:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS (D),
Illinois: Thank you, Judy.

00:25.733 --> 00:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
before we talk about the
party, the Democratic
Party, let me just ask

00:27.833 --> 00:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you, having watched and listened
to that report from Virginia,
such conflicting opinions about

00:33.233 --> 00:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act.

00:35.366 --> 00:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How can you know the Democratic
Party's position is right, when
people are so conflicted over

00:40.700 --> 00:41.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

00:41.533 --> 00:43.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:43.066 --> 00:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: Well, I don't
know if we're entirely right.

00:45.200 --> 00:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the way we need to look
at the Affordable Care Act is,
while it's made some tremendous

00:48.066 --> 00:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
improvement in people's
lives, there is a lot of
work we need to do still.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prescription drug prices are
too high and unaffordable
for too many people.

00:57.733 --> 01:01.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Co-pays, deductibles and
premiums are too high
for too many people.

01:01.966 --> 01:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the folks who were
just talking on the
show demonstrate that.

01:06.166 --> 01:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, what resonated the
most with me was right at the
end of the story, when you

01:09.766 --> 01:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had people saying, come
here, look us in the eye,
talk to us, listen to us.

01:14.666 --> 01:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is everything to
do with what we need to do
as Democrats going forward.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we ever want to win back
the majority in 2018, that's
exactly what we need to do.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
let's talk about that.

01:28.033 --> 01:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You represent your district,
the 17th District of Illinois,
northwestern part of the state.

01:31.100 --> 01:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You won by, what, 20 points
last fall reelection.

01:34.933 --> 01:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump also won
by, what, just a fraction
of a point, but he won.

01:41.366 --> 01:43.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was it in his message
that appealed to your voters?

01:43.166 --> 01:45.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:45.166 --> 01:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: Well, we have
communities all over the Central
and Northwestern Illinois,

01:48.066 --> 01:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the area that I represent,
that have lost their
jobs to outsourcing.

01:52.033 --> 01:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ag and manufacturing are
the two economic drivers in
my congressional district.

01:58.966 --> 02:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so when you have people
who lost their jobs -- one
example was the Maytag plant in

02:02.833 --> 02:04.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Galesburg, Illinois.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was 13 years ago this
September when Maytag sent every
one of their last jobs over to

02:09.100 --> 02:11.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mexico.

02:11.033 --> 02:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet, all these years
later, the people who had these
jobs still haven't recovered

02:14.533 --> 02:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the wages to the same
level they did before.

02:17.033 --> 02:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I talked to the people who
then took another job who then
ended up being outsourced and

02:24.033 --> 02:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now are working, for instance,
as a clerk in a grocery store
making half what they did

02:26.100 --> 02:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a dozen years ago.

02:27.300 --> 02:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's what resonated.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When people can hearken back
to making America great again,
that resonated with people who

02:35.566 --> 02:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have lost their jobs
and who aren't making
what they did before.

02:37.733 --> 02:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you have
been saying it's not enough for
Democrats to be against Donald

02:41.400 --> 02:43.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

02:43.466 --> 02:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's clear Democrats disagree
with him on health care, on
the Russia story, and on and

02:47.033 --> 02:48.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

02:48.466 --> 02:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is it that Democrats
should be saying?

02:49.566 --> 02:51.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:51.633 --> 02:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: I think we
should be talking nonstop
about jobs and the economy.

02:53.633 --> 02:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have the right policies.

02:56.066 --> 03:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a whole
make-it-in-America package
that focuses on making
products in America.

03:01.033 --> 03:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have job retraining programs.

03:03.766 --> 03:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have the right -- we
have the right programs,
but we talk about things
that are more divisive

03:09.633 --> 03:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than they draw us together.

03:11.700 --> 03:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think if we talk about our
values and what we stand for
as Democrats, making sure that

03:16.000 --> 03:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hardworking men and women have
a chance to succeed -- when I
go home and listen to people,

03:22.600 --> 03:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that's what they want us
to focus on, not things
that divide people.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is
there a single message?

03:26.633 --> 03:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it a combination of messages,
a vision that the Democratic
Party has that's not being

03:32.100 --> 03:32.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spoken?

03:32.900 --> 03:35.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHERI BUSTOS: Well,
what we're doing, kind
of a behind-the-scenes
look at it, we are

03:36.633 --> 03:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
working with the
Senate, the House.

03:38.700 --> 03:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're also making sure that
the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee is informed

03:42.233 --> 03:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what we're doing,
the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee.

03:45.533 --> 03:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm told that this is the
first time where we have really
all worked together on this.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my role in policy
communications, we have
met with more than 150 of
our Democratic colleagues.

03:55.566 --> 04:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have met with all the major
caucuses, from the Congressional
Black Caucus, the Progressives,

04:00.166 --> 04:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Blue Dogs, the New Dems.

04:02.000 --> 04:07.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this is a very much
bottoms-up report, our
coalescence of ideas.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But what we will do is,
this will all be about
jobs and the economy.

04:10.900 --> 04:13.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will roll this
out this month.

04:13.500 --> 04:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then when all these members,
congressional members, go back
home for the August district

04:17.133 --> 04:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work period, we they be talking
about jobs and economy, and
we will be united on that.

04:20.733 --> 04:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, that's a
little bit about the process,
but in terms of the vision, what

04:24.933 --> 04:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is the vision of the
party for the country?

04:27.733 --> 04:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you say jobs and the
economy -- and I want to bring
in or mention something else

04:32.633 --> 04:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have been saying, is
you have said to your fellow
Democrats, don't talk down to

04:37.033 --> 04:38.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

04:38.266 --> 04:39.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Make sure they know
you respect them.

04:39.800 --> 04:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is the message there?

04:41.100 --> 04:43.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: Well, the
message is, is that we may
be members of Congress.

04:45.233 --> 04:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It just means that we
have a different job.

04:47.133 --> 04:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're no better, no
worse than anybody else.

04:50.466 --> 04:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just a different job.

04:52.566 --> 04:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm blessed by the fact that I
was a newspaper reporter, and
I have been in the homes in

04:59.033 --> 05:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the worst neighborhoods,
the toughest neighborhoods
of my region, to, you know,

05:03.833 --> 05:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the country club lot in life.

05:06.333 --> 05:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I'm comfortable talking
to any of those people.

05:10.366 --> 05:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I'm also -- I know
that I'm no better or no
worse than any of them.

05:13.833 --> 05:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But back to your question
about what is it about jobs and
the economy, that we're going

05:18.566 --> 05:22.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to make sure that Social
Security is strong and
will grow stronger.

05:22.500 --> 05:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we're not going
to cut benefits.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's not something
we stand for.

05:26.300 --> 05:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I gave my mom a call today
and she said, what are they
doing to my health care?

05:30.633 --> 05:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's 84 years old.

05:32.666 --> 05:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to make sure that
Medicare is strong and is not
facing financial difficulty.

05:38.666 --> 05:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to make sure that
pensions people that they have
paid into are not sacrificed.

05:41.433 --> 05:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got all the right
policies, but we have
got to talk about that.

05:45.133 --> 05:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So is it a matter
of not changing or cutting
back on government programs?

05:49.233 --> 05:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that the Democrats' idea?

05:50.500 --> 05:52.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:52.433 --> 05:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: I don't think
government is the entire
answer, but people want to know

05:54.833 --> 05:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that their member of Congress
is going to Washington and
fighting for them, that we

05:58.733 --> 06:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't view that everybody
through the lens that it's all
partisan and we can't work with

06:02.766 --> 06:04.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

06:04.833 --> 06:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I know the people of my
congressional district
send me to Washington
and expect me to get

06:08.333 --> 06:10.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a job done.

06:10.366 --> 06:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want me to work hard,
because I make a pretty good
wage, especially in comparison

06:12.500 --> 06:14.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to a lot of families.

06:14.033 --> 06:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want me to fight for them
if there's a fight to be had.

06:16.066 --> 06:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they want me to get results.

06:18.133 --> 06:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think that's so
much different, whether you're
in San Francisco or New York

06:20.666 --> 06:22.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
City or Chicago.

06:22.366 --> 06:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's what people want
in their members of Congress.

06:24.366 --> 06:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what,
frankly, they deserve.

06:26.433 --> 06:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just finally,
who is the leader of the
Democratic Party right now?

06:28.933 --> 06:29.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:29.933 --> 06:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHERI BUSTOS: Who is the leader?

06:31.400 --> 06:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, I suppose it depends
on how you look at it.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
On the House side,
it's Nancy Pelosi.

06:36.266 --> 06:38.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
On the Senate side,
it's Chuck Schumer.

06:38.433 --> 06:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At the DCCC, at the DCCC...
