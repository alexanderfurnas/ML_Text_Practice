ALISON STEWART: And I'm Alison
Stewart.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:08.742 --> 00:14.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: Grow up, Donald. Grow
up. Time to

00:14.047 --> 00:15.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be an adult. You're president.

00:16.016 --> 00:21.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I sit down with
Vice President
Joe Biden at the White House to
talk president-elect

00:21.388 --> 00:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, Russian hacking and look
ahead to the
future of the Democratic Party.

00:25.893 --> 00:30.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Also ahead: What
drives you?
Paul Solman helps make sense of
the science

00:30.931 --> 00:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
behind motivation, and how it
can be used
to create happier, more
productive workers.

00:36.270 --> 00:41.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Jeffrey
Brown's conversation
with the stars of the new movie
"Hidden Figures"

00:41.909 --> 00:46.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the African-American women
behind NASA's
success in the '50s and '60s.

00:46.847 --> 00:53.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARAJI P. HENSON, Actress: This
one is important.
This one is important on a deep
level because

00:53.687 --> 00:58.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a part of history that has
been overlooked.
You know, this is more important
than anything

00:58.425 --> 00:59.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have done in my career.

00:59.760 --> 01:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:07.401 --> 01:10.137 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:10.170 --> 01:20.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: The director of
national intelligence
says he has -- quote -- "very
high confidence"

01:20.347 --> 01:25.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Russia hacked Democratic
Party computers
in a bid to interfere with the
U.S. election.

01:25.118 --> 01:31.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Clapper spoke at a Senate
hearing today
with Admiral Mike Rogers of the
National Security

01:31.325 --> 01:36.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Agency. He also addressed
president-elect
Trump's criticism of U.S.
intelligence agencies.

01:36.363 --> 01:40.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D),
Missouri: Who actually
is the benefactor of someone who
is about

01:40.734 --> 01:43.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to become the commander in chief
trashing
the intelligence community?

01:43.737 --> 01:47.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES CLAPPER, National
Intelligence Director:
I think there is an important
distinction

01:47.307 --> 01:56.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here between healthy skepticism,
which policy-makers,
to include policy-maker number
one, should

01:56.249 --> 02:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always have for intelligence,
but I think
there's a difference between
skepticism and

02:01.321 --> 02:03.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disparagement.

02:03.190 --> 02:09.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALISON STEWART: Clapper
confirmed that President
Obama has now received a final
report on the

02:09.196 --> 02:11.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issue.

02:11.098 --> 02:14.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, it was widely
reported that former
Indiana Senator Dan Coats is the
president-elect's

02:14.768 --> 02:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
choice for the next director of
national intelligence.

02:18.205 --> 02:22.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump also walked back from
his criticism
of intelligence agencies. He
tweeted -- quote

02:22.709 --> 02:27.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "The media lies to make it
look like I'm
against intelligence, when, in
fact, I'm a

02:27.948 --> 02:29.750 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
big fan."

02:29.783 --> 02:33.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Turkey, a
senior official
says police are closing in on
the gunman who

02:33.754 --> 02:38.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killed 39 people at an Istanbul
nightclub
on New Year's Eve. The deputy
prime minister

02:38.925 --> 02:45.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said today he's likely a member
of the Muslim
Uighur minority in China and
part of a specialized

02:45.399 --> 02:46.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terror cell.

02:46.933 --> 02:51.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Iraq, new bombings
killed at
least 27 people today in
Baghdad.

02:51.905 --> 02:57.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: The Obama
administration released
four more prisoners from
Guantanamo today.

02:57.110 --> 03:01.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's despite president-elect
Trump's vow
to keep the military prison
open. Those released

03:01.581 --> 03:06.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were from Yemen, and had been
held more than
14 years, but never charged.
They were sent

03:06.353 --> 03:09.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Saudi Arabia; 35 inmates
remain at Guantanamo.

03:09.856 --> 03:14.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle over
the fate of
Obamacare's had president-elect
Trump firing

03:14.628 --> 03:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
barbs today at Senate Minority
Leader Chuck
Schumer. In a series of tweets,
Mr. Trump

03:20.367 --> 03:26.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criticized Democrats in general
and branded
Schumer the -- quote -- "head
clown."

03:26.039 --> 03:28.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York senator answered
during a morning
news conference.

03:28.675 --> 03:31.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY),
Minority Leader:
I would say to the
president-elect and the

03:31.878 --> 03:40.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans that this is not a
time for calling
names. It's time for them to
step up to the

03:40.120 --> 03:45.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plate if they want to repeal and
show us what
they'd replace it with.

03:45.092 --> 03:49.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Vice President
Biden also commented,
and you will see that shortly in
our interview.

03:49.729 --> 03:55.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, House Speaker Paul
Ryan said today
that Republicans plan to act
this year on

03:55.268 --> 03:58.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both repealing and replacing the
president's
health care law.

03:58.505 --> 04:02.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: An assault in
Chicago that
was live-streamed on Facebook
drew national

04:02.876 --> 04:08.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention today. Police charged
four black
suspects with hate crimes
against a mentally

04:08.215 --> 04:13.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenged white male. The video
showed the
victim being threatened with a
knife and shoved

04:13.186 --> 04:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down. He was later beaten and
forced to drink
from a toilet. As the attack
progressed, the

04:18.024 --> 04:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
assailants yelled obscenities
about whites
and president-elect Trump.

04:21.862 --> 04:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
is touting
progress on criminal justice
reform during

04:26.633 --> 04:31.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his tenure and urging more. He
wrote about
it today in The Harvard Law
Review and said

04:32.005 --> 04:37.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "How we treat
citizens who make
mistakes, pay their debt to
society reflects

04:37.677 --> 04:39.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who we are as a people."

04:39.613 --> 04:43.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Obama served as The Law
Review's first
black president in 1990.

04:43.517 --> 04:47.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: On Wall Street
today, big
banks and department stores
struggled, but

04:47.721 --> 04:53.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
online retailer Amazon surged.
The Dow Jones
industrial average lost nearly
43 points to

04:53.560 --> 05:00.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close at 19899. The Nasdaq rose
almost 11
points to a new record close,
and the S&amp;P

05:01.001 --> 05:02.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
500 slipped a point.

05:02.702 --> 05:06.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there's word
that living
near a lot of traffic could make
you more

05:06.840 --> 05:12.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prone to dementia. A Canadian
study found
the risk is 7 percent greater
for people living

05:12.546 --> 05:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within 55 yards of high-traffic
roads. Researchers
say that it could come from
breathing the

05:18.118 --> 05:23.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pollution in car exhaust fumes.
The findings
appear in the medical journal
"The Lancet."

05:23.790 --> 05:29.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
Judy's interview with Vice
President Joe Biden;

05:29.496 --> 05:36.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the secret to boosting workers'
productivity;
and much more.

05:36.770 --> 05:47.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to my
conversation with
Vice President Joe Biden.

05:47.514 --> 05:52.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sat down at the White House
earlier today
and began by discussing the
future of the

05:52.285 --> 05:56.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama administration's signature
legislative
achievement, the Affordable Care
Act.

05:56.923 --> 06:00.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: I don't know what's
going to happen.

06:00.093 --> 06:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, as I said last night,
it was reported
in the press, speaking to
Democratic members

06:04.497 --> 06:08.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- newly elected members of the
House, that
I think they're going to inherit
the wind

06:08.568 --> 06:10.370 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

06:10.403 --> 06:14.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, all the things that
they said they
dislike about the Affordable
Care Act, they

06:14.641 --> 06:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are all able to be adjusted if
-- and we knew
when we passed the act that we'd
have to constantly

06:21.248 --> 06:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see how it worked and improve
it.

06:24.150 --> 06:29.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, making sure that
there are significant
more -- more subsidies for young
people to

06:29.422 --> 06:33.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be able to get into the
Affordable Care Act,
bringing down overall cost.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at any rate, I think
they're going to
find, when they repeal it, all
of a sudden,

06:37.998 --> 06:43.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're going to be reporting on
your program
at night on PBS about so and so
died because

06:43.603 --> 06:47.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they got their insurance cut
off, would no
longer cover them. They --
you're going to

06:47.907 --> 06:50.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find out women are paying more
than men again
for the same insurance.

06:50.877 --> 06:57.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're going to find out that
preexisting
conditions are -- are able to
disqualify you

06:57.617 --> 07:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or make the cost of insurance
prohibitive.
And so they're going to have --
that's why

07:03.089 --> 07:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're having a problem now.
They have no
replacement.

07:04.991 --> 07:07.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, do you think
Democrats
should work with them to...

07:07.994 --> 07:09.796 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

07:09.829 --> 07:12.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, I think
Democrats should
say, look, let's take a look at
what you have

07:12.732 --> 07:17.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now. What don't you like
about it? Let's
see if we can fix it. Let's see.
Talk to us.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us what your ideas are.

07:19.439 --> 07:24.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this wholesale -- now, look,
the fundamental
disagreement most Republicans
have is they

07:24.477 --> 07:32.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't think health care is a
right. They think
it is a privilege, not a right.

07:32.419 --> 07:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe health care is a
basic right. If
education -- you're entitled to
an education,

07:39.225 --> 07:41.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why wouldn't you be entitled to
adequate health
care, period?

07:41.995 --> 07:45.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But based on
conversations
of, the president -- we know the
president

07:45.899 --> 07:47.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has spoken with president-elect
Trump about
this.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Yes.

07:49.669 --> 07:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Based on that,
what parts of
it do you think may actually
survive?

07:52.172 --> 07:57.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: None of the good
parts can survive
with out the funding pieces of
it. And the

07:57.243 --> 07:59.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part they say they don't like is
the funding.

07:59.145 --> 08:04.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a reason why. There's a
reason why
it's constructed the way it is.
You can't

08:04.517 --> 08:08.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to insurance companies and
say, you know
what, we're not going to change
anything having

08:08.455 --> 08:13.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do with the pool from which
you -- you
draw your people. We're not
going to do anything.

08:13.493 --> 08:19.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But guess what? You can no
longer allow for
preexisting conditions to
disqualify somebody.

08:19.232 --> 08:23.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they go, oh, OK, how do I
pay for that?

08:23.269 --> 08:29.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, they talk -- it's
obvious they
don't know much about it. Mr.
Trump's a good

08:29.976 --> 08:31.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
man, but he doesn't know much
about the health
care system.

08:31.911 --> 08:33.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they're very
serious about
undoing it.

08:33.613 --> 08:35.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Oh, they're very
serious about
undoing it.

08:35.849 --> 08:40.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, like I said, lots of luck in
your senior
year. Undo it. See what happens.

08:40.220 --> 08:45.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More broadly, the
Republicans
are saying they want to
dismantle much of

08:45.291 --> 08:52.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the entire Obama-Biden legacy,
legislation,
regulations. What are you most
worried that

08:52.232 --> 08:54.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they may do?

08:54.167 --> 08:59.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I think they're
kidding themselves
if they think they can do away
with legislation

08:59.572 --> 09:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relating to the progressive
values we've built
into the law.

09:03.042 --> 09:08.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The public has moved beyond
politicians. For
example, I'm not worried about
them repealing

09:08.348 --> 09:13.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
protections for the LGBT
community, because
the public is beyond that. I'm
not worried

09:13.219 --> 09:18.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about them being able to change
the way in
which we have reached out to and
provided

09:18.792 --> 09:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many more opportunities for
women.

09:20.860 --> 09:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I -- but here's what does
concern me.
What concerns me is that they
will make some

09:25.265 --> 09:30.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
judgments in the foreign policy
area, without
having thought it through, that
may cause

09:30.770 --> 09:38.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of problems, for example,
Ukraine, or
the Northern Triangle here in
the hemisphere,

09:38.044 --> 09:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or dealing with Colombia.

09:40.613 --> 09:46.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Unless you are very
sophisticated about what
your actions or inactions -- let
me say it

09:46.853 --> 09:55.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another way. I was asked to go
down to Australia
several months ago to meet with
the new -- same

09:55.395 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prime minister, but with a new
coalition,
and to re -- not reestablish,
but make sure

10:00.567 --> 10:02.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we had close relationships.

10:02.368 --> 10:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While I was there, I got a call
from the -- from
the president of Latvia, saying:
You've got

10:07.307 --> 10:13.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to come to the Baltic states
because Mr. Trump,
during the campaign, said that,
you know,

10:13.713 --> 10:16.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they may not protect us against
the Russians.

10:16.316 --> 10:22.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, words matter. I'm not
suggesting that's
his position. But you have a lot
of folks

10:22.255 --> 10:27.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the parts of the world
that have relationships
with us now that, based on some
of the rhetoric

10:27.560 --> 10:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's occurred, if they follow
through with
the rhetoric by nonaction, could
cause -- have

10:33.166 --> 10:37.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some serious diplomatic and --
and physical
consequences.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what worries me most of
anything.

10:39.105 --> 10:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're worried
more about foreign
policy than about domestic
policy?

10:41.241 --> 10:42.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I am.

10:42.308 --> 10:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What they could
undo domestically.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Because I -- I...

10:44.377 --> 10:46.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The environment
and the rest
of it.

10:46.346 --> 10:51.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I -- look, they
will probably
do some very rash things
relative to the environment.

10:51.551 --> 10:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they, again, will reap the
whirlwind.

10:54.153 --> 11:01.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The public has moved beyond the
positions
that these fellows have taken.
So, in the

11:01.194 --> 11:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
near term, that may happen, but
they'll pay
a heavy price if they do that.

11:05.832 --> 11:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, they could come
along and decide
that they're not going to have
the -- you

11:10.737 --> 11:16.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, enforce the clean air
standards. They
could do that, but there will be
a backlash.

11:16.809 --> 11:21.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
about the Supreme
Court. You chaired the Senate
Judiciary Committee

11:21.681 --> 11:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for eight years, so you know
very well what
it means when the
Republican-controlled Senate

11:25.585 --> 11:31.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sat on the nomination of Merrick
Garland to
fill that ninth seat on the
court, sat on

11:31.291 --> 11:32.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it for almost 10 months.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: First time ever.

11:34.627 --> 11:40.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Once the
president-elect, then
President Trump, chooses
someone, should the

11:40.099 --> 11:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats do the same thing and
oppose and
refuse to go along?

11:45.772 --> 11:47.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: No.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Or should they,
thinking you
need to fill that vacancy on the
court, go

11:50.510 --> 11:52.211 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
along?

11:52.245 --> 11:55.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I think they
should -- look,
the Constitution says the
president shall

11:55.181 --> 12:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominate, not maybe he could,
maybe he can't,
he shall nominate. Implicit in
the Constitution

12:00.920 --> 12:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that the Senate will act on
its constitutional
responsibility and give its
advice and consent.

12:08.761 --> 12:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one is required to vote for
the nominee.
But they, in my view, are
required to give

12:14.701 --> 12:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nominee a hearing and a
vote. I -- it's
been my policy since I've been
in the United

12:20.206 --> 12:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States Senate, and I presided
over more Supreme
Court nominees than anyone in
history, anyone

12:24.544 --> 12:26.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
living.

12:26.479 --> 12:31.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And never once, even the ones
that I've disagreed
with, have they been denied a
hearing. And

12:31.351 --> 12:37.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so I think the Democrats should
not take up
what I think is a fundamentally
unconstitutional

12:37.123 --> 12:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notion that the Republicans --
Republicans
initiated 10 months ago. I think
they should

12:42.061 --> 12:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see who they nominate and vote
on them.

12:44.998 --> 12:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you've seen
the list
of names that president-elect
Trump has put

12:49.168 --> 12:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out there. Are any of them, to
you, acceptable,
and are any unacceptable?

12:54.040 --> 12:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Well I -- I'm not
going to comment
on -- and to be honest with you,
I don't know

12:57.610 --> 13:01.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all that he's put out there.
I've been having
trouble enough following him on
some other

13:01.481 --> 13:02.915 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But -- so, I'm not prepared to
comment on
any one of his nominees.

13:06.819 --> 13:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Come back to
foreign policy.
Have you seen now the report by
the intelligence

13:12.191 --> 13:14.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community on Russian hacking of
the Democrats
during the...

13:14.360 --> 13:16.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Yes, I have. Yes,
I've read
it.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And?

13:18.831 --> 13:24.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: There's
overwhelming consensus
in the community and
overwhelming evidence

13:24.671 --> 13:31.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supplied by the community that
Russia did
engage in an effort to impact on
the elections.

13:31.544 --> 13:36.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no evidence that they
actually tampered
with voting booths or tampered
with voting

13:36.549 --> 13:41.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rolls. But there is clear
evidence that they
-- in fact, they were engaged in
activities

13:41.954 --> 13:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
designed to try to impact on the
outcome of
the election.

13:44.924 --> 13:49.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Evidence of any
American cooperation
with the Russians in doing that?

13:49.429 --> 13:52.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I'm not going to
comment on
that, Judy. I don't want to
comment on any

13:52.532 --> 13:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the detail of the report.
There will be
an unclassified version that
will be released

13:56.636 --> 14:01.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very shortly, and it will lay
out in bold
print what they know.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Will the American
people learn
something new from this?

14:04.277 --> 14:13.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I think it will
probably confirm
what a lot of the American
people think.

14:13.553 --> 14:20.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it will -- it will state
clearly that
the Russians did, as a matter of
policy, attempt

14:20.827 --> 14:31.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to affect and -- three things.
One, it attempted
to discredit the U.S. electoral
process by

14:31.037 --> 14:36.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
implying that or laying the
foundation for,
it is not on the level.

14:36.743 --> 14:44.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two, it -- there's evidence that
they -- there
was an attempt to hurt Mrs.
Clinton. But there's

14:44.717 --> 14:52.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also evidence that there was
wider hacking
than some people thought.

14:52.125 --> 15:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the idea that the Russians
were not involved
in an effort to engage in our
electoral process

15:00.900 --> 15:04.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is simply not able to be
sustained. They were.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.338 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:05.371 --> 15:07.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In connection with that, the
criticism by
the president-elect of the
intelligence community

15:11.144 --> 15:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country, belittling of
the intelligence
community, do you think that's
just politics,

15:15.481 --> 15:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or do you think it's dangerous?

15:17.183 --> 15:19.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I think it's
dangerous.

15:19.886 --> 15:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope -- some very smart people
around him,
like General Mattis and some
others. For a

15:28.494 --> 15:41.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president not to have confidence
in, not to
be prepared to listen to the
myriad of intelligence

15:41.140 --> 15:49.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
agencies, from Defense
Intelligence, to the
CIA, et cetera, is -- is
absolutely mindless.

15:49.916 --> 15:52.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just mindless.

15:52.552 --> 15:57.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How would you -- now, can you
disagree? Can
you ask for more detail? Can you
question

15:57.857 --> 16:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether or not there is a
disagreement among
the various intelligence
agencies? That's

16:02.161 --> 16:04.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all legitimate.

16:04.063 --> 16:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the idea that -- that you
know more than
the intelligence community
knows, it's a little

16:12.238 --> 16:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like saying, I know more about
physics than
my professor. Now, I didn't read
the book.

16:16.609 --> 16:18.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just know I know more.

16:18.444 --> 16:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's not a -- it's
worrisome. I'm
assuming it will change.

16:24.550 --> 16:29.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If -- if what the
Russians
did is so serious, should there
be more retaliation

16:29.155 --> 16:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than what the administration has
just enacted?

16:31.657 --> 16:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I -- when the
question was,
would we respond to the hacking
over a month

16:40.266 --> 16:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, I said, at our -- our time
and choosing,
we would. Some of what we did,
you will know,

16:49.408 --> 16:51.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and some, you will not know.

16:51.577 --> 16:59.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we've done both, things you
do not know
and things that are known, like
expelling...

16:59.852 --> 17:00.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That were
announced.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Yes.

17:02.121 --> 17:02.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Will we know
those things that
weren't...

17:03.022 --> 17:05.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Hope not.

17:05.191 --> 17:12.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Syria, will that
go down as
one of the administration's
great failures,

17:12.131 --> 17:16.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you think? And is the U.S.
now impotent
to affect the outcome there?

17:16.903 --> 17:19.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: No. No.

17:19.405 --> 17:28.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is not a failure. The -- to
be a failure,
the -- there was -- you would
assume there

17:28.080 --> 17:33.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was an alternative that could
have been offered
that would have benefited or
been great -- in

17:33.152 --> 17:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the greater interest of the
security of the
United States.

17:37.690 --> 17:41.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you notice, there wasn't
anybody in either
political party ever talking
about putting

17:41.394 --> 17:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troops on the ground. If you
notice, there
wasn't anybody talking about --
there was

17:48.167 --> 18:00.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no plan put forward by anyone
that demonstrated
that there was a sufficient,
coherent nucleus

18:00.479 --> 18:12.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of democrats, with a small D,
who were in
opposition to the Assad regime
who would,

18:12.325 --> 18:22.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given the requisite training and
capability,
have the ability to be able to
take on both

18:22.168 --> 18:33.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extreme elements of the Sunnis,
meaning Al-Qaeda,
as well as ISIS, as well as
Nusra, and take

18:33.980 --> 18:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the Assad regime at the same
time.

18:38.584 --> 18:46.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so our focus has been the
dismantling
of the so-called caliphate, the
dismantling

18:46.559 --> 18:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of ISIS being able to occupy
territory and
govern like they were a
nation-state, like

18:54.633 --> 18:56.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they were a government.

18:56.702 --> 19:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have lost enormous amounts
of ground.
And I predict to you, before
June, there will

19:02.375 --> 19:08.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be no such place where they
occupy anywhere
in Syria, as well as Iraq.

19:08.681 --> 19:13.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The caliphate will have been
dismantled. It
will still be a problem, but
that has been

19:13.919 --> 19:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our focus, because that is the
greatest existential
threat to U.S. interests.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
president, President
Assad, will still be in power?

19:20.259 --> 19:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: That remains to be
seen.

19:22.995 --> 19:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And why I say that is, we've
been saying from
the beginning, like most others,
that this

19:27.099 --> 19:34.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
needs to be a negotiated
settlement. The Russians
appear to be -- appear to be --
in conjunction

19:34.073 --> 19:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Turks, as well as the
Iranians, appear
to be at a point where they are
realizing,

19:40.913 --> 19:47.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for their interests as well,
Assad being in
power indefinitely is not in
their interests.

19:47.319 --> 19:54.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it remains to be seen. We've
been trying
to put together, in multiple
fora, ability

19:54.393 --> 20:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring a negotiated settlement
to this.
It's still a reach, but we'll
see.

20:01.067 --> 20:09.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Looking back to
the election,
why did Hillary Clinton lose in
middle-class,

20:09.341 --> 20:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working-class places like
Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania,
close to where you grew up? And
what economic

20:15.381 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
message could have changed the
outcome?

20:17.349 --> 20:23.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, first of
all, I'm not
-- there's a false choice being
put forward

20:23.989 --> 20:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by some Democrats now. Either we
double down
on our progressive values, or we
go out there

20:30.696 --> 20:35.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and talk about the middle class
and the working
class. I've never found them
inconsistent.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They go together.

20:37.002 --> 20:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reason I'm a Democrat is
because the essence
of the Democratic Party is an
abhorrence for

20:42.241 --> 20:47.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the abuse of power on the one
hand, and the
notion that everyone's entitled
to be treated

20:47.947 --> 20:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with dignity. That message never
got through.

20:50.716 --> 20:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I remember going -- I was flying
to Cleveland.
I did 83 events. I was flying to
Cleveland.

20:55.087 --> 20:59.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was wondering why I was so
upset about the
way the campaign was going. This
was about

20:59.725 --> 21:01.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
three weeks out.

21:01.560 --> 21:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it hit me that, because of
the outrageous
nature of the way in which the
things that

21:07.566 --> 21:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump was saying, we never got
to substance.

21:10.136 --> 21:15.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't find me any of your
viewers who
can define for you what
Hillary's free tuition

21:15.808 --> 21:19.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan college plan was about. We
never got
to it. And...

21:19.578 --> 21:21.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whose fault was
that?

21:21.113 --> 21:23.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, I think it
was the -- I
think it was multiple faults.

21:23.415 --> 21:27.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that the campaign
was clear
enough. I don't think you guys
were ready

21:27.086 --> 21:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to cover it. You know, you look
at what the
Annenberg School and other
studies have shown,

21:32.591 --> 21:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's hardly any coverage of a
single issue,
of a substantive issue.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you also said
the campaign
wasn't clear enough.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, I don't
think -- I've
been the odd man out here.

21:41.267 --> 21:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I -- you know, I didn't hear
anybody talk
about the plight of that guy who
works on

21:46.805 --> 21:50.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the assembly line and his wife
is a hostess,
they make 90,000 bucks a year,
have two kids,

21:50.876 --> 21:53.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they're hurting. They're
scared.

21:53.646 --> 21:59.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't show enough respect. We
don't show
enough. We don't speak enough to
-- my dad

21:59.351 --> 22:03.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used to have an expression. He'd
say, "I don't
expect the government to solve
my problem,

22:03.289 --> 22:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joe, but at least I expect them
to understand
it."

22:06.258 --> 22:10.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were not clear enough in
making it clear
we understood the pressure they
were under

22:10.362 --> 22:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we had concrete solutions to
it. We never
got to them.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Could you have
beaten Donald
Trump?

22:15.834 --> 22:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Oh, I don't --
that's -- I have
no idea.

22:18.704 --> 22:24.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you know, it's easy to
say now. People
say that. But who knows, who
knows whether

22:24.677 --> 22:26.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I could have beaten Donald
Trump.

22:26.445 --> 22:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're seeing
-- seem very
clear on what the message should
have been.

22:28.547 --> 22:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Oh, I -- I was...

22:29.582 --> 22:30.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:30.849 --> 22:33.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I've been clear on
that message
for a long time.

22:33.385 --> 22:37.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This handle I've been given of
Middle Class
Joe, I know, in Washington,
that's not meant

22:37.423 --> 22:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a compliment. It means
you're not sophisticated.
But the reason I talk so much
about the middle

22:42.194 --> 22:46.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
class, it's the glue that holds
this country
together. It really is. And we
don't speak

22:46.098 --> 22:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enough to their legitimate
concerns.

22:47.900 --> 22:51.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The future of the
Democratic
Party, you're talking about it
right now,

22:51.770 --> 22:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's now less -- fewer seats
in state
capitals around the country.

22:55.474 --> 22:56.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Yes.

22:56.909 --> 22:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not only lost the
Congress,
but lost the White House.

22:59.612 --> 23:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does the party -- what
needs to happen
now?

23:01.413 --> 23:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I think we just
have to remember
who the heck we are and speak to
who we are

23:06.018 --> 23:10.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and what we believe. The
American public agrees
with us on almost every basic
issue.

23:10.756 --> 23:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here's what's going to
happen, in my view,
Judy. The very issues that
didn't get covered

23:16.662 --> 23:21.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are going to get covered
extremely thoroughly
now. You know why? This is going
to be the

23:21.300 --> 23:25.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most contentious Congress you've
seen since
you and I have been doing this
business.

23:25.938 --> 23:30.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what's going to happen?
Just like their
initial effort to do away with
an oversight,

23:30.709 --> 23:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, committee on -- on
ethics, well,
guess what? If they had talked
about that

23:36.282 --> 23:39.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the campaign, they'd pay
no price for
it. But now they're going to
implement it.

23:39.818 --> 23:43.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they go and take on health
care, when
they take on Medicare, when they
take on aid

23:43.889 --> 23:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to education, when they take on
college tuition,
when they take -- we're going to
-- you're

23:47.626 --> 23:51.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to cover it. You're going
to be -- you're
going to maybe even have an
old-timer like

23:51.630 --> 23:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me talking about it on your
program.

23:53.532 --> 23:57.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people are going to go, oh,
that's what
these guys want to do? This is
what the Democrats

23:57.736 --> 23:58.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are? That's what...

23:58.737 --> 23:59.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:59.738 --> 24:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Excuse me.

24:00.739 --> 24:01.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:01.940 --> 24:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you referred
to this a
minute ago.

24:03.709 --> 24:05.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats are dealing with a new
reality in
how this new president will
communicate, the

24:05.644 --> 24:07.513 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tweets.

24:07.546 --> 24:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just today, he tweeted -- he
called the Senate
minority leader, Chuck Schumer,
the head clown.

24:11.550 --> 24:17.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, he said -- he said
just like: "Doing
my best to disregard the many
inflammatory

24:18.023 --> 24:23.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President O statements and
roadblocks. Thought
it was going to be a smooth
transition. NOT!"

24:23.529 --> 24:26.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- in all caps and an
exclamation point.

24:26.265 --> 24:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Grow up, Donald.
Grow up. Time
to be an adult. You're
president. You got

24:32.404 --> 24:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do something. Show us what
you have. You're
going to propose the
legislation. We're going

24:37.743 --> 24:42.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get to debate it. Let the
public decide.
Let them vote in Congress. Let's
see what

24:42.281 --> 24:44.083 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happens.

24:44.116 --> 24:49.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to be much clearer
what he's for
and against and what we're for
and against,

24:49.288 --> 24:55.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now that it's going to get down
to actually
discussing in detail these
issues that affect

24:55.327 --> 24:56.295 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people's lives.

24:56.328 --> 24:58.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two quick things.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The Cancer Moonshot.

24:59.231 --> 25:00.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Yes.

25:00.532 --> 25:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You started that
in memory
of your son Beau.

25:06.071 --> 25:11.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're now going to be launching
a nonprofit
to do, among other things, look
at the cost

25:11.176 --> 25:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cancer drugs. What would you
consider success
when it comes to the price of
cancer medicine?

25:15.681 --> 25:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, look, that's
a small part
of this.

25:18.150 --> 25:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The overwhelming part of this is
to continue
to instill this overwhelming
sense of urgency

25:24.022 --> 25:31.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in cooperating in terms of
breaking down silos,
in terms of -- look, the medical
-- when Nixon

25:31.096 --> 25:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
declared the war on cancer, he
had no army.
He had no tools. He had no
anything, except

25:36.602 --> 25:38.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
good intentions.

25:38.437 --> 25:42.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And there was one model,
institutional model.
It was Jonas Salk in the
library, in -- excuse

25:42.474 --> 25:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me -- a laboratory -- that was
finding the
silver bullet.

25:45.444 --> 25:52.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We've now found out 45 years
later that it's
enormous collaboration that's
required. But

25:52.684 --> 25:54.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the institutional instruments
have not changed.

25:54.586 --> 26:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, if I could get every
single cancer genome
sequence that has been
sequenced, if I could

26:00.859 --> 26:06.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever put it in one repository,
we have the
capacity to do a million billion
calculations

26:06.965 --> 26:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
per second. We'll be able to
find out more
than -- in 10 minutes more than
it would take

26:11.837 --> 26:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10 Nobel laureates 10 years to
find out about
the patterns of cancer and the
cures for cancer.

26:17.576 --> 26:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are the things that I'm
working on most.
Drug prices are a problem.
Access is a problem.

26:23.682 --> 26:30.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, because it is so
celebrated, that issue,
I -- I want to put it in
perspective. If I

26:30.522 --> 26:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
could solve everything but that,
I would solve
everything but that.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to work on that as
well.

26:36.228 --> 26:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You'll be doing
Cancer Moonshot,
affiliating with two
universities.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Yes.

26:41.633 --> 26:45.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You'll be -- I
guess Lunch
Pail Joe is going to become Ivy
League Professor

26:45.170 --> 26:46.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Biden? Is that...

26:46.939 --> 26:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, I'm going to
-- I'm going
back to my alma mater, where my
heart is,

26:50.242 --> 26:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
University of Delaware. They've
been so good
to me. I'm going to be doing all
domestic

26:53.812 --> 26:55.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
policy out of there.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm going to be doing
diplomatic and foreign
policy out of Penn.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Less time for
politics?

26:59.284 --> 27:03.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Well, that is
politics to me.
They're the issues.

27:03.689 --> 27:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, every single morning since
I've been
27 years old, I've got up and
someone's handed

27:08.126 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me a card, like the one I have
in my pocket,
that has a schedule on it of all
the things

27:12.097 --> 27:14.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm going to do.

27:14.466 --> 27:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know what to do if I
didn't have that
card.

27:16.268 --> 27:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, these are the things I
care about.
And it's a -- my dad in another
expression,

27:21.907 --> 27:25.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said: "A lucky person gets up
in the morning
and puts both feet on the floor,
knows what

27:25.511 --> 27:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're about to do, and thinks
it still matters."

27:28.013 --> 27:29.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think this stuff really
matters.

27:29.948 --> 27:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm going to be able to take
some of the
intellectual horsepower out of
the vice president's

27:34.987 --> 27:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
office, and I'm going to have
two platforms
in which I can hire those people
in -- at

27:39.391 --> 27:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Delaware and at Penn, and work
on the issues
that are of overwhelming concern
to me still.

27:43.862 --> 27:47.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, leaving
government after,
what, almost half-a-century of
public service.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Oh, geez, don't
say -- that's
an awful thing to say. But
you're right.

27:50.168 --> 27:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What -- how does
that feel?

27:51.737 --> 27:54.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I -- I -- I don't
know.

27:54.606 --> 28:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I must tell you, it was -- like
I said, since
I've been a 27-year-old kid,
I've -- this

28:01.547 --> 28:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been the essence of my life.
And -- and
I -- I just know that I want to
stay engaged.

28:10.422 --> 28:14.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that I will have a
platform to
do that.

28:14.626 --> 28:20.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that will also affect public
policy. And
that's what -- that's why I got
involved in

28:20.065 --> 28:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
government in the first place.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you won't be
shy about
speaking out?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: No, I won't be shy
about speaking
out.

28:25.170 --> 28:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I never got involved in it for
the money,
as my net worth will show you.
So -- and I

28:30.042 --> 28:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still don't have that interest.
I'm interested
in doing the things that I've
been doing.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Vice President
Joe Biden, thank
you very much.

28:37.883 --> 28:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: Thank you Judy. I
appreciate
it.

28:47.759 --> 28:52.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Stay with us.

28:52.931 --> 28:58.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
great risks
and rewards of editing human
DNA; and the

28:58.136 --> 29:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unsung black women behind NASA's
first manned
orbit around the Earth.

29:03.809 --> 29:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: With a new year comes
new resolutions
both at home and at work, but
many of us aren't

29:08.880 --> 29:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
motivated enough to get through
our to-do
lists. In fact, more than half
of American

29:13.352 --> 29:16.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
workers feel disengaged at their
jobs.

29:16.121 --> 29:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
looks at what could motivate us
into action.

29:21.326 --> 29:25.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series,
Making Sense,
which airs Thursdays on the
"NewsHour."

29:25.664 --> 29:29.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN ARIELY, Behavioral
Economist: I think
we could get people to both be
more productive

29:29.935 --> 29:31.737 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and happier.

29:31.770 --> 29:35.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Behavioral
economist Dan Ariely,
who's joined a chorus of
economists bemoaning

29:35.474 --> 29:37.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
America's productivity slowdown.

29:37.376 --> 29:40.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN ARIELY: We're less
productive as individuals.
We're less productive as
companies, and we're

29:40.879 --> 29:42.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more miserable.

29:42.881 --> 29:46.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Ariely thinks
there's something
corporate America can do to
boost productivity:

29:47.019 --> 29:48.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
better understand human
motivation.

29:48.987 --> 29:54.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN ARIELY: Motivation,
basically getting
people to be happy at work,
everybody -- everybody

29:54.259 --> 29:55.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
benefits.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Thus his new book,
"Payoff."

29:57.095 --> 30:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But before the specifics, a bit
of backstory.
As a teen, Ariely spent three
years in the

30:02.601 --> 30:06.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospital, horribly burned. But
it was just
recently, when a stranger called
him after

30:06.672 --> 30:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her son suffered a similar fate,
that he realized
why people make an effort.

30:11.043 --> 30:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: And she asked me to
send her son
an optimistic note about life. I
didn't know

30:15.847 --> 30:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what to say. You know, I -- he
was so badly
burnt and...

30:22.387 --> 30:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As badly burned as
you had been?

30:24.623 --> 30:25.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAN ARIELY: Worse.

30:25.624 --> 30:26.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Even worse?

30:26.625 --> 30:28.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: Worse -- worse than
I was.

30:28.493 --> 30:36.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I wasn't sure that staying
alive is better
for him than not. Pain is just
terrible, pain

30:36.201 --> 30:43.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and desperation and
hopelessness. And if it
happened again today, I wouldn't
want to continue.

30:43.608 --> 30:49.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Recalling his own
cruel trial,
Ariely broke down, out of the
patient's sight.

30:49.614 --> 30:52.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: And, eventually, I
said, you know,
life is going to be difficult
and complex,

30:52.818 --> 30:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you will never have a normal
life. But
I also told him that technology
is on the

30:56.722 --> 31:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side of the disabled, because we
can do things
that we wouldn't be able to do
without it.

31:03.361 --> 31:09.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though it was a very
difficult time with
this kid, right, it gave me a
sense of, I'm

31:09.568 --> 31:14.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
giving back, I'm helping
somebody else, and
I'm connecting with this kid,
and I'm doing

31:14.206 --> 31:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that I'm supposed to
do in some
ways.

31:17.375 --> 31:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The lesson for
Ariely: Our behavior
is driven by emotion, not the
conventional

31:22.814 --> 31:24.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rewards like money.

31:24.149 --> 31:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEC BALDWIN, Actor: Have I got
your attention
now?

31:25.717 --> 31:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And he thinks
corporate America
would do well to take note.

31:28.520 --> 31:32.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEC BALDWIN: We're adding a
little something
to this month's sales contest.
As you all

31:32.657 --> 31:35.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, first prize is a Cadillac
Eldorado.
Anybody want to see second
prize? The second

31:35.994 --> 31:45.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prize is a set of steak knives.
Third prize
is, you're fired.

31:45.437 --> 31:51.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Money, threats of
no money, Ariely
has found they don't inspire
hard work.

31:51.710 --> 31:56.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Consider this experiment he ran
at a computer
chip production line in Israel.
Workers who

31:56.681 --> 32:03.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made their chip quota got either
$30 or a
voucher for pizza to take home
to the family

32:03.088 --> 32:06.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or a "well-done" text from the
boss.

32:06.525 --> 32:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We asked New Yorkers to guess
the experiment's
results. Which do you think
would be most

32:11.229 --> 32:12.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
motivating?

32:12.230 --> 32:13.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: The voucher for the
pizza.

32:13.598 --> 32:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Cash in the wallet. It
always works.

32:15.033 --> 32:17.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The text from the boss.
That would motivate
me more.

32:17.636 --> 32:18.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: The bonus.

32:18.904 --> 32:22.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Well done more often is
definitely more
motivational.

32:22.140 --> 32:27.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In the actual
experiment, workers
who made the quota and received
the $30 and

32:27.979 --> 32:33.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those that got a pizza voucher
and the group
that got a compliment were all
more productive

32:33.118 --> 32:34.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than workers who received
nothing.

32:34.886 --> 32:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: Money was slightly
worse than
the other two, but they were all
much better.

32:38.924 --> 32:43.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, on the second
day, when
the workers who'd gotten the $30
were not

32:43.128 --> 32:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paid a bonus, regardless of how
many chips
they turned out, their
productivity actually

32:48.400 --> 32:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dropped below those who'd gotten
zilch.

32:51.169 --> 32:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: In total, by giving
people $30
bonus, Intel lost almost 5
percent of productivity.

32:57.843 --> 33:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a lot. Now, think about
it. You give
money because you think this
would increase

33:04.282 --> 33:07.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
motivation. It actually
decreases motivation.

33:07.719 --> 33:13.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real issue is, how much
goodwill do you
invest in the work? And goodwill
is not something

33:13.291 --> 33:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we can buy with money. It's
very hard
to buy goodwill with money.

33:17.128 --> 33:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ariely has
highlighted another
payoff using, of all things,
origami.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's already a little sloppy.

33:23.301 --> 33:24.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAN ARIELY: Indeed.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you have got
time constraints,
so...

33:26.304 --> 33:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: I see. You're doing
it for me.
You're being sloppy for me.
That's so kind

33:30.208 --> 33:31.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of you.

33:31.209 --> 33:32.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: I am. I am.

33:32.477 --> 33:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's pride in your own hard
work, regardless
of outcome.

33:35.780 --> 33:37.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Anyway, that's good enough.

33:37.482 --> 33:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: You put some effort
into it. It
doesn't look like the one in the
book.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: No.

33:42.888 --> 33:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: But it's uniquely
yours. And the
effort that's gone into folding
it and crumpling

33:46.358 --> 33:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is uniquely a combination of
this magical
moment between you and this
piece of paper.

33:51.830 --> 33:52.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:52.831 --> 33:54.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN ARIELY: Now, in the
experiment, we came
to people, we said, look, so,
this origami

33:56.134 --> 33:59.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually belongs to us, but, if
you're interested,
we will sell it to you.

33:59.037 --> 34:03.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for example, if it was 10
cents, would
you buy it or not?

34:03.375 --> 34:04.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes. Yes.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: Ninety cents?

34:06.678 --> 34:12.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: A buck. It's got
character. It's
got a little runny nose. It's
definitely unique,

34:13.018 --> 34:13.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I would say.

34:14.019 --> 34:14.986 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:15.020 --> 34:15.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Unique.

34:16.021 --> 34:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: There you go.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then if I came from the
outside and I
look at it, I would look at the
same unique

34:19.624 --> 34:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
features in a different way, and
I would basically
say, I'm willing to pay maybe 10
cents.

34:25.096 --> 34:29.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we found is that people who
build it
were willing to pay more than
five times more

34:30.001 --> 34:31.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than the people who didn't.

34:31.736 --> 34:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ariely has dubbed
this attachment
to things we have made ourselves
the Ikea

34:36.641 --> 34:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effect, and he says it can be
harnessed by
employers.

34:39.311 --> 34:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: If you get people to
feel that
they are putting something, that
they are

34:43.949 --> 34:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
creating it and so on, their
love for the
project would increase. The more
something

34:48.987 --> 34:52.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is yours, the more you're
willing to invest
in it.

34:52.390 --> 34:55.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, these are Bionicles, little
LEGO robots.

34:55.160 --> 35:00.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But it's then more
demotivating
when others devalue that hard
work, as in

35:00.098 --> 35:04.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this experiment in which Ariely
paid participants
to build these characters.

35:04.402 --> 35:08.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of these is like a
wrap-around thing
here. Hold on. Where do these
go? Oh, these

35:08.640 --> 35:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
guys go at the end of this.

35:10.675 --> 35:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What ages is this for, by the
way?

35:12.043 --> 35:13.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAN ARIELY: Seven to 14.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Seven to 14, so I'm
out of the
age range, so...

35:15.613 --> 35:18.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: Yes, after 14, it
becomes increasingly
harder.

35:18.249 --> 35:19.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:19.250 --> 35:20.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: And let's say you
finished, right?

35:20.585 --> 35:22.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: OK.

35:22.454 --> 35:27.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: I have it. And as
you start building
the second one, I break this
into pieces.

35:27.726 --> 35:32.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just doing it here next to
you. And then
I say, would you like to build
another one,

35:32.530 --> 35:33.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the third one?

35:33.531 --> 35:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Right.

35:35.367 --> 35:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: And if you say yes,
I don't bring
a third box in. I give you the
one that you

35:41.006 --> 35:43.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just built, and I disassembled.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Oh, that's cruel.

35:45.543 --> 35:52.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In-your-face Bionicle
dismemberment sure demotivated
me, and, it turns out, the
study's participants.

35:52.183 --> 35:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: Very quickly, they
said no more,
this is not worth my time.

35:55.854 --> 36:03.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what happens when we
destroy people's
work in front of their eyes, or
when we don't

36:03.628 --> 36:10.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
let their work reach any
fruition. So, imagine
that you're working on some
PowerPoint presentation,

36:10.435 --> 36:14.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and I say, we're not going to
present it to
anybody, or you're working on a
project, and

36:14.973 --> 36:20.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I cancel your project. I just
basically let
you work, but I don't let the
product of the

36:20.512 --> 36:22.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
work shine.

36:22.313 --> 36:26.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Too often, says
Ariely, firms
kill motivation by failing to
notice what

36:26.651 --> 36:29.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers really care about. And
yet it's so
obvious.

36:29.754 --> 36:35.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ARIELY: The things that
motivate us are
to help other people, to feel
that we're useful,

36:35.093 --> 36:39.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to feel that we're getting
better, to feel
that we are kind of living to
our potential,

36:39.364 --> 36:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get a sense of meaning. All
of those things
are positive.

36:42.333 --> 36:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, above all,
connection to
others. Just ask people what
most gratifies

36:48.640 --> 36:50.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them, Ariely suggested.

36:50.341 --> 36:55.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Watching my wife do things
that are completely
outrageous.

36:55.180 --> 36:56.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Taking care of my family.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: My children.

36:58.116 --> 36:59.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Watching my son dance.

36:59.951 --> 37:05.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And, in my own
case, what keeps
me doing this job, connecting
with folks like

37:05.824 --> 37:06.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Dan Ariely.

37:06.825 --> 37:08.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's cute.

37:08.193 --> 37:10.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAN ARIELY: How come the
Japanese didn't think
about this, right?

37:10.795 --> 37:12.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:12.664 --> 37:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is economics
correspondent
Paul Solman, trying to connect
with you from

37:15.500 --> 37:16.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a swan displaying. I have
got a whole
story in my mind now.

37:19.904 --> 37:24.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Online, we have
more from
Dan Ariely. Read an excerpt from
his book

37:24.409 --> 37:28.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where he recalls helping a burn
victim by
sharing his experience.

37:29.013 --> 37:33.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

37:33.084 --> 37:44.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As Vice President
Biden said
earlier, innovations in genetics
could be

37:45.029 --> 37:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crucial to finding cures for
diseases like
cancer.

37:48.666 --> 37:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the most significant
developments in
this field is the newly
discovered ability

37:53.438 --> 38:00.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to modify the very genes in our
DNA. The technique
is known by the acronym CRISPR.

38:00.245 --> 38:02.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William Brangham has our
conversation.

38:02.113 --> 38:07.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: CRISPR is a
technique that
allows scientists to go into the
DNA of a

38:07.085 --> 38:12.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plant or an animal or even a
human being and
remove or replace a small part
of that organism's

38:12.590 --> 38:14.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
genetic code.

38:14.492 --> 38:18.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This technique, which can be
used to improve
crops, eliminate genetic
diseases, or specifically

38:18.796 --> 38:25.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
target the viruses and pathogens
that have
killed billion, could be a
revolutionary advancement.

38:25.036 --> 38:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The potential for CRISPR is
described in the
recent issue of The New Yorker.
The story

38:28.773 --> 38:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is called "Rewriting the Code of
Life."

38:31.509 --> 38:35.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm joined now by its
author, New Yorker
staff writer Michael Specter. He
joins me

38:35.280 --> 38:36.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from California.

38:36.581 --> 38:38.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Michael Specter, welcome.

38:38.349 --> 38:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In your story, you profile a
young scientist
named Kevin Esvelt. And I want
to quote a

38:42.487 --> 38:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
line from your story. You say
that Esvelt
directs the -- quote --
"sculpting evolution

38:47.392 --> 38:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
group at MIT, where he and his
colleagues
are attempting to design
molecular tools capable

38:52.897 --> 38:56.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of fundamentally altering the
natural world."

38:56.234 --> 39:01.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, that's a pretty
extraordinary set
of ambitions. What are they
trying to do?

39:01.206 --> 39:04.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SPECTER, The New Yorker:
You know,
they're trying to look out the
problems we

39:04.943 --> 39:13.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have in health, in crops in a
variety of ways,
and rewrite DNA, which is the
basic code of

39:13.651 --> 39:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life, so that it can make us
healthier, safer,
protect crops, protect trees,
protect endangered

39:21.459 --> 39:23.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
species.

39:23.428 --> 39:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a tremendously energetic
and ambitious
idea. And it has -- like all
wonderfully ambitious

39:29.901 --> 39:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ideas, it has great risks, too.

39:31.669 --> 39:35.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You report on
a particular
experiment they're running up in
Nantucket

39:35.139 --> 39:36.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trying to target Lyme disease.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you explain what they're
hoping to do
there?

39:38.743 --> 39:43.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SPECTER: Mostly, people
think about
Lyme disease in deer. And there
is a relationship.

39:43.147 --> 39:52.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the real reservoir for Lyme
is the white-footed
mouse. At Kevin Esvelt at MIT
said, gee, let's

39:52.190 --> 39:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rewrite the DNA of the mouse so
that it is
resistant to the Lyme tick, so
when a Lyme

39:59.330 --> 40:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tick bites it, it doesn't
matter.

40:02.066 --> 40:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you do that, you sort
of break this
chain of transmission between
mice and deer

40:06.471 --> 40:11.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and humans. And if you did that
enough, and
if you really rewrote the DNA --
mice are

40:11.843 --> 40:16.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not that rapid, but they're
relatively rapid
at reproducing -- and you can
quite easily

40:17.015 --> 40:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see a way in which you would get
rid of that
disease.

40:19.350 --> 40:24.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, as you
describe
it in this piece, CRISPR is
really putting

40:24.188 --> 40:30.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us in the driver's seat for
evolution, and
not only to control, in some
ways, evolution,

40:30.061 --> 40:31.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but to accelerate evolution.

40:31.829 --> 40:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Am I understanding that this
just seems to
be a tremendously -- tremendous
potential

40:37.368 --> 40:39.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for this?

40:39.137 --> 40:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SPECTER: I think the
particularly
revolutionary thing here is the
combination

40:42.874 --> 40:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of CRISPR, which is an editing
program -- it's
like editing something on your
computer so

40:47.378 --> 40:52.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you can cut and paste words
-- combining
that with this phenomenon called
gene drive.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Gene drive?
And gene drive...

40:54.652 --> 40:56.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL SPECTER: Yes.

40:56.487 --> 40:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gene drive is something that
scientists have
known about for a long time. We
all are supposed

40:59.223 --> 41:04.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get one copy of a gene from
each of our
parents. And that's usually what
happens.

41:04.929 --> 41:07.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's Mendelian genetics.

41:07.098 --> 41:10.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But every once in a while,
there's something
called a selfless gene. A gene
figures out

41:10.768 --> 41:17.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way to be tricky, to be
counterfeit, to
cram itself in where it ought
not be.

41:17.342 --> 41:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a guy named Austin Burt, who
teaches at
Imperial College in London,
figured this out

41:22.146 --> 41:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometime ago. And he basically
said, gee,
if we could use those selfish
elements the

41:26.517 --> 41:32.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
way we wanted, we could
interrupt some things.
We could make malarial
mosquitoes unable to

41:32.857 --> 41:34.559 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
carry malaria.

41:34.592 --> 41:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he named a bunch of things
like that.
But it was theoretical then,
because they

41:38.129 --> 41:43.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't have this fantastic tool.
Now you have
the tool and you have this
phenomenon. And

41:43.935 --> 41:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you put them together, you
can really
envision doing this. And, in
fact, it's being

41:47.939 --> 41:49.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
done in labs.

41:49.807 --> 41:54.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As you write
in the piece,
you say that CRISPR could
enormously improve

41:54.112 --> 41:57.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world, but it could also
endanger the
world.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How could gene editing endanger
the world?

41:59.550 --> 42:06.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SPECTER: Well, I am not
an alarmist,
but if you can reedit the genes
of a mosquito

42:06.190 --> 42:12.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that it can't carry malaria,
you can also
reedit the genes of a mosquito
so that it

42:12.196 --> 42:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
carries something really bad
and...

42:14.065 --> 42:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Use it as a
weapon?

42:15.533 --> 42:17.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL SPECTER: Sure.

42:17.368 --> 42:20.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't have to be a science
fiction writer
anymore to believe that it would
be possible

42:20.605 --> 42:25.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to engineer a species -- and the
mosquito,
our deadliest foe, is an
excellent example

42:25.977 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- to transmit something bad.

42:28.813 --> 42:33.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're very focused on being able
to break
the transmission of this
terrible thing, malaria,

42:33.451 --> 42:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and also Zika and dengue and
many other things,
but the truth is, that could
happen.

42:40.491 --> 42:45.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And another thing that could
happen is mistakes
get made. When you're talking
about editing

42:45.096 --> 42:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DNA, you're talking about
changing a species.
And that's not a minor thing.
That's a fundamental,

42:52.303 --> 42:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
powerful choice. And it will
require some
tremendous forethought.

42:56.407 --> 43:01.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, how are
researchers,
policy-makers talking about
this, thinking

43:01.279 --> 43:05.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about this? How do they propose
that we manage
this awesome technology?

43:05.616 --> 43:10.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL SPECTER: Well, I
actually think researchers
are doing a fairly good job of
trying to think

43:10.788 --> 43:12.590 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this out.

43:12.623 --> 43:15.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what that mostly means is,
they're working
in the labs, but they're very
aggressively

43:15.359 --> 43:21.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reaching out to communities. I
don't think
policy-makers so far have a
clue. I mean,

43:21.732 --> 43:25.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they don't know what's coming.
They're so
far behind in regulation, it's
even difficult

43:26.003 --> 43:30.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to understand how you would even
talk about
regulating this technology.

43:30.241 --> 43:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with the malaria, Austin
Burt, who I mentioned,
runs something called Target
Malaria. And

43:35.079 --> 43:40.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he and a large group of people
are working
on editing enough of these
mosquitoes so that

43:40.418 --> 43:43.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they wouldn't be able to
transmit malaria.

43:43.354 --> 43:47.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's in Africa already,
years before he
would ever send a mosquito
there, talking

43:47.592 --> 43:53.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to people, teaching people on
the ground what
the choices are, so they
themselves can make

43:53.231 --> 43:54.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this choice.

43:55.032 --> 43:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This isn't a case where a bunch
of Western
scientists are going to fly in
somewhere with

43:58.302 --> 44:02.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
400 million mosquitoes and
release them and
say, congratulations.

44:02.707 --> 44:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is the possibility of
getting people
to understand this and make
their own decisions.

44:08.579 --> 44:12.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it worked, getting rid of
malaria is
a big deal, and it would also
actually be

44:12.884 --> 44:18.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cheap, because there's no
vaccines, there's
no drugs, there's no coming
back.

44:18.723 --> 44:20.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not there yet, but it's
certainly possible.

44:20.892 --> 44:24.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, the
article is
"Rewriting the Code of Life."

44:24.262 --> 44:26.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michael Specter, thank you so
much.

44:26.097 --> 44:29.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL SPECTER: My pleasure.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.203 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ALISON

44:32.236 --> 44:34.772 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ALISON

44:34.805 --> 44:44.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALISON STEWART: And a
clarification to our
story about the administration's
release of

44:44.916 --> 44:48.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four additional inmates from the
detention
facility at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba. Due to an

44:49.020 --> 44:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
editing error, we reported that
35 inmates
remain at Guantanamo. The
correct number is

44:52.990 --> 44:57.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
55. We regret the error. in the
film, Katherine
Johnson is assigned to an
all-white department

44:57.261 --> 45:00.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
run by Kevin costner's
character, a composite
of three NASA administrators.

45:00.197 --> 45:01.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can she handle geometry?

45:01.265 --> 45:02.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

45:02.266 --> 45:03.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I speak.

45:03.901 --> 45:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Think you can find me this data?

45:06.571 --> 45:12.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're done watching it you
can realize
that while the best idea got to
the top, how

45:13.010 --> 45:19.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many ideas aren't getting there?
What do we
keep down? My job was to keep
NASA going and

45:19.250 --> 45:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I naively was thinking that the
best idea
was getting to me. That we were
somehow above

45:28.926 --> 45:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this but certainly we weren't so
but you can
look at our movie, see where
we're at, and

45:37.001 --> 45:46.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can come out of the movie
and you can
turn the mirror around and ask
yourself where

45:46.077 --> 45:47.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you think we are?

45:47.878 --> 45:51.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's unfair is having the
responsibility
of a supervisor, but not the
title or pay.

45:51.983 --> 45:56.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Octavia Spencer
received a
golden globe nomination for her
supporting

45:56.354 --> 46:01.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role playing dorothy vaughan, a
mathematician
who became an expert in an early
electronic

46:02.026 --> 46:07.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comPuting language. In the film
she's effectively
managing the department of
African American

46:07.531 --> 46:11.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women without being recognized
for it. Did
that feel like ancient history?

46:11.235 --> 46:13.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I sound like a supervisor, don't
i?

46:13.437 --> 46:18.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It still resonates. There's
unfinished business
in our society. We can talk
about gender parity

46:18.109 --> 46:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all day. Women in positions that
aren't really
being recognized financially and
so no, it

46:23.080 --> 46:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't feel like it was an idea
whose time
had passed.

46:26.717 --> 46:30.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a human
story, revolving
around complicated math and
aeronautics. Director

46:30.721 --> 46:35.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
theodore melfi said he took some
dramatic
liberties, but worked hard to
get the science

46:35.426 --> 46:37.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right.

46:37.328 --> 46:41.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We took great pride in how much
NASA was involved
and how much we paid attention
to what they

46:41.332 --> 46:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to say. They read script
draft after script
draft, poured through every
single line in

46:46.637 --> 46:52.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the movie, I'm very proud of the
fact that
NASA says, they're very proud.
How legitimate

46:52.510 --> 46:54.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it is and how

46:54.278 --> 46:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Music, too,
references the
era, but it's all new, written
by superstar

46:59.717 --> 47:03.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
musician and producer pharrell
Williams, who
grew up in this part of Virginia
and felt

47:03.754 --> 47:05.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a personal connection to the
subject.

47:05.956 --> 47:14.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Space and NASA, two subjects
that I have been
obsessed with since I was a
child. I used

47:14.198 --> 47:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stare out of the window pane
at the stars
every night. Every night.

47:20.471 --> 47:22.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Thinking?

47:22.306 --> 47:29.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't know what it was, I
didn't understand
it. I used to ask my mom all the
time, you

47:29.280 --> 47:34.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know, what are the stars? How
many are there?
How far does the black part go?

47:34.685 --> 47:39.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pharrell is also
one of the
film's producers. And it's an
important one

47:39.690 --> 47:41.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to him.

47:41.525 --> 47:47.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aw man, the success in this film
is when young
girls, no matter what color, can
receive this

47:47.064 --> 47:52.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message beyond the suppression
that they endure
everyday. To see that they can
do anything

47:52.269 --> 47:56.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they want, including
science, including
technology, engineering and
math. That's like,

47:56.340 --> 47:58.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's the success.

47:58.209 --> 48:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new film
comes in the year
following the Oscars- so-white
controversy

48:01.879 --> 48:06.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Academy Awards, in which
no people
of color were nominated in
leading or supporting

48:06.283 --> 48:08.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roles. Does one film make a big
difference?
Or what do you think has to
happen within

48:08.385 --> 48:10.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the world you work in?

48:10.788 --> 48:12.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just gotta keep working.

48:12.690 --> 48:23.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
yes and I think that the
emphasis is placed
in the wrong spot. The academy
is at the very

48:23.167 --> 48:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of the whole cycle of the
year and how
movies get made. I think what
people fail

48:33.377 --> 48:36.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to understand is it's not the
Oscars, it's
the decision-makers who
green-light movies.

48:36.814 --> 48:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's what needs to change.

48:38.582 --> 48:47.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it just goes to show, we
still have work
to do. I'm not going to complain
about it.

48:47.591 --> 48:52.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see the issue. What am I going
to keep doing?
Leading movies. You're not going
to ignore

48:52.096 --> 48:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me. I'm not going anywhere.
Right, Kevin?
Kevin's Puting me in his next
movie.

48:56.600 --> 48:59.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Hidden Figures"
opens nationwide
this weekend. For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm

49:00.004 --> 49:01.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jeffrey Brown.

49:01.672 --> 49:04.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not one to miss.
Learn more
about the NASA heroes of "Hidden
Figures"

49:04.041 --> 49:07.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the discrimination they
faced on our Web
site: PBS.org/NewsHour.

49:07.044 --> 49:12.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON STEWART: Finally tonight:
A movie opening
widely this weekend tells a
little known piece

49:12.049 --> 49:19.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of history about the history of
the early
days of spaceflight and the
crucial role played

49:19.557 --> 49:26.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
behind the scenes by
African-American women
who acted as mathematicians and
engineers.

49:26.363 --> 49:30.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The film is called "Hidden
Figures." It's
up for a number of honors during
this awards

49:30.901 --> 49:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
season, including two Golden
Globes on Sunday
night.

49:33.971 --> 49:39.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has a look at the
film and that
history.

49:39.944 --> 49:44.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: You have identification
on you?

49:44.081 --> 49:47.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TARAJI P. HENSON, Actress: We're
just on our
way to work.

49:47.852 --> 49:49.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OCTAVIA SPENCER, Actress: At
NASA, sir.

49:49.920 --> 49:52.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: I had no idea they hired.

49:52.323 --> 49:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OCTAVIA SPENCER: There are quite
a few women
working in the space program.

49:57.561 --> 50:04.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a story
about an agency
that reached for the stars, but
was mired

50:04.935 --> 50:08.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in racial and gender barriers
still prevalent
on the ground.

50:08.072 --> 50:12.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Hidden Figures" is based on the
real-life
stories of three black woman who
worked in

50:12.676 --> 50:17.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mostly segregated quarters at
NASA's Langley
Center in Virginia in the 1950s
and '60s.

50:17.414 --> 50:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The film focuses on efforts to
launch the
first American, the late John
Glenn, into

50:22.953 --> 50:24.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
orbit.

50:24.722 --> 50:28.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Let me ask you, if you
were a white
male, would you wish to be an
engineer?

50:28.158 --> 50:32.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANELLE MONAE, Actress: I
wouldn't have to.
I would already be one.

50:32.630 --> 50:35.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Janelle Monae,
the singer-turned-actress,
plays Mary Jackson, struggling
to get her

50:35.366 --> 50:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
license as an engineer. Like the
others involved,
this history was new to Monae.

50:41.405 --> 50:48.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANELLE MONAE: I was excited. I
said, wow,
we're going to finally be
celebrating women

50:48.779 --> 50:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just for their beauty, but
for their brilliance.
And I got excited. And then once
I found out

50:54.518 --> 50:58.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they indeed were part of
the space program
at NASA, it became a personal
responsibility

50:58.722 --> 51:06.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me to make sure that no young
girl, or
no human being, no American, you
know, went

51:06.463 --> 51:08.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through life not knowing of
these true American
heroes.

51:08.232 --> 51:10.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mary Jackson
would spend 34
years at NASA and help many who
followed.

51:10.067 --> 51:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANELLE MONAE: She found out
that the women
and minorities were being paid
significantly

51:11.969 --> 51:14.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
less than their male white
counterparts. And
she, along with a couple of
other colleagues,

51:14.772 --> 51:19.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took this to NASA. And, you
know, NASA being
the progressive place and the
place that listened,

51:19.209 --> 51:24.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she helped advance more women's
careers and
more minorities' careers in STEM
at NASA during

51:24.048 --> 51:25.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that time.

51:25.749 --> 51:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I thought that was just so
remarkable,
and I'm so honored to play such
a woman.

51:27.551 --> 51:29.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARAJI P. HENSON: This one is
important. This
one is important on a deep
level, because

51:29.420 --> 51:30.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a part of history that has
been overlooked.
You know, this is more important
than anything

51:30.054 --> 51:31.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have done in my career.

51:32.022 --> 51:33.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Taraji P. Henson
plays Katherine
Johnson, a math prodigy who
worked as a so-called

51:33.891 --> 51:35.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
computer. This was just as
machine computers
were arriving, executing by hand
the difficult

51:35.292 --> 51:36.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and tedious equations needed to
make the science
of spaceflight work.

51:36.894 --> 51:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When she first read the script,
Henson saw
the story in very personal
terms.

51:38.729 --> 51:41.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARAJI P. HENSON: I was upset,
because a dream
had been stolen from me. Had I
known these

51:41.465 --> 51:45.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women existed, maybe I would've
dreamed to
be a rocket scientist. But
growing up, there

51:45.069 --> 51:48.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a universal understanding
that math and
science wasn't for girls. It was
for boys.

51:48.639 --> 51:51.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then I felt a great
responsibility for
all the little girls who thought
math or had

51:51.976 --> 51:53.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been told raise a baby, get in
the kitchen
and cook, or don't dream to be a
rocket scientist.

51:53.544 --> 51:55.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Katherine G. Johnson
refused to be limited
by society's expectations.

51:55.379 --> 51:58.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The real
Katherine Johnson
is still alive, and in 2015
received the Medal

51:58.449 --> 52:00.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Freedom from President Obama.

52:00.250 --> 52:03.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the film, she is assigned to
an all-white
department run by Kevin
Costner's character,

52:03.087 --> 52:04.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a composite of three NASA
administrators.

52:04.321 --> 52:05.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEVIN COSTNER, Actor: Would she
handle analytic
geometry?

52:05.155 --> 52:06.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: Absolutely. And she
speaks.

52:06.156 --> 52:07.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TARAJI P. HENSON: Yes, sir, I
do.

52:07.124 --> 52:08.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEVIN COSTNER: Which one?

52:08.125 --> 52:09.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TARAJI P. HENSON: Both, geometry
and speaking.

52:09.927 --> 52:10.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN COSTNER: Ruth, get me --
you think you
can find me the Frenet frame for
this data

52:10.561 --> 52:11.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
using the Gram-Schmidt...

52:11.829 --> 52:12.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TARAJI P. HENSON:
Orthogonalization algorithm?
Yes, sir.

52:12.730 --> 52:14.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I prefer it over Euclidian
coordinates.

52:14.498 --> 52:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN COSTNER: When you're done
watching it,
you can realize that, while the
best idea

52:16.033 --> 52:17.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got to the top, how many ideas
aren't getting
there? What do we keep down?

52:17.868 --> 52:19.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My job was to keep NASA going.
And I naively
was thinking that the best idea
was getting

52:19.269 --> 52:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to me, that we were somehow
above this. But,
certainly, we weren't.

52:21.071 --> 52:22.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you can look at our movie,
see where we're
at, and you can come out of the
movie and

52:22.506 --> 52:24.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you can turn the mirror around
and ask yourself
where you think we are.

52:24.274 --> 52:27.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OCTAVIA SPENCER: What's not fair
is having
the responsibility of a
supervisor, but not

52:27.711 --> 52:29.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the title or pay.

52:29.446 --> 52:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Octavia Spencer
received a
Golden Globe nomination for her
supporting

52:31.248 --> 52:31.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role playing Dorothy Vaughan, a
mathematician
who became an expert in an early
electronic

52:31.782 --> 52:33.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
computing language.

52:33.617 --> 52:34.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the film ,she's effectively
managing the
department of African-American
women without

52:34.184 --> 52:35.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being recognized for it.

52:35.986 --> 52:36.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OCTAVIA SPENCER: Have some
respect. Get your
damn feet off my dashboard. This
isn't your

52:36.387 --> 52:37.154 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
living room.

52:37.187 --> 52:37.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I sound like a supervisor, don't
I?

52:38.022 --> 52:38.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANELLE MONAE: A mean old, salty
one.

52:39.023 --> 52:40.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TARAJI P. HENSON: With
authority, no question.

52:40.691 --> 52:42.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OCTAVIA SPENCER: It still
resonates. There's
unfinished business in our
society.

52:42.459 --> 52:44.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We could talk about gender
parity all day,
women in positions that aren't
really being

52:44.328 --> 52:46.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recognized financially. And so,
no, it didn't
feel like it was an idea whose
time had passed.

52:46.096 --> 52:47.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a human
story revolving
around complicated math and
aeronautics.

52:47.865 --> 52:48.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Director Theodore Melfi said he
took some
dramatic liberties, but worked
hard to get

52:48.365 --> 52:50.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the science right.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THEODORE MELFI, Director: We
took great pride
in how much NASA was involved
and how much

52:51.969 --> 52:53.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we paid attention to what they
had to say.
They read script draft after
script draft,

52:53.837 --> 52:54.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pored through every single line
in the movie.
I was -- I'm very proud of the
fact that NASA

52:54.938 --> 52:56.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
says they're very proud how
legitimate it
is.

52:56.774 --> 52:58.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The music, too,
references
the era, but it's all new,
written by superstar

52:58.509 --> 52:59.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
musician and producer Pharrell
Williams, who
grew up in this part of Virginia
and felt

52:59.343 --> 53:01.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a personal connection to the
subject.

53:01.178 --> 53:03.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHARRELL WILLIAMS, Musician:
Space and NASA,
two subjects that I have been
obsessed with

53:03.047 --> 53:03.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since I was a child. I used to
stare out of
the windowpane at the stars
every night, every

53:03.347 --> 53:03.881 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

53:03.914 --> 53:05.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Thinking?

53:05.749 --> 53:07.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: I didn't know
what it was.
I didn't understand it. I used
to ask my mom

53:07.551 --> 53:07.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all the time, you know, what are
the stars?
How many are there? How far does
the black

53:07.851 --> 53:09.686 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
part go?

53:09.720 --> 53:10.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pharrell Williams
is also one
of the film's producers. And
it's an important

53:10.120 --> 53:11.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one to him.

53:11.922 --> 53:13.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHARRELL WILLIAMS: Oh, man, the
success in
this film is when young girls,
no matter what

53:13.657 --> 53:15.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
color, can receive this message
beyond the
suppression that they endure
everyday, to

53:15.626 --> 53:16.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see that they can do anything
that they want,
including science, including
technology, engineering

53:16.593 --> 53:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and math. That's like -- that's
the success.

53:18.462 --> 53:20.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new film
comes in the year
following the Oscars-so-white
controversy

53:20.330 --> 53:20.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Academy Awards, in which
no people
of color were nominated in
leading or supporting

53:20.631 --> 53:22.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
roles.

53:22.399 --> 53:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Does one film make a big
difference? Or what
do you think has to happen
within the world

53:22.800 --> 53:23.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you work in?

53:23.801 --> 53:24.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TARAJI P. HENSON: Just got to
keep working.

53:24.368 --> 53:26.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
OCTAVIA SPENCER: Yes.

53:26.170 --> 53:28.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the emphasis is
placed in the
wrong spot. The Academy is at
the very end

53:28.105 --> 53:29.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the whole cycle of the year
and how movies
get made. I think what people
fail to understand

53:30.007 --> 53:30.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, it's not the Oscars. It's
the decision-makers
who green-light movies. That's
what needs

53:30.374 --> 53:32.176 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to change.

53:32.209 --> 53:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TARAJI P. HENSON: So, it just
goes to show,
we still have work to do. I'm
not going to

53:34.044 --> 53:35.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complain about it. I see the
issue. What am
I going to keep doing? Leading
movies. You're

53:35.345 --> 53:35.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to ignore me. I'm not
going anywhere,
right, Kevin?

53:35.712 --> 53:36.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

53:36.980 --> 53:38.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TARAJI P. HENSON: Kevin's
putting me in his
next movie.

53:38.282 --> 53:39.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Hidden Figures"
opens nationwide
this weekend.

53:39.249 --> 53:39.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown.

53:39.950 --> 53:41.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Not one to miss.

53:41.685 --> 53:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Learn more about the NASA heroes
of "Hidden
Figures" and the discrimination
they faced

53:42.486 --> 53:44.254 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:44.288 --> 53:45.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALISON STEWART: And a
clarification to a story
about the administration's
release of four

53:45.756 --> 53:47.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
additional inmates from the
detention facility
at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

53:47.558 --> 53:48.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Due to an editing error, we
reported that
35 inmates remain at Guantanamo.
The correct

53:48.392 --> 53:49.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
number is 55. We regret the
error.

53:49.660 --> 53:50.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Alison Stewart.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

53:52.362 --> 53:53.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening for my conversation with
Secretary

53:53.897 --> 53:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of State John Kerry, plus the
analysis of
Mark Shields and David Brooks.

53:55.232 --> 54:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

54:01.472 --> 54:05.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
