DO SOMETHING.

19:37.533 --> 19:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I GUESS YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE THE

19:40.233 --> 19:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASE IF YOU HAVE TO TAX

19:42.100 --> 19:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING, BETTER TO TAX FUELS,

19:43.833 --> 19:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE THAT LIKE AND WANT TO

HAPPEN.

19:46.700 --> 19:48.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TAXATION, PEOPLE SAY IF YOU TAX

19:50.333 --> 19:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING YOU TAX LESS OF IT.

IN SORT OF THE IRONY, WHEN YOU

20:06.467 --> 20:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREASE THE PRICE OF GAS,

20:08.467 --> 20:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:13.933 --> 20:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE, THEY PURCHASE LESS GAS.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T FORGET AT THE MOMENT, OIL

20:19.867 --> 20:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRICE ARE FAIRLY LOW.

20:21.300 --> 20:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A FEW YEARS AGO, OIL PRICE HE

20:24.100 --> 20:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE $100 PER BARREL, AND NOW,

20:29.000 --> 20:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE 50, 55 A BARREL.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS THAT OPPORTUNITY THERE

20:32.833 --> 20:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PROBABLY MAKE A BIT OF THAT

20:35.900 --> 20:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GAP IN HIGH TAXES.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE THINGS

LOWER GAS PRICE HE HAVE BEEN

20:41.233 --> 20:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEIR INCOME IN GASOLINE THAN

21:31.300 --> 21:33.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
