accounts, he was sarcastic,
prickly, abrupt,

01:00.794 --> 01:05.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
utterly self- guarded, almost
impossible to

President Obama urged voters to
focus more

01:47.607 --> 01:52.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Donald Trump's record and
less on what
he called the spectacle and the
circus.

01:52.579 --> 02:01.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OBAMA: This is a contest for the
presidency
of the United States, and what
that means

02:01.488 --> 02:11.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that every candidate, every
nominee, needs
to be subject to exacting
standards and genuine

02:11.865 --> 02:19.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
scrutiny. It means that you got
to make sure
that their budgets add up.

02:19.606 --> 02:23.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YANG: The president said
Republicans will
have to decide for themselves if
they feel

02:23.977 --> 02:29.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comfortable with Trump as their
nominee. And
Senator Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina tweeted

02:29.149 --> 02:31.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that he is not.

02:31.485 --> 02:35.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Paul Ryan said
he's not ready to endorse Trump
either.

02:35.555 --> 02:39.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE:
I was really surprised by it.
It's not a good

02:39.459 --> 02:42.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing. It's something the party
should get
solved quickly.

the coal industry

03:00.781 --> 03:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and received the endorsement of
the West Virginia
Coal Association, an industry
group.

03:06.286 --> 03:11.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

and polls
show Bernie Sanders leading
Hillary Clinton.

03:11.658 --> 03:16.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has a nearly insurmountable
lead in delegates,
but in Charleston, voter John
Baker told us

03:17.097 --> 03:19.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why he's backing the Vermont
senator anyway.

03:19.399 --> 03:27.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BAKER, VOTER: And I liked
his emphasis
on things like healthcare and
approaching

03:27.974 --> 03:35.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
drug addictions from a
healthcare perspective,
and things like college
tuitions.

03:35.515 --> 03:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: So you feel perhaps by
voting for Senator
Sanders you're influencing
Secretary Clinton?

03:41.721 --> 03:43.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BAKER: I would hope so, making a
statement.

03:44.024 --> 03:48.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: Clinton supporter Bernie
Deem (ph) says
she isn't buying the Sanders
message.

03:48.428 --> 03:51.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE DEEM, CLINTON SUPPORTER:
I believe
that she has the ability to see
the needs

03:51.932 --> 03:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of every American. And I think
she has insight
into -- no matter what
generation you are

03:58.338 --> 04:03.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, no matter any of the things
that people
-- other people pull us apart, I
think she

04:03.810 --> 04:09.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
realizes that basically we all
have the same
needs. And that she'll find ways
for those

04:09.116 --> 04:10.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
needs to be met.

04:10.951 --> 04:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YANG: It's a divide that been
seen all
through this primary season and
likely will

04:14.754 --> 04:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continue. Sanders insists he'll
campaign all
the way to this summer's
convention.

Trump dismissed
Senator Lindsey Graham's
opposition, saying

04:29.169 --> 04:33.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Graham ran a, quote, "hapless"
campaign and
has zero credibility.

04:33.573 --> 04:39.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in Omaha, Nebraska, Trump
took on another
former rival -- Jeb Bush, who

he will not support Trump,

competition anymore. Although I
could -- when

04:46.987 --> 04:56.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody says bad about me, even
as recently
as yesterday, I allowed to hit
them, right?

04:56.596 --> 05:02.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I won't talk about Jeb Bush.
I will not
say -- I will not say he's low
energy. I will

not say it! I will not say it!

presidential

05:11.611 --> 05:17.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

President Dick Cheney
said he will be in the Trump
camp.

05:17.851 --> 05:22.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

doing the things
that ordinary Americans are
doing every day,

06:15.775 --> 06:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

OF WILDFIRE
PREVENTION: No firebreak here
would have stopped

10:59.425 --> 11:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this fire, because this fire is
jumping kilometers
at a time. We're seeing fire
spreads where,

11:03.696 --> 11:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, it's creating its own
lightning
fires out of this fire. This is
an extreme,

11:07.934 --> 11:11.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rare, rare fire event and that's
something
that's historic for us.

11:11.804 --> 11:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: The big blaze has
scorched some
1,600 homes and buildings,
burning entire

11:17.510 --> 11:23.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

says the Fort McMurray city
center has survived,

11:23.116 --> 11:24.884 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so far.

11:24.984 --> 11:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL NOTLEY, ALBERTA PREMIER:
As of this
morning, the downtown is largely
intact. The

11:27.520 --> 11:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospital is still standing. And
municipal
buildings and the airport also
remain intact.

11:32.625 --> 11:36.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Firefighters have also been
working to save
as much of the residential areas
as possible.

11:36.396 --> 11:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: More than 1,100
firefighters
are on the fire lines, backed by
145 helicopters

11:43.236 --> 11:47.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

only so much
they can do.

11:47.807 --> 11:53.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fire first broke out Sunday,
and by Tuesday,
towering walls of flames closed
in on the

11:53.646 --> 12:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city, with a blanket of thick
smoke choking
the sky.

12:01.454 --> 12:05.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some 88,000 residents fled for

People have talked about
escaping through

12:13.733 --> 12:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
100 foot flames on both sides of
the road.
I mean, we have seen dash cam
footage that

12:20.006 --> 12:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we shot of people fleeing this
fire where
you find it hard to believe cars
can even

12:25.712 --> 12:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make it through this inferno.
There was fire
hopping both sides of Highway
63, which is

12:30.984 --> 12:32.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the only road of out Fort
McMurray.

12:32.819 --> 12:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: The city sits in
the heart of
Canada's oil sands region, and
the flames

12:37.323 --> 12:42.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have shut down a number of
facilities, pushing
up global oil prices.

12:42.395 --> 12:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the fire is still
burning out of
control, fueled by low humidity
and high winds.

12:48.001 --> 12:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORRISON: Right now, we really
do need some
rain. There's no question about
it. And then

12:53.473 --> 12:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even once we get rain, there's
still going
to be a lot of fire out there
and a lot of

12:56.676 --> 13:00.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work. We'll be here for weeks
and weeks to
put that fire out.

13:00.146 --> 13:05.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: The CBC's Evan Dyer
says that
means there's no timetable for
when the evacuees

13:05.418 --> 13:07.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will finally be able to return
home.

13:07.754 --> 13:12.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DYER: Some know for a fact that
their homes
have been destroyed. Others are
still living

13:12.659 --> 13:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the uncertainty of not
knowing, some
know their homes are safe, but
perhaps are

13:16.729 --> 13:18.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the path of fire.

families and people
who are worried about our folks,
I need to

13:30.076 --> 13:34.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assure you, everybody has been
out safe and
sound. We've got more that we're
moving and

13:34.947 --> 13:36.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we will get them out.

13:36.749 --> 13:40.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: An investigation is
underway
to determine how the fire
started in the first

of another Puerto Rico. Coral
Jimenez lives

14:31.871 --> 14:37.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with her 11-year-old son Felix
who suffers
severe disabilities. Several
months ago, the

14:37.844 --> 14:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fiscal crisis that now plagues
this island
territory trick ltd down to her
son.

14:42.749 --> 14:47.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORAL JIMENEZ: The people that
provide therapy
for my son were not getting paid
so we stopped

14:47.587 --> 14:53.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting the services for more
than a month.
He couldn't get his physical
therapy, occupational

14:53.359 --> 14:57.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
therapy, speech therapy,
psychological therapy,
he stopped getting them.

14:57.964 --> 15:03.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Coral says caring for her
son has taken
a village of friends and family.
But now,

15:03.503 --> 15:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that village itself needs help.

15:05.605 --> 15:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIMENEZ: For a son like my
Felix, I required
therapy, I required his father
to help me

15:11.978 --> 15:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economically. My mom has to help
me, but the
economy has been affecting his
father's business.

15:17.950 --> 15:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's doing the best he can, but
he's warning
me things are not going the way
they used

15:22.622 --> 15:24.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be.

15:24.957 --> 15:28.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some friends of mine, they used
to helped
me a lot, they have to move to
the States,

15:28.694 --> 15:30.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so I don't count on those
friends anymore.

15:30.663 --> 15:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Around San Juan, we heard
other stories
from victims of a slow-moving
economic crisis

15:36.068 --> 15:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's battered government
coffers and sacked
personal savings. The
unemployment rate is

15:41.374 --> 15:43.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

They are suffering,
too, because I can't help them
the way I normally

15:57.256 --> 15:59.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would have.

15:59.392 --> 16:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: One response, Puerto
Ricans are leaving
in record numbers, some 230 a
day. According

16:08.201 --> 16:14.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a recent study, Puerto Rico
lost testimony
2 percent of its population in

Children's Hospital

17:01.320 --> 17:07.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

as people slide into poverty,
can't pay their

CRUZ: No business can stay open
if you cut
40 percent of your business. If
Congress doesn't

17:18.404 --> 17:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assign resources to the Medicaid
program,
the whole healthcare system on
the island

17:25.244 --> 17:25.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will collapse.

17:25.745 --> 17:27.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BROWN: Collapse?

17:27.613 --> 17:34.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

Eventually, there
will not be enough healthcare
professionals

17:34.220 --> 17:39.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take care of the 3.5 million
U.S. citizens
in Puerto Rico.

17:39.358 --> 17:45.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: The question of the
moment is whether
Puerto Rico itself can stay in
business. Some

17:45.398 --> 17:49.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the problems have gone on for
more than
a decade, but this week came the
latest twist,

17:49.635 --> 17:53.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the government will default
on a scheduled
debt payment.

SERGIO MARXUACH, THE CENTER FOR

The two big problems are the
economic slow

18:06.786 --> 18:15.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down and the debt crisis. Puerto
Rico has
been contracting since 2006,
that's when the

18:15.594 --> 18:19.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax break for U.S. companies
doing business
in Puerto Rico expired. Congress
phased it

18:19.899 --> 18:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out starting in 1996 over ten

BROWN: And companies left and
jobs left --

18:23.903 --> 18:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARXUACH: Companies left and
jobs left and
the government had to increase
the debt to

18:28.774 --> 18:30.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
keep the economy going.

18:30.576 --> 18:35.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Today, that overall debt
stands at
an astounding $72 billion. And
on Monday,

18:35.982 --> 18:42.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government said it would not
pay a piece
of it, a $422 million payment
owed by it government

ALEJANDRO GARCIA PADILLA, PUERTO
RICO
GOVERNOR: I haven't been able to
afford one

18:45.825 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
then you have the other.

18:47.760 --> 18:52.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Puerto Rico's Governor
Alejandro Garcia
Padilla says he had to make a
choice between

18:52.498 --> 18:55.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
paying off creditors and
providing basic services.

18:55.668 --> 19:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADILLA: I do not have the
moneys. It's not
that I do not want to pay. It's
I just don

19:03.409 --> 19:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have the money. It's automatic.

19:05.845 --> 19:15.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If today I have to pay to supply
fuel to police
cars, I will not pay the
supplier of the medicines

19:15.988 --> 19:17.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the medical center.

19:17.423 --> 19:19.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: It that -- you have to
pick one
or the other, you feel?

19:19.592 --> 19:21.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PADILLA: Every day.

19:21.527 --> 19:25.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: The governor blames what
he calls vulture
hedge funds blocking Puerto
Rico's request

19:25.598 --> 19:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to restructure its debt and sees
racial discrimination
and ads now airing in the U.S.

19:31.270 --> 19:33.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AD ANNOUNCER: Stop the
Washington bailout
of Puerto Rico.

19:33.939 --> 19:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PADILLA: Why are they using
actors, trying
to represent that they are
Puerto Ricans?

19:41.080 --> 19:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why are they say we're asking
for a bailout,
one that not true? It's just
because we

19:45.751 --> 19:49.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not a state? It just
because we're
not a republic? It just because
we are

19:49.789 --> 19:51.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Puerto Rican?

19:51.757 --> 19:55.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: The governor wants help
from Washington
and key figures from Treasury
Secretary Jack

19:55.194 --> 20:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lew to House Speaker Paul Ryan
are looking
for possible solutions including
new legislation

20:01.133 --> 20:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that would allow Puerto Rico to
file for a
kind of municipal bankruptcy, as
Detroit did.

20:06.472 --> 20:12.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the moment, though, there's
a political
stalemate. If it lasts, Governor
Garcia Padilla

20:12.311 --> 20:15.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has warned, a bailout by U.S.
taxpayers is
inevitable.

SOFIA STOLBERGER, PILOTO 151: We
are optimistic
entrepreneurship is the way
forward.

20:19.718 --> 20:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: But for some, the picture
is much brighter,
filled with opportunity.

20:24.490 --> 20:31.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Piloto 151 is small business
aiming for a
giant breakthrough. It part

20:36.368 --> 20:38.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sofia Stolberg is the

20:38.604 --> 20:44.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STOLBERG: When there is economic
pain, there
is economic opportunity. We
truly believe

20:44.844 --> 20:50.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entrepreneurship and high-growth
entrepreneurship
is what's going to help us out
of this fiscal

20:50.683 --> 20:51.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crisis we're currently in.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROWN: How does that do that?

20:53.252 --> 20:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STOLBERG: It will eventually get
to a critical
mass where we'll be able to have
at least

20:58.591 --> 21:03.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one big home run that we'll be
able to change
the economic landscape forever.

21:03.596 --> 21:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: It's a lot to hope for
and maybe years
away.

21:07.266 --> 21:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The territory as a whole faces
its next test
when a huge debt payment of $2
billion comes

21:13.539 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
due on July 1st.

21:17.877 --> 21:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Coral Jimenez is focused on
daily struggles.
She wants to remain in her
homeland with her

21:23.048 --> 21:25.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
son and is trying to hold out
faith.

21:25.117 --> 21:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORAL JIMENEZ: I not like some
other people
that think the government is
against us and

21:29.555 --> 21:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the department of education is
against us
and trying to take away our
services. I think

21:34.560 --> 21:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are trying. People of the
government,
they're trying. But whatever
they're doing

21:39.365 --> 21:41.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is not working.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not fair my son gets
affected. Hundreds
of kids get affected because of
decisions

21:44.537 --> 21:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody else is making, and I
don't think
for a second that they're doing
it with a

21:49.341 --> 21:53.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
bad intention, but it's
affecting the population.

21:53.212 --> 22:00.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Affecting this island of
more than
3 million, one family at a time.

Mark Shields and David Brooks
examine this

22:29.748 --> 22:35.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week with its political turning
point. Pianist
Rob Kapilow breaks down a famous

Johannes Brahms just in time to

the late composer's birthday.

22:40.759 --> 22:46.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first, we turn our focus to
the fight
to win the Democratic nomination
for president.

22:46.699 --> 22:52.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

November,

22:52.538 --> 22:57.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders is still working
hard to defeat
her. I spoke with the Vermont
senator this

22:57.376 --> 22:57.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
afternoon.

22:57.910 --> 22:59.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

22:59.178 --> 23:01.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Senator Sanders,
welcome to the
"NewsHour".

23:01.847 --> 23:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me start with a question
about something
that's happened in West
Virginia, a state

23:08.487 --> 23:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have been campaigning in.
Donald trump,
yesterday, received the
endorsement of the

23:13.259 --> 23:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
West Virginia Coal Association.
This is a
group that represents 95 percent
of the coal

23:18.797 --> 23:24.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry in that state. They
almost always
endorse Democrats.

23:24.770 --> 23:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does that say about the
challenge that
you or Secretary Clinton face
this November?

23:29.508 --> 23:33.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT),
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE: Well, I think that we
stand a good

23:33.145 --> 23:40.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chance to win the primary in
West Virginia
on Tuesday, and the reason is
that we are

23:40.119 --> 23:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking to the issues that
impact the people
of West Virginia and, in fact,
this country,

23:44.456 --> 23:49.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that is the fact that people
are working
longer hours for lower wages and
almost all

23:49.194 --> 23:53.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new income and wealth is going
to the top
1 percent. That we're the only
major country

23:53.799 --> 23:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on earth that doesn guarantee
healthcare
to all people and paid family
and medical

23:57.269 --> 23:59.071 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
leave.

23:59.171 --> 24:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now in terms of coal in West
Virginia, I think
the scientific community has
made it as clear

24:04.677 --> 24:10.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they can, climate change is
real. It is
caused by human activity. It
already doing

24:10.616 --> 24:15.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devastating harm all over this
planet. And
I think we have got to transform
our energy

24:15.587 --> 24:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
system away from fossil fuel.

24:18.057 --> 24:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I have introduced change
legislation which
puts $41 billion into rebuilding
those communities

24:27.933 --> 24:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all over this country that have
been hurt
by that transition, by making
sure that if

24:33.405 --> 24:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workers lose their jobs, they're
going to
get new jobs. They're going to
get educational

24:37.843 --> 24:40.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunities. They're going to
get extended
unemployment.

24:40.679 --> 24:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: I hear you. But when
the group that
represents most of the coal
industry hears

24:45.818 --> 24:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your message and Donald Trump's,
they're saying
they like Donald Trump better.

24:49.722 --> 24:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDERS: Well, I think at the
end of the day
the people of West Virginia and
the people

24:53.826 --> 24:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of America understand that we
have a moral
responsibility to leave this
planet in a way

24:59.431 --> 25:02.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is healthy and habitable
for your children
and future generations.

25:03.068 --> 25:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Senator, a question
about what Secretary
Clinton said to "The Los Angeles
Times" this

25:07.806 --> 25:09.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week in an interview with the
editorial board.

25:09.775 --> 25:15.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said, "Anytime you ask
Senator Sanders
a question about foreign
policy," what's your

25:15.581 --> 25:20.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan, for example, to defeat
ISIS? She said,
"His response is, I voted
against the Iraq

25:21.019 --> 25:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
war authorization," meaning
Secretary Clinton.

25:23.689 --> 25:28.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She went on to say, "He has
never had any
experience or authority to make
any hard decisions."

25:29.061 --> 25:32.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said, "I can't tell you what
he would
have done in the Situation Room
about bin

25:32.398 --> 25:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Laden" or -- she listed other
crises. She
said, "But a lot of what he says
is problematic."

25:38.704 --> 25:44.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDERS: Yes, well, you know,
she may not
know what I would have done with
regard to

25:44.510 --> 25:50.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bin Laden and, obviously, what I
would have
done is everything we could to
kill or capture

25:51.049 --> 25:55.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him. But she does run away from
this very
important issue.

25:55.654 --> 26:01.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, she was in the Senate. I
was in the
House in 2002. Iraq is and has
been the most

26:01.927 --> 26:06.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important foreign policy issue
that this country
has faced in our modern history.
She heard

26:06.965 --> 26:11.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same evidence that I did.
She voted for
the war, I voted against the
war.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: But --

26:13.038 --> 26:16.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDERS: She in a debate we had
a couple of
months ago, she said, Henry
Kissinger thought

26:16.708 --> 26:20.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I was doing a good job as
secretary of state.
Well, what does that tell the
American people?

26:20.913 --> 26:24.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kissinger was the worst, most
destructive
secretary of states this country
has had.

26:24.750 --> 26:26.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But what about --

26:26.485 --> 26:29.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDERS: Secretary Clinton and I
do look at
foreign policy in a very
different way.

26:29.421 --> 26:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: My question, though,
Senator, is
that she's saying that you don't
have the

26:34.460 --> 26:36.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
experience making these
decisions she does.

26:37.095 --> 26:43.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDERS: Yes, well, that's
right, I did not
have the experience to overthrow
Gadhafi in

26:43.469 --> 26:49.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Libya and then create a
destabilized area
there that allowed ISIS to come
into.

26:49.908 --> 26:53.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, she was secretary of state
for four
years, there's no argument. That
is a lot

26:53.812 --> 26:57.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of experience. I have been in
the Senate for
nine years. I was in the House
for 16 years.

26:57.649 --> 27:03.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I voted against the First Gulf
War which I
think history will conclude was
the right

27:03.956 --> 27:05.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

27:05.924 --> 27:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe that ISIS not only
must be defeated,
they must be destroyed, but they
must be destroyed

27:09.962 --> 27:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Muslim troops on the ground
with our support
and support of other
superpowers. Not with

27:15.667 --> 27:19.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a perpetual war engaged in by
the Ameri -- the
United States military.

27:19.838 --> 27:22.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF, PBS NEWSHOUR
ANCHOR: Senator,
different subject. You sent a
letter today

27:22.307 --> 27:27.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to the chairman of the
Democratic National
Committee, Debbie Wasserman
Schultz. You urged

27:27.479 --> 27:32.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her in your words not to stack
the committees
that will draft the rules at the
convention

27:32.885 --> 27:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and lay out the party platform.
You went on
to say that if committee
assignments aren't

27:39.458 --> 27:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fairly allotted, you said one
result could
be floor fights. And you talked
about being

27:45.097 --> 27:49.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
prepared -- that you are
prepared to mobilize
your delegates to force as many
votes as necessary.

27:49.935 --> 27:52.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This sounds like a threat?

27:52.137 --> 28:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDERS: A threat? No. It's
using the rules
and the process of the
Democratic convention,

28:00.946 --> 28:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nothing threatening about it.
What is the
threat is that Chairwoman
Wasserman Schultz

28:08.487 --> 28:14.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is creating a process right now
in terms of
the selection of delegates for
the major committees

28:14.793 --> 28:16.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which are totally stacked.

28:16.762 --> 28:21.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, as of now, we have won 45
percent of
the pledged delegates. That is
the real delegates

28:22.034 --> 28:27.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people vote for. I have the
feeling that
in the next nine primaries and
caucuses, we're

28:27.673 --> 28:31.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to see that number go up,
hopefully,
actually, to a majority.

28:31.476 --> 28:37.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that our people
deserve a fair
shake on the important
committees. We have

28:37.382 --> 28:41.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been fighting for Medicare for
all healthcare
program. We're fighting to end
the grotesque

28:42.087 --> 28:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level of income and wealth
inequality. We're
fighting for free tuition of
public colleges

28:46.425 --> 28:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and universities. People who
support me deserve
fair representation on these
committees.

28:52.064 --> 28:57.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what the chairwoman has done
so far is
really absurd. She has stacked
the deck completely

28:57.869 --> 29:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the more conservative
members of the
Democratic Party when the people
all over

29:02.307 --> 29:07.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this country are saying, we're
tired of establishment
politics and establishment
economics.

29:07.412 --> 29:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, all that that letter says is
we think
our people, where we are right
now at 45 percent,

29:13.418 --> 29:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that number will go
higher, maybe
to 50 percent, we deserve a fair
shake.

29:18.857 --> 29:20.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is wrong with that
proposal?

29:20.859 --> 29:24.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Now, Senator, I wasn't
suggesting
there was anything wrong. I was
saying when

29:24.129 --> 29:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you say the result could be
floor fights,
mobilizing the delegates --

29:28.467 --> 29:29.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SANDERS: Well --

29:29.601 --> 29:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: -- it sounds like
youe saying
--

29:31.470 --> 29:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDERS: That's part of the
rules. Judy, that
is what the rules are. You have
the right

29:35.641 --> 29:41.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have minority reports. You
have the right
to have vigorous discussion on
the issues.

29:41.179 --> 29:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All that that letter says is
treat us fairly.
Don't stack the deck and give us
committees

29:46.585 --> 29:53.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are lopsided in terms of
Clinton delegates.
We want a fair shake. Nothing
more than that.

29:53.525 --> 30:00.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we don't get a fair shake, we
will do what
is natural. We will use the
rules of the Democratic

30:00.265 --> 30:03.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
convention to fight for what we
believe in.

30:03.402 --> 30:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: OK. Senator, you've
looked very
closely, of course, at this
context coming

30:09.007 --> 30:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up there, nine more states
coming, I should
say nine more primaries, four
more caucuses

30:15.914 --> 30:17.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming up.

30:17.716 --> 30:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you believe is the most
number of
pledged delegates you could have
going into

30:21.086 --> 30:22.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this convention?

30:23.021 --> 30:27.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Look, Judy, we are
fighting an uphill
battle to get a majority. For
us, I think,

30:27.859 --> 30:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, we stand a pretty
good chance
to win in West Virginia, maybe
Kentucky and

30:32.798 --> 30:38.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're favored in Oregon.
I think we
have a good chance to win in
California which

30:38.670 --> 30:45.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obviously is the largest number
of delegates
of any state.

30:45.444 --> 30:50.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we get -- and I understand
this is uphill,
I not predicting that we will,
but if

30:50.716 --> 30:55.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we do very, very well and get 65
percent of
the remaining votes, we actually
will have

30:55.654 --> 31:00.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a majority of pledge delegates
as I understand
it. If not, maybe wel have 47
percent,

31:00.959 --> 31:04.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
48 percent of pledged delegates
going into
the convention.

31:04.863 --> 31:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the case that I want to make
to the superdelegates,
over 400 superdelegates came on
board secretary

31:11.837 --> 31:18.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's campaign well over a
year ago before
I even got into the race, and
the case that

31:18.243 --> 31:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to make to those parts of
the Democratic
establishment is what is most
important is

31:23.115 --> 31:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we defeat Donald Trump, that
somebody like
Trump never should get into the
White House.

31:28.153 --> 31:33.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at all of the
national polls,
virtually all of the statewide
polls, Bernie

31:34.059 --> 31:38.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sanders is the stronger
candidate against
Donald Trump than is Hillary
Clinton. And

31:39.030 --> 31:44.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the reason for that is we are
appealing not
only to Democrats, we are
appealing to independents

31:44.336 --> 31:46.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

31:46.271 --> 31:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Senator, final quick
question -- what
do you say to your supporters
that are telling

31:49.508 --> 31:54.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my colleagues at the "NewsHour",
other journalists,
that if you don't get the
nomination, they're

31:54.112 --> 31:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to vote -- theye not
going to vote
for Hillary Clinton and they may
vote for

31:57.516 --> 31:59.417 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump?

31:59.518 --> 32:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SANDERS: Well, what I will --
what I am going
to be doing now, Judy, in the
next five weeks

32:03.455 --> 32:09.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is fighting for every delegate
that we can
get. We have a narrow path to
victory, but

32:09.427 --> 32:13.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I going to fight to see that we
can win,
and then we're going to take our
fight to

32:13.331 --> 32:15.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Democratic Caucus.

32:15.367 --> 32:19.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we do not one the nomination,
we will sit
down with Secretary Clinton and
wel see

32:19.838 --> 32:21.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
where we go from here.

32:21.773 --> 32:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is incumbent on Secretary
Clinton,
who by the way, as I understand
it, is now

32:26.578 --> 32:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reaching out to Jeb Bush's
fundraisers in
order to raise money from them,
you know,

32:32.250 --> 32:36.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that really casts a doubt on
the parts
of millions of Americans -- are
you really

32:36.588 --> 32:40.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to stand up for the
working and middle
class while you're collecting
millions from

32:40.725 --> 32:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeb Bush supporters? I mean,
those are the
kinds of things that I think
make not only

32:45.397 --> 32:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my supporters but ordinary
Americans nervous.

32:48.700 --> 32:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the bottom line is: A, we're
going to
fight to win the Democratic
nomination. B,

32:53.271 --> 32:57.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going to make sure if we
don't win that
the platform at the convention
is a platform

32:58.043 --> 33:02.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that speaks to the needs of
working families.
C, if we do not win the
nomination, we're

33:02.747 --> 33:07.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking forward to sitting down
with Secretary
Clinton and seeing where we go
from there.

33:07.752 --> 33:10.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Senator Bernie
Sanders, we thank
you very much.

33:10.655 --> 33:11.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SANDERS: Thank you.

33:11.723 --> 33:12.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

33:12.824 --> 33:14.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: That interview from
this afternoon.

33:14.726 --> 33:19.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we take a close look now at
this stunner
of a week in American politics
with Shields

33:19.164 --> 33:23.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Brooks. That is syndicated
columnist Mark
Shields, and "New York Times"
columnist David

33:23.635 --> 33:24.135 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Brooks.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

33:26.137 --> 33:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we just heard from a feisty
Bernie Sanders.
We're going to talk about him in
a minute.

33:28.907 --> 33:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I first want to ask you
about, I guess,
kind of an earth quake that
happened this

33:33.578 --> 33:38.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week that many people thought
wouldn't come,
the presumptive nominee of the
Republican

33:38.516 --> 33:43.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party, David, is Donald Trump. I
won't say
if anybody in this room
predicted he might

33:43.688 --> 33:53.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not make this -- reach this
point, but what
does it say that here he is
against all odds?

33:53.331 --> 33:57.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS, THE NEW YORK
TIMES: I'd like
to assure you that he will not
get the nomination.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

33:59.437 --> 34:04.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: You know, it says a lot
of things.
It says the Republican
establishment has been

34:04.442 --> 34:09.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
coasting on the fumes of
Reaganite philosophy
for too long which are not
applicable to the

34:09.114 --> 34:15.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day. It says that we have some
people in America
who are longing for a country
that is never

34:15.420 --> 34:20.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming back, where a certain
sort of white
male ideal is the top of society
and that's

34:20.392 --> 34:23.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never coming back and they're
looking for
a white male to remind them of
those days.

34:24.029 --> 34:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also says a lot of people are
hurting for
perfectly legitimate reasons.
They've seen

34:28.566 --> 34:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their jobs go, theye seen their
neighborhoods
go, theye seen their families
go, theye

34:31.937 --> 34:35.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen drug addiction, theye seen
unemployment,
and theye pessimistic about the
future

34:35.774 --> 34:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and theye willing to take a
flyer on the
guy.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, there are a lot of
legitimate and
illegitimate reasons why this
guy is here.

34:41.613 --> 34:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think he's a legitimate
candidate
or would be a legitimate
president but what

34:45.784 --> 34:47.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's done has to be respected to
some degree.

34:47.852 --> 34:49.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What would you add,
Mark? How did
he do this?

34:49.921 --> 34:53.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS, SYNDICATED
COLUMNIST: Judy,
I think we missed the story, in
the sense

34:54.025 --> 34:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we never examined the
program sees that
the Republican Party has been
organized around,

34:59.731 --> 35:07.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is an aggressive foreign
policy, a muscular
defense policy,
interventionists, a commitment

35:07.205 --> 35:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to smaller government, and not
open immigration
but certainly, considerably
welcoming immigration

35:16.114 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
policy, and tax cuts.

35:20.251 --> 35:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump went right by
this argument.
He basically did. I mean, he
repealed the

35:27.092 --> 35:34.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican interventionist
defense foreign
policy and, you know, emphasized
his own opposition

35:34.632 --> 35:40.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the war in Iraq, and echoed
some of the
sentiments that the president
himself has.

35:41.072 --> 35:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, our allies have to do
more, that they
have to contribute more to their
own defense,

35:47.445 --> 35:49.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the responsibilities.

35:49.280 --> 35:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would say beyond that,
what he did was
he put government -- this is
Henry Olsen,

35:55.053 --> 35:59.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the conservative scholar's
analysis, I think
it's a good one -- he advocates
a government

35:59.190 --> 36:03.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is on the side of the
people who are
hurting, the people David
described. I mean,

36:03.728 --> 36:07.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's not going to change Social
Security.
He's going to strengthen Social
Security.

36:07.198 --> 36:10.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He going to make sure Social
Security
is there. He going to make
Medicare there

36:10.702 --> 36:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and at the same time, he's going
to use it
to -- aggressive opposition to
trade policies,

36:18.443 --> 36:22.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where these people in many cases
as David
mentioned have been the
collateral damage.

36:22.647 --> 36:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The big picture has been good.
There are communities
and families and individuals all
over this

36:28.486 --> 36:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, and he spoke to them in
a way that
really neither party has and,
you know, I

36:35.126 --> 36:42.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
think that has to be
acknowledged, and just
remarked upon. It's an amazing
achievement

36:42.934 --> 36:44.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what he's done.

36:44.436 --> 36:47.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's transformed the Republican
electorate
nominating the president.

36:47.572 --> 36:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, David, based on
what Mark
is saying and you touched on
this a minute

36:51.342 --> 36:56.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ago, I mean, what is the
organizing principle
for the Republican Party or
people who vote

36:56.915 --> 36:58.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republican?

36:58.883 --> 37:03.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: Well, I happen to figure
the Republican
Party is in a moment of
cataclysmic darkness.

37:03.655 --> 37:07.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it's in a moment of
pre-revolutionary
moment that we'll probably have
a cataclysm

37:08.093 --> 37:13.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the fall for the party, and
then therel
be a moment of ferment where all
sorts of

37:13.531 --> 37:17.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different people begin to speak
-- trying
to speak for the party and we'll
have a scientific

37:17.735 --> 37:21.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
revolution, and then some new
party will have
emerged in five years. But I
suspect it won't

37:21.606 --> 37:24.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be Donald Trump because there is
no there
there, there no policy there.
There is

37:24.576 --> 37:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump the personality but when
he goes away,
that's gone.

37:27.946 --> 37:32.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What interests me about what he
presents to
the party that could last is a
weird mixture

37:32.550 --> 37:37.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of pessimism -- build a wall,
pull in American
roles abroad and optimism.

37:37.388 --> 37:41.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you talk to the Trump
supporters, they
like the optimism, "Make America
Great Again",

37:41.192 --> 37:44.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can't believe how great
we're going to
be. And so, there's this weird
mixture of

37:44.696 --> 37:47.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fear and hope that he embodies
as a person.

37:47.332 --> 37:53.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing I thinking
about is the
next six months. We've seen in
the last week

37:53.304 --> 37:59.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or last day in training fire on
Lindsey Graham
and on Jeb Bush. He has great
ability to train

37:59.277 --> 38:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fire on people. That's going to
be focused
on Hillary Clinton for six
months.

38:03.982 --> 38:06.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is that going to do to our
politics?
What is that going to do with
the way she

38:06.818 --> 38:11.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reacts? What is that going to do
to the American
psyche to have probably a level
of personal

38:11.823 --> 38:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
viciousness that we actually
haven't seen
before because he does erase all
the rules?

38:16.794 --> 38:21.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's going to have some
permanent effect
on the divisions within this
country and probably

38:21.166 --> 38:22.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at least in the short term not
for the better.

38:23.001 --> 38:27.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What about that, Mark?
Does it make
any difference that the leading
lights in

38:27.205 --> 38:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican Party are either
clearly not
with him, the two former
Republican -- living

38:33.611 --> 38:37.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican presidents, both
Presidents Bush,
Mitt Romney, John McCain are not
going to

38:38.049 --> 38:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the convention, they're not
getting involved.
Does that matter?

38:42.253 --> 38:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: Yes, it speaks volumes.
I mean, these
are privileged observers who
know the man.

38:49.661 --> 38:54.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's unthinkable that George W.
Bush, the
most recent Republican president
could support

38:54.299 --> 38:56.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

38:56.201 --> 38:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this is a man, Donald
Trump, who on
the eve of the South Carolina
primary, in

38:58.836 --> 39:04.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the debate, accused George W.
Bush not being
simply being -- having been
negligent in the

39:04.309 --> 39:08.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
invasion of Iraq, or not having
thought it
through, but of deliberately and
consciously

39:08.846 --> 39:13.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knowing there were no weapons of
mass destruction
and sending Americans into
combat and into

39:13.551 --> 39:15.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
death.

39:15.420 --> 39:21.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, that is such a charge of
such magnitude
and such seriousness, there no
way you

39:21.593 --> 39:27.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could even, you know, stand in
the same room
with such a person which George
W. Bush understandably

39:27.265 --> 39:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
does not want to do.

39:29.133 --> 39:34.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to David's point, what
you're going to
get I think from Trump is almost
-- it's the

39:35.039 --> 39:44.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reality TV, sort of the wives of
Jersey Shore,
no thought goes, no matter how
shallow, goes

39:44.916 --> 39:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unexpressed. I mean, Lindsey
Graham said he
couldn't vote for him today.
Fine, let it

39:49.621 --> 39:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go. But he has to respond in
kind.

39:52.123 --> 39:58.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a man who's going to
need, in our
current political climate, 90
percent-plus

39:58.129 --> 40:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Republicans to have any kind
of a chance
to be competitive, and he
doesn't have them

40:03.268 --> 40:08.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, and, you know, I just don't
think if
you're going to continue sniping
and griping

40:08.940 --> 40:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and just denigrate and demean
other Republicans
that you're ever going to get
him.

40:13.544 --> 40:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Do you think there
will be a third-party
move on the part of
conservatives, David?

40:17.348 --> 40:19.284 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
What --

40:19.384 --> 40:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: No, there is not enough
self-confidence
to do that. There is not enough
organizational

40:24.389 --> 40:29.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
structure. Right now, the
Republicans who
were non-Trump are deeply
unhappy, deeply

40:29.560 --> 40:32.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immobilized. Morale is low,
conviction is
low.

40:32.730 --> 40:34.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don think theye going to
do
anything. Theye just going to
sit and

40:34.666 --> 40:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
avoid and hope to survive.

40:36.567 --> 40:41.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But there are tough
decisions that
Republicans will be making in
the weeks --

40:41.873 --> 40:45.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: It's especially tough,
Judy, if you're
a Republican running for
Congress. I mean,

40:45.877 --> 40:51.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you know, we now have
nationalized our elections
to the point where people vote
the same way

40:51.349 --> 40:55.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for president they vote for
Congress, and
there is very little overlap.
And if Donald

40:56.020 --> 41:01.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is going to be in trouble
in your district,
you know, that's a problem for
Republicans.

41:01.826 --> 41:05.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, let's talk about
the Democrats,
David. We just heard from Bernie
Sanders.

41:05.630 --> 41:11.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't show any signs of
slowing down.
He's going to fight to the last
dog dies,

41:11.669 --> 41:13.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess, as somebody would put
it.

41:13.638 --> 41:17.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do we have happening here
in the Democratic
race for president?

41:17.875 --> 41:21.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: Well, Hillary Clinton's
pretty weak.
I mean, the loss -- I confess I
was surprised

41:21.879 --> 41:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by her loss in Indiana. Usually,
once it sort
of gets settled, the party
coalesces, but

41:28.619 --> 41:33.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that doesn happen. That is not
happening,
in part because he has his
issues, he has

41:33.191 --> 41:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his following, in part because
she just hasn't
been able to rally and inspire.
And her base,

41:37.228 --> 41:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her supporters, it's almost
demographically
defined, not intellectually or
emotionally

41:42.633 --> 41:44.402 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
defined.

41:44.502 --> 41:47.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I -- you know, she gave a
speech in West
Virginia this week which in some
levels was

41:47.472 --> 41:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fine speech but it sounded
like every other
political speech you've heard,
and the political

41:52.276 --> 41:58.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
proposals in there were fine,
you know, expand
community college, let's look at
job training

41:58.216 --> 42:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
programs, they were fine. But
they did not
inspire an interest, they did
not seem new,

42:02.887 --> 42:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they did not seem fresh, and
this is a year
where freshness is really called
for because

42:07.425 --> 42:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the mood of the country.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, so, I think imaginatively,
she has not
risen to the moment and still
has not risen

42:13.030 --> 42:17.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to this moment. She's now
training fire on
Trump and that will probably be
enough. But

42:18.069 --> 42:22.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in terms of inspiring people for
an agenda
when and if she becomes
president is not really

42:22.874 --> 42:24.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there yet in my mind.

42:24.609 --> 42:26.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: What do you see
happening?

42:26.511 --> 42:30.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: Well, I disagree in the
sense that
what have been her liabilities
in the primaries,

42:30.548 --> 42:37.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they -- and Bernie Sanders
has a remarkable
story. I mean, he got 18
primary and caucus

42:38.022 --> 42:40.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
victories when people had
written him off
before.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And he going to win
more --

42:42.326 --> 42:44.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

42:44.128 --> 42:46.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: He going to win West
Virginia
and Oregon, according to poll
information.

42:46.731 --> 42:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you know, 20 heading
into California.
It's pretty -- it remarkably
impressive,

42:53.337 --> 42:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2.4 million contributors and all
the rest
of it. But I think in a strange
way, what

42:58.476 --> 43:04.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been Hillary Clinton's
liabilities, the
lack of incitement, the long
resume, the sort

43:05.049 --> 43:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of stability and predictability
could become
great assets in a general
election, running

43:09.854 --> 43:11.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
against this mercurial,
flamboyant figure.

43:11.589 --> 43:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, she going to -- it's
going to
look like, wow, that's bedrock I
think to

43:16.794 --> 43:21.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of American voters. Even
ones right
now who don't like her, don't
intend to vote

43:21.599 --> 43:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for her, she is going to look
like the beacon,
the island in a contest if it is
a Trump-Clinton

43:28.239 --> 43:34.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
race, and I think it is a
strength of hers,
her stability and predictability
and sort

43:34.378 --> 43:41.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of solid commitment to policy
and facts and
background.

43:41.652 --> 43:45.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that -- I think that in
a strange
way what has been a liability
could be a great

43:45.590 --> 43:47.291 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
asset.

43:47.391 --> 43:49.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Could that work to her
benefit?
I mean, she still has to deal
with Sanders.

43:49.293 --> 43:54.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: Right. No, I agree with
Mark. Generally,
voters vote for the candidate of
order, the

43:54.932 --> 44:00.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one who seems safest, and she
certainly
compared to, you know, Mr.
Thermonuclear,

44:00.371 --> 44:03.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Self-Implosion, Donald Trump,
yes, she does
seem safe.

44:03.174 --> 44:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I still think even -- so
she's likely
to win, obviously. But as a
president, being

44:09.981 --> 44:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the status quo, being sitting on
the course
is probably still not what the
country wants.

44:15.920 --> 44:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, so, I do think, if I were
her, I would
think where can I be more daring
than I have

44:22.593 --> 44:25.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been, and who can I hire that's
more daring
than I have been?

44:25.963 --> 44:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Where -- because Trump has --
Sanders has
big ideas, Trump has ideas that
are big but

44:30.835 --> 44:37.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hollow, but all of the sensible
people have
really small ideas. And I think
she's included

44:37.642 --> 44:40.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that, and, frankly, Paul Ryan
is, too,
right now. I think a lot of his
instincts

44:40.912 --> 44:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are right. But the idea is
people have been
constrained by the last 20 years
of what we

44:44.849 --> 44:49.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can think about. And so, the
ideas coming
out of people that are

SHIELDS: No, but I mean, you
know, Bernie
has got a big idea, free tuition
at colleges.

45:01.165 --> 45:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's an idea sponsored by
another Vermont
member of congress, Justin
Morrill, in 1862,

45:08.439 --> 45:13.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the middle of the Civil War.
And we built
the University of California,
one of the great

45:13.177 --> 45:16.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
university systems and that's
produced 81
Nobel Prize winners.

45:16.213 --> 45:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know, we're a time of
small, timid
ideas and have been. I mean,
Barack Obama

45:23.521 --> 45:31.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had big ideas in 2009 and 2010,
and the voters
spoke rather resoundingly in
2010, and he

45:31.862 --> 45:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has not had anywhere near a
working majority
in the Congress since.

45:36.567 --> 45:41.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, I covered 2010.
I didn't cover
the Vermont politician in the
1800s.

45:42.073 --> 45:46.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: No, that was free
tuition. That was
Abraham Lincoln signing. Those
were two Republicans.

45:46.777 --> 45:51.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those were big ideas. You know,
the gross
domestic product was then? Seven
billion dollars

45:51.682 --> 45:54.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and we did it. Isn't that
remarkable? And
we can't do it now?

45:54.785 --> 45:55.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Wee remarkable still.

45:55.853 --> 45:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

this?

45:59.056 --> 45:59.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

pianist and composer
Rob Kapilow returns, this time
to discuss

46:21.812 --> 46:27.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
19th century German pianist and
composer Johannes
Brahms, who would have
celebrated a birthday

46:27.551 --> 46:37.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tomorrow. First, here is noted
pianist Emanuel
Ax playing "Brahms Intermezzo in
A Major,

46:37.862 --> 46:50.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

with Jeffrey

47:08.159 --> 47:11.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brown about what makes Brahms'
music so beautiful
and endearing.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

47:13.597 --> 47:14.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT:
Rob Kapilow, welcome back.

47:14.865 --> 47:16.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB KAPILOW, PIANIST: Thanks so
much for having
me.

47:16.734 --> 47:20.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Johannes Brahms, a man
and his music,
right? You picked one of his
famous piano

47:20.304 --> 47:22.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pieces.

47:22.306 --> 47:24.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAPILOW: I did. But you know,
the thing is,
to get at the heart of Brahms'
music is difficult

47:24.341 --> 47:27.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because to get at the heart of
who Brahms
was as a person is difficult.

47:27.778 --> 47:29.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BROWN: Brahms the man.

47:29.613 --> 47:32.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAPILOW: Brahms the man. I mean,
according
to all contemporary accounts, he
was sarcastic,

47:32.650 --> 47:36.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
prickly, abrupt, utterly
self-guarded, almost
impossible to get to know. And
the same thing

47:36.921 --> 47:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is actually true of this piece.
This is the
second piece in a set of six
pieces, but the

47:40.825 --> 47:46.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first piece is, like Brahms
himself, dense,
filled with swirling energy,
complicated,

47:46.497 --> 47:50.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dark, and he has to sort of
wrestle it into
submission to actually end the
piece like

47:50.735 --> 47:56.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this -- and then one long chord.

47:57.074 --> 48:00.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: That's the end of part
one.

48:01.078 --> 48:04.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAPILOW: End of part one. But in
a way it's
also the beginning of part two,
because that

48:04.815 --> 48:10.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last chord is actually the first
chord of
our song. But it's not just a
shared chord,

48:10.888 --> 48:14.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's as if somehow Brahms had to
work through
the complexity, turbulence and
struggle of

48:14.925 --> 48:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this first piece, in order to
sing from the
heart in the second.

48:18.529 --> 48:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's this fantastic quote
that he himself
acknowledges. He says, "Have I
not often told

48:22.867 --> 48:28.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you how seldom I succeed in
getting my thoughts
out of my heart and onto paper.
It is exactly

48:28.305 --> 48:31.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same with my composing. It
simply won't
flow from my heart."

48:31.842 --> 48:33.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BROWN: This is to Clara
Schumann.

48:33.778 --> 48:36.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAPILOW: This is to Clara
Schumann, the closest
person in his life, but though
he may have

48:36.313 --> 48:39.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felt that the music wouldn't
flow from his
heart, when you hear the first
phrase of this

48:39.850 --> 48:48.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
second piece, nothing could
sound more straight
from the heart than this
exquisite music.

48:48.993 --> 48:59.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(PLAYING PIANO)

48:59.603 --> 49:05.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROWN: So what's going on there?

49:06.010 --> 49:09.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAPILOW: The thing that's so
amazing is, when
you just hear it, it sounds like
simple, spontaneous

49:09.613 --> 49:11.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
melody, straight from the heart.
But --

49:11.916 --> 49:13.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROWN: The passion, the emotion.

49:13.717 --> 49:16.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAPILOW: All there. Even his
most lyrical
melodies tend to be almost
mathematically

49:16.754 --> 49:22.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
constructed out of these tiny,
microscopic,
developable ideas. This one is
based on two

49:22.259 --> 49:27.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tiny, anti-romantic ideas. What
Il call
"1, 2, up" -- it's important for
you to learn

49:27.398 --> 49:34.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these technical vocabulary-- "1,
2, up" and
then same two notes, last one
changed, "1,

49:34.271 --> 49:36.040 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2, leap."

49:36.140 --> 49:45.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, just "1, 2, up" and then "1,
2, leap."
Now, you won't know it until the
last incredible

49:45.482 --> 49:52.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
measure of this song, but "1, 2,
up" really
wants to resolve to "1, 2,
down." But the

49:52.890 --> 49:57.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first time he puts that note up
an octave,
so instead of "1, 2, down" and
resolution,

49:57.194 --> 49:59.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we get yearning.

49:59.163 --> 50:04.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's this leap in the right
hand that really
exaggerates it, "1, 2, up," all
Brahms' yearning

50:04.869 --> 50:05.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is in that one thing.

50:05.736 --> 50:07.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROWN: Maybe to Clara, right?

50:07.638 --> 50:11.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAPILOW: The desire for intimate
communication,
wanting to say more, but then
all filtered

50:11.508 --> 50:15.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
through this supremely
accomplished, almost
mathematically precise
technique.

50:15.346 --> 50:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, take the climax of this
piece. It
sounds utterly heartfelt.
Everything he always

50:23.020 --> 50:31.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to say to Clara right
here. Then he
marks, "singing, singing." but
though it sounds

50:31.195 --> 50:34.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
straight from the heart, it's
constructed
with mathematical precision. So
we come back

50:35.065 --> 50:43.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to "1 2 up" at the very end of
the piece,
down here in the middle now. "1,
2 up." every

50:44.041 --> 50:49.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other time it's gone "1 2 leap,"
but it wants
to go "1 2 down." and we get
both at the same

50:49.914 --> 50:51.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
time in one rolled chord.

50:51.916 --> 51:01.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get "1, 2," first we get
down, and then
we get leap. And you have heart
and mind perfectly

51:01.825 --> 51:07.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
combined, emotion and technique.
We resolve
and we yearn at the same time.

51:07.231 --> 51:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: Johannes Brahms, through
