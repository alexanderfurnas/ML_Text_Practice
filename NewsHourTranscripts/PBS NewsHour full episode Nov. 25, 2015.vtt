JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is

00:06.940 --> 00:11.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away. On the "NewsHour" tonight:
angry protests after the release

00:11.211 --> 00:16.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a video showing a black teen
shot by a Chicago police officer

00:16.116 --> 00:21.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
renews the question of excessive
force. Then, a century ago,

00:21.755 --> 00:26.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Albert Einstein changed how we
think about our world. We talk

00:26.059 --> 00:29.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with biographer Walter Isaacson
about the scientist's

00:29.696 --> 00:31.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revolutionary ideas. WALTER
ISAACSON, Author, "Einstein: His

00:31.698 --> 00:34.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Life and Universe": And it was
just a huge leap. It wasn't like

00:34.034 --> 00:38.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a little improvement over
Newton's universe. It was just a

00:38.071 --> 00:44.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whole new way of looking at the
universe. JUDY WOODRUFF: And the

00:44.044 --> 00:47.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin,
wins one of the first Portrait

00:47.881 --> 00:51.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of America Awards, and talks
about her remarkable career. All

00:51.985 --> 00:56.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that and more on tonight's "PBS
NewsHour." (BREAK) JUDY

01:05.098 --> 01:10.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Less than two weeks
after the attacks in Paris and

01:12.606 --> 01:16.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with a worldwide travel alert in
place, President Obama told

01:16.410 --> 01:20.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans today there's no
credible threat to the U.S. this

01:20.347 --> 01:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
holiday weekend. He urged people
to go about their normal

01:23.617 --> 01:27.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activities this Thanksgiving. At
the White House, flanked by his

01:27.387 --> 01:31.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
top counterterrorism and
national security advisers, he

01:31.491 --> 01:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said the U.S. government is
working overtime to protect the

01:35.162 --> 01:37.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
homeland. BARACK OBAMA,
President of the United States:

01:37.164 --> 01:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The combined resources of our
military, our intelligence, and

01:40.067 --> 01:43.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our homeland security agencies
are on the case. They're

01:43.837 --> 01:49.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
vigilant, relentless and
effective. In the event of a

01:49.676 --> 01:54.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
specific, credible threat, the
public will be informed. JUDY

01:54.348 --> 01:59.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: The president also
signed a $607 billion defense

01:59.119 --> 02:03.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
authorization bill today,
despite provisions that ban him

02:03.190 --> 02:06.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from moving detainees at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the

02:06.793 --> 02:10.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. In addition, the bill
contains a provision that the

02:10.263 --> 02:13.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president come up with a plan
for defeating the Islamic State.

02:13.967 --> 02:17.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Across the Atlantic, the French
announced that they will deploy

02:17.537 --> 02:23.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extra police and troops in Paris
next week, as about 140 world

02:23.143 --> 02:27.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leaders, including President
Obama, arrive for climate talks.

02:27.314 --> 02:31.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Belgium's capital
city, where some of the Paris

02:31.151 --> 02:35.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attackers were based, the
maximum threat alert remained in

02:35.155 --> 02:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place as a manhunt continued. In
spite of that, schools did

02:39.493 --> 02:43.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reopen in Brussels after a
two-day closure, and subway

02:43.597 --> 02:49.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
service was also restored in
some areas under tight security.

02:49.069 --> 02:52.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Islamic State has claimed
responsibility for yesterday's

02:52.272 --> 02:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bus bombing in Tunisia that
killed 12 presidential guards.

02:56.777 --> 03:00.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In an online post, the group
identified the suicide bomber

03:00.814 --> 03:04.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and included a picture of him
with explosives strapped to his

03:04.785 --> 03:08.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chest. Today, investigators
sifted through the wreckage and

03:08.555 --> 03:14.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
found roughly 22 pounds of
military explosives on the bus.

03:14.428 --> 03:18.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia today touted its rescue
operation of the surviving

03:18.498 --> 03:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fighter pilot shot down by
Turkish jets yesterday. The

03:22.803 --> 03:27.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pilot told reporters he didn't
violate Turkey's airspace and he

03:27.074 --> 03:31.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
received no warning, claims that
Turkey rejects. The other pilot

03:31.578 --> 03:35.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was killed. The shoot-down
sparked outrage in Moscow, where

03:35.582 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protesters pelted the Turkish
Embassy with eggs and chanted

03:39.820 --> 03:42.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"murderers." And Russian
President Vladimir Putin

03:42.989 --> 03:46.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questioned Turkey's motivation.
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian

03:46.093 --> 03:49.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President (through translator):
The problem is not the tragedy

03:49.296 --> 03:52.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we witnessed yesterday. The
problem is much deeper. We

03:52.532 --> 03:56.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
observe -- and not only us, I
assure you -- the whole world is

03:56.069 --> 03:58.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seeing that the current Turkish
leadership over a significant

03:58.872 --> 04:02.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
number of years has been
pursuing a deliberate domestic

04:02.075 --> 04:05.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policy of supporting the
Islamization of their country.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Ankara,
Turkey's prime minister, Ahmet

04:08.782 --> 04:12.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Davutoglu, called the downing a
communication accident, while

04:12.986 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still maintaining the Russian
jet did cross into Turkish

04:16.756 --> 04:19.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airspace. But he said Russian
airstrikes along the

04:19.960 --> 04:24.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkey-Syria border must stop.
AHMET DAVUTOGLU, Turkish Prime

04:24.331 --> 04:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Minister (through translator):
Nobody should pave the way to

04:26.967 --> 04:29.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
massacres against Turkmens in
this region under the pretext of

04:29.903 --> 04:32.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
carrying out operations against
the Islamic State. Today, in

04:32.973 --> 04:35.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this region near Turkey's border
with Syria, civilians are

04:35.709 --> 04:38.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacked with cluster bombs.
Attacks, close to a massacre,

04:38.612 --> 04:41.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are being carried out. This
should stop immediately. JUDY

04:41.414 --> 04:44.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Foreign ministers from
Russia and Turkey have also

04:44.317 --> 04:48.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agreed to meet, but not before
Russia ordered state-of-the-art

04:48.321 --> 04:52.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
air defense missile systems
deployed at a Russian air base

04:52.392 --> 04:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria. Pope Francis arrived
in Kenya today to begin his

04:56.830 --> 05:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first-ever trip to Africa.
Thousands of people lined the

05:00.467 --> 05:04.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
streets of the capital, Nairobi,
to greet the pontiff as his

05:04.204 --> 05:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
motorcade passed through. Later,
he urged Kenyans to work toward

05:08.542 --> 05:12.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
peace in a world filled with
extremist violence. The pope

05:12.679 --> 05:16.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will be in Africa for six days,
with visits to Uganda and the

05:16.750 --> 05:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Central African Republic. Before
the year even ends, the U.N.

05:21.121 --> 05:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weather agency is predicting it
will be the hottest on record.

05:24.858 --> 05:28.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The World Meteorological
Organization said there was no

05:28.128 --> 05:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point waiting until the end of
the year because temperatures

05:31.498 --> 05:35.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around the world have already
been so hot. Scientists point to

05:35.468 --> 05:39.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manmade global warming and a
strong El Nino weather system

05:39.773 --> 05:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a 1.8-degree Fahrenheit rise
over pre-industrial times. It

05:46.313 --> 05:49.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was a day of light trading and
little change on Wall Street

05:49.683 --> 05:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today The Dow Jones industrial
average gained one point to

05:52.686 --> 05:59.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
close at 17813. The Nasdaq rose
13 points, and the S&amp;P 500

05:59.092 --> 06:03.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dropped less than a point. And
President Obama carried out a

06:03.363 --> 06:05.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time-honored Thanksgiving
tradition at the White House

06:05.832 --> 06:08.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this afternoon. He officially
pardoned the National

06:08.735 --> 06:13.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thanksgiving Turkey, named Abe,
during a Rose Garden ceremony.

06:13.173 --> 06:17.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Turkey and an alternate bird
named Honest will live out the

06:17.310 --> 06:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rest of their lives on a farm in
Leesburg, Virginia. Still to

06:22.148 --> 06:25.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come on the "NewsHour": analysis
of the video released in

06:25.318 --> 06:29.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chicago, what is on the tape and
what does it say about the

06:29.389 --> 06:33.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
record of the Chicago police;
new details about the U.S.

06:33.393 --> 06:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bombing of a Doctors Without
Borders hospital in Afghanistan;

06:37.063 --> 06:42.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and much more. In Chicago, the
release of a video of a police

06:52.012 --> 06:55.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officer shooting a black
teenager has stirred racial

06:55.415 --> 06:59.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tensions and launched protests.
A warning to our viewers: Some

06:59.519 --> 07:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of what you are about to see may
be disturbing. Last night, the

07:03.957 --> 07:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city of Chicago released the
video from a police cruiser

07:07.460 --> 07:11.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dashboard camera. Seconds after
exiting his vehicle, police

07:11.965 --> 07:16.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer Jason Van Dyke opens
fire on Laquan McDonald. The

07:16.870 --> 07:21.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teenager collapses. Van Dyke
continues shooting, emptying his

07:21.474 --> 07:26.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weapon. In all, McDonald was
shot 16 times. Officers had

07:26.546 --> 07:30.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
responded to an allegation that
McDonald punctured a police car

07:30.884 --> 07:34.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tire with a knife. Yesterday,
Van Dyke was charged with

07:35.021 --> 07:40.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first-degree murder. Hundreds of
Chicago residents, upset by the

07:43.563 --> 07:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video, took to the streets
Tuesday night. Although the

07:46.900 --> 07:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protests remained peaceful for
the most part, demonstrators and

07:51.004 --> 07:55.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police officers clashed in a few
incidents, leading to the

07:55.875 --> 07:59.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
arrests of five people.
Activists had repeatedly called

07:59.579 --> 08:03.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the city to make public the
video of the incident, which

08:03.483 --> 08:06.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
occurred more than a year ago.
The city had already paid

08:06.986 --> 08:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McDonald's family $5 million at
settlement. Still, it took a

08:12.025 --> 08:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
freedom of information lawsuit
and a court order to force

08:16.363 --> 08:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
authorities to release the
video. Today, members of the

08:19.899 --> 08:23.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city council's Black Caucus
criticized authorities for that

08:23.837 --> 08:25.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
delay. RODERICK SAWYER, Chicago
Alderman: While we know the

08:25.839 --> 08:30.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system has failed, no one can
specifically say how. We must

08:30.510 --> 08:34.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
value all the children of the
city of Chicago, more than just

08:34.114 --> 08:38.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thinking that a quick payout can
solve the problem. A clear,

08:38.985 --> 08:44.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transparent process is the only
way we can begin to build trust

08:44.157 --> 08:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in our communities with law
enforcement. JUDY WOODRUFF: At a

08:47.027 --> 08:50.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
news conference last night,
Mayor Rahm Emanuel struck a

08:50.597 --> 08:55.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
similar tone, and said that the
shooting of Laquan McDonald must

08:55.168 --> 08:58.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be an opportunity for the
community to heal and come

08:58.638 --> 09:01.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together. RAHM EMANUEL (D),
Mayor of Chicago: We need, as a

09:01.908 --> 09:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city, to get to a point where
young men in our community and

09:06.146 --> 09:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in parts of our city see an
officer and don't just see an

09:10.950 --> 09:14.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer with a uniform and a
badge, but they see him as a

09:14.621 --> 09:18.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
partner in helping them reach
their full potential. We also

09:18.391 --> 09:23.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to get to a place in the
city where officers who patrol

09:23.430 --> 09:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
communities in our city see a
young man not as a potential

09:27.100 --> 09:32.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem and a risk, but they
also see in -- that young man as

09:32.772 --> 09:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an individual who is worthy of
their protection and their

09:36.509 --> 09:40.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
potential. JUDY WOODRUFF:
Details on McDonald and Van Dyke

09:40.380 --> 09:45.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are still coming to light, but
here is what we know now. Laquan

09:45.218 --> 09:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McDonald was a 17-year-old
African-American. He was removed

09:49.622 --> 09:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from his mother's care twice at
a young age, and spent most of

09:53.993 --> 09:58.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his life as a ward of the state.
Family services twice

09:58.298 --> 10:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigated allegations that
McDonald was sexually abused in

10:02.802 --> 10:07.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foster care, but no charges were
ever brought. At the time of his

10:07.640 --> 10:12.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
death, the autopsy found
McDonald had the drug PCP in his

10:12.245 --> 10:16.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system. Jason Van Dyke is a
37-year-old white police

10:16.883 --> 10:20.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer. He is married with two
teenage children. He served on

10:20.887 --> 10:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Chicago police force for 14
years. During that time, he

10:25.325 --> 10:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
received 18 citizen complaints,
eight of which were claims of

10:30.063 --> 10:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
excessive force. Van Dyke's
lawyer told CNN today that the

10:34.567 --> 10:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dashboard camera video is
unreliable, and that his client

10:38.872 --> 10:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was justified in shooting the
teen. DANIEL HERBERT, Attorney

10:41.341 --> 10:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Jason Van Dyke: No matter
how clear it is, there are

10:44.377 --> 10:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problems with video. And most
important, I think, is the fact

10:49.349 --> 10:53.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that video by its nature is
two-dimensional. And it distorts

10:53.753 --> 10:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
images. So, what appears to be
clear on a video sometimes is

10:58.091 --> 11:00.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not always that clear. JUDY
WOODRUFF: Officer Van Dyke is

11:00.994 --> 11:05.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being held without bail. His
next court appearance is on

11:05.098 --> 11:09.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Monday. And now, for a law
enforcement perspective on this

11:09.469 --> 11:12.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
video and the events it
captures, we turn to David

11:12.372 --> 11:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Klinger. He's professor of
criminal justice at the

11:15.241 --> 11:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of Missouri-Saint
Louis, and a former police

11:18.611 --> 11:23.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer. He is also author of
"Into the Kill Zone: A Cop's Eye

11:23.416 --> 11:27.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
View of Deadly Force," a book
based on firsthand interviews

11:27.086 --> 11:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with police officers who have
shot people while on duty. David

11:31.724 --> 11:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Klinger, welcome to the program.
After looking at this video,

11:35.929 --> 11:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what does it tell you about what
happened on that night in

11:39.299 --> 11:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
October a year ago? DAVID
KLINGER, Professor, University

11:41.301 --> 11:44.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Missouri-Saint Louis: What I
see is, I see a tactical failure

11:44.370 --> 11:47.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the part of the officer that
ended up shooting, as well as

11:47.307 --> 11:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his partner. And what I mean by
that is, police officers, when

11:50.376 --> 11:54.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're dealing with individuals
who are reportedly armed with an

11:54.047 --> 11:57.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
edged weapon, a knife, a
hatchet, a machete, what they're

11:57.116 --> 12:00.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trained to do is, they are
trained to try to keep distance.

12:00.219 --> 12:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so if you look at the video,
what we see from the back of Mr.

12:04.357 --> 12:07.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McDonald as he's walking toward
these police officers is, he

12:07.327 --> 12:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moves away and the officers
actually move towards him away

12:10.897 --> 12:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from their vehicle. And so
that's the very first thing that

12:13.900 --> 12:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I saw. And I'm thinking, this
really doesn't make any sense. I

12:17.437 --> 12:20.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was thinking at first perhaps
there was maybe some innocent

12:20.206 --> 12:22.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people on the opposite side of
the street. I checked the video

12:22.842 --> 12:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a couple, three times. There is
no evidence that there were any

12:25.111 --> 12:28.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other citizens who might be in
jeopardy, and so it didn't make

12:28.581 --> 12:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any sense. And then, when the
gunshots start to ring out, I

12:32.619 --> 12:36.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
couldn't understand why shots
were being fired. Then McDonald

12:36.522 --> 12:39.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
falls down, and I don't
understand why additional shots

12:39.325 --> 12:44.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are fired. And so, as I look at
this, I am scratching my head,

12:44.397 --> 12:47.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
figuratively, because it doesn't
add up. It doesn't appear to me

12:47.767 --> 12:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be what we call a reasonable
use of deadly force. JUDY

12:50.303 --> 12:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, the lawyer for the
officer is saying -- we just

12:54.707 --> 12:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heard him say that, from a
different perspective, this

12:59.445 --> 13:02.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer saw something that we
are not able to see in this

13:02.281 --> 13:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video. What could that possibly
be? DAVID KLINGER: I don't know.

13:06.252 --> 13:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, at one point, I do agree
with the lawyer that a video is

13:10.289 --> 13:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
never dispositive, because it
doesn't tell everything. What

13:13.893 --> 13:17.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the courts have ruled for a long
time, for over 30 years now --

13:17.697 --> 13:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or excuse me -- for 30 years
now, is you have to take the

13:20.066 --> 13:23.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
totality of the circumstances
into account when you're looking

13:23.603 --> 13:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at what police officers do. And
then in 1989 in Graham v.

13:27.273 --> 13:30.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Connor, the U.S. Supreme Court
said that you can't look at it

13:30.543 --> 13:33.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with 20/20 hindsight, but rather
through the eyes of a reasonable

13:33.546 --> 13:37.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police officer on or at the
scene. And so, consequently, we

13:37.417 --> 13:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do have to take into account
everything in addition to the

13:40.486 --> 13:43.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video that might be relevant.
What that might be that would

13:43.990 --> 13:47.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overturn what appears to be a
clear-cut case of unreasonable

13:47.326 --> 13:49.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
force, I don't know what it is.
But, certainly, the

13:49.996 --> 13:52.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investigation is never over
merely because a video comes

13:52.965 --> 13:55.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forth. We have to hear the
officer's statement, partner's

13:55.668 --> 13:58.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
statement, listen to the
dispatch tapes. Maybe there's

13:59.005 --> 14:01.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other video, maybe there's other
audio we're unaware of. The

14:01.274 --> 14:05.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bottom line is that the officer
has been charged with homicide,

14:05.745 --> 14:09.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with first-degree murder, and he
deserves his day in court, and

14:09.248 --> 14:11.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he deserves to have the
opportunity to put forth a

14:11.384 --> 14:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defense. And we will have to see
what the defense is. JUDY

14:13.619 --> 14:17.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: You started out
describing what an officer might

14:17.090 --> 14:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do approaching someone, you
said, with an edged weapon. What

14:20.626 --> 14:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the standard of practice for
an officer in a situation like

14:24.964 --> 14:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this? I know you can't
generalize across every part of

14:27.300 --> 14:30.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country, but in general,
what would be the practice an

14:30.169 --> 14:34.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer is advised to take?
DAVID KLINGER: In a situation

14:34.841 --> 14:36.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where you're dealing with an
individual with a knife, a

14:36.843 --> 14:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hatchet, some other form of
edged weapon, you want to try to

14:39.078 --> 14:41.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
keep distance. And the reason
you want to try to keep distance

14:41.814 --> 14:45.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is if you are 30 or 40 or 50
feet away, it's awfully hard for

14:45.151 --> 14:48.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that individual armed with that
weapon to harm you with it. But

14:48.621 --> 14:51.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when a suspect is within about
20 to 25 feet -- it depends on

14:52.024 --> 14:53.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what training block of
instruction you might get in a

14:54.026 --> 14:56.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
given police department around
the country -- that's what we

14:56.629 --> 15:00.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
call the zone where an officer
could reasonably perceive that

15:00.433 --> 15:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his or her life is in jeopardy
if someone is moving towards

15:03.469 --> 15:06.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them. JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.
DAVID KLINGER: And the reason

15:06.572 --> 15:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for that is basically threefold.
Number one, it takes time to

15:09.475 --> 15:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perceive something and react to
it. Were you trying to cut me

15:11.477 --> 15:13.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
off, ma'am? JUDY WOODRUFF: No, I
was -- because I just wanted to

15:13.479 --> 15:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get to one -- one question.
DAVID KLINGER: OK. JUDY

15:15.481 --> 15:17.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And that is, when
someone is down on the ground,

15:17.650 --> 15:21.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what justifies continuing to
fire round after round at that

15:21.454 --> 15:25.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
person? DAVID KLINGER: In this
situation, I can't see anything

15:25.958 --> 15:28.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that would justify it. However,
if an individual was armed with

15:28.895 --> 15:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a firearm, it really doesn't
matter if they're standing up,

15:31.597 --> 15:34.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sitting down or laying down. If
they are moving that firearm in

15:34.767 --> 15:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a fashion that could threaten
someone, i.e., they could be

15:37.603 --> 15:41.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continuing to pull the trigger,
then that would be justifiable.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, in this situation, as far
as I know -- and I haven't heard

15:44.677 --> 15:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any claim that there was any
indication at all that the

15:48.181 --> 15:51.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suspect was armed with a firearm
-- it wouldn't make any sense to

15:51.250 --> 15:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continue to fire. JUDY WOODRUFF:
Professor David Klinger,

15:53.986 --> 15:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University of Missouri-Saint
Louis, we thank you. DAVID

15:56.789 --> 15:59.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KLINGER: Thank you for having
me. JUDY WOODRUFF: And, next, we

15:59.859 --> 16:02.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hear from two reporters who have
been closely following these

16:02.728 --> 16:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
events. They both have years of
experience covering Chicago

16:05.998 --> 16:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crime, policing, and race
relations. Mark Konkol is a

16:10.002 --> 16:14.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
columnist at DNA Info. It's a
neighborhood reporting site. In

16:14.941 --> 16:19.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2011, he and a team at The
Chicago Sun-Times won a Pulitzer

16:19.779 --> 16:23.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Prize for their reporting on
violence, crime and policing in

16:23.049 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chicago. And Jamie Kalven is a
freelance journalist. He

16:27.119 --> 16:31.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
uncovered the autopsy report
showing that Laquan McDonald was

16:31.157 --> 16:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shot 16 times by officer Jason
Van Dyke. Kalven is also the

16:35.795 --> 16:39.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
founder of the Invisible
Institute. It's a nonprofit

16:39.265 --> 16:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
journalism project that recently
released tens of thousands of

16:43.002 --> 16:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pages of civilian complaints
filed against the Chicago Police

16:47.773 --> 16:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Department. And, gentlemen, we
thank you both for being with

16:50.610 --> 16:54.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us. Mark Konkol, let me start
with you. How does this incident

16:54.714 --> 16:59.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fit into the bigger picture of
Chicago police relations with

16:59.552 --> 17:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the African-American community
in that city? MARK KONKOL,

17:02.889 --> 17:06.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DNAinfo: Well, I think that it's
just a big example of what's

17:06.392 --> 17:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been happening for a long time.
There is a severe lack of trust

17:09.795 --> 17:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between people who live in
poverty-stricken communities

17:13.833 --> 17:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are crippled by violence
and fractured gang wars. And

17:18.304 --> 17:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chicago -- the Chicago Police
Department, there's a lot of

17:20.673 --> 17:24.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good cops on the department. I
would say the overwhelming

17:24.043 --> 17:28.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
majority, 90 percent, 95 percent
-- and there's been stories

17:28.848 --> 17:33.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
written that, you know, there is
a few officers that are

17:33.419 --> 17:37.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
troubled. But, overall, the
police department has a

17:37.990 --> 17:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generational problem that a
federal judge said was a culture

17:43.095 --> 17:47.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's of the public interest,
and that is the thin blue line

17:47.233 --> 17:50.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
code of silence within the
department. And it's something

17:50.670 --> 17:55.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's really wrong with the
department. And Cook County

17:55.274 --> 17:59.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Toni Preckwinkle
recently said that the culture

17:59.111 --> 18:05.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of law enforcement isn't
trusted, and it's just -- this

18:05.117 --> 18:09.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incident highlights that to the
nth degree. And the protests

18:09.555 --> 18:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really aren't just about one
incident. It's about being fed

18:13.125 --> 18:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up. JUDY WOODRUFF: Right. MARK
KONKOL: And I think that's the

18:15.895 --> 18:18.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
message that these protesters
have been sending and that

18:18.230 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public officials have been
sending as well. JUDY WOODRUFF:

18:20.733 --> 18:23.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me turn to you, Jamie
Kalven. As we said, you were

18:23.502 --> 18:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
part of the effort to uncover
the documents that showed just

18:29.442 --> 18:34.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what happened on that night and
a broader practice among Chicago

18:34.447 --> 18:40.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police. It's been 13 months
since Laquan McDonald was killed

18:40.886 --> 18:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- died. What could explain the
delay in releasing this video

18:45.758 --> 18:49.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and in charging this officer, as
he was yesterday? JAMIE KALVEN,

18:49.495 --> 18:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Invisible Institute: I think
that's the essential question at

18:52.098 --> 18:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this point. Everything that we
now know the day after the video

18:57.069 --> 19:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was released was known by the
city, by the department within

19:01.440 --> 19:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hours of Laquan McDonald's
death. There were multiple

19:07.380 --> 19:11.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
witnesses, police witnesses,
civilian witnesses. There was

19:11.283 --> 19:15.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the video, and the autopsy you
referred to before was actually

19:15.488 --> 19:20.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conducted at 8:30 the next
morning with an investigator

19:20.192 --> 19:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the Independent Police
Review Authority, the city

19:23.662 --> 19:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agency tasked with investigating
police shootings in the room.

19:28.034 --> 19:31.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you know, with all of that
information, the information

19:31.537 --> 19:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that has been the basis now for
the indictment of officer Van

19:36.909 --> 19:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dyke, the city put out, the
police department put out a

19:40.112 --> 19:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
press release saying that the
young man had approached and

19:46.485 --> 19:51.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lunged toward the police
officers and was shot as an act

19:51.724 --> 19:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of self-defense on the part of
officer Van Dyke. They have to

19:55.728 --> 19:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have known that that was a
fabrication. Now, 13 months

19:59.231 --> 20:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
later, we're getting a quite
different narrative. So, I mean,

20:03.469 --> 20:08.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this -- if this had been a gang
shooting in Chicago, with this

20:08.240 --> 20:14.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amount of evidence, witnesses,
video, the information from the

20:14.313 --> 20:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
autopsy, I imagine it would have
been weeks, you know, a matter

20:19.118 --> 20:22.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of a few weeks before an
indictment was returned. So I

20:22.655 --> 20:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think -- I don't know the answer
to that question, but I think it

20:25.157 --> 20:28.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the question of the moment.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Konkol, what

20:28.561 --> 20:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- what do you know about your
reporting on the Chicago police

20:32.198 --> 20:36.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that could explain this, the
delay? MARK KONKOL: Well, one of

20:36.035 --> 20:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the -- there is a provision in
the Chicago Police Department's

20:39.872 --> 20:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
union contract that says when
there is a complaint of

20:44.009 --> 20:49.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
misconduct against an officer,
the city, the citizen review

20:49.381 --> 20:54.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
board is not allowed to release
the name or any -- identify the

20:54.453 --> 20:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer in any way unless the
complaint is sustained. When we

20:58.124 --> 21:02.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bring up the fact that officer
Van Dyke had 18 misconduct

21:02.261 --> 21:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
complaints, all of them which
were not sustained, some people

21:09.802 --> 21:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that's a red flag, and
that that's something that the

21:12.338 --> 21:15.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public should know when it
actually happens. When there is

21:15.374 --> 21:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a police shooting, reporters
across the city file Freedom of

21:17.376 --> 21:19.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Information Act requests to get
the video of the shooting, and

21:19.378 --> 21:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're always doing that for
the same reason, that the case

21:21.380 --> 21:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is under investigation. It's a
very broad statement that police

21:23.382 --> 21:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
use. (CROSSTALK) JUDY WOODRUFF:
And we heard the prosecutor...

21:25.384 --> 21:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(CROSSTALK) MARK KONKOL: ...
public records. JUDY WOODRUFF:

21:27.386 --> 21:29.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Excuse me. I was just going to
say, we heard the prosecutor say

21:29.388 --> 21:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yesterday it's more complex when
it's a police officer involved.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK KONKOL: Well, yes, it is
more complex. And it usually is.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there's -- what happened
here is that the city paid a $5

21:35.394 --> 21:37.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million settlement without a
lawsuit being filed. The

21:37.396 --> 21:39.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information didn't come up. And
it wasn't until citizens,

21:39.398 --> 21:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
journalists fought to get the
video released in court that we

21:41.400 --> 21:43.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know what we know now. And I
think all those things

21:43.402 --> 21:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contribute to a lack of trust in
the community. And these are the

21:45.404 --> 21:47.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things that you hear Chicago
aldermen saying need to be

21:47.406 --> 21:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remedied. There needs to be more
sunlight on this process. JUDY

21:49.408 --> 21:51.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Let me... MARK KONKOL:
If you want people that have

21:51.410 --> 21:53.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been suffering from gun violence
in these neighborhoods to be

21:53.412 --> 21:55.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
held accountable for cooperating
with police, the message that's

21:55.414 --> 21:57.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being sent is, we want the
police to be under the same

21:57.416 --> 21:59.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
amount of scrutiny. JUDY
WOODRUFF: Jamie Kalven, let me

21:59.418 --> 22:01.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just repeat what we heard Mayor
Emanuel say just a minute ago,

22:01.353 --> 22:06.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that: We want to get to a point
in our community where young men

22:32.818 --> 22:34.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see an officer and don't just
see someone in a uniform and a

22:34.820 --> 22:36.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
badge, but someone who is a
partner helping them reach their

22:36.822 --> 22:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
potential. Is Chicago making
progress in that regard? We hear

22:38.824 --> 22:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
statistics that the number of
officer-involved shootings is

22:40.826 --> 22:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down in the African-American
community. JAMIE KALVEN: Well,

22:42.828 --> 22:44.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's only one measure. I spent
a lot of time -- I have spent a

22:44.830 --> 22:46.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of time in recent years
doing intensive interviews with

22:46.832 --> 22:48.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young African-American teenagers
on the South Side of Chicago in

22:48.834 --> 22:50.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neighborhoods most affected by
these patterns. They

22:50.836 --> 22:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consistently say two things,
first, that: If we have an

23:08.220 --> 23:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
encounter with police officers,
we know they have all the power.

23:27.706 --> 23:31.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, secondly, if something
happens in a random stop or some

23:31.343 --> 23:33.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other kind of interaction with a
police officer, something

23:33.812 --> 23:37.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happens, we know we won't be
believed. Until those

23:37.850 --> 23:42.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fundamental conditions change,
then I think there are all sorts

23:42.288 --> 23:46.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of other -- otherwise sensible
measurers, in terms of building

23:46.492 --> 23:50.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relationships and police
officers interacting with

23:50.729 --> 23:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
residents in contexts apart from
law enforcement -- all these

23:54.767 --> 23:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things make -- make perfect
sense -- in the absence of

23:59.004 --> 24:02.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accountability, in the absence
of confidence on the part of

24:02.508 --> 24:06.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
citizens that, if police
officers exceed their roles,

24:06.745 --> 24:11.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violate the public trust, they
will be effectively disciplined,

24:11.150 --> 24:15.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then I think it just impeaches
and undermines everything else.

24:16.021 --> 24:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, gentlemen,
we are going to have to leave it

24:18.724 --> 24:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there. Clearly, Chicago is a
city in the spotlight right now,

24:24.029 --> 24:26.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I know we're going to
continue to follow this. We

24:26.432 --> 24:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thank you both, Mark Konkol and
Jamie Kalven. Thank you. JAMIE

24:30.302 --> 24:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KALVEN: Thank you. MARK KONKOL:
Thanks. JUDY WOODRUFF: And the

24:33.739 --> 24:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
problem of police shootings
isn't isolated to the city of

24:37.042 --> 24:40.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chicago. A funeral was held in
Minneapolis today for Jamar

24:40.546 --> 24:44.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clark. He's a black man who was
fatally shot by police last

24:44.249 --> 24:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week. His funeral procession
passed Black Lives Matter

24:48.053 --> 24:51.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
protesters who have been
demonstrating for days. Police

24:51.824 --> 24:54.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also announced they have a
fourth person in custody in the

24:54.927 --> 24:59.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shootings of some of the
protesters on Monday. Nearly two

25:09.975 --> 25:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
months after a bombing at a
hospital in Afghanistan, the

25:13.645 --> 25:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
U.S. military has completed its
investigation into the incident.

25:17.449 --> 25:20.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The announcement and details
about why the hospital was

25:20.753 --> 25:25.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mistakenly targeted came out
today in Kabul. Hari Sreenivasan

25:25.257 --> 25:27.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has our story. GEN. JOHN
CAMPBELL, Commander of U.S.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Forces in Afghanistan: This was
a tragic mistake. U.S. forces

25:29.762 --> 25:33.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would never intentionally strike
a hospital or other protected

25:33.132 --> 25:36.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facilities. HARI SREENIVASAN:
General John Campbell, the U.S.

25:36.468 --> 25:40.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
commander in Afghanistan, said
the destruction of the hospital

25:41.006 --> 25:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the northern city of Kunduz
was an avoidable accident.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the judgment contained in
a more-than-3,000-page report

25:46.245 --> 25:50.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compiled since the early October
attack. At least 31 civilians

25:50.249 --> 25:54.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
died and another 28 were injured
when a U.S. warplane struck the

25:54.486 --> 25:57.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facility operated by Doctors
Without Borders, more commonly

25:58.023 --> 26:02.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know by its French acronym, MSF.
Despite repeated calls from its

26:02.961 --> 26:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
staff to American officials both
inside and outside Afghanistan,

26:06.865 --> 26:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hospital was hammered by the
American AC-130 gunship. The

26:12.838 --> 26:15.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack followed days of heavy
fighting in Kunduz as Afghan and

26:15.541 --> 26:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
American forces fought to retake
the city from the Taliban.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Campbell said the plane's
crew had been given faulty

26:22.014 --> 26:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
location information of a
suspected Taliban base. GEN.

26:25.717 --> 26:28.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN CAMPBELL: That U.S. strike
upon the MSF trauma center in

26:28.487 --> 26:33.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kunduz city, Afghanistan, was
the direct result of human error

26:33.292 --> 26:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
compounded by systems and
procedural failures. The medical

26:36.929 --> 26:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facility was misidentified as a
target by U.S. personnel who

26:41.300 --> 26:43.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
believed they were striking a
different building several

26:43.635 --> 26:46.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hundred meters away, where there
were reports of combatants. HARI

26:47.005 --> 26:50.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: MSF has maintained
no armed fighters were in the

26:50.075 --> 26:53.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
area near the hospital when the
strike occurred. The group

26:53.045 --> 26:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
released its own report earlier
this month. Today, it repeated

26:56.548 --> 26:59.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its call for an independent
investigation, and said the

26:59.585 --> 27:04.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attack cannot only be dismissed
as individual human error.

27:04.423 --> 27:06.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Joining me now for more on this
is Gordon Lubold of The Wall

27:06.758 --> 27:09.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Street Journal. He's just been
briefed on the report by

27:09.595 --> 27:12.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pentagon officials. So, the big
question I think everyone is

27:12.664 --> 27:16.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wondering is, how could they get
this so wrong, when Doctors

27:16.435 --> 27:19.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Without Borders goes out of
their way to make sure that

27:19.905 --> 27:23.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyone in the theater knows
exactly where the hospital is?

27:23.342 --> 27:26.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GORDON LUBOLD, The Wall Street
Journal: Right. So, what we

27:26.578 --> 27:29.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
learned from this report that
was released today at the

27:29.815 --> 27:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pentagon and General Campbell,
who is the commander of all

27:33.051 --> 27:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
allied and U.S. forces in
Afghanistan, is that this really

27:36.121 --> 27:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was human error. It was just a
combination of errors, really,

27:41.026 --> 27:45.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to include some technical
problems that they had on the

27:45.264 --> 27:49.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gunship that was used during the
October 3 strike that

27:49.535 --> 27:54.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contributed to just the wrong
targeting of the -- targeting of

27:54.206 --> 27:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the wrong building in Kunduz
that night And it ended up being

27:58.677 --> 28:01.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hospital, not the building
several hundred meters away that

28:02.014 --> 28:04.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they meant to target. HARI
SREENIVASAN: So, Afghan forces

28:04.650 --> 28:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
send in the coordinates to this
gunship, but, according to the

28:08.587 --> 28:11.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
summary by the general, the
gunship is, what, just out of

28:11.523 --> 28:14.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
range enough where their GPS is
just a little off? GORDON

28:14.426 --> 28:17.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LUBOLD: Right. Afghan forces
conveyed coordinates to the

28:17.796 --> 28:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right target, which happened to
be an intelligence building

28:21.533 --> 28:25.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where the Taliban was known to
be positioned. Through U.S.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
special forces who were also on
the ground there, they conveyed

28:29.241 --> 28:33.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these coordinates to the crew of
the gunship. But because the --

28:33.912 --> 28:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of the capabilities on the
ship and on the plane itself

28:38.750 --> 28:42.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were malfunctioning, a lot of
this was communicated verbally,

28:42.588 --> 28:48.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the coordinates somehow got
plugged in and, I think, maybe

28:48.160 --> 28:51.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
properly, but it malfunctioned
and sent the crew to an empty

28:51.630 --> 28:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
field to be the target. The crew
realized, this is the wrong

28:54.600 --> 28:59.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place and relied then on a
verbal description of the

28:59.037 --> 29:01.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
target, and then began striking
for about a half-an-hour the

29:01.506 --> 29:03.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hospital, and not the actual
target, which was, as I say,

29:03.508 --> 29:05.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
several hundred meters away. And
I think what we learned was that

29:05.510 --> 29:07.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
word never got to them in time
to stop targeting that hospital,

29:07.512 --> 29:09.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they just simply didn't
realize that that was the place

29:09.514 --> 29:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they weren't supposed to hit.
HARI SREENIVASAN: During the

29:11.516 --> 29:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airstrikes, people from the
hospital were calling anyone

29:13.518 --> 29:15.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they could, and they were
actually getting that

29:15.520 --> 29:17.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
information to headquarters,
saying, listen, you're bombing

29:17.522 --> 29:19.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us, you have the wrong target.
But wasn't there a list that

29:19.524 --> 29:24.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they could compare to say, OK, I
guess, guys, you guys are

29:39.978 --> 29:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bombing an area that's on our
no-bomb list? GORDON LUBOLD:

29:42.848 --> 29:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right. And from the outside,
even to me -- and I cover this a

29:46.585 --> 29:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot -- it doesn't quite make
sense, like, why it would take

29:50.255 --> 29:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that long for the kind of
process to catch up with itself,

29:54.726 --> 29:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when somebody's calling, as you
say, and saying, like, you're

29:58.597 --> 30:03.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bombing us, this is the wrong
place. But I think that because

30:03.235 --> 30:07.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the communications errors,
because of the -- as somebody

30:07.072 --> 30:10.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who's very familiar with it
described to me this morning,

30:10.942 --> 30:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said, the crew of the gunship
had kind of convinced themselves

30:14.613 --> 30:17.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this was the target. I
don't -- again, I don't think

30:17.683 --> 30:19.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they were getting
information that it wasn't the

30:19.685 --> 30:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
target yet, as I understand it.
But because of the problems and

30:23.755 --> 30:26.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the because of the verbal
description that was given to

30:26.291 --> 30:29.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, they essentially were
convinced that was the -- they

30:29.061 --> 30:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were doing the right thing, they
were targeting the right place.

30:32.097 --> 30:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, obviously, they weren't.
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what are

30:34.199 --> 30:36.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the consequences now that the
government has this report?

30:36.301 --> 30:39.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GORDON LUBOLD: The consequences
are that we don't know yet what

30:39.604 --> 30:42.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will happen to these military
personnel who have been

30:42.307 --> 30:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suspended from their jobs.
General Campbell will conduct an

30:45.010 --> 30:48.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assessment, and then we will
know who -- what happens to

30:48.313 --> 30:51.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these people. But, for now,
we're in that zone of he's still

30:51.917 --> 30:54.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conducting an investigation into
what's going to happen to them.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Gordon Lubold
of The Wall Street Journal,

30:56.922 --> 31:01.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thanks so much for joining us.
GORDON LUBOLD: Thank you. JUDY

31:08.033 --> 31:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Stay with us. Coming
up on the "NewsHour": how to eat

31:13.538 --> 31:18.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
better and shop differently
while living on very little; and

31:18.243 --> 31:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Queen of Soul on her past,
present and future. But, first,

31:23.849 --> 31:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this week marks the 100th
anniversary of the publication

31:27.018 --> 31:31.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Albert Einstein's greatest
work, a series of papers laying

31:31.356 --> 31:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out the general theory of
relativity. Gwen has a look at

31:35.127 --> 31:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how it changed our understanding
of the cosmos and the man behind

31:39.164 --> 31:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ideas. She recorded this
conversation earlier this week.

31:42.834 --> 31:47.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: His work transformed
our way of living at the cosmos.

31:47.739 --> 31:51.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When Einstein put forward his
general theory of relativity,

31:51.276 --> 31:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that gravity itself is the
bending of space and time by

31:54.746 --> 31:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mass and energy, it was a
seminal moment in the history of

31:58.116 --> 32:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
science. Today, the importance
of his work is even better

32:01.419 --> 32:05.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recognized than a century ago.
"NOVA" pays tribute tonight with

32:05.423 --> 32:10.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a special program called "Inside
Einstein's Mind." Here's a clip

32:10.228 --> 32:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about how it's seen today. MAN:
The best theories in physics

32:13.932 --> 32:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
always take to places where the
people who invented them didn't

32:16.868 --> 32:20.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
imagine. And a truly wonderful
theory like general relativity

32:20.038 --> 32:23.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
predicts all sorts of things
that Einstein didn't conceive

32:23.141 --> 32:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of. The theory has a life of its
own. We understand general

32:26.945 --> 32:30.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relativity much better right now
than Albert Einstein ever did.

remarkable predictions of the

32:55.106 --> 33:00.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
black holes, ripples in
space-time, and perhaps the most

33:04.583 --> 33:10.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bizarre, the idea that not just
space, but time itself, is

distorted by heavy objects. GWEN

that the theory, the general

33:27.339 --> 33:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to say that right -- is
the most beautiful theory in the

mean by that? WALTER ISAACSON:

33:33.678 --> 33:36.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gorgeous. It is a mathematical,
as well as conceptual

33:36.882 --> 33:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
masterpiece. It's something that
can be visualized as bodies

telling space and time how to
curve and the curving of space

33:43.788 --> 33:47.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and time telling bodies how to
move, and then the math goes

33:47.492 --> 33:50.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with it. And it was just a
hugely -- it wasn't like a

33:50.562 --> 33:53.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little improvement over Newton's
universe. It was just a whole

33:53.565 --> 33:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new way of looking at the
universe. GWEN IFILL: Define

33:55.567 --> 33:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relativity for a layperson like
myself. WALTER ISAACSON:

33:58.236 --> 34:01.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Relativity begins in 1905, in
which Einstein says, oh, time is

34:01.940 --> 34:05.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relative depending on your state
of motion. Then 10 years ago,

34:05.877 --> 34:08.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
exactly 100 years ago this week,
he comes up with the

34:08.813 --> 34:13.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generalization of the theory
that says acceleration, gravity,

34:13.652 --> 34:17.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time, space, they're all
related, and these equations

34:17.389 --> 34:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
show how. GWEN IFILL: And the
thing that bends the whole

34:21.059 --> 34:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation is the speed of
light, right? We use the term

34:23.995 --> 34:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speed of light in a haphazard
way all the time, but he meant

34:28.366 --> 34:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it in a very literal way. WALTER
ISAACSON: It begins with

34:31.536 --> 34:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Einstein trying to figure out,
why is the speed of light always

34:34.906 --> 34:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
constant, no matter which way
you're moving, if you're moving

34:37.309 --> 34:40.779 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
toward the source of the light
or away from it? And in 1905,

34:40.812 --> 34:44.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when he was just a patent clerk
in the Swiss patent office, all

34:44.482 --> 34:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the physicists of Europe are
trying to figure this out. And

34:47.319 --> 34:51.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he begins his path to whole
theory of relativity by

34:51.256 --> 34:54.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
realizing that if you're
traveling really fast, say, to

34:54.259 --> 34:57.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clock, it will look different
for you, whether it's

34:57.329 --> 35:00.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
synchronized, as somebody
traveling really fast in the

35:00.131 --> 35:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other direction. And he comes up
with the amazing, sort of

35:03.935 --> 35:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
imaginatively, that, oh, I get
it, the speed of light is always

35:07.706 --> 35:11.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
constant, but time is relevant
depending on your state of

35:11.242 --> 35:14.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
motion. So that's the first
building block of the whole

35:14.612 --> 35:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
theory of relativity. It's
called the special theory of

35:17.449 --> 35:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relativity, because it was just
about constant velocity, motion

35:20.885 --> 35:23.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the speed of light. GWEN
IFILL: And then gravity comes

35:23.154 --> 35:25.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the equation. WALTER
ISAACSON: Right. It takes him 10

35:25.190 --> 35:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years to generalize this -- the
theory, because he's wondering,

35:28.593 --> 35:32.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what about the acceleration? And
his theory says, nothing can

35:32.464 --> 35:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
travel faster than the speed of
light. But Newton's theory of

35:35.467 --> 35:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gravity said that gravity acts
instantaneously, the moon

35:39.771 --> 35:43.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pulling the sun, pulling the
Earth, vice versa. That's

35:43.341 --> 35:46.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
instantaneous. And Einstein is
trying to figure out how that

35:46.444 --> 35:50.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be, and so he realizes
that the effects you would feel

35:50.482 --> 35:54.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of acceleration, like if you're
in an car, an elevator car

35:54.586 --> 35:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accelerating upwards, that feels
just like gravity. And he comes

35:58.156 --> 36:01.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up with the equivalence theory,
that gravity and acceleration

36:01.493 --> 36:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are both really the same thing.
GWEN IFILL: Bowling ball and the

36:04.596 --> 36:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trampoline, explain -- I love
that idea, that analogy.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(CROSSTALK) WALTER ISAACSON:
That's another way he visualizes

36:10.001 --> 36:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, because the cool thing about
Einstein is, he thinks visually

36:13.371 --> 36:15.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in imaginative thought
experiment. And one of them is

36:15.940 --> 36:19.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rolling a big ball on a piece of
fabric. You and I can call it a

36:19.444 --> 36:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trampoline. And what happens? It
curves the fabric. Now, if you

36:23.081 --> 36:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
roll some billiard balls behind
it, what happens? They roll and

36:26.451 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they start curving towards the
bowling ball. Why? Not because

36:30.221 --> 36:33.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bowling ball has some
mysterious attraction at a

36:33.258 --> 36:35.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
distance, but because the ball
has curved the fabric of the

36:35.827 --> 36:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trampoline. And what Einstein is
able to visualize is that a big

36:39.531 --> 36:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mass moving curves not just the
fabric of the trampoline, but

36:44.002 --> 36:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all four dimensions of space and
time. GWEN IFILL: You talk about

36:47.806 --> 36:51.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thought experiments. Was
Einstein basically a daydreamer?

36:51.543 --> 36:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALTER ISAACSON: Yes. He gets to
call them gedankenexperiment,

36:54.979 --> 36:57.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which means thought experiments.
These are things where he

36:57.348 --> 37:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
imagines what happens if a big
object is rolling across a

37:01.152 --> 37:04.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fabric. And it's just
imagination, what we might call

37:04.422 --> 37:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
daydreaming. He never did
physical experiments in a lab.

37:08.726 --> 37:12.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He just did the experiments
visualizing concepts in his head

37:12.864 --> 37:16.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and said, well, what if I caught
up with a light beam? Or what if

37:16.367 --> 37:20.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I were in the car -- an elevator
car accelerating upward in outer

37:20.371 --> 37:23.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
space where there is no gravity?
Or what would happen if a

37:23.074 --> 37:26.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
massive object rolled over a
fabric? These were the

37:26.578 --> 37:29.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
imaginative thought experiments
that leads him to this most

37:29.848 --> 37:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beautiful of all theories. GWEN
IFILL: If this was never proven

37:33.485 --> 37:38.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a lab, or at least if that is
not where his ideas came from,

37:38.790 --> 37:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has anyone ever tried in the 100
years since to debunk the

37:40.792 --> 37:42.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
theory? WALTER ISAACSON: Oh,
over and over again. The first

37:42.794 --> 37:46.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
major proof is in 1919, because
he says, well, gravity will bend

37:46.564 --> 37:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a light beam a certain way. And
you say, well, we could look at

37:50.135 --> 37:52.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the light from a star that goes
right next to the sun to see if

37:52.904 --> 37:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's bent. But you can't do that
unless you have a total eclipse.

37:55.640 --> 37:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, you go blind. So,
they wait for the 1919 eclipse,

37:59.611 --> 38:03.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and it proves Einstein right.
Over and over again, you read

38:03.581 --> 38:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stories saying, Einstein's
theories disproved or debunked,

38:07.785 --> 38:12.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then you wait a month or
two, and there has been nothing

38:12.690 --> 38:14.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that has cut out the
underpinnings of general

38:14.859 --> 38:17.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relativity, of all of
relativity. And even the ones

38:17.462 --> 38:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Einstein thought, well,
this just can't be true, like

38:20.565 --> 38:24.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his theory predicts black holes
-- it predicts an expanding

38:24.169 --> 38:27.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cosmos. He said, well, that
can't be right, so maybe

38:27.105 --> 38:30.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
somebody will have to fix the
theory. It turns out the theory

38:30.141 --> 38:33.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is right, and the universe is
expanding. There are black

38:33.111 --> 38:36.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
holes. GWEN IFILL: Einstein, we
salute you. WALTER ISAACSON: A

birthday. GWEN IFILL: A hundred

38:39.751 --> 38:44.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years ago. (LAUGHTER) GWEN

pans and stove tops to make

38:54.666 --> 38:58.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
family favorites this week, but
for tens of millions of

38:58.369 --> 39:01.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans, getting dinner on the

financial challenge.
Correspondent William Brangham

39:04.842 --> 39:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
went to New York to visit the
author of a new cookbook aimed

39:08.479 --> 39:12.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at helping families eat well
while stretching their food

39:12.116 --> 39:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dollars. He was there just in
time to try a few recipes for

39:15.954 --> 39:18.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thanksgiving. WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Walking through a grocery store

39:18.323 --> 39:20.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Leanne Brown, you're going
to get a whirlwind of advice.

39:20.992 --> 39:23.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEANNE BROWN, Author, "Good and
Cheap: Eat Well on $4/Day": You

39:23.628 --> 39:26.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
want to get these little
snack-size guys. But they are

39:26.464 --> 39:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
often about double the price of
what you would pay if you're

39:29.234 --> 39:32.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just buying the larger quantity.
Always get a can of tomatoes,

39:32.704 --> 39:36.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rather than a jar. Always in
almost all of these is large

39:36.441 --> 39:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tomatoes. WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Brown's mission is to help

39:38.810 --> 39:41.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shoppers on a tight budget
stretch their money and to

39:41.546 --> 39:44.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
create new options in the
kitchen. It's at the core of her

39:44.549 --> 39:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new cookbook, "Good and Cheap:
Eat Well on $4/Day." The book

39:49.387 --> 39:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
began as her master's thesis
when she was at New York

39:51.923 --> 39:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University's Food Studies
Program. Brown wanted to develop

39:55.493 --> 39:59.197 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recipes to answer a simple
question: Could someone on food

39:59.230 --> 40:03.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stamp benefits eat well on the
program's average budget of $4

40:03.735 --> 40:06.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
per person per day? LEANNE
BROWN: Sure, there's a lot of

40:06.437 --> 40:08.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sort of black and white
pamphlets and there's a lot

40:08.673 --> 40:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like, here's how to eat cheaply.
But there wasn't as much stuff

40:11.542 --> 40:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on how to still eat well. And as
sort of, not a lifelong cooking,

40:15.179 --> 40:18.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but a most-of-my-life-long cook,
I know that the cost of basic

40:19.017 --> 40:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foods is so inexpensive, you
just need to know how to put

40:22.020 --> 40:23.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them together. That's where the
magic is. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To

40:24.022 --> 40:27.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brown's way of thinking, eating
well isn't a luxury, but a basic

40:27.458 --> 40:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right. LEANNE BROWN: Four
dollars a day is not something

40:29.661 --> 40:33.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that anyone should try to do.
It's a reality for 46 million

40:33.364 --> 40:36.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people. And in some ways, I
think it was a reaction to when

40:36.834 --> 40:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was studying and thinking,
this is so unjust, this is so

40:39.404 --> 40:41.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult, this is so terrible.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thesis

40:41.773 --> 40:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
finished, Brown posted the
recipes and her own photos on

40:44.742 --> 40:48.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her Web site free for anyone to
download. When someone posted

40:48.413 --> 40:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that on a popular online message
board, it took off. LEANNE

40:51.883 --> 40:53.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: At first, I felt like
something horrible had happened,

40:53.885 --> 40:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because, at that point, nobody
had been to my Web site, except,

40:57.088 --> 41:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like, my father to tell me about
all of the mistakes I had on

41:00.625 --> 41:02.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there. You know, like, nobody
was visiting it. I was like,

41:02.627 --> 41:06.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what is going on? But it turned
out to be all these people who

41:06.597 --> 41:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were really excited about it who
were saying, this is going to be

41:09.400 --> 41:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
helpful for me in my life right
now. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That led

41:11.703 --> 41:16.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a Kickstarter campaign. Brown
met her $10,000 goal in just 36

41:16.240 --> 41:20.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hours. She eventually raised 14
times that, and sent more than

41:20.244 --> 41:24.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
30,000 low- or no-cost books to
various nonprofits to give away

41:24.682 --> 41:28.252 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to their clients. The book's now
been published, complete with 50

41:28.286 --> 41:32.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new recipes. For every copy
purchased, one is given away to

41:32.223 --> 41:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
someone in need. The book's
popularity reaches beyond those

41:35.693 --> 41:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stuck with extremely tight
budgets. Maybe it's because

41:38.363 --> 41:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brown's message is so different
from popular cooking shows and

41:41.699 --> 41:45.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
foodie magazines, where good
cooking is really complex.

41:45.103 --> 41:47.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEANNE BROWN: I like to think of
my role as kind of coaxing

41:47.739 --> 41:50.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people to just give it a try,
because it's so easy, actually.

41:50.641 --> 41:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have to try it. And then I
think cooking sells itself.

41:54.545 --> 41:59.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
fast-approaching holidays don't

41:59.317 --> 42:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mean Brown's principles of
thoughtful, efficient shopping

42:02.387 --> 42:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and cooking have to go out the
window. So, it's Thanksgiving

42:05.556 --> 42:07.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
season. LEANNE BROWN: Yes.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: People are

42:07.558 --> 42:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
starting to think about planning
for that meal. What are some

42:09.560 --> 42:11.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basic guidelines you would
offer? LEANNE BROWN: Oh, man.

42:11.562 --> 42:13.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, so this is the time of the
year where everyone is, first,

42:13.564 --> 42:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cooking from scratch, which is
awesome. And you're eating a lot

42:15.566 --> 42:17.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of seasonal foods as well, which
is also awesome. That's like a

42:17.568 --> 42:19.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good and cheap principle. The
thing that I want everyone to

42:19.804 --> 42:22.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really keep in mind is that you
shouldn't feel like you have to

42:22.440 --> 42:25.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make all 20 of those sort of
side dishes, because that can

42:25.710 --> 42:31.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get really inefficient. WILLIAM
BRANGHAM: Brown picked a few

42:31.249 --> 42:33.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recipes from the book that could
work as Thanksgiving sides and

42:33.684 --> 42:35.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
appetizers. LEANNE BROWN: We're
going to make Thanksgiving-style

42:35.686 --> 42:37.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deviled eggs. WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
I love deviled eggs. LEANNE

42:37.688 --> 42:39.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: I love deviled eggs too.
They're such a great little

42:39.690 --> 42:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
party snack. And so, really, I
always say, like, obviously, the

42:42.126 --> 42:45.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
classic is fantastic, but you
can make them taste like

42:45.229 --> 42:48.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anything that you happen to have
around. So we're just going to

42:48.533 --> 42:51.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basically cut all these guys. I
already boiled them. We're going

42:51.436 --> 42:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take beautiful rosemary and a
little bit of one of my favorite

42:56.607 --> 43:00.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sides, pureed squash. And this
is just pureed squash with

43:00.912 --> 43:03.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
garlic. This is sort of my
favorite. And so it's the one

43:03.915 --> 43:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we're adding to here, but
it could be a lot of different

43:06.317 --> 43:08.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things. Like, this could be
sweet potatoes or this could be

43:08.419 --> 43:11.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
maybe a mashed cauliflower or
something like that, whatever

43:11.122 --> 43:13.991 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have around, if you think
that could go well with eggs.

43:14.025 --> 43:16.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, why not? WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
And so you don't mind -- if

43:16.561 --> 43:19.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're serving this dish with
these eggs, you feel like these

43:19.497 --> 43:21.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are distinct enough that you're
not overlapping? LEANNE BROWN:

43:22.033 --> 43:24.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, totally. I think this just
sort of brings the meal

43:24.101 --> 43:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Each
serving of these costs just

43:26.804 --> 43:30.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about 15 cents. In fact, all of
Brown's recipes show you roughly

43:30.208 --> 43:33.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they will cost. Next up was
her cheesy cauliflower, a

43:33.945 --> 43:37.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
substitute for mac and cheese.
It comes to about $1.65 per

43:37.915 --> 43:39.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
serving. LEANNE BROWN:
Basically, all we did was, we

43:39.917 --> 43:42.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chopped up our beautiful
cauliflower and we just boiled

43:42.854 --> 43:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it for about three to four
minutes. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: OK.

43:45.890 --> 43:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LEANNE BROWN: So -- and now we
have that in the bowl. We're

43:47.892 --> 43:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to make our sauce. So,
we're going to let the butter

43:50.261 --> 43:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
melt, one bay leaf, and about
three cloves of chopped garlic.

43:56.133 --> 44:01.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're going to add our
flour, just all in there at

44:01.672 --> 44:06.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
once. This is a cup-and-a-half
of milk. And then we will grab

44:09.213 --> 44:11.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our cheese. WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
So, the cheese sauce goes over

44:11.716 --> 44:14.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the cauliflower? LEANNE BROWN:
Yes. We're just going to bake it

44:14.852 --> 44:17.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at 400 for about 40, 45 minutes.
But I have one baking already,

44:17.989 --> 44:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so we can grab that right now.
Oh, yes. Oh, my gosh. WILLIAM

44:23.694 --> 44:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRANGHAM: Gorgeous. Your book,
on the surface, seems like a

44:29.100 --> 44:31.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cookbook. It's masquerading as a
cookbook. LEANNE BROWN: Right.

44:31.736 --> 44:34.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But it
certainly seems like there is a

44:34.038 --> 44:37.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manifesto buried on every page
there. LEANNE BROWN: Right.

44:37.341 --> 44:40.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, am I
reading into that, or is that

44:40.344 --> 44:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there? LEANNE BROWN: No, I think
it's definitely there. I think

44:42.914 --> 44:44.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of it as a strategy guide for
sort of eating well. You know,

44:44.916 --> 44:47.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how do we do this whole thing?
And cooking is a massive part of

44:47.685 --> 44:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, but it's not all of it. And
I think the manifesto part is

44:51.422 --> 44:54.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that, yes, it's a strategy guide
and it's a thing we have to do,

44:54.191 --> 44:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but it's also something that we
all absolutely deserve,

44:57.028 --> 44:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regardless of how much money we
have. WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today,

44:59.597 --> 45:03.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 71,000 copies of "Good
and Cheap" have gone to nearly

45:03.200 --> 45:05.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
900 nonprofits around the
country, where they're

45:05.836 --> 45:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
distributed to clients who
couldn't afford to buy it

45:08.205 --> 45:11.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
otherwise. For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm William Brangham

45:11.442 --> 45:15.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in New York City. JUDY WOODRUFF:
Not only economical, but yum. If

45:15.746 --> 45:18.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're cooking for only a few
this Thanksgiving, you will find

45:19.016 --> 45:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a special recipe from Leanne
Brown for a one-pan Thanksgiving

45:23.354 --> 45:26.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dinner. That's on our Web site,
where you can also find the

45:26.257 --> 45:31.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recipes from this story. Aretha
Franklin been given many honors

45:41.405 --> 45:45.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over the years, but, last week,
she was honored in a new way, as

45:45.376 --> 45:50.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gwen and I emceed the inaugural
American Portrait Gallery event

45:50.147 --> 45:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to honor the portraits of a
nation. Gwen is back with a

45:53.651 --> 45:57.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation with the Queen of
Soul about her remarkable career

45:57.588 --> 46:04.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and her big plans still coming
up. GWEN IFILL: It was an

46:04.228 --> 46:10.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evening to honor legends, from
designers to heroes from the

46:10.167 --> 46:14.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world of sport and the military.
But it was the Queen of Soul who

46:14.605 --> 46:17.308 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got the red carpet crowd to
their feet. Mid-concert,

46:17.341 --> 46:22.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Detroit's own Aretha Franklin
added another prestigious honor

46:22.546 --> 46:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to her extensive collection.
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is only one

46:27.618 --> 46:32.189 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Aretha Franklin. (CHEERING AND
APPLAUSE) GWEN IFILL: The

46:32.223 --> 46:36.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Portrait Gallery's
first Portrait of America Award.

46:36.127 --> 46:39.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Franklin's likeness hangs at the
Washington museum. ARETHA

46:39.630 --> 46:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANKLIN, Musician: We were
ladies and gentlemen, and we

46:44.735 --> 46:51.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weren't overnight stars. It was
gradual. And, for me, I just try

46:51.409 --> 46:54.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to keep my head out of the
clouds, keep my feet on the

46:54.578 --> 46:59.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ground. GWEN IFILL: The
73-year-old Franklin has been

47:14.231 --> 47:19.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
honored for her jazz, rock, pop,
classical, and gospel singing.

47:19.870 --> 47:23.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is the first female and just
the fourth artist overall to

47:23.708 --> 47:28.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place 100 career titles on
Billboard's hot R&amp;B/hip-hop

47:28.546 --> 47:33.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
songs chart. Franklin is no
stranger to Washington,

47:36.821 --> 47:41.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
performing at tree lightings,
inaugurations and White House

47:41.225 --> 47:46.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
concerts. In 2005, she received
the nation's highest civilian

47:46.564 --> 47:51.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
honor, the Presidential Medal of
Freedom. This latest honor

47:51.335 --> 47:55.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guarantees that her image will
live alongside her soundtrack.

47:55.639 --> 47:59.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Portrait Gallery
director Kim Sajet says Franklin

47:59.310 --> 48:03.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was a natural choice. KIM SAJET,
Director, National Portrait

48:03.481 --> 48:05.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gallery: The portrait of Aretha
is a gateway. I think straight

48:05.716 --> 48:08.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away, standing in front of it, I
get a sense of, obviously, she's

48:08.552 --> 48:12.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
singing. She's got this big hair
moment. There's a lot of color.

48:12.123 --> 48:15.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, also, her name is spelt in
capital letters at the bottom of

48:15.359 --> 48:18.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this print, "ARETHA." She
actually probably is one of the

48:18.662 --> 48:22.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very few handful of people in
this country we know exactly by

48:22.433 --> 48:26.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their first name who we are
talking about. She's a lesson

48:26.504 --> 48:30.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for all of us, being smart and
tenacious, had a dogged

48:30.141 --> 48:33.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
determinedness about herself,
which I think many of us can

48:33.444 --> 48:36.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
admire. GWEN IFILL: After her
performance at the Gallery, I

48:37.014 --> 48:41.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sat down with Franklin, who is
seen worldwide as the diva, the

48:41.152 --> 48:44.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
queen, the consummate
entertainer. Tell me, how do you

48:44.255 --> 48:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think of yourself? ARETHA
FRANKLIN: A lady next door. GWEN

48:46.390 --> 48:48.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: But nobody thinks of you
that way, none of your fans,

48:48.893 --> 48:50.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
none of the people in that room
tonight. ARETHA FRANKLIN: Sure.

48:50.961 --> 48:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes. Yes. GWEN IFILL: They think
of you as much more than that.

48:52.963 --> 48:57.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARETHA FRANKLIN: Well, no, they
don't see me in that setting,

48:57.868 --> 49:01.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right. GWEN IFILL: Yes. So,
then, how do you handle the

49:01.405 --> 49:04.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weight of the diva-ness of this
all? Because, I mean, there's a

49:04.675 --> 49:07.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little bit of that in you. You
have a lot of flair. ARETHA

49:07.745 --> 49:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANKLIN: I love to sing. It's
just a natural thing for me.

49:10.948 --> 49:14.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And in the span of a
six-decade music career, there

49:14.785 --> 49:17.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was never anything else she
wanted to do. So, is part of

49:17.988 --> 49:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you, you know, always going to
be Reverend C.L. Franklin's

49:20.424 --> 49:24.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
daughter? ARETHA FRANKLIN:
Absolutely. GWEN IFILL: I'm a

49:24.528 --> 49:27.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
preacher's kid, too, so I...
ARETHA FRANKLIN: I knew you --

49:27.998 --> 49:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.K., OK. GWEN IFILL: But I -- I
am a P.K. But I don't sing quite

49:30.000 --> 49:31.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like you. ARETHA FRANKLIN: Oh,
well, we don't all sing.

49:32.002 --> 49:33.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(LAUGHTER) GWEN IFILL: We have
other gifts. ARETHA FRANKLIN:

49:34.004 --> 49:35.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, you have other gifts. GWEN
IFILL: I want to ask you about

49:36.006 --> 49:37.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that, because one of the things
that comes up with people who

49:38.008 --> 49:40.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are immensely successful about
what they choose is what brought

49:40.744 --> 49:44.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the success, who urged
you, or who didn't stop you.

49:44.415 --> 49:47.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARETHA FRANKLIN: Well, my mentor
was Clara Ward of the famous

49:48.018 --> 49:53.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ward gospel singers of
Philadelphia. And my dad was my

49:53.657 --> 49:59.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coach. He coached me. And just
my natural love for music is

49:59.496 --> 50:04.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what drove me. GWEN IFILL: Do
you keep watch of the young

50:04.802 --> 50:08.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people who are huge out there,
and think, that person was the

50:08.339 --> 50:11.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young me? ARETHA FRANKLIN: When
I see choirs, the junior choir.

50:11.742 --> 50:14.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In each and every
one of those cases, and tonight

50:14.211 --> 50:17.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too? ARETHA FRANKLIN: Uh-huh.
GWEN IFILL: You devoted a lot of

50:17.248 --> 50:20.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it to gospel, which I think
surprised some of the audiences.

50:20.217 --> 50:23.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you do that routinely? ARETHA
FRANKLIN: No, I just -- I was

50:23.621 --> 50:28.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
listening to some of the C.D.s
earlier today, and I wasn't

50:28.325 --> 50:32.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happy with my opening song. It
just wasn't what I wanted it to

50:32.596 --> 50:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be And then up popped "I Came to
Lift Him Up," and I said, that's

50:37.101 --> 50:42.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, that's it. That's what I
want to sing. GWEN IFILL:

50:42.539 --> 50:45.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Exactly. ARETHA FRANKLIN: It's
Sunday, and what could be

50:45.843 --> 50:48.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
better? This is the lord's day.
GWEN IFILL: But I see you do

50:48.779 --> 50:53.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that when it's not Sunday.
ARETHA FRANKLIN: Mm-hmm. GWEN

50:53.083 --> 50:56.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: And I wonder if part of
you feels... ARETHA FRANKLIN:

50:56.720 --> 50:58.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes. No, you don't have to have
any special day. GWEN IFILL: One

50:58.722 --> 51:02.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recent capstone to her career,
an invitation to perform for

51:02.660 --> 51:06.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pope Francis when he visited
Philadelphia. She jumped at the

51:06.897 --> 51:09.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chance. ARETHA FRANKLIN: It was
wonderful, a very, very gracious

51:09.700 --> 51:13.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
man, a very gracious man. GWEN
IFILL: And did you get that he

51:13.037 --> 51:16.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got what you were bringing to
this? ARETHA FRANKLIN: I think

51:16.540 --> 51:18.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he did, yes. Uh-huh. He's
all about the word, bottom line.

51:18.642 --> 51:23.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But when did you
cross the line from gospel to

51:23.480 --> 51:27.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pop? ARETHA FRANKLIN: I didn't
cross the line. Gospel goes with

51:27.117 --> 51:30.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me wherever I go. Gospel is a
constant with me. GWEN IFILL: So

51:30.721 --> 51:32.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when people hear you sing...
ARETHA FRANKLIN: So, I just

51:32.723 --> 51:34.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
broadened my musical horizons.
GWEN IFILL: Yes. So when people

51:34.725 --> 51:37.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hear you sing "Pink Cadillac,"
there's gospel in that? ARETHA

51:37.861 --> 51:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANKLIN: No. So... (LAUGHTER)
ARETHA FRANKLIN: No, that's

51:45.602 --> 51:50.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
secular. GWEN IFILL: That's
secular. ARETHA FRANKLIN: That

51:53.344 --> 51:59.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is secular, yes. GWEN IFILL: I
asked her if technology,

51:59.950 --> 52:03.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including auto-tuning and other
digital enhancement, has changed

52:03.854 --> 52:07.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the music industry's definition
of success. ARETHA FRANKLIN: My

52:07.358 --> 52:12.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
generation, we came along, we
had to really know our craft.

52:12.229 --> 52:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And my dad helped me do that
long before I left home. People

52:16.367 --> 52:21.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really don't have to give you
anything, so appreciate what

52:21.338 --> 52:24.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people give you. And just don't
let that go to your head,

52:24.375 --> 52:26.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatever it is they give you.
GWEN IFILL: But is it different

52:26.710 --> 52:29.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or harder or more difficult than
it was when you were coming up?

52:29.513 --> 52:31.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARETHA FRANKLIN: Yes. Yes. GWEN
IFILL: Technology? ARETHA

52:31.982 --> 52:35.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANKLIN: Yes, it is. It's a lot
more difficult now, because you

52:35.686 --> 52:39.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have a lot more artists out here
now, particularly in hip-hop,

52:39.189 --> 52:45.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and rappers, and singers, and so
on. The competition is extremely

52:45.129 --> 52:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high, so you really have got to
have something going on. GWEN

52:50.000 --> 52:54.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IFILL: Franklin still has a lot
going on, including upcoming

52:54.505 --> 52:58.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
projects with old friends,
artists she's known, but not

52:58.175 --> 53:00.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recorded with for decades.
ARETHA FRANKLIN: I love to

53:00.878 --> 53:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
record with Stevie and Smokey.
GWEN IFILL: Have you never

53:04.381 --> 53:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recorded with... (CROSSTALK)
ARETHA FRANKLIN: No, we haven't.

53:06.650 --> 53:10.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
George Benson and I are going to
do some things together. I have

53:10.721 --> 53:15.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got a lot of fabulous recording
ideas. GWEN IFILL: Will you ever

53:15.659 --> 53:17.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
consider stopping? ARETHA
FRANKLIN: No, not ever, no. I'm

53:17.961 --> 53:20.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not ever going to retire. That's
-- that wouldn't be good, for

53:20.798 --> 53:25.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one, just to go somewhere and
sit down and do nothing. Please.

53:25.102 --> 53:29.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No, that's not moi. GWEN IFILL:
It's not moi. ARETHA FRANKLIN:

53:29.406 --> 53:36.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is not moi. (LAUGHTER) GWEN
IFILL: Ms. Franklin, thank you

53:36.180 --> 53:41.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very much for talking to us.
ARETHA FRANKLIN: Thank you. JUDY
