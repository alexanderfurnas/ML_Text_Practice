deal.

16:36.495 --> 16:38.364
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
I am gratified to say to my fell

16:39.832 --> 16:44.303
our negotiating partners, and ou
around the world, this agreement

16:45.771 --> 16:48.941
LISA DESJARDINS: It also means t
will not have to use his veto po

16:50.409 --> 16:54.313
the deal. But even with the outc
certain, Senate Majority Leader

16:55.448 --> 16:57.183
again took aim at what the admin
negotiated.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.386
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Maj
We know that the president's dea

end its nuclear program, but wou
leave Iran with a threshold nucl

17:06.792 --> 17:12.531
recognized as legitimate by the
community, quite the opposite of

17:12.965 --> 17:12.865
goal.

17:14.333 --> 17:17.837
LISA DESJARDINS: And Maine's Sus
made it unanimous: All 54 Republ

17:18.704 --> 17:20.339
Senate now officially oppose the

17:21.807 --> 17:26.379
SEN. SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: I
believed that a verifiable diplo

17:27.847 --> 17:36.622
with Iran would be a major achie
that doesn't describe the agreem

administration negotiated. The a
fundamentally flawed.

17:45.498 --> 17:49.168
LISA DESJARDINS: But in the Sena
the president's viewpoint is pre

17:50.636 --> 17:54.407
while House Republicans may reje
deal this week, that's look like

17:55.107 --> 17:55.775
as the issue will go.

17:57.243 --> 18:00.513
GWEN IFILL: And political direct
joins me now from Capitol Hill.

18:01.981 --> 18:05.151
Just in the last few moments, Li
discovered that number went from

with the additional yea or nay v
on how you add this up, of Senat

18:11.290 --> 18:14.727
from Washington State. What's th
of this number of 41 or 42 as it

18:16.195 --> 18:18.130
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, technical
our viewers probably caught on t

than it did last week.

18:45.057 --> 18:49.495
And also about the strength of t
President Obama won these votes

18:50.963 --> 18:54.433
by convincing senators. Many of
had huge doubts. And, frankly, o

18:55.901 --> 18:58.270
told me today that they don't tr
here. It's not a question of tru

18:59.372 --> 19:02.074
question of them verifying what
this deal.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.645
And 41 percent, Gwen, interestin
around the approval rating of th

sign of how much strength he has

19:10.449 --> 19:10.316
or not.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.820
GWEN IFILL: Lisa, you spent the
the reasons behind all of this o

Hill, why the president got this
who flipped in the end. What can

19:19.291 --> 19:19.225
us?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.361
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, one of th
conversations I had was with the

19:23.829 --> 19:27.266
Senator Ron Wyden. He's a import
up here, head of the Senate Fina

19:28.734 --> 19:31.404
He didn't decide until this week
staff told me one of the key ind

19:32.872 --> 19:35.041
him that he was going to go yes
a letter from the White House to

19:36.509 --> 19:39.378
have a copy of it right here --
White House gave him an assuranc

19:40.846 --> 19:45.818
White House would stand by snapp
reimposing sanctions as soon as

19:46.585 --> 19:47.386
sign of cheating by Iran.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.790
We heard that before, but, Gwen,
interesting in this letter, they

19:52.258 --> 19:56.362
only the U.S., but European alli
reimpose sanctions the minute th

19:57.063 --> 19:57.463
cheating that happens.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.333
Now, you can say this isn't the

They want it in writing from the

20:06.505 --> 20:08.040
what's being guaranteed and what

20:09.508 --> 20:11.677
The other theme, Gwen, you see t
these senators who have decided

20:13.145 --> 20:16.549

most of them don't like it, but

20:18.017 --> 20:21.320

20:22.488 --> 20:24.323
proceed without restrictions if
do something.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.427
GWEN IFILL: Lisa, we spent a lot
about the Senate, but this also

20:29.895 --> 20:33.432
approved or not disapproved in t
well. Over the weekend, we got w

20:34.900 --> 20:38.838
to be a pretty significant expre
from Debbie Wasserman Schultz, w

20:40.306 --> 20:42.942
head of the Democratic National

20:44.410 --> 20:48.314
who has been speaking with -- be
with the Israeli pushback agains

20:49.048 --> 20:49.381
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

20:50.850 --> 20:53.819
Gwen, I had a good phone convers
Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz

20:55.254 --> 20:57.089
And she really conveyed how much
a difficult decision for her.

20:58.557 --> 21:01.393
Here's how she got to yes. She s
with her constituents, in partic

21:02.862 --> 21:05.998
in her district. It's between Mi
Lauderdale. Not just her, Gwen,

21:07.466 --> 21:10.469
enough, she brought down Vice Pr
Biden. This is when she says she

21:11.637 --> 21:12.938
He answered questions for her an
constituents.

21:14.406 --> 21:17.810
She said most of them don't like
She listened. And then, Gwen, I

21:19.278 --> 21:21.347
is what turned it for a lot of m
Congress. Wasserman Schultz went

21:22.815 --> 21:26.152
House some 20 different times, s
Situation Room, sat one on one w

21:27.253 --> 21:29.355
officials, sat down with Treasur
Jack Lew.

21:30.823 --> 21:33.859
One by one, I think the White Ho
these votes as members asked que

21:35.327 --> 21:38.931
got details about this deal. She
others, put out a five-, six-pag

21:40.399 --> 21:42.768
over the weekend in terms of why
to her decision. But I think it

21:43.969 --> 21:45.604
one over hundreds of questions t
the White House.

21:47.072 --> 21:49.108
GWEN IFILL: Now, as you know as
just because the president has t

21:50.576 --> 21:53.245
doesn't mean that he -- that all
goes away. And we're going to se

on that -- to that point tomorro

22:00.085 --> 22:03.088
So, what happens next? What is t
that has to drop? We have a dead

22:03.622 --> 22:03.522
week, right?

22:04.356 --> 22:04.356
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

22:05.824 --> 22:08.961
There's a deadline next week. Co
60 days to act. That runs out ne

they will act before that, Gwen.

Senate as early as Friday. Maybe
slip into next week, but in the

22:22.341 --> 22:22.908
that will happen.

22:24.376 --> 22:25.911
Of course, once these votes are
like you're saying, Gwen, I thin

22:27.379 --> 22:30.082
to see this issue, well, at leas
of next year on the campaign tra

22:31.550 --> 22:33.152
GWEN IFILL: So, it's still all o
shouting, but the shouting hasn'

LISA DESJARDINS: Oh, it will get

22:36.155 --> 22:39.892
GWEN IFILL: Lisa Desjardins for
on Capitol Hill, thank you very

LISA DESJARDINS: You got it.

ALLISON AUBREY: At 7:00 p.m., th

23:54.266 --> 23:59.405
was packed. The main draw? Think
Michelin-starred waste. That's w

we can finish that, please.

thinking big thoughts and they a

on this 80-acre plot of land jus
Manhattan, where he combines an

farm and restaurant. It's called

DAN BARBER: In this day and age,
a message to broadcast, and in t

26:05.898 --> 26:09.735
we're broadcasting that vegetabl
delicious fiber that could be ut

26:11.203 --> 26:15.107
ALLISON AUBREY: Vegetable pulp?
as Barber's right-hand man, chef

26:16.575 --> 26:20.012
transformed beet and celery pulp
from a local juice bar named Liq

26:21.146 --> 26:23.549
make something that lots of peop
want to eat.

26:25.017 --> 26:28.086
Oh, I have to say looking at thi
look appealing. It looks like I

26:28.587 --> 26:28.687
wet grass.

26:30.155 --> 26:32.891
ADAM KAYE, Chef: Well, it really
like celery. You can see there's

26:34.359 --> 26:37.262
of fiber in there, which we will
up a little bit so it's not comp

26:38.397 --> 26:39.465
DAN BARBER: Yes. And this normal
tossed out?

26:40.833 --> 26:42.534
ADAM KAYE: This would be tossed
be composted or landfill.

26:44.002 --> 26:47.573
ALLISON AUBREY: So why not turn
burger? That beet pulp looks kin

26:48.674 --> 26:50.142
So this looks like a meat loaf m
have made.

26:51.610 --> 26:52.478
ADAM KAYE: Yes. I mean, no pun i
let's call it a beet loaf. Right

26:52.978 --> 26:52.711
(LAUGHTER)

26:53.512 --> 26:53.779
ALLISON AUBREY: I love that.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.982
ADAM KAYE: This has become proba
the most popular items on the wa

26:57.716 --> 26:57.382
ALLISON AUBREY: Really?

26:58.851 --> 27:00.886
ADAM KAYE: It's just incredible.
-- people are going crazy about

beef fat there or like bacon dri

27:05.624 --> 27:05.157
something.

27:05.891 --> 27:05.224
ALLISON AUBREY: Really?

27:06.091 --> 27:06.124
ADAM KAYE: They said it tastes s

27:07.593 --> 27:09.895
ALLISON AUBREY: Besides the vege
there are a bunch of other ingre

27:11.363 --> 27:14.099
ADAM KAYE: Chopped toasted mushr
natural almonds with the skin on

27:14.566 --> 27:14.433

27:15.200 --> 27:15.834
ALLISON AUBREY: All right.

27:16.935 --> 27:18.403
ADAM KAYE: And what else? We hav
mushrooms.

27:19.738 --> 27:22.040
ALLISON AUBREY: And some Blue Hi
that he couldn't reveal.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.510
ADAM KAYE: There you go. You're

27:25.978 --> 27:29.281
DAN BARBER: The hope here is to
demand that then kick-starts a l

27:30.749 --> 27:35.454
for an economy that gives the ju
a reason to save that pulp and d

27:36.922 --> 27:40.492
it and use it. I mean, I don't k
juice bars actually become the n

27:40.959 --> 27:41.226
kiosks.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.098
ALLISON AUBREY: So this is the m
to give this a try?

27:46.965 --> 27:47.366
DAN BARBER: Yes. I hope I haven'

27:48.834 --> 27:52.771
ALLISON AUBREY: We will see. All
little bit of this wasted beet k

27:53.171 --> 27:53.705
it.

27:56.074 --> 28:01.346
ALLISON AUBREY: This is not a ve
wannabe. This is actually -- thi

DAN BARBER: Yes.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.817
ALLISON AUBREY: Like, I would ea
might even think that there's be

28:06.685 --> 28:08.120
DAN BARBER: I wouldn't lie to PB

burger, Barber's prized pickle b

by walls draped with a white fab

and pears salvaged from a food p

Water left over canned chick pea

28:49.361 --> 28:52.397
And as you were tasting it, were
this is left over from an indust

28:53.098 --> 28:53.432
processor? How was it?

28:54.666 --> 28:56.068
WOMAN: Surprisingly good. Yes, y
surprisingly good.

28:57.469 --> 29:00.472
MICHAEL PARILLO, Diner: Yes. It
It's sort of a shabby chic.

29:01.940 --> 29:05.777
ALLISON AUBREY: They almost orde
called dog food, made from anima

29:06.578 --> 29:07.613
are usually discarded, but:

29:09.081 --> 29:12.117
MICHAEL PARILLO: We planned to o
food, but we made a last-minute

29:12.784 --> 29:12.618
different direction.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.521
DAN BARBER: The other idea is to
of these ingredients like this a

29:17.990 --> 29:20.492
that you're going to see later t
start to think about it in the c

29:21.960 --> 29:25.831

30:15.747 --> 30:19.251

30:56.455 --> 31:07.599
GWEN IFILL: There are nearly two
candidates running for president

31:09.067 --> 31:13.405
and the ones getting the most at
not all elected officials. They

here before?

Nelson Rockefeller.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.705
So, Michael Beschloss, a lot of
running. We seem to be paying at

31:48.173 --> 31:51.510
them. But the ones catching fire
the politicians or at least seen

31:52.377 --> 31:53.712
as being the politicians. How un

31:55.180 --> 31:56.281
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Well, it has happened before a l

31:57.616 --> 32:00.852
And maybe the best example of th
been Ross Perot in 1992.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.290
What he basically said was, I'm
I have never held public office.

32:06.758 --> 32:10.595
means I'm not implicated in thes
that have taken the country the

32:11.630 --> 32:13.598
So he went on "Larry King" in Fe
1992.

32:14.299 --> 32:14.299
GWEN IFILL: Remember.

32:15.767 --> 32:19.070
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: And he said,
want me to run, I will run as a

32:20.539 --> 32:24.643
candidate, and I will attack the
which neither party is doing any

32:26.111 --> 32:29.881
He allowed himself, at least in
to be recruited. He ran, and at

32:31.349 --> 32:36.188
early that year, at least in the
he was running ahead of George H

32:37.055 --> 32:37.923
Bill Clinton, the two major-part

32:38.790 --> 32:39.491
GWEN IFILL: And he was a third-p

32:40.959 --> 32:43.695
But we have seen people even fro
parties, Lara Brown, who have br

32:45.030 --> 32:48.066
this and changed up the whole fe
race before Ross Perot.

32:49.534 --> 32:49.534
LARA BROWN, Director, George Was
Graduate School of Political Man

32:50.235 --> 32:50.168
I think that's right.

32:51.636 --> 32:55.073
What we really have to do is mak
And that distinction is those wh

32:56.541 --> 33:00.478
outsiders, who really mean they'
Washington, vs. those who call t

33:01.613 --> 33:03.315
outsiders because they're outsid
altogether.

33:04.049 --> 33:04.349
GWEN IFILL: For example?

33:05.817 --> 33:10.589
LARA BROWN: For example, we can
who run. They often say things l

33:12.057 --> 33:15.660
of Washington. I'm going to go a
government and get it back on tr

33:17.095 --> 33:19.364
seen that with Jimmy Carter. We
seen that with Ronald Reagan.

33:20.832 --> 33:25.237
But then you do have those who s
outside of politics altogether,

33:26.705 --> 33:31.042
Ross Perot fits that model, as M
has written. So too has Wendell

33:32.377 --> 33:34.312
GWEN IFILL: Wendell Willkie. You

33:35.780 --> 33:40.819
OK, Richard Norton Smith, there'
Who is your favorite outsider wh

33:42.220 --> 33:44.890
see as someone who was part of t

33:46.324 --> 33:46.491
RICHARD NORTON SMITH, Scholar in
George Mason University: Yes.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.896
Well, actually, go back 200 year
Jackson transformed American pol

33:52.364 --> 33:57.869
in many ways reinvented the Amer
running as an outsider. Certainl

33:59.337 --> 34:03.942
was horrified. It's one of the g
of American democracy, the scene

34:05.410 --> 34:11.283
Day, 1829, when Jackson and his
descended on the town, took it o

34:12.050 --> 34:12.918
was never quite the same.

34:14.386 --> 34:19.257
At the end of the 19th century,
Jennings Bryan, who gave voice t

34:20.725 --> 34:26.131
of mostly Southern and Western f
others who felt victimized by Wa

34:27.599 --> 34:31.002
A lot of this is -- the question
are you outside of? It's not onl

34:32.470 --> 34:39.010
establishment that they run agai
the economic policies that it re

34:40.145 --> 34:42.580
that in turn are centered symbol
Wall Street.

34:44.049 --> 34:47.218
GWEN IFILL: Michael, let's go ba
Carter, who Lara mentioned. I fo

34:48.520 --> 34:50.188
were 17 candidates, Democratic c
for president in 1976.

34:50.956 --> 34:50.989
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Right.

34:51.790 --> 34:52.157
GWEN IFILL: It's remarkable.

34:52.924 --> 34:53.058
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: It is.

34:54.526 --> 34:57.228
And that's one reason why Jimmy
himself as an outsider. And to s

34:58.697 --> 35:01.900
that was a big sham, because he
had been in politics for over a

35:03.168 --> 35:04.836
had been in the Georgia State Se
governor of Georgia.

35:06.304 --> 35:09.607
But he knew that in the wake of
and also with all these other pe

35:11.076 --> 35:14.779
himself from, it would be most h
him to say, I'm not from Washing

35:15.647 --> 35:17.916
a lawyer. That was very much wit

35:19.384 --> 35:21.753
And as Lara mentioned, the same
Ronald Reagan when he ran for pr

35:23.221 --> 35:26.825
'76. His announcement speech, he
me because I'm not part of the W

35:27.392 --> 35:27.559
buddy system.

35:29.027 --> 35:33.331
And, yes, he wasn't from Washing
wouldn't nominate Ronald Reagan

35:34.566 --> 35:36.301
and the first person who is goin
the establishment.

35:37.769 --> 35:40.105
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's think ab
a moment. Are outsiders outsider

35:41.573 --> 35:43.775
they themselves represent someth
different, or is it because of w

35:44.809 --> 35:45.643
of the American public is at the
Brown?

35:47.112 --> 35:50.949
LARA BROWN: Well, a lot of it is
They're trying to essentially cl

35:52.417 --> 35:55.587
to a feeling that's in kind of r
something else that is going on.

35:57.055 --> 36:01.192
So, as we have discussed, Jimmy
about because there was Watergat

36:02.660 --> 36:10.201
this opportunity. You know, you
back to, in fact, 1924, when Joh

36:11.669 --> 36:17.108
the nomination at the Democratic
after 103 ballots. There are iss

36:18.576 --> 36:22.347
election because William McAdoo
up in the Teapot Dome scandal an

36:23.114 --> 36:24.816
money from Edward Doheny.

36:26.284 --> 36:29.988
So there was a sense that he was
and that that nomination shouldn

36:31.456 --> 36:37.829
So there is this way in which ou
in, or there is essentially surf

36:39.230 --> 36:42.801
a number of candidates running w
are opportunities to do so.

36:44.269 --> 36:47.072
GWEN IFILL: Well, we certainly a
with surfeit ambition in any cam

36:47.772 --> 36:47.839
certainly in this one.

36:48.339 --> 36:48.006
(LAUGHTER)

36:49.474 --> 36:53.611
GWEN IFILL: So, let me ask you,
Smith, a little bit about what t

36:55.080 --> 36:58.983
the process. But does this actua
our weaken the establishment par

37:00.452 --> 37:03.688
-- the rise of the Donald Trumps
of the Wendell Willkies, or does

37:04.355 --> 37:05.990
it just predictable?

37:07.459 --> 37:11.196
RICHARD NORTON SMITH: Traditiona
traditionally, it's been a blip.

37:12.664 --> 37:15.900
was no age of Willkie. That's fo
who knows what will happen over

37:16.367 --> 37:17.669
months.

37:19.137 --> 37:22.507
What is, however, seemingly uniq
and we saw some of this particul

37:23.975 --> 37:27.846
Republican side for years ago, w
remember, there were a number of

37:29.314 --> 37:32.283
candidates who stressed the fact
were not part of the Washington

37:33.751 --> 37:38.456
-- both Jimmy Carter and Ronald
effect went to the electorate wi

37:39.924 --> 37:44.028
that, we're outsiders, we're not
mess, but we have the right expe

37:45.497 --> 37:50.301
have the right skill set, as gov
major states, to fix what is wro

37:51.769 --> 37:56.975
What is really unusual about thi
outsiders is that they are runni

37:58.443 --> 38:03.515
the very qualifications that hav
been viewed as necessary to be a

38:04.015 --> 38:03.715
president.

38:05.183 --> 38:07.385
GWEN IFILL: And I wonder, Michae
this is all sped up because of t

38:08.253 --> 38:08.920
the Internet or conservative rad

38:09.754 --> 38:09.420
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Absolutely.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.957
GWEN IFILL: That people who mayb
just thought about running befor

38:13.591 --> 38:13.791
instant platforms.

38:15.260 --> 38:18.263
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: And for most
history, if you wanted a major p

38:19.731 --> 38:21.900
you would have to be chosen by o
and officeholders would have bee

38:23.368 --> 38:26.437
people who would have chosen som
not run for office or served bef

38:27.906 --> 38:30.542
So this is something that's rela
But Richard also makes a good po

38:32.010 --> 38:35.480
is that outsiders do wonderfully
are really angry about something

38:36.948 --> 38:39.617
is an overwhelming issue of fore
Americans are probably going to

38:41.052 --> 38:43.588
about giving the keys to someone
have that kind of experience.

38:45.056 --> 38:48.626
Ross Perot got 19 percent in 199
he could do that is that the Col

38:50.028 --> 38:52.497
over and the country seemed as p
it had been for a long time.

38:53.965 --> 38:57.168
GWEN IFILL: So, as a protest can
for the sake of protest, does th

38:58.203 --> 39:00.605
add to or perhaps enhance our po
Lara?

39:02.073 --> 39:04.742
LARA BROWN: Well, throughout mos
what protest candidates have rea

39:06.110 --> 39:10.381
raised issues that the major can
then adopted or co-opted.

39:11.849 --> 39:16.020
And they have moved on to essent
those ideas in their platforms,

39:17.488 --> 39:22.727
and, if they have won, their pre
In fact, you can see the focus o

39:24.195 --> 39:29.300
Clinton and Newt Gingrich on iss
the budget as really being about

39:30.168 --> 39:31.035
that Ross Perot was raising in '

39:32.503 --> 39:35.340

39:39.744 --> 39:42.647
RICHARD NORTON SMITH: He was, ab

You go back a few years earlier,
candidate, an outsider named Geo

39:48.820 --> 39:55.326
who ran first in the Democratic
'64, and then a third-party camp

39:56.794 --> 39:59.864
He never came close to winning,
is no doubt that he had a dispro

40:01.332 --> 40:10.575
impact both on the debate that y
on the heralding of a conservati

40:21.653 --> 40:21.552
GWEN IFILL: OK.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.857
Well, we will be watching for th
or maybe proportionate, effect i

40:26.291 --> 40:26.257
year.

40:27.558 --> 40:30.662
Richard Norton Smith, Michael Be

magic of genies and the reality

40:47.545 --> 40:48.579
in our own time.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.649
Jeffrey Brown has our story from
Bookshelf.

40:53.117 --> 40:56.888
JEFFREY BROWN: In Salman Rushdie
the genies, or jinn, are out of

and on the loose in New York, en
a crack in the world, bringing o

41:02.994 --> 41:03.761
what's called the Strangenesses.

41:05.229 --> 41:08.866
SALMAN RUSHDIE, Author, "Two Yea
and Twenty-Eight Nights": These

41:10.335 --> 41:13.004
have arrived to start attacking
And one of them has a tendency t

41:14.105 --> 41:17.108
a sea monster, and he just rises
the ferry.

41:18.576 --> 41:22.980
JEFFREY BROWN: It's a world in s
our own, reason battling extremi

41:24.449 --> 41:28.920
busy city, but one in which grea
suddenly disappear, a beautiful

41:29.787 --> 41:32.290
water, but a police boat keeping

41:33.758 --> 41:36.761
In the novel, fear is in the air
magic. These are genies, after a

SALMAN RUSHDIE: The book of cour
kind of comic devices, but it's,

41:40.198 --> 41:43.668
talking about something serious,
an attack on the city.

41:45.136 --> 41:49.640
JEFFREY BROWN: Mixing magic and
and history, it's what Salman Ru

41:51.109 --> 41:55.046
been doing in his writing for de
new book is titled "Two Years Ei

41:56.514 --> 42:02.820
and Twenty-Eight Nights," which
to add up to 1,001. And like the

42:04.288 --> 42:07.492
Arabian Nights," Rushdie told me
at the Waverly Inn, one of his f

42:08.559 --> 42:12.730
spots, this novel began as a sto
itself.

42:14.198 --> 42:20.037
SALMAN RUSHDIE: I grew up fallin
with this kind of story, this ki

42:21.506 --> 42:23.975
wonder tale of the East, you kno
you're a child growing up in Ind

42:24.509 --> 42:24.475
around you.

42:25.943 --> 42:31.416
And I think one of the gifts it
a writer was this early knowledg

42:31.983 --> 42:32.316
are not true.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.051
JEFFREY BROWN: Stories are not t

42:34.919 --> 42:34.786
SALMAN RUSHDIE: No, they're made

42:35.820 --> 42:36.287
JEFFREY BROWN: In case you had a
right?

42:37.755 --> 42:41.325
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yes, you know, t
Bovary and a flying carpet, they

42:42.527 --> 42:44.829
untrue in the same way. Somebody
up. And once...

42:46.230 --> 42:46.531
JEFFREY BROWN: Even though we th
of them as being realistic.

42:47.999 --> 42:48.766
SALMAN RUSHDIE: You think of one
realistic and the other one is n

42:49.467 --> 42:51.536
they're both fictions.

42:53.004 --> 42:58.109
So once you get that instinct fo
the fictionality of fiction, it

42:59.577 --> 43:05.416
you free. And all my life, it's
that has recurred to a greater o

43:06.717 --> 43:08.453
in the various books. And this t
thought to let it rip.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.757
JEFFREY BROWN: Rushdie actually

43:21.999 --> 43:25.570
SALMAN RUSHDIE: My father decide

thinking that he changed the fam
Rushdie.

43:28.806 --> 43:28.639
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

43:29.507 --> 43:31.242
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yes. So that's w

43:32.710 --> 43:36.481
Of course, that made me very int
him as a thinker. And then I rea

43:37.949 --> 43:44.255
my father was so interested in h

could be brought in and one didn
just believe in blind faith.

44:07.178 --> 44:09.981
And his books were about that, a
him into some trouble.

44:11.449 --> 44:15.253
JEFFREY BROWN: Salman Rushdie, o
found trouble when his 1989 nove

44:22.560 --> 44:25.897
leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, issu
calling for Rushdie's death.

44:27.365 --> 44:31.469
There were violent, even deadly
and Rushdie spent nearly a decad

44:32.270 --> 44:33.337
before the fatwa was lifted.

44:34.805 --> 44:41.178
SALMAN RUSHDIE: This conflict ab
vs. what we now call fundamental

44:42.647 --> 44:45.550
of traditionism, literalism, tha
still going on, you know, and so

44:47.018 --> 44:50.922
it's -- it would be interesting
in the way in which it started.

44:52.390 --> 44:56.327
JEFFREY BROWN: So you're setting
sort of magical story of our tim

44:57.194 --> 44:59.397
after, but grounding it very muc

45:00.865 --> 45:02.300
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Really, it's abo
you see, I was a historian by tr

45:03.067 --> 45:03.668
what I did at university.

45:05.136 --> 45:09.173
So I have always thought that th
of talking, one is the fantastic

45:10.641 --> 45:16.814
you know, the fairy tale, and th
history, the scholarly study of

45:18.282 --> 45:22.086
I think they're both amazing way
human nature, you know? And then

45:23.554 --> 45:25.923
what happens if you push them to
happens if you take the fantasti

45:26.791 --> 45:28.759
historical and bang them into th

45:30.227 --> 45:32.630
JEFFREY BROWN: Since coming out
Rushdie has gotten new attention

45:34.098 --> 45:39.637
man about town, including for a
divorce with model and TV host P

45:41.005 --> 45:43.874
He does seem to regret one parti
of his earlier experience.

45:45.209 --> 45:48.312
SALMAN RUSHDIE: I feel that I go
put into the Islam box.

45:49.113 --> 45:49.981
JEFFREY BROWN: Meaning what?

45:51.449 --> 45:53.284
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Because of what
"The Satanic Verses," because su

45:54.485 --> 45:57.188
thought of as, oh, that Islam gu
guy or whatever.

45:58.656 --> 46:02.660
And I have never really thought
as a writer about religion. And

46:04.128 --> 46:07.598
of the things that happened to m
of all that is that I think it d

46:08.866 --> 46:11.702
people, many people, obscure the
that I actually am.

46:12.536 --> 46:12.937
JEFFREY BROWN: Which is what?

46:14.405 --> 46:15.873
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, very often
actually pick up a book of mine

46:17.341 --> 46:21.345
time are kind of surprised. And
letters saying, well, who knew t

46:21.946 --> 46:21.746
good, you know?

46:22.246 --> 46:21.979
(LAUGHTER)

46:22.680 --> 46:22.580
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

46:24.048 --> 46:26.651
SALMAN RUSHDIE: I get a lot of l
lot of letters saying, who knew

46:27.084 --> 46:26.917
funny?

46:28.386 --> 46:31.622
JEFFREY BROWN: But, I mean, isn'
you get a lot of attention as a

46:32.490 --> 46:32.857
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yes, it is odd,

46:33.724 --> 46:33.090
JEFFREY BROWN: It's odd to you?

46:34.558 --> 46:35.860
SALMAN RUSHDIE: It's odd to me b
doesn't happen to a lot of write

46:36.560 --> 46:36.761
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

46:38.229 --> 46:44.702
SALMAN RUSHDIE: And what can I d
me tables in restaurants. It get

46:45.469 --> 46:46.070
tickets. It's not all bad.

46:46.570 --> 46:46.337
(LAUGHTER)

46:47.805 --> 46:51.175
JEFFREY BROWN: "Two Years Eight
Twenty-Eight Nights," in Rushdie

46:52.643 --> 46:57.114
1,001 nights is the length of th
involving genies and men. We won

46:58.215 --> 47:00.317
the ending, but the writer himse
this way.

47:01.185 --> 47:01.686
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Optimistic, but.

47:02.787 --> 47:03.888
JEFFREY BROWN: Optimistic, but -
you feel?

47:05.356 --> 47:08.192
SALMAN RUSHDIE: One of the thing
the study of history is that his

47:09.660 --> 47:14.165
you. History is not written. It'
you know, that the victory of ev

47:14.799 --> 47:15.099
certain, you know?

47:16.567 --> 47:20.371
So, I thought, let me what else
could you tell this story? And s

47:21.839 --> 47:26.343
does have an unexpected ending.
thought, I don't want it just to

47:27.745 --> 47:32.216
of Pollyannish happy ever after
I had to screw it up a bit.

47:33.684 --> 47:37.288
JEFFREY BROWN: Maybe so, but on
least, the genies were back in t

47:38.622 --> 47:42.026
A great city and its millions of
on about their business.

49:48.519 --> 49:51.689
through all the different securi
and everything.

49:53.157 --> 49:55.793
And it's really disorienting whe
start. You know, it takes them a

49:57.261 --> 50:01.665
warm up to you or just really ev
at all. And they would test me a

50:03.133 --> 50:06.070
And on the first day, they're ki
-- you think about the guitar is

50:07.538 --> 50:10.074
instrument. And kids are like li
kind of when they're holding it,

50:10.941 --> 50:11.609
like, I just want to make noise.

in that what they do with that p
in their treatment alongside of

it feels good to have something
graduating high school, learning

52:33.083 --> 52:37.421
