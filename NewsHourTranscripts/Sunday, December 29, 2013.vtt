09:07.200 --> 09:08.233
THE PERSON THAT ARRESTS THEM

09:08.233 --> 09:09.700
>> THIS KIND OF PROACTIV

09:09.700 --> 09:11.800
POLICING IS AT THE HEART OF

09:11.800 --> 09:13.400
LITTLE-KNOWN PROGRAM WITHIN TH

09:13.400 --> 09:15.267
NYPD CALLED "THE JUVENIL

09:15.267 --> 09:17.467
ROBBERY INTERVENTION PROGRAM,"

09:17.467 --> 09:19.200
OR J-RIP

09:19.200 --> 09:21.733
ITS AIM IS TO STEER EVER

09:21.733 --> 09:23.333
TEENAGER WHO'S ARRESTED FROM A

09:23.333 --> 09:24.767
ROBBERY AWAY FROM A LIFE O

09:24.767 --> 09:25.100
CRIME.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.533
THE FOCUS IS ON TWO NEW YORK

09:26.533 --> 09:27.433
CITY NEIGHBORHOODS

09:27.433 --> 09:29.400
OFFICERS MAKE REPEATED VISITS TO

09:29.400 --> 09:31.200
THE TEENS' HOMES, GETTING TO

09:31.200 --> 09:32.767
KNOW THEIR FAMILIES AN

09:32.767 --> 09:34.133
MONITORING THEIR WHEREABOUTS

09:34.133 --> 09:35.400
>> IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT WE

09:35.400 --> 09:37.367
USUALLY LOOK AT WHERE CRIME IS

09:37.367 --> 09:38.800
HAPPENING, AND THAT'S WHERE WE

09:38.800 --> 09:40.233
DEPLOY OUR PERSONNEL, AND THAT

09:40.233 --> 09:43.867
WAS ONLY WORKING, YOU KNOW,

09:43.867 --> 09:44.000
BIT HERE

09:44.000 --> 09:47.133
>> JOANNE IS THE HOUSING BUREA

09:47.133 --> 09:49.300
CHIEF FOR NYPD

09:49.300 --> 09:51.400
SHE OVERSEES HUNDREDS OF HOUSING

09:51.400 --> 09:51.767
DEVELOPMENTS

09:51.767 --> 09:53.867
ONLY ABOUT 5% OF THE CITY'

09:53.867 --> 09:55.067
RESIDENTS LIVE IN PUBLIC

09:55.067 --> 09:56.667
HOUSING, BUT APPROXIMATELY 20%

09:56.667 --> 09:59.033
OF VIOLENT CRIME TAKES PLACE I

09:59.033 --> 09:59.200
THEM

09:59.200 --> 10:00.667
IN LATE 2006, SHE NOTICED

10:00.667 --> 10:02.800
SPIKE IN ROBBERIES COMMITTED B

10:02.800 --> 10:05.233
TEENS IN PUBLIC HOUSING UNITS IN

10:05.233 --> 10:06.567
THE BROWNSVILLE AREA O

10:06.567 --> 10:06.733
BROOKLYN

10:06.733 --> 10:08.533
>> A LOT OF IT, THE MAJORITY O

10:08.533 --> 10:10.667
IT, WAS YOUTH-ON-YOUTH

10:10.667 --> 10:11.933
ROBBERIES, WHERE YOUNG TEENAGERS

10:11.933 --> 10:13.400
WERE STEALING PROPERTY OF OTHE

10:13.400 --> 10:14.833
YOUNG KIDS THAT LIVED IN THE

10:14.833 --> 10:15.000
AREA

10:15.000 --> 10:16.433
AND WE KNEW WE HAD TO DO

10:16.433 --> 10:18.033
SOMETHING, AND WHAT I STARTED TO

10:18.033 --> 10:19.933
LOOK AT IS, WHERE DID TH

10:19.933 --> 10:21.700
ROBBERS THAT ARE COMMITTIN

10:21.700 --> 10:22.367
ROBBERIES LIVE

10:22.367 --> 10:24.367
>> THAT'S WHEN SHE CAME UP WIT

10:24.367 --> 10:24.733
J-RIP.

10:24.733 --> 10:26.833
>> AND THE IDEA WAS NOW, WE WERE

10:26.833 --> 10:28.867
GOING TO GO TO EVERY JUVENIL

10:28.867 --> 10:31.433
AND WE WERE GOING TO GIVE THEM A

10:31.433 --> 10:31.800
MESSAGE.

10:31.800 --> 10:34.033
IF THEY CONTINUED TO ENGAGE IN

10:34.033 --> 10:35.433
CRIMINAL CONDUCT, WE WOULD D

10:35.433 --> 10:37.167
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO MAK

10:37.167 --> 10:39.200
SURE THAT THEY STAY IN JAIL.

10:39.200 --> 10:41.100
THE SECOND COMPONENT TO TH

10:41.100 --> 10:42.300
PROGRAM WAS REALLY TO GE

10:42.300 --> 10:44.133
INVOLVED WITH THEM AND THEIR

10:44.133 --> 10:46.967
FAMILIES AND IDENTIFY RESOURCE

10:46.967 --> 10:49.733
TO ASSIST THE FAMILY AS A WHOLE.

10:49.733 --> 10:50.933
>> WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

10:50.933 --> 10:52.633
SOUNDS A LOT LIKE SOCIAL WORK.

10:52.633 --> 10:55.267
IS THIS REALLY THE ROLE OF A

10:55.267 --> 10:56.300
POLICE OFFICER OR POLICE UNIT?

10:56.300 --> 10:57.900
>> I THINK SO MUCH OF WHAT WE DO

10:57.900 --> 10:59.333
IS SOCIAL WORK

10:59.333 --> 11:01.633
THERE'S A TRUE OVERLAP

11:01.633 --> 11:03.567
HERE, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUN

11:03.567 --> 11:06.333
KIDS, YOUNG ADULTS, THAT HAVE AN

11:06.333 --> 11:07.067
OPPORTUNITY, WE HAVE A

11:07.067 --> 11:08.800
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP THEM AND

11:08.800 --> 11:10.533
THEIR FAMILIES CHANGE THEI

11:10.533 --> 11:10.767
LIVES.

11:10.767 --> 11:13.333
>> THE PROGRAM BEGAN IN 2007

11:13.333 --> 11:16.833
AND NOW TRACKS A TOTAL OF 31

11:16.833 --> 11:19.000
TEENAGERS IN BROWNSVILLE

11:19.000 --> 11:20.567
BROOKLYN, AND IN EAST HARLEM

11:20.567 --> 11:22.333
BOTH AREAS WITH HIGH RATES O

11:22.333 --> 11:25.500
ROBBERIES COMMITTED BY TEENS

11:25.500 --> 11:27.100
WHY IS THIS PROGRAM FOCUSED ON

11:27.100 --> 11:27.433
ROBBERIES?

11:27.433 --> 11:29.033
>> A LOT OF KIDS AREN'T INVOLVED

11:29.033 --> 11:31.067
IN HOMICIDES, YOU KNOW, KIDS ARE

11:31.067 --> 11:32.600
INVOLVED IN ROBBERIES.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.500
THEY ARE STEALING PROPERTY, AN

11:34.500 --> 11:36.800
SOME OF THEM DON'T EVEN REALIZ

11:36.800 --> 11:39.367
THAT WHAT THEY ARE DOING IS

11:39.367 --> 11:40.667
SERIOUS, SERIOUS FELONY CRIME.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.567
>> JORDAN RAUS SAYS THAT WAS THE

11:42.567 --> 11:43.900
CASE FOR HIM

11:43.900 --> 11:46.467
HE WAS ARRESTED IN 2009 AT THE

11:46.467 --> 11:48.500
AGE OF 16, CHARGED WITH ROBBER

11:48.500 --> 11:49.833
BY PHYSICAL FORCE.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.733
HE STOLE SOMEONE'S CELL PHONE.

11:51.733 --> 11:54.167
>> EVERYTHING I DID WAS FOR THAT

11:54.167 --> 11:54.567
MOMENT

11:54.567 --> 11:57.400
I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT PAST OR

11:57.400 --> 11:57.667
FUTURE

11:57.667 --> 11:59.067
IT WAS JUST HERE AND NOW

11:59.067 --> 12:01.200
>> JORDAN LIVES ALONE WITH HIS

12:01.200 --> 12:01.800
MOTHER

12:01.800 --> 12:04.133
GROWING UP, HE RARELY SAW HI

12:04.133 --> 12:05.833
FATHER, AND HIS MOM SAYS KEEPING

12:05.833 --> 12:07.467
HIM ON THE RIGHT PATH WASN'T

12:07.467 --> 12:08.000
EASY

12:08.000 --> 12:09.333
>> THERE WAS NIGHTS I CAN'

12:09.333 --> 12:12.533
WATCH HIM WHEN I'M NOT HERE, S

12:12.533 --> 12:14.967
BASICALLY, HE WAS GOING TO

12:14.967 --> 12:16.567
SCHOOL AND NOT DOING ANYTHING.

12:16.567 --> 12:18.333
>> IN THE NEARLY FOUR YEARS THAT

12:18.333 --> 12:20.100
THE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN

12:20.100 --> 12:21.900
MONITORING JORDAN, THEY'VE

12:21.900 --> 12:23.300
OFFERED HIM ADVICE ON HOW TO

12:23.300 --> 12:25.500
LAND A JOB AND ENCOURAGED HIM TO

12:25.500 --> 12:27.233
ENROLL IN VOCATIONAL TRAININ

12:27.233 --> 12:27.500
CLASSES.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.067
>> IF YOU WANT TO GO, KEPT

12:30.067 --> 12:31.700
RESISTING, AND AFTER, YOU KNOW

12:31.700 --> 12:33.100
JUST CONSTANTLY HARASSING HI

12:33.100 --> 12:35.333
ABOUT IT, BASICALLY, IF THAT'S

12:35.333 --> 12:36.967
HOW YOU WANT TO SAY IT

12:36.967 --> 12:39.967
HARASSING, HE FINALLY DECIDED TO

12:39.967 --> 12:40.600
GO

12:40.600 --> 12:44.567
WENT, AND ACTUALLY EARNED HI

12:44.567 --> 12:44.933
DIPLOMA OUT OF THERE

12:44.933 --> 12:46.867
>> KEEP HIM ON HIS TOES.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.300
LET HIM KNOW, YOU KNOW WHAT,

12:48.300 --> 12:49.633
OFFICER WILL BE COMING AROUND.

12:49.633 --> 12:50.133
YOU GOT TO, YOU KNOW, STEP U

12:50.133 --> 12:52.467
YOUR GAME.

12:52.467 --> 12:54.100
YOU HAVE TO, YOU KNOW, IMPROVE

12:54.100 --> 12:54.333
YOURSELF

12:54.333 --> 12:56.333
>> FOR OFFICERS IN THIS PROGRAM,

12:56.333 --> 12:58.833
IT'S A JOB THAT REQUIRES TIM

12:58.833 --> 13:01.000
AND RESOURCES TO DEVELOP AND

13:01.000 --> 13:02.933
MAINTAIN THESE RELATIONSHIPS

13:02.933 --> 13:05.100
EVERYTHING FROM DRIVING TEENS TO

13:05.100 --> 13:06.200
DOCTORS APPOINTMENTS T

13:06.200 --> 13:07.667
CONNECTING FAMILIES WITH

13:07.667 --> 13:08.700
CHILDCARE OPTIONS.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.767
BUT GAINING THE TRUST OF

13:10.767 --> 13:12.800
FAMILIES ISN'T ALWAYS SO EASY.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.167
ESPECIALLY IN NEIGHBORHOOD

13:14.167 --> 13:15.733
WHERE THE CONTROVERSIAL USE OF

13:15.733 --> 13:18.900
STOP AND FRISK HAS CREATED

13:18.900 --> 13:19.300
TENSION.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.600
>> THERE'S NOT ALL WELCOME MAT

13:20.600 --> 13:22.533
ON THE FLOOR, YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE

13:22.533 --> 13:23.367
TO DEVELOP RELATIONSHIPS WIT

13:23.367 --> 13:24.800
THE PARENTS.

13:24.800 --> 13:27.567
IT MAY TAKE WEEKS.

13:27.567 --> 13:30.267
I HAD A MOTHER SLAM THE DOOR I

13:30.267 --> 13:31.967
MY FACE A FEW TIMES.

13:31.967 --> 13:33.400
>> WHAT IF THEY SAY I DON'T WANT

13:33.400 --> 13:35.400
TO BE IN THIS PROGRAM, I DON'T

13:35.400 --> 13:37.267
WANT TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH

13:37.267 --> 13:37.733
IT

13:37.733 --> 13:38.533
>> GREAT QUESTION.

13:38.533 --> 13:40.333
GUESS WHAT, THEY DON'T HAVE

13:40.333 --> 13:40.700
CHOICE

13:40.700 --> 13:41.767
THEY ARE IN A PROGRAM WE'R

13:41.767 --> 13:43.567
GOING TO MONITOR AND MENTO

13:43.567 --> 13:43.767
THEM

13:43.767 --> 13:45.700
THEY CAN NOT ALLOW US TO MENTO

13:45.700 --> 13:47.233
THEM, BUT WE CAN MONITOR THEM.

13:47.233 --> 13:48.400
>> THIS IS THEIR GROUP

13:48.400 --> 13:50.233
>> THAT MEANS MONITORING THE

13:50.233 --> 13:52.400
ANY WAY THEY CAN, EVEN POSING AS

THINK IT IS.

14:54.167 --> 14:55.633

14:55.633 --> 14:57.867
SMALL, IT HAS ATTRACTE

14:57.867 --> 14:58.633
RELATIVELY LITTLE ATTENTION, AND

14:58.633 --> 15:01.533
EVEN LESS CRITICISM.

DAVID KENNEDY, AN EXPERT O

15:05.300 --> 15:07.400
KINDS OF TACTICS ARE NOT

15:07.400 --> 15:08.067
SURPRISING

15:16.933 --> 15:18.333
AND DANGEROUS, THEY ARE GOING TO

15:18.333 --> 15:19.700
WATCH THEM MORE CLOSELY.

15:19.700 --> 15:22.167
>> KENNEDY IS CONSIDERED A

15:22.167 --> 15:23.500
RENOWNED AUTHORITY ON CRIMINAL

15:23.500 --> 15:25.133
JUSTICE POLICIES IN THE U.S.

15:25.133 --> 15:27.033
HIS PHILOSOPHY, WHICH HAS BEEN

15:27.033 --> 15:29.167
WIDELY IMPLEMENTED WITH GREA

15:29.167 --> 15:30.900
SUCCESS, IS TO HAVE REGULA

15:30.900 --> 15:32.267
DIALOGUE AMONG OFFENDERS

15:32.267 --> 15:34.100
COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND LAW

15:34.100 --> 15:34.333
ENFORCEMENT.

15:34.333 --> 15:36.167
>> THESE ARE NEIGHBORHOODS THA

15:36.167 --> 15:38.667
NEED MORE PUBLIC SAFETY.

15:38.667 --> 15:40.400
THEY NEED A DIFFERENT KIND O

15:40.400 --> 15:42.267
CRIMINAL JUSTICE, ONE THAT WORKS

15:42.267 --> 15:44.300
FOR THEM WITHOUT LOCKING

15:44.300 --> 15:48.167
EVERYBODY UP, AND THEY NEED TO

15:48.167 --> 15:50.500
HAVE RESET RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

15:50.500 --> 15:53.433
THE COMMUNITY AND THE COPS

15:53.433 --> 15:55.133
>> THE JUVENILE ROBBER

15:55.133 --> 15:56.367
INTERVENTION PROGRAM, HE SAYS,

15:56.367 --> 15:58.933
IS PUTTING THIS IDEA INT

15:58.933 --> 15:59.133
PRACTICE

15:59.133 --> 16:04.400
>> NYPD IS A NO-NONSENSE POLIC

16:04.400 --> 16:06.067
DEPARTMENT, AND THE FACT THA

16:06.067 --> 16:08.267
THEY HAVE INVENTED THI

16:08.267 --> 16:10.167
INSTITUTIONALIZED IT, AND AR

16:10.167 --> 16:12.767
BACKING IT, IS REALLY

16:12.767 --> 16:14.067
BREAKTHROUGH FOR POLICING, AND

16:14.067 --> 16:16.067
IT'S A TESTAMENT TO HO

16:16.067 --> 16:17.133
SERIOUSLY THEY ARE TAKING THIS

16:17.133 --> 16:18.900
WAY OF THINKING ABOUT THINGS

16:18.900 --> 16:21.700
>> SO IS THE PROGRAM MAKING

16:21.700 --> 16:21.900
DIFFERENCE

16:21.900 --> 16:24.233
OF THE 317 TEENS THAT THE NYPD

16:24.233 --> 16:26.700
IS MONITORING THIS YEAR, ONLY 30

16:26.700 --> 16:28.700
WERE ARRESTED FROM JANUARY

16:28.700 --> 16:30.433
THROUGH NOVEMBER

16:30.433 --> 16:33.033
THAT'S A RECIDIVISM RATE OF JUST

16:33.033 --> 16:34.000
MORE THAN 10%.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.567
THE NYPD DOESN'T TRACK NUMBERS

16:36.567 --> 16:38.200
TO MAKE A CITYWIDE COMPARISON,

16:38.200 --> 16:40.433
BUT SAYS THE RATE IS A

16:40.433 --> 16:42.067
INDICATOR OF SUCCESS, AND SAYS

16:42.067 --> 16:43.633
SOME THINGS CAN'T BE MEASURED AT

16:43.633 --> 16:45.200
ALL, LIKE THE RIPPLE EFFECT ON

16:45.200 --> 16:47.400
FRIENDS AND FAMILIES OF TH

16:47.400 --> 16:48.333
TEENS IN THE PROGRAM

16:48.333 --> 16:50.267
POLICE COMMISSIONER RAY KELL

16:50.267 --> 16:51.967
APPLAUDS THE PROGRAM, BUT SAYS

16:51.967 --> 16:53.800
ADDING MORE RESOURCES TO IT IS

16:53.800 --> 16:56.367
NOT LIKELY ANY TIME SOON

16:56.367 --> 16:59.767
>> WE HAVE ABOUT 6,000 FEWER

16:59.767 --> 17:01.333
POLICE OFFICERS THAN WE HAD 12

17:01.333 --> 17:02.900
YEARS AGO, SO WE'RE DOING MORE

17:02.900 --> 17:04.400
WITH LESS.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.900
WE'D LIKE TO DO MORE OF J-RIP IN

17:08.900 --> 17:10.600
THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE, PROBABLY

17:10.600 --> 17:12.300
GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO EXPAN

17:12.300 --> 17:14.133
IT IN ANY SIGNIFICANT WAY.

17:14.133 --> 17:16.333
>> YOU'RE INVESTING HEAVILY IN

17:16.333 --> 17:18.933
THESE INDIVIDUALS, SO WHEN A

17:18.933 --> 17:21.800
YOUNG PERSON BECOMES A REPEA

17:21.800 --> 17:24.100
OFFENDER, IS THAT INVESTMENT

17:24.100 --> 17:24.333
SQUANDERED

17:24.333 --> 17:28.467
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO, BECAUSE

17:28.467 --> 17:30.533
FOR THE KIDS THAT CONTINUE TO BE

17:30.533 --> 17:31.700
INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL CONDUCT, WE

17:31.700 --> 17:33.433
NEED TO GET THEM OFF THE

17:33.433 --> 17:33.567
STREETS.

17:33.567 --> 17:35.800
WE NEED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC,

17:35.800 --> 17:38.067
AND OUR DUTY IS PROTECT THES

17:38.067 --> 17:40.167
OTHER KIDS, AND I THINK WE AS

17:40.167 --> 17:41.967
SOCIETY AND WE IN THE POLICE

17:41.967 --> 17:44.133
DEPARTMENT HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING

17:44.133 --> 17:44.833
WE CAN TO FIRST HELP THESE KID

17:44.833 --> 17:47.533
CHANGE THEIR LIVES

18:19.267 --> 18:19.867
USED TO.

18:19.867 --> 18:23.733
I SEE THE BIGGER PICTURE I

THAT AT THE TIME

18:29.567 --> 18:31.233
I WAS JUST A MOMENT TYPE OF GUY.

IF I WANTED IT, I'D TAKE IT, BUT

19:17.600 --> 19:19.033
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT

19:19.033 --> 19:20.900
THIS PRICE HIKE IN OUR STAMPS IS

19:20.900 --> 19:22.367
TO THE VIABILITY OF THE POSTAL

19:22.367 --> 19:22.867
SYSTEM TODAY

19:22.867 --> 19:24.867
>> WELL, CERTAINLY, THE POSTAL

19:24.867 --> 19:26.233
SERVICE HOPES THIS IS GOING TO

19:26.233 --> 19:28.100
HELP IT GENERATE MORE REVENUE.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.900
THEY WERE HARD HIT BY TH

19:29.900 --> 19:30.167
RECESSION.

19:30.167 --> 19:33.533
THEY'VE ALSO BEEN HARD HIT B

19:33.533 --> 19:35.000
INCREASED COMPETITION FROM

19:35.000 --> 19:36.867
PRIVATE POSTAL CARRIERS, AS WELL

19:36.867 --> 19:38.767
AS THE INTERNET, WHICH MAKES A

19:38.767 --> 19:41.200
LOT OF THINGS WE USED TO DO BY

19:41.200 --> 19:42.767
POST NOT NECESSARY ANY LONGER,

19:42.767 --> 19:45.933
BUT FOR CONSUMERS, I DON'T THINK

19:45.933 --> 19:47.667
THERE WILL BE IMMEDIATE DRASTI

19:47.667 --> 19:47.967
EFFECTS.

19:47.967 --> 19:51.167
YES, THREE CENTS MORE A STAM

19:51.167 --> 19:52.733
AND CONSIDERING HOW MUCH LES

19:52.733 --> 19:54.600
CONSUMERS ARE MAILING TODAY, I

19:54.600 --> 19:57.100
SHOULDN'T BE A DRAMATIC PINCH IN

19:57.100 --> 19:57.933

20:02.033 --> 20:04.767
IT'S THE MAGAZINES O

20:04.767 --> 20:07.400

THEY GOING TO FEEL THE PINCH

20:09.500 --> 20:10.167
MUCH WORSE

20:10.167 --> 20:11.567
>> THIS IS WHERE THE LOUDE

20:11.567 --> 20:12.933
PROTESTS ARE COMING FROM

20:12.933 --> 20:14.800
WHETHER IT'S GREETING CARDS,

20:14.800 --> 20:16.500
MAGAZINES, CHARITIES, THEY ARE

20:16.500 --> 20:18.333
REALLY UPSET WITH THIS

20:18.333 --> 20:20.933
THEY SAY THIS COULD EFFECT THE

20:20.933 --> 20:21.967
BOTTOM LINES, THIS COULD MEA

20:21.967 --> 20:23.867
LOST JOBS, THIS COULD REALLY

20:23.867 --> 20:25.233
IMPACT THE WAY THEY DO BUSINESS.

20:25.233 --> 20:27.767

VIABILITY OF A STATE-RUN POSTA

20:41.067 --> 20:42.133
SERVICE IS IN JEOPARDY

20:42.133 --> 20:43.933

20:43.933 --> 20:45.733
CLEARLY, FOR POSTAL SERVICES

20:45.733 --> 20:47.567
WORLDWIDE, FEWER AND FEWER ARE

TO CURTAIL HOME DELIVERY AND

21:00.667 --> 21:01.833
OTHER SERVICES

21:01.833 --> 21:02.967
IN THE UNITED STATES, DESPIT

21:02.967 --> 21:05.233
HIGH LEVEL OF LOSSES IN RECENT

21:05.233 --> 21:09.067
YEARS, THE SERVICES ARE STIL

21:09.067 --> 21:10.533
THERE, SO CHANGES MAY BE AROUN

21:10.533 --> 21:11.467
THE CORNER

21:11.467 --> 21:13.733
>> SO THE MONEY THAT THE POSTA

21:13.733 --> 21:17.167
SERVICE WILL RAISE FROM TH

21:17.167 --> 21:18.533
INCREASED PRICE OF STAMPS, I

21:18.533 --> 21:19.833
THAT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO GET

21:19.833 --> 21:24.333
IT BACK ON A FINANCIALLY SOLVENT

21:24.333 --> 21:24.600
TRACK?

21:24.600 --> 21:26.000
>> THAT ALONE ISN'T GOING TO D

21:26.000 --> 21:27.733
IT AND IS SOMETHING THE POSTAL

21:27.733 --> 21:29.000
SERVICE RECOGNIZES

21:29.000 --> 21:31.700
THE REGULATORS RECOGNIZED THEY

21:31.700 --> 21:33.967
COULD RAISE THE PRICE OF A STAMP

21:33.967 --> 21:36.533
AND BULK MAIL AND OTHER SERVICES

21:36.533 --> 21:39.100
FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS, AND THE

21:39.100 --> 21:43.500
IDEA WAS THAT THEY WOULD BE ABLE

21:43.500 --> 21:48.633
TO RECOUP $2.8 MILLION, BU

21:48.633 --> 21:50.100
LOSSES LAST YEAR FOR THE POSTA

21:50.100 --> 21:51.667
SERVICE WERE ABOUT $6 BILLION,

21:51.667 --> 21:53.633
THE YEAR BEFORE WERE ABOUT $15

21:53.633 --> 21:55.067
BILLION, SO THAT ALONE IS NO

21:55.067 --> 21:58.267
GOING TO MAKE IT A SUDDENL

21:58.267 --> 21:59.567
FINANCIALLY SOLVENT ENTERPRISE

21:59.567 --> 22:00.433
>> ALL RIGHT

22:46.767 --> 22:49.133
