ANCHOR: Good evening.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'’m Judy Woodruff.

00:07.674 --> 00:12.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
amidst new allegations
of Donald Trump assaulting
women, we explore

00:12.346 --> 00:18.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how women voters in North
Carolina are responding
to an election increasingly
about gender.

00:18.819 --> 00:24.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

the presidential
candidates.

SETH MEYERS, COMEDIAN: I don't
think in comedy
support is a particularly funny
position to

00:33.033 --> 00:34.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
have.

00:34.902 --> 00:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's far more-- it's far
funnier to
point out people's flaws as
opposed to pointing

00:36.570 --> 00:37.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out their strengths.

00:37.571 --> 00:38.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

forward to say they were fondled
or groped
by Donald Trump.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

01:21.048 --> 01:25.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In graphic terms, Kristin

sitting next to Trump at a

01:25.652 --> 01:27.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

The person
to my right, who unbeknownst to
me at the

time was Donald Trump, put their
hand up my
skirt.

01:36.496 --> 01:41.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I as pushed the hand away
and I got up
and I turned around and I see
these eyebrows

01:41.868 --> 01:47.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- very distinct eyebrows of
Donald Trump.

01:47.441 --> 01:51.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESJARDINS: She said that he
touched her genitals
through her underwear.

01:51.745 --> 01:56.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hours later, in Los Angeles,

01:58.418 --> 02:02.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Summers Zervos said Trump
assaulted her in
a hotel room when she thought
she was there

02:02.389 --> 02:04.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to talk about a job.

02:04.191 --> 02:07.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUMMER ZERVOS, TRUMP ACCUSER: He
grabbed my
shoulder and began kissing me
aggressively,

02:07.160 --> 02:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and placed his hand on my
breast.

02:10.464 --> 02:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I pulled back walked to another
part of the
room, and he grabbed my hand and
took me to

02:17.637 --> 02:19.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bedroom.

02:19.172 --> 02:20.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I walked out.

in Greensboro, North Carolina.

02:24.111 --> 02:26.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE:
They all are false.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're totally invented,
fiction.

02:29.716 --> 02:34.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All 100 percent totally and
completely fabricated.

02:34.121 --> 02:38.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESJARDINS: Trump's campaign
said the timing
points to a political smear.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he mocked Anderson's account
of assault
in a nightclub.

02:41.795 --> 02:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I was sitting alone by
myself like
this and then I went wah.

02:47.200 --> 02:52.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESJARDINS: This after running
mate Governor

that Trump will release evidence

MIKE PENCE (R), VICE
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
Well, Matt, I think it's coming
and it's coming

02:58.045 --> 03:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in frankly probably, in a matter
of hours.

03:02.149 --> 03:06.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DESJARDINS: As of late
afternoon, the Trump
campaign had not released any
new information.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Cleveland, President Obama
went after Trump
directly.

03:09.923 --> 03:13.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES:
All he had time for was
celebrities.

03:13.126 --> 03:17.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now all of a suddenly, he'’s
acting like
populist out there.

03:17.397 --> 03:28.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Man, I'’m going to fight for
working people."

03:28.408 --> 03:30.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Come on, man.

03:30.110 --> 03:30.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to know what somebody's
gonna do
-- look what they've been doing
their whole

03:30.410 --> 03:32.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, Hillary
Clinton, in
a taped interview, talked to
Ellen DeGeneres

03:33.380 --> 03:35.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about Trump's physical presence
during Sunday's
debate.

03:35.348 --> 03:38.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HILLARY CLINTON (D),
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
He was really trying to dominate
and literally

03:38.919 --> 03:41.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stalk me around the stage.

03:41.088 --> 03:48.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would just feel this
presence behind
me and, you know, I thought,
"Whoa, this is

03:48.528 --> 03:50.330 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really weird".

03:50.363 --> 03:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, I was just trying to
stay focused.

03:53.834 --> 03:55.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DESJARDINS: Clinton was also in
print.

03:55.802 --> 04:00.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She gave a series of written
answers under
penalty of perjury about her use
of private

04:00.974 --> 04:04.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mail, as secretary of state,
this as part
of a private lawsuit.

04:04.811 --> 04:09.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her lawyers wrote that Clinton
did not recall
any warning that her email
account conflicted

04:09.583 --> 04:12.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with or violated federal laws.

04:12.652 --> 04:17.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twenty-five days left until
election day and
we clearly are not done with the
twists and

04:17.457 --> 04:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
turns of this campaign season
yet.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

inappropriately with
"Apprentice"

to have one of the biggest
overhauls in its

04:38.512 --> 04:43.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50 year history -- changing how
it pays doctors
and other clinicians.

04:43.517 --> 04:49.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Starting in 2019, they can
choose to be compensated
for quality of service, rather
than quantity.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If they do, they'll be paid
more.

04:51.958 --> 04:56.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new system rolled out in
detail today
is the product of bi-partisan
legislation

04:56.930 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that passed Congress last year.

04:59.566 --> 05:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Swollen rivers have put parts of

The people
don't know how difficult a
situation they're

05:24.691 --> 05:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about to enter when the water
clears.

05:26.493 --> 05:32.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'd say 80 percent of this town
is under water
at this point in time.

05:32.532 --> 05:33.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we've got to prepare them
for that.

board was sued by the Democratic

05:45.712 --> 05:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

05:58.091 --> 06:03.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city's rebel-held east is
again under
heavy bombardment, and President
Bashar al-Assad

gain and national gain.

06:13.139 --> 06:18.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It'’s going to be the springboard
as a big

to liberate

another areas from the
terrorists.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to clean.

06:22.115 --> 06:26.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to keep cleaning this

push the terrorists to go back
to where they

06:26.219 --> 06:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
come from, or to kill them.

to bring Cuban
cigars and rum into the U.S.

07:45.999 --> 07:51.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration says

Cuba.

07:53.173 --> 07:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

year.

08:10.390 --> 08:14.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's up 34 percent over the
previous fiscal
year, due to a slowdown in
revenues and higher

08:14.828 --> 08:16.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government spending.

08:16.596 --> 08:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

The NASDAQ rose nearly a point,
and the S&amp;P

08:31.978 --> 08:37.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the week, the Dow lost a

the S&amp;P 500

08:37.617 --> 08:39.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

Still to come on the "NewsHour",
how some
women in the swing state of
North Carolina

08:44.324 --> 08:50.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see this election, an investor's

vote held
as much sway in a presidential
race as this

09:13.353 --> 09:18.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year, even before the recent
allegations of
sexual aggression were leveled
against Donald

09:18.858 --> 09:20.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, I traveled to the
crucial swing
state of North Carolina -- a
state that voted

09:23.897 --> 09:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama in 2008, but flipped to
Mitt Romney
and the Republicans in 2012.

09:29.803 --> 09:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four years later, there's no
slice of electorate
being fought over more than
college educated

09:35.909 --> 09:38.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white women -- and that's who we
went looking
for.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

09:39.879 --> 09:44.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I
originally thought
this cartoon of a man is not
going to get

09:44.117 --> 09:46.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very far, and how could he?

09:46.453 --> 09:49.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And here we are.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I am disgusted.

09:51.558 --> 09:58.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is
just basically
saying, "Well, boys will be
boys."

09:59.032 --> 10:00.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not acceptable.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Not acceptable to me.

10:02.469 --> 10:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And certainly not becoming of
someone I would
wish to be our president.

10:06.372 --> 10:09.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I wouldn't
want that
man in my home, I wouldn't want
him in my

10:10.243 --> 10:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I don't want him in my White
House.

WOODRUFF: A few of the reactions
from women
voters we talked to in North
Carolina.

10:16.115 --> 10:22.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Even women looking for a
Republican to support,
were repelled they said by the
11-year-old

10:22.055 --> 10:23.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

10:23.923 --> 10:27.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

case I start kissing her.

10:27.627 --> 10:32.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And coming in the
final month of
the campaign, it and the
accusations of the

10:32.232 --> 10:37.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past few days have thrown the
already-crucial
women's vote here into sharper
relief.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you
guys registered
to vote?

10:39.472 --> 10:45.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: If you needed proof of
how much
the Tar Heel state's 15
electoral votes matter,

10:45.545 --> 10:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look no further than the campus
of the University
of North Carolina in Chapel
Hill.

10:51.317 --> 10:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton volunteers were in a
last-minute push
to meet today's voter
registration deadline.

10:59.058 --> 11:05.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among the most coveted voters
are college-educated
white women, who in 2012 gave
Mitt Romney

11:05.665 --> 11:08.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a six point advantage
nationally.

11:08.768 --> 11:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year, polls show Donald

FERREL GUILLORY, DIRECTOR,

LIFE AT UNC: Frankly, women,
women are gonna

11:15.675 --> 11:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make up their own minds, you
know, unlike
you know, kind of the old South,
where everybody

11:20.413 --> 11:21.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voted together.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And women went to vote the way
their husbands
did.

amidst new allegations
of Donald Trump assaulting
women, we explore

11:28.488 --> 11:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how women voters in North

SETH MEYERS, COMEDIAN: I don't
think in comedy
support is a particularly funny
position to

11:35.728 --> 11:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have. I think it's far more--
it's far funnier
to point out people's flaws as
opposed to

11:36.429 --> 11:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pointing out their strengths.

or groped
by Donald Trump.

The first new accusation
appeared on "The

KRISTIN ANDERSON, TRUMP ACCUSER:

hand up my
skirt. And I as pushed the hand
away and I

11:56.182 --> 11:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got up and I turned around and I
see these
eyebrows -- very distinct
eyebrows of Donald

Trump.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

aggressively,

12:06.159 --> 12:07.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and placed his hand on my

I walked out.

DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATE:
They all are false. They're
totally invented,

12:12.131 --> 12:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fiction. All 100 percent totally
and completely
fabricated.

12:13.900 --> 12:14.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESJARDINS: Trump's campaign
said the timing
points to a political smear. And
he mocked

12:14.867 --> 12:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anderson's account of assault in
a nightclub.

DESJARDINS: As of late

12:25.411 --> 12:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE

All he had time for was
celebrities. Now all

12:28.982 --> 12:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

populist

fight for

12:29.682 --> 12:31.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
working people." Come on, man.

12:31.384 --> 12:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to know what somebody's

12:33.486 --> 12:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

HILLARY CLINTON (D),

He was really trying to dominate
and literally

12:38.257 --> 12:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stalk me around the stage. And I
would just
feel this presence behind me
and, you know,

12:39.959 --> 12:41.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I thought, "Whoa, this is really
weird". And
so, I was just trying to stay
focused.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESJARDINS: Clinton was also in
print. She
gave a series of written answers
under penalty

12:43.663 --> 12:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of perjury about her use of
private e-mail,
as secretary of state, this as
part of a private

12:45.498 --> 12:46.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lawsuit. Her lawyers wrote that
Clinton did
not recall any warning that her
email account

12:46.466 --> 12:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conflicted with or violated

If they do,

13:01.414 --> 13:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they'll be paid more. The new

it has political gain, on the

13:28.775 --> 13:30.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political gain and national

clean. You

13:32.378 --> 13:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

and to push
the terrorists to go back to
where they come

in revenues

14:07.513 --> 14:09.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

Obama in 2008, but flipped to

you know, kind of the old South,
where everybody

15:06.773 --> 15:07.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

to vote the
way their husbands did. I -- I
don't think

15:07.173 --> 15:08.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that holds.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
energizing millennial women is
one part of
Clinton's challenge.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GUILLORY: The millennial
generation is now
larger than the baby boom
generation, but

15:13.780 --> 15:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it doesn't vote with the same
potency. So,
she has the opportunity to bring
new voters

15:14.714 --> 15:16.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into the electorate,
particularly women.

WOODRUFF: We sat down with two
millennials,

15:18.284 --> 15:18.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year old PhD student Kyla
Wagner. D'Onofrio
had supported Bernie Sanders
early in the

15:18.851 --> 15:20.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
primary process, but --

15:20.753 --> 15:22.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIM D'’ONOFRIO: When Hillary won
the nomination,
I just sort of accepted it
immediately. It's

15:22.555 --> 15:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important to have somebody who
understands
how that world works. But do you
really think

15:24.290 --> 15:25.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump would be able
to -- you
can't just shove your foot
through the door

15:25.958 --> 15:27.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it comes to American
politics. You have
to take your time. It's
difficult.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Wagner is a registered
Republican
who wanted to see the White
House back in

15:29.695 --> 15:30.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOP hands. And when Trump beat
out the others,
Wagner says she did give him
serious consideration

15:30.062 --> 15:31.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at first.

15:31.831 --> 15:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLA GARRETT WAGNER: I'd like to
think I gave
him an honest opportunity, but
as a young

15:33.699 --> 15:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman, newly married, interested
in not only
the progress I'’m going to have
as a career

15:35.468 --> 15:37.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
woman, but as a mother, I just
really did
not feel and still do not feel
like Donald

15:37.303 --> 15:39.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump understands the needs of
the holistic
American woman. I do feel that
Hillary Clinton

15:39.071 --> 15:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will work tirelessly to get some
of the issues
I'’m most concerned about
addressed, paid

15:40.973 --> 15:41.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paternity leave, reassurance
that Roe v. Wade

protection of women's

15:43.109 --> 15:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: North Carolina is a
top priority
for both campaigns. President
Obama was here

15:44.911 --> 15:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just this week, Michelle Obama
last week.
On Tuesday, Mike Pence showed up
in Charlotte.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And today, Donald Trump is in
Greensboro.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The voters they're looking for
live in towns
like Apex, which are exploding
in population.

15:49.482 --> 15:51.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Much of that growth is fueled by
an influx
of college educated workers who
have come

15:51.250 --> 15:53.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here to raise their families.
The men tilt
Republican, but statewide,
college-educated

15:53.052 --> 15:53.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women -- who went for Mitt
Romney four years
ago -- this time are struggling
to support

15:53.486 --> 15:55.221 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

for a woman
to be president, I'’m certainly
not adverse

16:01.260 --> 16:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to that, just not this woman.
The emails are
concerning in terms of national
security.

16:02.995 --> 16:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do worry what might have been
in there that
got carelessly shared with
others.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, that's Hillary
Clinton. What
about Donald Trump? What's your
sense of him?

16:06.599 --> 16:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WAKEFORD: It's kind of like a
junior high
student beating his chest going,
"Oh, yeah,

16:08.367 --> 16:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'’m going to get you, and this
is how."
And you think, really? You're an
adult? You're

16:09.936 --> 16:11.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running for office -- the
highest office in
the land. What are you doing?

16:11.704 --> 16:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I cannot tell you how much I
cannot stand
that candidate. If I may make a
comparison,

16:13.372 --> 16:15.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is overtly
distasteful. I find
Hillary more covertly
distasteful.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Just 11 miles away,
41-year-old
Kristen Wynns lives in Cary with
her husband

16:17.210 --> 16:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kevin and two children, Zoe and
Logan. A registered
Republican, she runs her own
psychology practice,

16:18.978 --> 16:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went to an all women's college
and is still
struggling about what to do in
November.

16:20.780 --> 16:22.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISTEN WYNNS: Putting my blood,
sweat, and
tears into my own practice for
the last nine

16:22.582 --> 16:24.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years, clearly, some of Trumps
tax laws and
his views on taxes and small
businesses are

16:24.317 --> 16:26.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quite appealing to me as a small
business
owner, but then I'’ve got the
women's college

16:26.085 --> 16:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blood coursing through my veins.
Love the
idea of a women president. I'’m
raising two

16:28.087 --> 16:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
daughters, and some of Hillary
Clinton's beliefs
about closing the wage gap,
affirmative action,

16:29.355 --> 16:30.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
girls and women not being the
victims of abuse
or assault.

16:30.556 --> 16:30.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Are you still
struggling with your
decision?

16:30.957 --> 16:32.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WYNNS: I am.

16:32.391 --> 16:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: You think you're
leaning one way
or another at this point?

16:33.626 --> 16:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WYNNS: Can I be struggling and
leaning at
the same time?

16:34.060 --> 16:34.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Yes.

16:35.027 --> 16:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WYNNS: OK, then I think that's
where I am.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: That day, Wynns told
us she was
leaning Trump. But we've stayed
in touch and

16:38.831 --> 16:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today, she told us in light of
all the allegations
made by women this week, she's
now truly stumped.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUILLORY: Trump, with his words
and with his
life story, has demeaned women.
It's the coarseness

16:42.602 --> 16:46.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the way he sees the world of
men and women.
And I think that's -- that is
destabilized

16:46.706 --> 16:55.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a segment of the electorate that
would ordinarily
vote for a Republican like Mitt
Romney or

16:55.648 --> 16:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a Republican like John McCain.

16:57.583 --> 17:03.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Eight miles south of
Cary, in the
Raleigh suburb of Apex, the
evidence of exploding

17:03.089 --> 17:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growth is plain to see -- new
homes popping
up everywhere.

17:07.260 --> 17:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michele Hilmey, a New York
transplant and
registered Democrat, says the
tone of the

17:14.166 --> 17:19.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign has been particularly
difficult,
especially for her 8-year-old
son Nate.

17:19.772 --> 17:24.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELE HILMEY: Donald Trump was
accepting
the Republican nomination. We
were all gathered

17:24.710 --> 17:29.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
around, we were actually
visiting some family
out of town, and I happen to
look over at

17:29.215 --> 17:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him and he was crying. And he
was confused.
He thought that Donald Trump was
the president

17:33.486 --> 17:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at that point. We had to explain
that he was
just accepting the nomination.

17:37.256 --> 17:43.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I pressed him as to why
he was crying
he said, "Mom, I hear on the TV
all the time

17:43.696 --> 17:51.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Donald Trump hates women."
That was shocking
to me, I just couldn't believe
that he absorbed

17:51.070 --> 17:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, that he gleaned that from
conversations
knowing that his mom, and his
sister, and

17:57.543 --> 18:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his grandma that he loved so
dearly are women.

18:01.380 --> 18:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: For now, Hilmey is
undecided, but
leaning toward Clinton. But she
says she hopes

18:06.886 --> 18:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the sake of both her family
and the country,
the politicians who do get
elected will work

18:12.625 --> 18:14.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to find common ground.

18:14.427 --> 18:21.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILMEY: We cannot continue as a
country to
say, "I'’m a Democrat, you're a
Republican,

18:21.734 --> 18:29.575 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is no space in the
middle," we cannot
continue to have these extreme
one-sided beliefs.

18:29.608 --> 18:33.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has to be ground in the
middle or we'll
never move forward.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.047 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

18:35.081 --> 18:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And a note, as we
reported at the
top of the program, late today,
North Carolina

18:38.551 --> 18:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
extended voter registration in
36 counties
due to the flooding.

18:48.761 --> 18:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Now, the second of two
perspectives
on the campaign from the world
of business.

18:59.005 --> 19:04.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, correspondent Paul
Solman talked
to LinkedIn co-founder Reid
Hoffman, a Hillary

19:04.677 --> 19:06.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton supporter.

19:06.412 --> 19:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Paul sits down with Tom
Barrack.
He'’s a friend of, economic
advisor to, and

19:11.584 --> 19:16.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fundraiser for Donald Trump. It
is the second
take this week of our series,
"Making Sense".

TOM BARRACK, FRIEND OF DONALD
TRUMP: I'’m
the first kid to ever go to
college, first

19:19.892 --> 19:21.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kid to ever go to law school.

PAUL SOLMAN, PBS NEWSHOUR
CORRESPONDENT: Billionaire
Tom Barrack, the son of Lebanese
immigrants,

19:24.997 --> 19:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made his fortune as a real
estate investor.
Though his firm, Colony Capital,
has taken

19:30.770 --> 19:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stakes in more visible, if
unconventional
assets as well, like Michael
Jackson's Neverland

19:36.342 --> 19:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ranch, film company Miramax, and
the debt
of photographer Annie Leibovitz.
His showbiz

19:42.548 --> 19:46.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investments often made with his
friend actor
Rob Lowe.

19:46.519 --> 19:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the southern California
educated polo-playing
mogul spoke with us on behalf of
his business

19:52.324 --> 19:55.528 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
associate of longstanding,
Donald Trump.

19:55.561 --> 20:00.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the reason you're one of the
only two top
executives who were willing to
talk to us

20:00.900 --> 20:04.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in support of Mr. Trump because
you're fearless?

20:04.336 --> 20:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: It starts with number
one: he's a
friend. And number two: with
him, it's the

20:08.474 --> 20:13.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personal things of compassion,
and kindness,
and intellectual acuity, and the
ability to

20:14.013 --> 20:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make decisions that I think I
could help explain.

20:17.083 --> 20:21.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: Barrack met the
candidate when he
sold Mr. Trump New York's Plaza
Hotel in the

20:21.487 --> 20:25.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1980s, as he recounted at the
Republican National
Convention.

20:25.324 --> 20:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: He said, "No contract.
No contract.
You and I shake hands right
here, no lawyers,

20:31.764 --> 20:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no contract, no nothing. You
just tell me
the things that I should know
and how to fix

20:36.902 --> 20:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it and I'll do this deal." He
played me like
a Steinway piano.

20:41.307 --> 20:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: A few years after the
deal, Trump
filed for bankruptcy and the
plaza was sold

20:47.279 --> 20:51.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at a loss. But the two have been
friends ever
since.

20:51.450 --> 20:56.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barrack is one of Trump's
economic advisors
because, he says, among other
reasons --

20:56.555 --> 21:01.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: We have an unequal
barbell society.
The rich are getting richer, the
poor are

21:01.961 --> 21:06.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting poorer, middle class is
evaporating.
I see it every day in our
businesses.

21:06.332 --> 21:12.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, somebody has to intervene,
other than
professional politicians who are
paid to increase

21:12.671 --> 21:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bureaucratic morass of what
everybody
else is dealing with.

21:16.142 --> 21:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: But, Mr. Trump's policy
with regard
to, for example, taxes, would
actually cut

21:23.782 --> 21:29.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taxes more on the people who are
on the -- I
don't know, the richer side of
the barbell.

21:29.688 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: Well, I don't think
it's -- it's
fair to say that, right? The
concept is, that

21:36.295 --> 21:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you incent people to take
risk, they will
take risk. They'll infuse more
capital into

21:41.367 --> 21:47.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the system. And at the higher
end of that
-- of that equation, that'll
eventually produce

21:47.606 --> 21:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more growth, and growth will
produce more
opportunity, and the tax base
itself will

21:52.244 --> 21:54.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
increase.

21:54.113 --> 21:57.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it takes all of us on the
outside, gently
knocking at that door, and
saying, it's time

21:57.449 --> 21:59.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reexamine these things, let's
do it.

21:59.351 --> 22:03.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Well, it's not gentle
knocking at
the moment, right? I mean, Mr.
Trump is not

22:03.789 --> 22:05.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a "gentle knocker."

22:05.558 --> 22:09.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: Well, actually, on the
policy side,
I think it is gentle. The
rhetoric is not

22:09.195 --> 22:13.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gentle. I think they're both
better than that.
I think Hillary is very
accomplished and very

22:13.632 --> 22:17.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capable, and I think people
would be surprised
at the -- the intellectual
ability of Donald

22:17.903 --> 22:18.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on these issues.

22:18.971 --> 22:21.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: "Conciliator," you said
in one interview.

22:21.307 --> 22:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: Yes, absolutely. And
you think about
the difficulty of building a
Trump Tower.

22:26.512 --> 22:30.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, you have 100
constituencies that you
have to bring together, and then
you have

22:30.883 --> 22:35.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to be able to sell it to
somebody who's going
to lend you the money. Making
deals and negotiations

22:35.821 --> 22:40.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me is where the United States
is going
to have to go in the next
decade. We haven't

22:40.259 --> 22:42.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been good at it.

22:42.228 --> 22:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have Donald, who has no
political background,
but has a very good background
in being able

22:46.999 --> 22:52.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to coalesce these
constituencies, most of
the time successfully, sometime
not successfully,

22:52.471 --> 22:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who's saying, "I will challenge
that system,
and I'll bring in people who
understand the

22:58.677 --> 23:00.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system, but people who are not
of the system."

23:00.412 --> 23:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: But he's giving no
indication that
that's what he's like, when he
appears in

23:05.651 --> 23:10.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public, in the debate, when he
appears at
rallies and so forth, right?

23:10.489 --> 23:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: Yes. It's true. This
crass sense
of who he is, which comes out of
vignettes,

23:16.595 --> 23:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which he doesn't help, right?
Because he's
not apologizing for things the
way --

23:20.966 --> 23:22.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SOLMAN: Yes.

23:22.768 --> 23:26.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: -- that we would,
right? That being
said, I think a man who has the
courage to

23:26.505 --> 23:32.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, "Look, interpret it however
you want.
I'’m not a political animal, so I
make mistakes,

23:32.344 --> 23:34.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and that'’s who I am" is
refreshing.

23:34.713 --> 23:41.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: You have no concerns
that he might
go too far, that he might do
things -- threatening,

23:41.787 --> 23:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, Secretary Clinton,
with putting
her in jail? I mean, that
doesn't bother you?

23:46.859 --> 23:53.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: Look, all, all of that
quite personally
bothers me. It bothers me having
her attacked,

23:53.432 --> 23:57.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it bothers me having him
attacked. I don't
see any benefit in either of
those things.

23:57.836 --> 24:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's this cat fight that's
becoming disheartening.

24:02.741 --> 24:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: And if Donald Trump, as
he will, hears
you saying this, he's not going
to be upset

24:10.482 --> 24:12.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with you?

24:12.318 --> 24:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: No, he will! He hates
it when I say
that, because, in his view, the
cat fighting

24:17.990 --> 24:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is what's important. In other
words, the emails,
the lack of credibility, the
lack of integrity.

24:23.996 --> 24:28.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I look at it differently,
saying, look, I
have a private server, and I
have a public

24:28.467 --> 24:33.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
server. And I know how
complicated it is,
just for me as a little guy
trying to keep

24:33.072 --> 24:34.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
track of things.

24:34.873 --> 24:40.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I quite honestly think somebody
of Hillary's
ilk is not intentionally doing
any of that.

24:40.212 --> 24:43.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a foundation, if you're
president of the
United States then you have to
go get a job,

24:43.549 --> 24:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what are you gonna do, be a
caddy! Right?
I mean, you're going to do
something elegant,

24:47.886 --> 24:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're going to go out to the
world and you're
going to form a foundation, and
you're going

24:50.255 --> 24:52.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do big things.

24:52.157 --> 24:57.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you then do those big
things, and somebody
needs to get invited to a lunch,
is it -- is

24:57.930 --> 25:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it so out of place that you're
going to invite
somebody who's a contributor
versus somebody

25:02.000 --> 25:05.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else. You know, the things to me
are not the
issue.

25:05.304 --> 25:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: But Barrack says there
are a host
of economic issues Donald Trump
would positively

25:10.776 --> 25:12.578 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
address.

25:12.611 --> 25:17.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: Fair trade, a monetary
policy that's
failed with quantitative easing
and a focus

25:17.049 --> 25:21.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on jobs is employment and normal
people having
an education and healthcare
system.

25:21.453 --> 25:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: But, Mr. Trump has had
almost no specific
proposals for how to deal with
any of the

25:28.026 --> 25:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things you're talking about,
except to say,
"No!" to the trade deals,
"They're bad. I'’m

25:34.833 --> 25:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to make them better."

25:36.602 --> 25:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: So, here's why I think
that it's
not as silly as it sounds. So,
if you take

25:40.539 --> 25:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade, you have every senator
and congressman
that has a different view, that
all have special

25:44.610 --> 25:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interests that need to be
vetted, and, by
the time that you get to the
efficacy of any

25:48.781 --> 25:54.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade agreement, it's illusory.
So, I think,
somebody like Mr. Trump coming
in, saying,

25:54.686 --> 25:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Look, I don't know. I'’m not
sure on the
trade side, I'’m not sure on
central bank

25:58.690 --> 25:59.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
intervention."

25:59.691 --> 26:01.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: But, blow it up.

26:01.460 --> 26:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: Not blow it up, I'’m
gonna bring
the best minds that I can find,
and I'’m

26:05.731 --> 26:09.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to take it apart and I'’m
gonna make
it better, because I have no
vested baggage

26:09.234 --> 26:11.036 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in it.

26:11.069 --> 26:15.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: But to Tom Barrack,
Hillary Clinton
is part of the economic system
and that system

26:15.140 --> 26:22.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is broken: over-indebted, over
bureaucratized,
overregulated, overtaxed --
problems papered

26:23.015 --> 26:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over by a Federal Reserve that's
printed too
much money.

26:27.119 --> 26:32.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you saying that the economy,
the United
States economy is a mirage? The
extent to

26:32.257 --> 26:36.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which things look good, markets
look good?
Unemployment is down?

26:36.628 --> 26:40.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BARRACK: Of course, it's
artificial stimulation
and an illusion.

26:40.232 --> 26:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: And it's going to end
catastrophically?

26:42.167 --> 26:45.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARRACK: My belief is, unless
something happens,
it will end catastrophically,
one way or the

26:45.838 --> 26:47.439 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: And so, the, something
that would
prevent it from happening would
be?

26:49.942 --> 26:51.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARRACK: A disruption.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: Like Mr. Trump's
election.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
BARRACK: Yes.

26:54.079 --> 26:56.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: And, is that what's
fundamentally
driving you economically?

26:56.682 --> 26:58.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRACK: Absolutely. Absolutely.
A hundred
percent.

26:58.984 --> 27:02.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think whoever the next
president is,
it's going to be high on their
list, and that

27:02.888 --> 27:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress will pay attention this
time. And
that they'll move it. It'll move
15 degrees

27:09.795 --> 27:13.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with one, seven degrees with the
other, but
I think the debate will have
done a good job

27:13.432 --> 27:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of getting them to move period.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SOLMAN: Tom Barrack, thank you
very much.

27:16.668 --> 27:23.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARRACK: It was great to be with
you, thanks.

27:23.408 --> 27:28.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

27:28.213 --> 27:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And with that, we turn
to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks. That's
syndicated columnist

27:34.386 --> 27:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and "New York
Times" columnist
David Brooks.

27:37.589 --> 27:39.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

27:39.424 --> 27:46.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, what a week. And it keeps
coming. David,
these allegations against Donald
Trump, some

27:46.431 --> 27:52.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of them we can't even describe
in full here
on this program. He said --
they'’re very

27:52.437 --> 27:56.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
graphic, he says they didn't
happen, these
are all lies.

27:56.708 --> 27:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this just more of the same or
have we reached
a new low?

27:59.611 --> 28:03.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS, THE NEW YORK
TIMES: I guess
we've always reached a new low,
Judy, every

28:03.582 --> 28:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Friday. So, we'’re on a weekly
basis. His
case would be better if he
hadn't bragged

28:08.754 --> 28:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about doing exactly what he's
alleged to have
done.

28:12.524 --> 28:16.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you know, when you get
five or six
of these people coming out, some
of whom said

28:16.328 --> 28:23.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things contemporaneously, I
don't know if
it'’s dispositive, but it's kind
compelling.

28:23.902 --> 28:26.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that we'’re talking
about a
major presidential candidate
behaving this

28:26.371 --> 28:32.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way in 2016, it'’s kind of
astounding. And
the fact that the guy is still
walking and

28:32.210 --> 28:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the guy has a lot of support
among a lot of
decent people, I don't know what
the word

28:37.049 --> 28:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
s. And so, you just -- just
gobsmacked, British
would say, surprised out of your
wits end

28:44.256 --> 28:45.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that we'’re here.

28:45.490 --> 28:47.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF, PBS NEWSHOUR
ANCHOR: Gobsmacked,
Mark?

28:47.326 --> 28:51.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHEILDS, SYNDICATED
COLUMNIST: I'’ve
never been gobsmacked, but I
know David -- David

28:51.163 --> 28:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been -- I just have to say,
Judy, it amazes
me that anybody with anything
approaching

28:58.870 --> 29:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this background, the tape alone
would run
for president. I mean, given --

29:04.276 --> 29:06.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: You mean the "Access
Hollywood"
tape.

29:06.211 --> 29:09.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: Yes, the "Access
Hollywood". I mean,
irrespective of these charges,
charges are

29:09.715 --> 29:16.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quite serious, but I mean, I had
one Republican
reminded me today, well, how did
Dennis Hastert

29:16.154 --> 29:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accept the speakership with that
in his background?
So -- but I don't know what
point you start

29:21.493 --> 29:27.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to think that you're invisible
or just bulletproof.

29:27.199 --> 29:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that -- I have to say that
the singular
impressive moment of the week to
me was Michelle

29:35.374 --> 29:44.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama. It was -- because she
took it out of
a -- sort of a "men should be
ashamed" or

29:44.883 --> 29:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whatever, into a -- and women
are victims
-- into a very I thought human
terms and spoke

29:51.590 --> 29:56.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the pain and the outrage
that she felt.

29:56.261 --> 30:02.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you are talking about
somebody as unassailable
critic, she is, A, the most
popular political

30:02.834 --> 30:08.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
figure in the country. She is
the best known
mother and mother two of
daughters, wife,

30:08.440 --> 30:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
professional woman and happens
to be African
American. But I just thought
authentic in

30:13.278 --> 30:19.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the air that'’s been synthetic in
so many
respects, and we hear about
campaigns and

30:19.151 --> 30:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what'’s going on. I just thought
that was
an authentic moment, I thought
it was a defining

30:23.588 --> 30:25.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this campaign.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: And sign of national
malaise that
we're all dragged into because
of the conversation

30:28.894 --> 30:30.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have to have. And I will say
--

30:30.228 --> 30:32.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: That we have to talk
about.

30:32.064 --> 30:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: Yes, and I will say one
other thing,
you know, oppo research gets a
bad name. You

30:34.666 --> 30:37.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
shouldn't go after your
opponent, you shouldn'’t
go dig them up, but if Marco
Rubio and Jeb

30:37.836 --> 30:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bush or John Kasich have decent
oppo research,
and had unearthed this in the
primary, it

30:43.075 --> 30:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would have spared the country a
lot of turmoil.
And their own party, a lot of
self destruction.

30:47.212 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: So, you think they
should have been
doing this.

30:50.315 --> 30:55.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: Well, things should come
up. They
had a lot of candidates in that
race, once

30:55.620 --> 30:59.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans had a lot of decent
choices, they
could have looked away from
Trump to somebody

30:59.257 --> 31:03.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they could have stomached and it
would have
been fine. But now, and you
watch a lot of

31:03.929 --> 31:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans who just feel -- you
feel like
they're lock in.

31:06.498 --> 31:11.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then you feel other
Republicans in morally
incoherent state. Last week, a
couple of senators

31:11.636 --> 31:15.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calling for Trump to step down,
and he didn'’t
step down. And now, they're
saying, we'll

31:15.741 --> 31:18.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote for him, which is morally
incoherent.
If you want them step down, you
can't vote

31:18.910 --> 31:21.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the guy to be president of
the United
States.

31:21.213 --> 31:24.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you have a lot of
people saying,
I'll just play it cool. I'’ll
just be with

31:24.616 --> 31:28.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him. I'll be good Republican,
and then when
he goes away, I'll just be fine.

31:28.954 --> 31:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is not the case. This is
not like supporting
Barry Goldwater in 1964. This is
like supporting

31:33.358 --> 31:37.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joe McCarthy and you will not be
fine. And
a lot of the people are just
hanging around

31:37.829 --> 31:42.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the fence or alienating both
sides by being
somewhere in the middle will not
be recovering

31:42.868 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so easily, I do not think.

31:43.869 --> 31:45.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: How do you explain
their calculus?

31:45.670 --> 31:49.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: Well, I think -- I
think the people
who switch last weekend after
the "Access

31:49.508 --> 31:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hollywood" tape, are ones who
are in the most
trouble politically. I think it
was politically

31:55.180 --> 31:56.148 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
--

31:56.181 --> 31:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: You mean because they
waited?

31:58.083 --> 32:03.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: First of all, if I'’m a
Trump supporter,
loyal supporter this is hour of
maximum peril.

32:03.855 --> 32:07.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these are the people who
picked up the
knife and plunged it into his
back when he

32:07.692 --> 32:12.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was really hurting, I won't
forget that as
a Trump supporter. If I'’m one of
the people

32:12.497 --> 32:19.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like Mitt Romney or Ben Sasse of
Nebraska
who early on said this man is
unacceptable,

32:19.271 --> 32:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a legitimate question and
say, wait
a minute, what was it that
finally tipped

32:23.875 --> 32:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it? I mean, you know, it wasn't
the judge,
it wasn't libeling Mexican
immigrants, it

32:31.183 --> 32:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't libeling prisoners of war
and their
courage or whatever else? I
mean, nothing

32:37.189 --> 32:42.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
else he did, libeling women
throughout e,
but this did it because he
became politically

32:42.360 --> 32:44.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
radioactive at that point?

32:44.229 --> 32:49.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think -- I think in that
sense, I'’ve
already seen it in a poll,
congressional poll

32:50.001 --> 32:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Republican member who had
changed, two
to one margin, constituents in a
post-weekend

32:56.741 --> 33:03.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poll, regarded it as act of
opportunism rather
than political courage. So, I
think David's

33:03.381 --> 33:10.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
categories are right. It is a
difficult thing
to do, but if in fact he loses
and they lose

33:10.322 --> 33:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Congress, Republicans lose
the Congress,
and I think that's the key, if
that happens,

33:15.193 --> 33:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then association with him will
have been regarded
as a permanent stain. Not
standing up to him

33:23.168 --> 33:24.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and calling him for what he has
done.

33:25.003 --> 33:28.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BROOKS: This is sort of
psychological question,
what happens, say he loses what
happens the

33:28.707 --> 33:33.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next day? Is there all the
Trumpians saying,
no, we were robbed, we are
robbed, we are

33:33.178 --> 33:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sticking with our man, we'’re
going into
some sort of revolt? Or is it,
like, I was

33:37.182 --> 33:40.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a loser and I'’m putting that
behind me.

33:40.085 --> 33:44.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My intuition about the
psychology is the latter
is more likely. That people are
just going

33:44.823 --> 33:50.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to throw Trump to history, and
then lot of
the sense that mass revolt, this
is not legitimate,

33:50.128 --> 33:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is not legitimate, I don't
think that's
likely to happen.

33:53.398 --> 33:56.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHIELDS: Could I just a little
dissent there.

33:56.268 --> 33:58.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Sure.

33:58.136 --> 34:00.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: I think reaction is,
Judy, whether
the Republicans see themselves
as congressional

34:00.438 --> 34:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party or presidential party. If
Donald Trump
loses badly, OK, and Republicans
lose the

34:07.312 --> 34:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress, lose the Senate, lose
the House,
which is for this first week
people are talking

34:12.317 --> 34:17.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, Republicans are even
talking about
it. If that were to happen they
say, in 2018

34:17.289 --> 34:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we'll come back because the
natural sequence
of things, Republicans then
return to majority.

34:23.194 --> 34:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what Democrats went
through, 1980,
1984, 1988, the Democratic
presidential candidates

34:29.067 --> 34:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won total of 17 states in three
presidential
elections cumulatively. But they
kept the

34:35.040 --> 34:40.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress. So, insulated the
congressional
party they said just the
candidates' fault.

34:40.578 --> 34:46.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the Republicans, you know,
take a whipping
across the board, we're doing
something wrong,

34:46.184 --> 34:50.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just the presidential level
but the congressional
level, then I think you'’ll see
the soul-searching.

34:50.088 --> 34:52.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But I want to ask you
both about
what happens to the country. I
know we're

34:52.691 --> 34:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still 3 1/2 weeks away. But what
happens to
the country after this election,
David? I

34:56.361 --> 35:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean, there are people at Trump
-- Trump himself
is saying, this thing is rigged,
it could

35:02.100 --> 35:08.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be stolen. People are booing the
press. They
cheer him on when he says the
country, there's

35:08.540 --> 35:10.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a big conspiracy.

35:10.809 --> 35:14.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How do you put anything
together? I already
hear from people saying how is
the country

35:14.980 --> 35:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be put together after
this?

35:16.815 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: Yes, I will say Hillary
Clinton wins,
there are two scenarios. One,
that there's

35:20.185 --> 35:25.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
such a vicious hatred that
nothing going to
happen. But I happen to think
she was mediocre

35:25.490 --> 35:29.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary of state, but I
thought she was
an excellent senator and very
good at working

35:29.427 --> 35:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
around the aisle. McCain,
Lindsey Graham,
John Barrasso, she was good.

35:34.399 --> 35:38.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, I see possibility
whatever is happening
out there in the country, I
think there will

35:38.870 --> 35:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a -- people may check out for
a little
while because they will be so
exhausted, so

35:43.241 --> 35:47.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down, including a lot of Trump
people. That
she may have an opportunity, at
least elite

35:47.278 --> 35:52.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level to be effective in some
way if she picks
issues that sensible Republicans
can sign

35:52.884 --> 35:54.552 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on to.

35:54.586 --> 35:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're going to want to put
a window
-- or a curtain between what
just happened

35:58.056 --> 36:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what they are going forward.
So, you could
paint an optimistic scenario.
So, I'’m clinging

36:02.727 --> 36:04.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to that against all odds.

36:04.596 --> 36:10.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But Trump voters are
going to want
to listen to her, Mark, if she
were elected?

36:10.902 --> 36:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: You know, what's going
to -- I think
David's point is a good, Judy. I
don't know.

36:17.375 --> 36:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I hope so. I hope that's the
case, I think
it comes down -- I mean, Hillary
Clinton highest

36:24.382 --> 36:28.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment in public life was in the
United States
Senate. I mean, she was good at
it.

36:28.853 --> 36:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She made 130 trips to New York
on first 18
months. She went to subcommittee
meetings.

36:34.359 --> 36:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She insisted on sharing the
spotlight. She
turned down the Sunday -- I
mean, she was

36:38.496 --> 36:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really good. She recognized that
this was
a collaborative, collegial. And
you know,

36:42.901 --> 36:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we hope that that -- will be
some response
to that.

36:46.471 --> 36:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I think it comes down
to the -- it
comes down to how she does it. I
think it

36:50.608 --> 36:53.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes down to some degree how
President Obama
handles the transition.

36:53.978 --> 36:57.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Well, we are -- I
don't want to
jump in too much, but we still
have days to

36:57.715 --> 36:59.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go before this election is over.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHIELDS: Yes, we do.

37:01.753 --> 37:05.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: But we're taking about
Hillary Clinton,
another -- David, another
WikiLeaks dump this

37:05.590 --> 37:11.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week from what apparently the
Russians hacked
from the Democrats, from Hillary
Clinton's

37:11.262 --> 37:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own campaign manager, John
Podesta. Is there
anything consequential there
that we're seeing

37:16.701 --> 37:19.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in these day after day of e-mail
dumps?

37:19.571 --> 37:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: Well, I was shocked to
how boring
it was. Usually, if you'’re in
the height

37:23.808 --> 37:27.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of campaign, they are setting up
private e-mails,
ripping into so-and-so.

37:27.512 --> 37:29.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:29.314 --> 37:33.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: Exactly. There is some
stuff like
the Catholic -- lot of people
who are Catholic

37:33.084 --> 37:36.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
think there's -- become
Catholic, they don't
want to become evangelicals.
They'’re living

37:36.888 --> 37:41.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in cities so they become
Catholics. Catholics
are systematic thinkers. You
would say it's

37:41.392 --> 37:44.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like -- it'’s not like something
horrible.

37:44.195 --> 37:47.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, they're saying like
Bill de Blasio,
the mayor of New York, is kind
of annoying

37:48.032 --> 37:54.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and overbearing and Governor
Richardson from
New Mexico can be a bad guy or
sort of pain

37:54.205 --> 37:55.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the rear.

37:56.007 --> 38:01.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But by the standard of what I
expected, to
get the inside of a campaign,
it's pretty

38:01.312 --> 38:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mild. I think Clinton people
should be lot
more imaginative.

38:05.049 --> 38:06.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOODRUFF: Mark?

38:06.885 --> 38:10.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHIELDS: I think, Judy, if there
weren'’t
what'’s going on with Donald
Trump's campaign,

38:10.388 --> 38:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it would be a big story.
I think it's
hard to make the case reading
those e-mails

38:15.093 --> 38:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Hillary Clinton is a
candidate of change.
She's very much an establishment
candidate.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's a status quo candidate.

38:22.534 --> 38:29.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The open borders, open trade,
the hemisphere
would have been -- would have
sent some signals

38:29.908 --> 38:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and shock waves. But -- and
there'’s a certain
moral arrogance I think,
especially on the

38:37.182 --> 38:41.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- looking down their nose at
Catholics and
Evangelicals. I think that comes
through.

38:41.186 --> 38:47.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing about John Podesta,
ten years of
his e-mails, he's incredibly
discrete. I mean,

38:47.358 --> 38:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's one of the reasons he'd
be able to
survive, but no candidate comes
through to

38:52.263 --> 38:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote Hillary Clinton on her
inability to apologize,
it's been a problem. She has not
effectively,

38:58.770 --> 39:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believably apologized for the
e-mail, the
personal e-mail server to this
moment.

39:04.075 --> 39:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And there was a draft
that was leaked
of the speech that she might
have given where

39:08.580 --> 39:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she would have been a little bit
more direct
but she didn't give that
version. We're still

39:12.917 --> 39:14.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sorting it out.

39:14.719 --> 39:17.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROOKS: And the key point, which
is why Trump
is still in the race, it does
indeed make

39:17.689 --> 39:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her look like very pinion of the
establishment
which happens to be true. So,
there are lot

39:23.194 --> 39:27.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people who are supporting
Donald Trump
not because they like sexual
abuse but they

39:27.165 --> 39:31.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just think the country needs
some big, big
change, that she's not, they're
willing to

39:31.569 --> 39:33.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
swallow a lot, it turns out.

39:33.371 --> 39:37.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: David Brooks, Mark
Shields, we'’ll
see you next week. Thank you.

39:37.642 --> 39:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

sales have fallen

40:18.016 --> 40:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

multinational tobacco
corporations are targeting

huge new markets in the

Culturally, smoking seems to be
an accepted

41:15.940 --> 41:20.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mode of socialization, an
accepted mode of

ROSARIO: There is that vision of
holding a
cigarette and smoking with
makeup -- it seems

41:30.021 --> 41:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be something that we have to
fight against.

41:32.256 --> 41:36.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's really
hard to kick
the habit. I try to lessen it
down, cut it,

41:36.761 --> 41:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but then you always have that
urge.

41:38.563 --> 41:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: The fight against
smoking here
won a major victory four years
ago when the

41:42.533 --> 41:48.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Philippine Congress passed what
is called
the "Sin Tax Law", imposing a
tax that effectively

41:48.039 --> 41:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
doubled the price of cigarettes.

41:49.741 --> 41:52.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated):
It'’s expensive.
It'’s five pesos a stick.

41:52.977 --> 41:58.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE (translated):
The effect
on me is I'’m smoking less. It's
more expensive.

DR. ENCARNITA BLANCO-LIMPIN,
TOBACCO CONTROL
ALLIANCE PHILIPPINES: From 1990
to 2008, the

42:13.097 --> 42:21.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate of smoking in the country
has never really
gone below 30 percent. The
latest survey that

42:21.272 --> 42:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we did in the country showed
dramatic drop
in the prevalence rate of
smoking. This time,

42:27.445 --> 42:36.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is going down from above 31
percent to
25 percent. That's a big
deduction.

42:36.954 --> 42:42.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Private held
leaders say a major
reason why the sin tax law was
passed was

42:42.860 --> 42:46.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the grassroots campaign
organized by cancer
survivor Emer Roxas.

42:46.764 --> 42:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMER ROJAS, CANCER SURVIVOR: I
started smoke
can at the age of 17. And at the
age of 44,

42:55.039 --> 43:03.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I got stage 4 throat cancer, and
that was
12 years ago. They removed my
vocal cords

43:03.147 --> 43:06.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that the cancer would go
away.

43:06.651 --> 43:11.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Before cancer,
Rojas was a successful
engineer, businessman and radio
broadcaster.

43:11.155 --> 43:17.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I still
remember that
voice when he was singing.
Before, he used

43:17.261 --> 43:19.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to sing a lot whenever there was
a birthday
party.

43:19.964 --> 43:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He loves to
sing "I Left
My Heart in San Francisco."

43:23.301 --> 43:24.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROJAS: That's my favorite song.

43:24.902 --> 43:26.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, I
know.

43:26.704 --> 43:30.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Rojas says he felt
he was given
a second life, and he decided he
would commit

43:30.141 --> 43:34.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his life to making people aware
of what happened
to him because of smoking, and
his family

43:35.012 --> 43:36.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has joined him.

43:36.380 --> 43:38.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All of us
in the family,
we're volunteers.

43:38.182 --> 43:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I want to
save lives
of other people. I don'’t want
for them to

43:42.253 --> 43:44.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
experience what we experience
with Emer.

43:44.388 --> 43:49.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: With rallies,
speeches, and messaging
on radio and television, Rojas
developed the

43:49.260 --> 43:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new voice association as a
powerful advocate
against smoking, especially to
protect children.

43:55.933 --> 44:04.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIMPIN: All of the strategies of
the tobacco
companies, particularly their
advertising

44:05.009 --> 44:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strategy. They'’re all geared to
hook the
young children into starting
smoking at an

44:12.717 --> 44:18.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earlier age. And since of the
adults would
actually grow old and eventually
die. And

44:18.523 --> 44:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
therefore, they need new market.

44:20.291 --> 44:25.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The children
agree that
cigarette smoking is really bad,
right, kids?

44:25.062 --> 44:26.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Cigarette smoking is bad.

44:26.931 --> 44:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENTS: Cigarette smoking is
bad.

44:29.233 --> 44:33.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Another new law,
following examples
in other countries, requires
health warnings

44:33.471 --> 44:35.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and graphic pictures on
cigarette packaging.

44:35.773 --> 44:40.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEACHON: The graphic health
warnings have
been helpful in other countries,
and basically

44:40.745 --> 44:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to use this for the
young population,
of course, to women as well.

44:46.584 --> 44:51.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I'’ve been
to some airports
and they do sell those packs
with pictures

44:51.522 --> 44:58.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of throat cancer, your lungs are
all wrecked
up, I guess it made you think a
bit, but at

44:58.930 --> 45:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end of the day, I'’m, like,
where's my
pack of cigarettes?

45:03.000 --> 45:05.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Pictures save
lives!

45:05.903 --> 45:10.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: After months of
delay, and rallies
like this, the law requiring
graphic health

45:10.608 --> 45:15.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warnings is now in effect. But
public health
advocates say they've not yet
won the war

45:15.379 --> 45:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against tobacco. Millions of
Filipinos still
face lifelong addiction, and the
benefits

45:20.952 --> 45:24.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the sin tax and graphic
warnings won't
be clearly evident for decades.

45:24.989 --> 45:27.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: One, two,
three --

45:27.258 --> 45:29.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENTS: Do not smoke!

45:29.093 --> 45:30.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WOODRUFF: Next, the presidential
campaign
is often ripe fodder for
comedians and late

45:49.847 --> 45:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night TV. But this year, you
might say, is
a little different. The campaign
season brought

45:55.486 --> 46:01.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seth Meyers, who cut his teeth
as a head writer

My new set, it's technically
really just the

46:10.368 --> 46:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
same furniture in a different
place.

46:11.669 --> 46:13.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN, PBS NEWSHOUR: You
even brought
your own desk.

46:13.738 --> 46:20.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: My own desk, yes. When a

a show he builds a relationship
with the desk,

46:20.277 --> 46:21.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and you can't just--

46:21.579 --> 46:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROWN: Not just any desk.

46:23.247 --> 46:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: You can't be promiscuous
with the
desk. You have to be loyal to
one desk.

46:26.517 --> 46:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So yeah, we brought it down.

Seth Meyers told me, that fits

46:39.930 --> 46:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: They thought it was
totally normally
to just start walking off the

46:42.867 --> 46:45.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary was giving an answer.

46:45.269 --> 46:50.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

46:50.775 --> 46:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Biting, direct, sometimes
using raw
language -- Meyers' monologues
have become

46:56.614 --> 46:58.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
increasingly political.

46:58.382 --> 47:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

47:18.869 --> 47:22.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

focus on Trump.

47:22.339 --> 47:27.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: Well, it's really
because of what
he's doing. You know, we're not
going out

47:27.178 --> 47:32.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sort of -- we don't feel
like we're making
ad hominem attacks on him and
just every day

47:32.783 --> 47:35.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
saying, "We got to find
something on him."
You know, it's on the front page
of the paper

47:35.886 --> 47:43.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every day. You know, we do feel
pretty strongly
about everything. You know, I
feel like comedy

47:47.498 --> 47:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

days?" as opposed
to?

47:49.567 --> 47:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: Well, I think when you
go back to
Johnny Carson, I think there was
a real sense

47:53.437 --> 47:57.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you didn't really know
exactly what he
felt. And Jay Leno, you didn't
really know

47:57.608 --> 48:02.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exactly what he felt. And I
think that for
that era, those guys were making
the right

48:02.813 --> 48:04.548 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decision.

48:04.582 --> 48:09.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you know, there's so many

more by that Carson model, and
then there
are shows like mine that can --
thanks to

48:13.424 --> 48:16.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jon Stewart's "Daily Show,"
thanks to the
"Colbert Report" -- like we can
live in a

48:16.160 --> 48:19.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world now where people tune in
and they do
want to know what we're
thinking, and we've

48:19.430 --> 48:21.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
certainly taken advantage of
that this election.

48:21.465 --> 48:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What a great time to be in
Washington. The
Nationals won yesterday.

48:25.636 --> 48:26.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

48:26.637 --> 48:30.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Redskins won yesterday!

48:30.374 --> 48:31.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

48:31.375 --> 48:36.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the orange skin lost.

48:36.046 --> 48:42.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BROWN: Traditionally, to
entertain, make us
laugh, to help us end the day
to, help us

48:42.086 --> 48:43.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go to sleep.

48:43.087 --> 48:44.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MEYERS: Sure.

48:44.088 --> 48:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: OK. But that's not what
you're doing.

48:45.923 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: Yes. I mean, we want to
be informative,
and we want to talk about issues
that we care

48:49.794 --> 48:53.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about and we also think other
people care
about. But we really, I can't
stress enough,

48:53.531 --> 48:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if we can't get enough jokes in
them, we will
cut it that night -- like we
have to also

48:58.502 --> 49:00.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be entertaining.

49:00.204 --> 49:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Yes, but I watch, I see
that there's
a lot of jokes, but there's also
a lot of

49:03.574 --> 49:07.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very serious what you could call
political
analysis in it.

49:08.012 --> 49:14.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: I would say we try to
explain with
jokes and probably some analysis
comes out

49:14.785 --> 49:18.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every now and then. I don't know
if I would
take it to the bank though. You
should double

49:18.422 --> 49:21.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- you should back up everything
that you
see on our show with another
source.

49:21.992 --> 49:26.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: You're not going that
far. No "trust
everything we say."

49:26.197 --> 49:30.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: I will say we try very
hard to be
fair as far as what we present,
as far as

49:30.501 --> 49:34.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being factually correct. I'’m
sure people
-- I'’m sure there's plenty of
people who

49:34.038 --> 49:37.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
watch my show that don't think
we're fair
at all because we hold a
contrasting point

49:37.174 --> 49:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of view to what they have, and I
think that
I completely respect and they're
entitled

49:42.913 --> 49:44.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to that position.

49:44.815 --> 49:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Do you think or do you
want to influence
people in this election? You
clearly support

49:51.288 --> 49:54.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one candidate over another. At
least that's
the appearance.

49:54.758 --> 49:59.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: I think if you go back,
we have not
been particularly supportive of
Hillary Clinton.

49:59.296 --> 50:06.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How many emails does Hillary
Clinton have
that she can just miss 15,000?
Oh, no, is

50:06.537 --> 50:09.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she one of those weirdoes has
them unread
on her phone?

50:09.874 --> 50:11.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we've certainly been harder
on Donald
Trump.

50:11.809 --> 50:16.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think in comedy, support
is a particularly
funny position to have. I think
it's far more

50:16.981 --> 50:23.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it's far funnier to point out
people's
flaws as opposed to pointing out
their strengths.

50:23.821 --> 50:28.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an election where one
has so many
more flaws than the other that
it's naturally

50:28.459 --> 50:30.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
drawn our focus to that.

50:30.327 --> 50:34.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: But conversely, have you
ever felt
that you wanted to go a little
easier on Hillary

50:34.732 --> 50:38.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton because you're afraid of
pushing people
toward Trump?

50:38.369 --> 50:41.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: I don't. I really don't
think we have
that kind of influence. So, I
really haven't

50:41.839 --> 50:42.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thought about it that way.

50:42.840 --> 50:43.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: You don't think you have
that influence.

50:43.874 --> 50:45.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEYERS: I don't think we have
that influence.

50:45.776 --> 50:50.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: But what about when most
every late
night host seems to be taking
off after Trump

50:50.447 --> 50:51.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
night after night?

50:51.916 --> 50:55.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've barely
scratched
the surface of this scandal.

50:55.119 --> 50:59.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: When Jimmy Fallon served
up a more
traditional friendly late night
interview

50:59.690 --> 51:04.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Trump, sharp criticism came
from another
late night host, Samantha Bee.

51:04.128 --> 51:08.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE, LATE NIGHT HOST:
NBC tacitly
condoned a race-baiting
demagogue.

51:08.098 --> 51:13.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: Some commentators,
including "New York
Times" columnist Ross Douthat,
are critical

51:13.370 --> 51:18.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a late night "echo chamber,"
and note a
feeling by Trump supporters of,
quote, "being

51:18.776 --> 51:21.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
suffocated by the left's
cultural dominance."

51:21.211 --> 51:25.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: We try very hard not to
be an echo
chamber, and I hope people don't
take us as

51:25.115 --> 51:30.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. And I really do respect
the fact that
for some people, my show might
be frustrating

51:31.021 --> 51:36.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for them to watch based on what
they believe
in, and I respect those beliefs.
But again,

51:36.860 --> 51:40.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't want to have to try to
change my show
to something I don't believe in.

51:40.798 --> 51:45.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And again, you know, there's so
many options
for people to watch television
right now.

51:45.369 --> 51:47.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's so many places to go.

51:47.137 --> 51:50.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Take away the fact that you
might not like
any of your late night options
on a given

51:50.474 --> 51:54.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, people are I'’m sure just
going to
Netflix and watching some
documentary.

51:54.244 --> 51:55.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROWN: Or just go to sleep.

51:55.879 --> 51:59.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEYERS: That's our biggest
competition. Don't
ever think that it's not sleep.

51:59.917 --> 52:05.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BROWN: You are of course in a
ratings business.
Have you seen any impact of what
you're doing

52:05.889 --> 52:06.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in this?

52:06.890 --> 52:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEYERS: We haven't. We really
haven't.

52:08.025 --> 52:10.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BROWN: So you don't get any
pressure to tone
it down.

52:10.728 --> 52:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MEYERS: No. Again, it's hard to
say. This
is a complete hypothetical,
because we haven't

52:15.332 --> 52:20.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen anything. I mean, I would
assume that
if our ratings plummeted based
on anything

52:20.204 --> 52:26.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we were doing, the network would
politely
let me know. I can tell you up
to this point

52:26.076 --> 52:27.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they haven't. And they have my
number, and
they know where my office is.

52:27.711 --> 52:29.079 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: They know how to reach
you.

52:29.113 --> 52:30.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MEYERS: Yes.

52:30.114 --> 52:31.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Seth Meyers, thank you
very much.

52:31.615 --> 52:37.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEYERS: And thank you for having
me at the
coolest bar in Washington, D.C.

WOODRUFF: And on the "NewsHour"
online right
now: British scientists who
re-mapped the

52:47.398 --> 52:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deepest corners of the universe
now believe
there are ten times as many
galaxies as once

52:53.070 --> 52:59.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thought. You can learn more

discovery on our website:

Tonight on "Washington Week:"
the campaign
finish line is in sight, but
both candidates

53:05.783 --> 53:09.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are confronting a new week of
controversy.
The "Washington Week" panel will
try to make

53:09.720 --> 53:13.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sense of it all here on your PBS
station.

53:13.490 --> 53:19.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend
Saturday", car makers
are racing to build a
long-range, affordable

53:19.963 --> 53:23.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
electric car to compete with
Tesla's success.

53:23.467 --> 53:27.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. On
Monday, we'll take a look at the
rise of the

53:27.671 --> 53:31.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far right wing of politics in
one European
country.

53:31.408 --> 53:41.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'’m Judy Woodruff. Have a great
weekend.
Thank you and good night.

53:41.452 --> 53:49.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
