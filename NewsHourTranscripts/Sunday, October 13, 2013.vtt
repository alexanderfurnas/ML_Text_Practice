00:52.800 --> 00:54.900
AVERT A U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFAULT,

00:54.900 --> 00:56.067
AN EVENT SOME WARN COULD

00:56.067 --> 00:56.933
SERIOUSLY DAMAGE THE WORLD WHICH

00:56.933 --> 00:57.067
ECONOM

00:57.067 --> 00:59.100
THE DEADLINE TO INCREASE THE

00:59.100 --> 01:01.300
DEBT CEILING IS NOW LITTLE MOR

01:01.300 --> 01:03.833
THAN 71 HOURS AWAY

01:13.100 --> 01:14.467
DISRUPTION, THAT LACK OF

01:14.467 --> 01:17.200
CERTAINTY, THAT LACK OF TRUST IN

MEAN MASSIVE DISRUPTION TH

WORLD OVER

01:22.200 --> 01:24.367
WE WOULD BE AT RISK OF TIPPING

01:24.367 --> 01:26.733
YET AGAIN INTO RECESSION

01:26.733 --> 01:28.033
>> NEGOTIATIONS BETWEE

PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HOUS

01:29.400 --> 01:30.433
REPUBLICANS FALTERED YESTERDAY

01:30.433 --> 01:32.133
SO THE TWO SENATE LEADERS BEGA

01:32.133 --> 01:34.800
TALKS TO TRY TO END THE NO

01:34.800 --> 01:35.633
13-DAY GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN AND

DEBT CEILING

DEMONSTRATORS GATHERED T

PROTEST THE CLOSING OF THE WORLD

01:43.400 --> 01:45.800
WAR II MEMORIAL BECAUSE OF THE

01:45.800 --> 01:46.100
SHUTDOWN

01:46.100 --> 01:47.433
A NUMBER OF THEM THEN MARCHED TO

01:47.433 --> 01:47.967
THE WHITE HOUSE.

01:47.967 --> 01:49.467
THE SENATE WAS BACK IN SESSION

01:49.467 --> 01:51.167
TODAY, BUT MANY HOUSE MEMBER

01:51.167 --> 01:52.633
WENT HOME YESTERDAY.

01:52.633 --> 01:54.767
THE HOUSE IS NOT EXPECTED TO

01:54.767 --> 01:56.167
RESUME BUSINESS BEFORE TOMORRO

01:56.167 --> 01:56.333
NIGHT.

01:56.333 --> 01:58.333
FOR MORE ON WHAT COULD BE NEXT

01:58.333 --> 02:00.867
WE'RE JOINED BY OUR POLITICA

02:00.867 --> 02:01.100
EDITOR

02:01.100 --> 02:02.300
LET'S START WITH THAT PROTEST WE

02:02.300 --> 02:04.467
JUST MENTIONED A LITTLE WHIL

02:04.467 --> 02:04.967
AGO.

02:04.967 --> 02:07.267
THERE WAS A PICTURE IN "TH

02:07.267 --> 02:08.833
WASHINGTON POST.

02:08.833 --> 02:12.133
WHY IS THIS PROTEST GETTIN

02:12.133 --> 02:12.300
TRACTION

02:12.300 --> 02:14.200
>> YOU'RE SEEING A LOT O

02:14.200 --> 02:15.867
CONSERVATIVES REALLY PUSH TH

02:15.867 --> 02:17.067
IDEA THAT BLAMING PRESIDEN

02:17.067 --> 02:18.767
OBAMA FOR SHUTTING DOWN THIS

02:18.767 --> 02:21.267
OPEN-AIR MEMORIAL THAT REALL

02:21.267 --> 02:22.133
DOESN'T NECESSARILY NEED PEOPL

02:22.133 --> 02:24.200
AND STAFF TO RUN IT.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.467
IT'S SOMETHING YOU SEE TOURIST

02:25.467 --> 02:27.633
VISIT ALL THE TIME I

02:27.633 --> 02:29.000
IT'S BECOME THIS FLASH POINT O

02:29.000 --> 02:31.633
THE RIGHT SAYING THAT THEY'V

02:31.633 --> 02:33.300
BEEN BLOCKED

02:33.300 --> 02:35.933
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING TH

02:35.933 --> 02:36.933
CONSERVATIVES FLOCK TO THAT.

02:36.933 --> 02:39.033
IT'S GENERATING A LOT OF ENERG

02:39.033 --> 02:40.667
AMONG HOUSE REPUBLICANS IN

02:40.667 --> 02:41.900
PARTICULAR WHO SAY PERHAPS THOSE

02:41.900 --> 02:42.967
PICTURES, PEOPLE SEE THE CROWDS,

02:42.967 --> 02:44.200
THEY'RE GOING TO SAY, WELL

02:44.200 --> 02:45.700
MAYBE WE'RE ON THE HOUSE

02:45.700 --> 02:47.533
REPUBLICAN SIDE ON THIS ISSUE.

02:47.533 --> 02:48.200
I DON'T KNOW THAT'S ACTUALLY

02:48.200 --> 02:51.700
GOING TO MOVE THE ISSUE WHEN

02:51.700 --> 02:54.200
YOU'RE HAVING STILL A SHUT DOW

02:54.200 --> 02:54.400
GOVERNMENT

02:54.400 --> 02:55.333
IT'S STILL SOMETHING GENERATIN

02:55.333 --> 02:56.133
A LOT OF ATTENTION

02:56.133 --> 02:56.567
>> OKAY.

02:56.567 --> 02:57.733
IN REGARDS TO THE NEGOTIATIONS

02:57.733 --> 02:59.900
OR THE CONVERSATIONS, SOMEON

02:59.900 --> 03:01.200
MISSING FROM THIS IS VIC

03:01.200 --> 03:02.700
PRESIDENT BIDEN.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.933
IT WAS JUST LAST DECEMBER THAT

03:04.933 --> 03:06.567
HE WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN

03:06.567 --> 03:08.467
ORCHESTRATING A DEAL WITH MITC

03:08.467 --> 03:08.733
McCONNELL.

03:08.733 --> 03:10.400
>> ABSOLUTELY.

03:10.400 --> 03:13.367
SO VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS

03:13.367 --> 03:15.667
SENATOR, SERVED FOR DECADES,

03:15.667 --> 03:15.700
KNOWS A LOT OF THE PLAYERS I

03:15.700 --> 03:18.933
THE SENATE VERY WELL AND IS ABLE

03:18.933 --> 03:20.933
TO COME TOGETHER AND BRIDG

03:20.933 --> 03:21.033
DEALS.

03:21.033 --> 03:23.267
BUT SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE WARY OF

03:23.267 --> 03:25.400
THIS, BOTH FROM PRESIDENT OBAM

03:25.400 --> 03:27.200
AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN, WARY

03:27.200 --> 03:28.333
THAT WHATEVER DEAL ENDS UP

03:28.333 --> 03:29.367
GETTING CRAFTED IS GOING TO HAVE

03:29.367 --> 03:31.533
MORE CONCESSIONS TO REPUBLICAN

03:31.533 --> 03:32.567
THAN SHOULD HAPPEN

03:32.567 --> 03:33.667
SO THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE SEEIN

03:33.667 --> 03:34.133
THE PRESSURE

03:34.133 --> 03:35.700
YOU'RE SEEING BIDEN PUSHED OUT

03:35.700 --> 03:37.033
OF THE WAY JUST A LITTLE BIT

03:37.033 --> 03:38.833
HE'S STILL BEEN AT THE TABLE

03:38.833 --> 03:46.533
WHEN THE PRESIDENT HOSTED AL

03:46.533 --> 03:47.133
FOUR CAUCUSES OVER THE LAS

03:47.133 --> 03:47.767
WEEK

03:47.767 --> 03:49.500
BUT HE'S NOT GOING UP TO CAPITOL

03:49.500 --> 03:50.933
HILL TO HAVE THESE CLOSED DOOR

03:50.933 --> 03:53.067
NEGOTIATIONS LIKE HE DID LAS

03:53.067 --> 03:53.233
YEAR

03:53.233 --> 03:54.433
YOU'RE WONDERING, YOU KNOW

03:54.433 --> 03:55.367
MAYBE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASON

03:55.367 --> 03:57.100
WHY THEY'RE NOT COMING UP WITH A

03:57.100 --> 03:58.233
DEAL

03:58.233 --> 03:58.700
>> OKAY.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.100
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'V

04:01.100 --> 04:02.333
HEARD RAND PAUL SAY THIS MORNING

04:02.333 --> 04:04.833
ON THE SUNDAY TALK SHOWS IS THIS

04:04.833 --> 04:06.967
SEQUESTER LEVEL, SAYING, HEY, IF

04:06.967 --> 04:09.133
YOU WANT THESE CUTS, SENAT

04:09.133 --> 04:10.500
REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO

04:10.500 --> 04:14.267
VOTE ON ANY KIND OF REOPENING OF

04:14.267 --> 04:15.500
THE GOVERNMENT UNTIL THE

04:15.500 --> 04:17.033
SEQUESTER CUTS ARE BASICALLY

04:17.033 --> 04:17.767
KEPT IN PLACE.

04:17.767 --> 04:18.767
WHY IS THIS SUCH AN IMPORTAN

04:18.767 --> 04:20.233
ISSUE FOR HIM?

04:20.233 --> 04:21.333
>> WELL, THAT'S ACTUALLY

04:21.333 --> 04:22.833
IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT, THAT THE

04:22.833 --> 04:24.600
CONTINUING RESOLUTION, THE

04:24.600 --> 04:26.033
BUDGET AGREEMENTS THAT THEY HA

04:26.033 --> 04:27.367
IN PLACE THAT WOULD ONLY FUN

04:27.367 --> 04:28.600
THE GOVERNMENT, BY THE WAY

04:28.600 --> 04:31.133
THROUGH A FEW EXTRA WEEKS.

04:31.133 --> 04:33.500
IT'S NOT LIKE A LONG-TERM OR

04:33.500 --> 04:35.000
ONE-YEAR PLAN, IT DOES HAVE TH

04:35.000 --> 04:36.100
SEQUESTER CUTS IN PLACE.

04:36.100 --> 04:37.567
THESE ARE REDUCED LEVELS O

04:37.567 --> 04:38.367
FUNDING WE'VE ALREADY SEEN I

04:38.367 --> 04:40.433
PLACE FOR A YEAR, AND IT

04:40.433 --> 04:41.300
CONTINUES THOSE ALONG.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.533
WHAT RAND PAUL IS SAYING IS THAT

04:42.533 --> 04:45.800
HE WANTS TO SEE EVEN MORE CUTS

04:45.800 --> 04:47.567
AND WANTS TO ENSURE THOSE CUTS

04:47.567 --> 04:49.200
BECOME PERMANENT

04:49.200 --> 04:51.300
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT

04:51.300 --> 04:55.167
THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF TH

04:55.167 --> 04:58.433
SEQUESTER WAS IT WOULD BE SO

04:58.433 --> 05:00.000
PAINFUL IF IMPLEMENTED THAT IT

05:00.000 --> 05:00.533
WOULDN'T HAPPEN.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.133
IT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR A YEAR.

05:02.133 --> 05:03.767
>> WE ALSO HEAR A DIFFERENT DATE

05:03.767 --> 05:05.600
ON LIFTING THE DEBT CEILING.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.100
WHAT ARE THE POLITICS BEHIND IT?

05:08.100 --> 05:09.233
WHY DOES ONE SIDE WANT IT TO B

05:09.233 --> 05:11.200
AS EARLY AS THANKSGIVING AND

05:11.200 --> 05:12.533
ANOTHER SIDE SAY WHY DON'T W

05:12.533 --> 05:13.967
KEEP IT OFF UNTIL THE END OF

05:13.967 --> 05:14.400
2014

05:14.400 --> 05:15.933
>> WELL, THE MIDTERM ELECTIONS

05:15.933 --> 05:18.800
HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THAT

05:18.800 --> 05:20.133
SENATE DEMOCRATS WOULD PREFE

05:20.133 --> 05:22.033
THERE'S ONE VOTE AND THEN YO

05:22.033 --> 05:23.233
DON'T HIT THE DEBT CEILING AGAIN

05:23.233 --> 05:24.767
UNTIL AFTER THE MIDTERMS IN TH

05:24.767 --> 05:26.533
FALL OF 2014

05:26.533 --> 05:27.900
THERE ARE A LOT OF VULNERABL

05:27.900 --> 05:28.900
SENATE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE FACIN

05:28.900 --> 05:31.500
EITHER TOUGH CHALLENGES OR

05:31.500 --> 05:32.333
POSSIBLE PROBLEMS WITH THEIR

05:32.333 --> 05:33.233
RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGNS.

05:33.233 --> 05:34.700
IT'S EASIER FOR THEM TO NOT HAVE

05:34.700 --> 05:36.033
TO TAKE THIS VOTE AGAIN.

05:36.033 --> 05:37.033
I DON'T ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WH

05:37.033 --> 05:39.400
ANYONE WOULD WANT TO TAKE THIS

05:39.400 --> 05:40.300
VOTE MORE THAN ONCE OTHER THAN

05:40.300 --> 05:41.300
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE TRYING T

05:41.300 --> 05:43.900
GET SOME CONCESSIONS, BOTH SIDES

05:43.900 --> 05:45.600
ARE TRYING TO GET CONCESSION

05:45.600 --> 05:46.600
FROM THE OTHER SIDE, WHETHER

05:46.600 --> 05:48.267
THAT'S SPENDING OR TAXES OR TH

05:48.267 --> 05:48.933
PRESIDENT'S HEALTH CARE LAW.

05:48.933 --> 05:52.400
ANY OF THOSE ITEMS

05:52.400 --> 05:53.833
SO RIGHT NOW THE BIG STICKIN

05:53.833 --> 05:55.033
POINT IS DOES THIS HAPPEN IN A

05:55.033 --> 05:55.700
FEW WEEKS?

05:55.700 --> 05:56.767
DOES IT HAPPEN IN JANUARY?

05:56.767 --> 05:58.400
DOES IT HAPPEN IN A YEAR AND A

05:58.400 --> 05:58.700
MONTH?

05:58.700 --> 05:59.533
THAT REALLY MATTERS FOR TH

05:59.533 --> 06:01.000
PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE BALLOT.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.467
>> AND WHAT ABOUT FOR TOMORROW

06:03.467 --> 06:03.800
MORNING?

06:03.800 --> 06:05.033
THERE'S STILL SOME CONCERN THA

06:05.033 --> 06:07.367
THE STOCK MARKET OR FINANCIA

06:07.367 --> 06:09.267
MARKETS COULD REACT ADVERSELY TO

06:09.267 --> 06:11.767
THE LAST 24 HOURS, WHICH HAVEN'T

06:11.767 --> 06:13.467
BEEN POSITIVE.

06:13.467 --> 06:15.033
WE'VE ESSENTIALLY SEEN MEMBERS

06:15.033 --> 06:16.733
OF CONGRESS GO ON TV AND SAY THE

06:16.733 --> 06:17.633
TALKS ARE STALLED.

06:17.633 --> 06:18.833
>> YEAH, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN TH

06:18.833 --> 06:19.867
HOUSE AND THE WHITE HOUSE.

06:19.867 --> 06:21.233
RIGHT NOW SENATE DEMOCRATS ARE

06:21.233 --> 06:22.733
TAKING THE CHARGE.

06:22.733 --> 06:24.133
THEY'RE TRYING TO GET AN

06:24.133 --> 06:25.233
AGREEMENT WITH SENAT

06:25.233 --> 06:25.967
REPUBLICANS.

06:25.967 --> 06:28.800
WHAT HARRY REID HAS SAID IS HE

06:28.800 --> 06:30.100
REALLY WANTS TO KEEP THOSE

06:30.100 --> 06:31.667
CONVERSATIONS GOING AND HE'LL BE

06:31.667 --> 06:32.800
SPEAKING WITH MITCH McCONNEL

06:32.800 --> 06:34.233
RIGHT WHEN MARKETS OPEN ON

06:34.233 --> 06:34.367
MONDAY

06:34.367 --> 06:35.800
EVERYONE IS WATCHING VER

06:35.800 --> 06:35.933
CAREFULLY.

06:35.933 --> 06:38.167
THURSDAY IS COMING UP VERY

06:38.167 --> 06:38.300
RAPIDLY.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.333
THE WAY THAT PROCEDURE WORKS, IT

06:40.333 --> 06:42.200
WILL TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME

06:42.200 --> 06:43.933
FOR WHATEVER DEAL THEY COME UP

06:43.933 --> 06:45.367
WITH TO ACTUALLY PASS AND MAKE

06:45.367 --> 06:47.733
IT TO PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DESK

06:47.733 --> 06:48.933
SO THE CLOCK IS REALLY TICKING

06:48.933 --> 06:50.733
A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE VERY NERVOUS

06:50.733 --> 06:52.667
THIS COULD HAVE FAR-REACHING

06:52.667 --> 06:53.700
CONSEQUENCES ON THE ECONOMY,

06:53.700 --> 06:54.667
BOTH HERE IN THE UNITED STATES

06:54.667 --> 06:56.633
AND INTERNATIONALLY.

18:16.133 --> 18:18.467
>> WELL, I THINK THIS THIR

18:18.467 --> 18:19.500
PARTY QUESTION IS JUST ANOTHER

18:19.500 --> 18:21.533
WAY OF ASKING THE CONGRESSIONA

18:21.533 --> 18:23.433
JOB APPROVAL QUESTION RIGHT NOW.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.667
FOR A LARGE SEGMENT OF AMERICANS

18:25.667 --> 18:27.500
WHO THINK THAT THERE'S TOO MUC

18:27.500 --> 18:28.500
GRIDLOCK, THEY DON'T AGREE WIT

18:28.500 --> 18:31.933
WHAT CONGRESS IS DOING, THEY'R

18:31.933 --> 18:33.100
EXTREMELY OPEN TO ANOTHE

18:33.100 --> 18:33.733
POSSIBILITY.

18:33.733 --> 18:35.333

18:35.333 --> 18:36.300
WOULD YOU WANT A THIRD PARTY

18:36.300 --> 18:38.400
THEY'LL SAY, SURE, WE DON'T LIKE

18:38.400 --> 18:39.067
WHAT REPUBLICANS OR DEMOCRAT

18:39.067 --> 18:40.267
ARE DOING, SO LET'S LOOK FOR

18:40.267 --> 18:40.800
ANOTHER WAY BEEN

18:40.800 --> 18:43.200
>> IS THIS INDICATIVE OF WHY THE

18:43.200 --> 18:45.367
TEA PARTY'S POPULARITY HAS

18:45.367 --> 18:46.967
SUSTAINED ITSELF OVER TIME

18:46.967 --> 18:48.867
>> WELL, I THINK THE TEA PARTY

18:48.867 --> 18:51.867
IS A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANIMAL

18:51.867 --> 18:52.867
I THINK IT WOULD BE NATURAL TO

18:52.867 --> 18:55.700
SAY, WELL, THE TEA PARTY IS IN

18:55.700 --> 18:57.500
PLACE IN ORDER TO BECOME THE

18:57.500 --> 18:59.300
NEXT REAL THIRD PARTY ACROSS THE

18:59.300 --> 19:00.833
COUNTRY, BUT THE TEA PARTY HAS

19:00.833 --> 19:02.367
NEVER REALLY SHOWN A DESIRE TO

19:02.367 --> 19:03.167
BECOME THAT THIRD PARTY.

19:03.167 --> 19:05.733
I THINK IT'S MORE OF A REFOR

19:05.733 --> 19:07.300
MOVEMENT WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN

19:07.300 --> 19:07.633
PARTY.

19:07.633 --> 19:09.833
I THINK THE TEA PARTY KIND O

19:09.833 --> 19:13.567
REVELS IN ITS DECENTRALIZATION

19:13.567 --> 19:15.267
BUT IN ORDER TO BECOME, I THINK,

19:15.267 --> 19:17.267
A LEGITIMATE ELECTORAL

19:17.267 --> 19:18.133
THIRD-PARTY THREAT, YOU'D NEED

19:18.133 --> 19:20.033
TO BE MUCH MORE ORGANIZED, HAV

19:20.033 --> 19:21.033
MORE OF A CENTRAL LEADERSHIP I

19:21.033 --> 19:22.167
ORDER TO WIN, YOU KNOW, RACES UP

19:22.167 --> 19:23.533
AND DOWN THE BALLOT.

19:23.533 --> 19:25.767
>> DESPITE THE GROWING SENTIMENT

19:25.767 --> 19:28.200
FOR A THIRD PARTY, AREN'T THER

19:28.200 --> 19:30.300
HUGE STRUCTURAL OBSTACLES TO

19:30.300 --> 19:31.467
CREATING ONE

19:31.467 --> 19:32.000
>> RIGHT

19:32.000 --> 19:34.033
I THINK THERE ARE A NUMBER O

19:34.033 --> 19:34.233
ISSUES

19:34.233 --> 19:35.667
ONE ARE STRUCTURAL ISSUES FO

19:35.667 --> 19:38.133
ANY POTENTIAL THIRD PARTY.

19:38.133 --> 19:40.467
OUR SYSTEM IS, I THINK, BIASED

19:40.467 --> 19:41.867
TOWARD REPUBLICANS AND

19:41.867 --> 19:42.967
DEMOCRATS, TOWARD TWO PARTIES.

19:42.967 --> 19:45.867
IF YOU'RE A THIRD PARTY, IN MOST

19:45.867 --> 19:47.033
STATES IT IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT

19:47.033 --> 19:50.067
TO GAIN BALLOT ACCESS, JUST TO

19:50.067 --> 19:51.700
BECOME A CHOICE, IT BECOMES MORE

19:51.700 --> 19:51.933
DIFFICULT.

19:51.933 --> 19:52.967
YOU EITHER NEED MORE SIGNATURE

19:52.967 --> 19:54.967
AND YOU DON'T HAVE THAT PART

19:54.967 --> 19:56.200
INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE TO

19:56.200 --> 19:57.700
GATHER THOSE SIGNATURES.

19:57.700 --> 19:58.767
I THINK IT'S ALSO STRUCTURALLY A

19:58.767 --> 20:00.767
PROBLEM FOR A THIRD PARTY IN

20:00.767 --> 20:01.267
RAISING MONEY.

20:01.267 --> 20:03.500
YOU DON'T HAVE A NATURAL BASE TO

20:03.500 --> 20:05.367
GO TO FROM ONE PARTY OR TH

20:05.367 --> 20:05.600
OTHER.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.167
BUT I ALMOST THINK MORE THAN THE

20:07.167 --> 20:09.167
STRUCTURAL DISADVANTAGES FOR A

20:09.167 --> 20:12.067
THIRD PARTY IS AN IDEOLOGICA

20:12.067 --> 20:12.333
CHALLENGE.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.133
THAT IS, I THINK WHAT THIS

20:14.133 --> 20:15.600
QUESTION, THE OPENNESS TO

20:15.600 --> 20:18.400
THIRD PARTY SHOWS IS A

20:18.400 --> 20:19.267
DISSATISFACTION WITH REPUBLICANS

20:19.267 --> 20:20.167
AND DEMOCRATS.

20:20.167 --> 20:21.600
THESE PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THE

20:21.600 --> 20:23.033
DON'T WANT BECAUSE THEY'RE

20:23.033 --> 20:23.767
SEEING GRIDLOCK.

20:23.767 --> 20:25.167
BUT WHEN YOU START TO AS

20:25.167 --> 20:26.867
PEOPLE, OKAY, LET'S GET A THIR

20:26.867 --> 20:28.400
PARTY, WHAT ARE WE FOR

20:28.400 --> 20:30.167
THAT'S WHEN IT BECOMES MUCH MORE

20:30.167 --> 20:30.767
DIFFICULT BECAUSE PEOPLE HAV

20:30.767 --> 20:35.033
DIFFERENT IDEAS OF WHAT TH

20:35.033 --> 20:35.167
SOLUTION IS, EVEN THOUGH THE

20:35.167 --> 20:36.567
ALL DISAGREE ON THE PROBLEM.

20:36.567 --> 20:37.633
I THINK THAT WOULD BE A MAJO

20:37.633 --> 20:39.000
STRUGGLE FOR A THIRD PARTY T

20:39.000 --> 20:40.100
REALLY COME UP OUT OF THIS

20:40.100 --> 20:41.133
>> THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL

20:41.133 --> 20:43.400
SERIOUS THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES

20:43.400 --> 20:45.700
OVER THE YEARS THAN FORMER

20:45.700 --> 20:52.267
PRESIDENT THEODORE ROOSEVELT

20:52.267 --> 20:56.567
GEORGE WALLACE WON 13.5% AND WON

20:56.567 --> 20:57.367
FOUR STATES.

20:57.367 --> 20:59.900
ROSS PEROT WON NEARLY 19% OF THE

20:59.900 --> 21:02.133
VOTE IN 1992

21:02.133 --> 21:03.367
IS THERE A SERIOUS THIRD-PARTY

21:03.367 --> 21:09.467
CANDIDATE WHO COULD EMERGE B

21:09.467 --> 21:09.600
2016

21:09.600 --> 21:11.500
>> I THINK EVERY SO MANY YEARS

21:11.500 --> 21:13.267
THERE IS THAT CANDIDATE.

21:13.267 --> 21:14.500
I THINK IN ORDER TO -- IT'

21:14.500 --> 21:16.833
GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE THA

21:16.833 --> 21:19.967
THAT IN ORDER TO GET A THIRD

21:19.967 --> 21:20.967
PARTY, A MAJOR THIRD PARTY

21:20.967 --> 21:22.600
ACROSS THE COUNTRY

21:22.600 --> 21:24.067
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SENAT

21:24.067 --> 21:26.233
CANDIDATES, CANDIDATES FOR THE

21:26.233 --> 21:29.067
U.S. HOUSE IN PLACE AND READ

21:29.067 --> 21:30.133
TO, YOU KNOW, WIN SEATS.

21:30.133 --> 21:31.233
THAT'S WHERE THE ELECTORAL POWER

21:31.233 --> 21:35.300
IS GOING TO COME

21:35.300 --> 21:37.333
SO RIGHT NOW, IN MOST CASES, YOU

21:37.333 --> 21:38.567
SEE THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATES THA

21:38.567 --> 21:40.133
CAN GET A SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF

21:40.133 --> 21:41.600
THE VOTE, MAYBE IN A
