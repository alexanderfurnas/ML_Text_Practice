03:23.333 --> 03:25.467
GENETICS AND OBESITY HAS DIED.

THE CANADIAN BORN DOUGLA

COLEMAN WAS 82

03:27.500 --> 03:30.200
HE DISCOVERED THAT A BLOOD-BOR

03:30.200 --> 03:31.800
SUBSTANCE COULD CURB HUNGER.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.200
THAT DISCOVERY HELPED A TEAM I

03:35.200 --> 03:35.867
ROCKEFELLER UNIVERSITY WORKING

03:35.867 --> 03:38.967
IN THE 1990s IDENTIFIED GENE

LEPTI NAH SENDS SIGNALS TO THE

03:41.000 --> 03:43.533
BRAIN THAT CONTROLS APPETITE

03:43.533 --> 03:45.867
SOME WHO ARE OBESE HAVE PLENTY

03:45.867 --> 03:49.500
OF LEPTIN BUT THEIR BOIES AR

03:49.500 --> 03:51.933
SOMEHOW RESISTANT TO IT.

03:51.933 --> 03:55.800
ANOTHER PIECE OF TITANIC

03:55.800 --> 03:55.933
MEMORABILIA HAS SOLD FOR A LARGE

03:55.933 --> 03:56.733
SUM OF MONEY

03:56.733 --> 03:58.367
A LETTER WRITTEN BY A PASSENGE

03:58.367 --> 04:01.533
ESTHER HART TO HER FAMILY IN

ENGLAND WENT FOR $200,000 TODA

04:02.300 --> 04:03.400
DURING AN AUCTION IN LONDON.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.867
IN THE LONDON SHE RELATES HO

04:05.867 --> 04:08.533
THE SAILORS ABOARD THE SHI

04:08.533 --> 04:09.833
DESCRIBED WHAT THEY CALLED THE

04:09.833 --> 04:11.667
WONDERFUL PASSAGE UP TILL NOW.

04:11.667 --> 04:14.900
HOURS LATER, THE SHIP STRUCK A

04:14.900 --> 04:15.633
ICEBERG AND SANK

04:15.633 --> 04:17.100
HART AND HER DAUGHTER WERE AMONG

04:17.100 --> 04:19.300
SOME OF THE 700 SURVIVORS BU

04:19.300 --> 04:20.900
HER HUSBAND DIED ALONG WITH MORE

04:20.900 --> 04:35.800
THAN 1,500 OTHERS.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.733
>>> LAST NIGHT ON "THE NEW

04:37.733 --> 04:39.600
HOUR" YOU HEARD HOW THE NE

04:39.600 --> 04:41.967
SANCTIONS PLANNED AGAINST RUSSIA

04:41.967 --> 04:44.800
WOULD AFFECT THE ECONOMY THERE

04:44.800 --> 04:45.567
BUT THAT MIGHT COME TO AT A COST

04:45.567 --> 04:47.200
TO SOME OF THEIR BUSINES

04:47.200 --> 04:48.300
PARTNERS IN THE WEST, MOST O

04:48.300 --> 04:48.933
ALL GERMANY.

04:48.933 --> 04:51.267
WE'RE JOINED TONIGHT I

04:51.267 --> 04:52.433
WASHINGTON BY THE EXECUTIV

04:52.433 --> 04:53.833
DIRECTOR OF THE TRANSATLANTI

04:53.833 --> 04:53.967
ACADEMY.

04:53.967 --> 04:55.800
AND STEVEN, IT'S CLEAR THAT TH

04:55.800 --> 04:57.667
STAKES ARE HIGHER IN EUROP

04:57.667 --> 04:58.467
RATHER THAN THE UNITED STATE

04:58.467 --> 04:59.867
WHEN IT COMES TO THE SITUATION

04:59.867 --> 05:02.200
WITH RUSSIA, BUT JUST FO

05:02.200 --> 05:03.667
CONTEXT, CAN YOU TELL US WHA

05:03.667 --> 05:05.100
ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

05:05.100 --> 05:07.467
ECONOMIC TIES BETWEEN EUROPE AND

05:07.467 --> 05:07.767
RUSSIA

05:07.767 --> 05:09.067
AND MOST SPECIFICALLY GERMAN

05:09.067 --> 05:11.200
BECAUSE OF ITS POSITION AS A

05:11.200 --> 05:12.500
POWER PLAYER

05:12.500 --> 05:13.200
>> YES

05:13.200 --> 05:14.800
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, WITH THE

05:14.800 --> 05:16.333
GERMAN CASE, ENERGY IS A VER

05:16.333 --> 05:17.267
BIG FACTOR

05:17.267 --> 05:19.200
THEY GETN'T ABOUT A THIRD OF

05:19.200 --> 05:20.333
THEIR ENERGY FROM RUSSIA, BOTH

05:20.333 --> 05:21.200
GAS AND OIL.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.767
THAT'S A MAJOR PLAYER.

05:22.767 --> 05:24.300
ALSO, THE GERMAN ENERG

05:24.300 --> 05:26.933
COMPANIES ARE VERY CLOSELY

05:26.933 --> 05:28.200
LINKED IN WITH OTHER RUSSIAN

05:28.200 --> 05:28.400
COMPANIES.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.467
SO THERE'S A REALLY CLOS

05:32.467 --> 05:32.967
INTERLOCKING BETWEEN THESE TWO

05:32.967 --> 05:34.200
SECONDLY, THEY SELL A LOT OF

05:34.200 --> 05:35.533
AUTOMOBILES AND MANUFACTURING TO

05:35.533 --> 05:37.567
RUSSIA, ENGINEERING IS A BIG

05:37.567 --> 05:37.767
THING.

05:37.767 --> 05:39.100
I THINK UP WITH OF THE MOS

05:39.100 --> 05:41.767
INTERESTING FACTS I'VE SEE

05:41.767 --> 05:45.567
RECENTLY IS THE HEAD OF SEIMAN

05:45.567 --> 05:46.933
WENT TO MOSCOW THE WEEK AFTE

05:46.933 --> 05:48.867
THE ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA AND MET

05:48.867 --> 05:51.067
WITH PUTIN AND ASSURED THEM THAT

05:51.067 --> 05:52.567
THEY WOULD CONTINUE A LONG-TER

05:52.567 --> 05:53.200
RELATIONSHIP WITH RUSSIA

05:53.200 --> 05:54.733
THAT WAS A SIGNAL TO ME TH

05:54.733 --> 05:55.733
GERMAN BUSINESS COMMUNITY IS

05:55.733 --> 05:57.100
CLEARLY CONCERNED ABOU

05:57.100 --> 05:58.167
MAINTAINING ITS INVESTMENTS AN

05:58.167 --> 05:59.100
EVEN BROADENING THEM IN TH

05:59.100 --> 06:00.633
FUTURE

06:00.633 --> 06:03.400
>> ON THE FRONT PAGES OF THE NEW

06:03.400 --> 06:03.900
YORK TIMES THERE'S AN ARTICL

06:03.900 --> 06:05.567
THAT DETAILS JUST HOW CONCERNE

06:05.567 --> 06:06.500
THE EUROPEAN BUSINESS COMMUNIT

06:06.500 --> 06:08.567
IS ABOUT THESE SANCTIONS

06:08.567 --> 06:10.633
WHAT IS IT THAT THE EUROPEAN

06:10.633 --> 06:11.200
BUSINESS COMMUNITY WANTS AND

06:11.200 --> 06:13.833
WHAT DOESN'T IT WANT

06:13.833 --> 06:15.967
>> I THINK IT CAN LIVE -- IT'S

06:15.967 --> 06:17.433
GOING TO HAVE TO LIVE WITH SOM

06:17.433 --> 06:19.333
MODIFIED OR AT LEAST TARGETE

06:19.333 --> 06:24.667
ZANGS, BUT NOT MAJOR SECTORA

06:24.667 --> 06:25.800
SANCTIONS ON SECTORS LIKE ENERGY

06:25.800 --> 06:26.467
OR FINANCE

06:26.467 --> 06:27.733
IT'S NOT JUST GERMANY.

06:27.733 --> 06:28.800
THERE'S A LOT OF RUSSIAN MONEY

06:28.800 --> 06:30.667
IN LONDON, FOR EXAMPLE

06:30.667 --> 06:32.700
THE ITALIANS HAVE A LOT OF

06:32.700 --> 06:33.667
ENERGY CONNECTIONS WITH TH

06:33.667 --> 06:34.067
RUSSIANS

06:34.067 --> 06:36.067
SO IT GOES WAY BEYOND THAT

06:36.067 --> 06:38.733
AND I THINK THAT'S THE CONCERN

06:38.733 --> 06:39.300
THAT THEY HAVE

06:39.300 --> 06:44.100
WHAT THEY'RE LOBBYING FOR NOW IS

06:44.100 --> 06:47.067
TO STAY COOL

06:47.067 --> 06:48.167
THAT'S WHAT COMPANIES ARE SAYING

06:48.167 --> 06:49.400
TO OBAMA

06:49.400 --> 06:50.900
DON'T MAKE THIS BIGGER THAN IT

06:50.900 --> 06:52.033
HAS TO BE.

06:52.033 --> 06:53.567
LET'S TRY NOT TO DO ANY LONG

06:53.567 --> 06:55.933
TERM DAMAGE TO OUR ECONOMI

06:55.933 --> 06:56.533
RELATIONSHIP, AND MOST

06:56.533 --> 06:57.433
IMPORTANTLY, WE'RE JUST COMING

06:57.433 --> 06:59.333
OUT OF AN ECONOMIC CRISIS, DON'T

06:59.333 --> 07:01.233
PULL US BACK INTO ANOTHER ONE BY

07:01.233 --> 07:01.333
A NEW FINANCIAL CRISIS WIT

07:01.333 --> 07:03.900
RUSSIA

07:03.900 --> 07:05.967
>> CHANCELLOR MERKEL WILL BE A

07:05.967 --> 07:06.933
THE WHITE HOUSE ON FRIDAY.

07:06.933 --> 07:09.233
LAST TIME SHE WAS IN THE STATES,

07:09.233 --> 07:11.500
THERE WAS A STATE DINNER IN HE

07:11.500 --> 07:11.733
HONOR.

07:11.733 --> 07:13.533
NOW SHE'S COMING AFTER IT WA

07:13.533 --> 07:16.800
REVEALED THE NSA HAS BEE

07:16.800 --> 07:17.100
WIRETAPPING HER PHONE.

07:17.100 --> 07:18.633
WHAT'S THE CONVERSATION GOING TO

07:18.633 --> 07:19.367
BE LIKE?

07:19.367 --> 07:20.467
DHA WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE FIRST

07:20.467 --> 07:21.933
THING ON THE AGENDA AND WHAT'S

07:21.933 --> 07:22.333
GOING TO BE THE SECOND THING O

07:22.333 --> 07:27.467
THE AGENDA

07:27.467 --> 07:28.233
>> IF IT'S MERKEL, SHE

07:28.233 --> 07:31.567
DEFINITELY WANTS TO GET THE NS

07:31.567 --> 07:33.967
THING BEHIND THEM AND SHE'LL

07:33.967 --> 07:35.267
PRESS ON THAT A LOT.

07:35.267 --> 07:36.367
BUT THIS BIG TRANSATLANTIC TRADE

07:36.367 --> 07:37.400
AGREEMENT IS STALLING RIGHT NO

07:37.400 --> 07:39.433
IN THE CONGRESS AND THE EU

07:39.433 --> 07:41.500
SHE'S CERTAINLY GOING TO WANT TO

07:41.500 --> 07:42.467
PUSH ON THAT

07:42.467 --> 07:45.000
OBAMA WANTS TO GET SOME SENS

07:45.000 --> 07:47.100
FROM HER ON HOW FAR RUSSIA WIL

07:47.100 --> 07:48.333
GO ON RUSSIAN POLICIES AND

07:48.333 --> 07:48.600
SANCTIONS.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.033
HE KNOWS WITHOUT GERMANY BEING

07:50.033 --> 07:51.200
CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE

07:51.200 --> 07:52.333
AMERICAN POSITION, THE U.S. WILL

07:52.333 --> 07:53.533
BE ISOLATED AND THE POLICY WIL

07:53.533 --> 08:01.667
BE PRETTY INEFFECTIVE.

08:01.667 --> 08:03.300
>> MERKEL HAS A RELATIONSHIP

08:03.300 --> 08:04.633
WITH PUTIN AND OBAMA

08:04.633 --> 08:06.300
HOW DOES HER RELATIONSHIP WITH

08:06.300 --> 08:06.567
EACH MAN AFFECT THEI

08:06.567 --> 08:10.367
RELATIONSHIP WITH EACH OTHER

08:10.367 --> 08:13.167
>> THAT'S A GOOD POINT

08:13.167 --> 08:14.367
IT SEEMS TO ME HAS A VERY BA

08:14.367 --> 08:15.333
RELATIONSHIP WITH PUTIN.

08:15.333 --> 08:17.033
SHE DOESN'T LIKE HIM AT ALL.

08:17.033 --> 08:19.533
SHE THINKS HE'S OVERLY MACHO AND

08:19.533 --> 08:21.500
KIND OF RIDICULOUS IN SOME WAYS.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.133
SHE HAD A FAMOUS STATEMENT WHE

08:23.133 --> 08:24.800
SHE WAS TALKING TO OBAMA ABOUT

08:24.800 --> 08:26.400
PUTIN SAYING HE LIVES IN ANOTHER

08:26.400 --> 08:26.667
WORLD.

08:26.667 --> 08:27.300
AT THE SAME TIME, HE

08:27.300 --> 08:28.967
RELATIONSHIP WITH OBAMA IS NOT

08:28.967 --> 08:31.467
VERY GOOD.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.567
SHE GOT INCENSED OVER TH

08:32.567 --> 08:33.767
BUGGING OF HER PHONE AND LET

08:33.767 --> 08:35.533
OBAMA KNOW IT.

08:35.533 --> 08:36.700
AT THE SAME TIME, SHE'S

08:36.700 --> 08:37.833
PRACTICAL BUSINESS-LIK

08:37.833 --> 08:38.633
POLITICIAN, VERY REALISTIC AND

08:38.633 --> 08:41.400
SHE KNOWS SHE CAN'T LET HE

08:41.400 --> 08:41.833
PERSONAL EMOTIONS GET TO

08:41.833 --> 08:42.400
INVOLVED IN THESE BIGGER

08:42.400 --> 08:45.067
INTERSTATE RELATIONSHIPS

08:45.067 --> 08:48.300
SO I WOULD SEE NEM HAVING A VERY

08:48.300 --> 08:50.533
BUSINESS LIKE RELATIONSHIP

08:50.533 --> 08:53.100
THEY ALSO RESPECT EACH OTHER A

08:53.100 --> 08:54.167
VERY SMART, REALISTI

08:54.167 --> 08:54.833
POLITICIANS.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.733
I THINK OBAMA REALLY DEPENDS O

08:57.733 --> 09:00.867
MERKEL RIGHT NOW FOR ADVICE ON

09:00.867 --> 09:01.133
RUSSIA

09:01.133 --> 09:03.833
SHE'S SPENDING SO MUCH TIM

09:03.833 --> 09:04.767
TALKING TO PUTIN AND THE

09:04.767 --> 09:05.200
RUSSIANS

09:05.200 --> 09:06.267
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOU

09:06.267 --> 09:07.567

09:07.567 --> 09:29.333

AN UNPRECEDENTED SCALE

11:23.333 --> 11:25.833

LIVE VERSION OF GOOGLE EARTH

11:28.100 --> 11:30.233
WITH A FULL TIVO CAPABILITY.

THEY OCCURRED.

11:36.800 --> 11:40.467

OF THE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS, THE

11:41.800 --> 11:42.967
COMPANY THAT RAN THE TEST IN

11:42.967 --> 11:44.533
COMPTON.

11:44.533 --> 11:46.933
McNUTT DEVELOPED A SIMILAR

11:46.933 --> 11:48.200
SYSTEM IN THE AIR FORCE THAT WAS

11:48.200 --> 11:50.267
USED IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN

11:50.267 --> 11:51.933
>> IT WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF THE

11:51.933 --> 11:53.367
IED PROBLEM, AND OUR OBJECTIVE

11:53.367 --> 11:55.267
WAS TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW THE

11:55.267 --> 11:56.767
BOMBERS FROM WHERE THE BOMB WENT

11:56.767 --> 11:58.500
OFF BACK TO THE HOUSE THAT THE

11:58.500 --> 12:00.167
WERE BUILDING THE BOMBS AND BE

12:00.167 --> 12:01.867
ABLE TO USE THAT

12:01.867 --> 12:03.000
TOWARDS THE END OF THE TIME WHEN

12:03.000 --> 12:05.433
THE SYSTEM WAS DEPLOYED, W

12:05.433 --> 12:07.400
LOOKED AT IT AND SAID HEY,

12:07.400 --> 12:09.100
THERE'S SOME REAL LA

12:09.100 --> 12:10.367
ENFORCEMENT APPLICATION TO THIS.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.633
>> McNUTT REDESIGNED THE

12:12.633 --> 12:14.733
ORIGINAL SYSTEM TO MAKE IT MOR

12:14.733 --> 12:16.700
AFFORDABLE FOR LOCAL LAW

12:16.967 --> 12:18.500
HE TESTED IN PHILADELPHIA,

12:18.500 --> 12:20.067
BALTIMORE AND DAYTON WHERE H

12:20.067 --> 12:21.933
SAID IT PROVIDED POLICE WITH

12:21.933 --> 12:23.867
USEFUL LEADS ON SHOOTINGS, ARMED

12:23.867 --> 12:27.133
ROBBERIES AND NARCOTICS CASES.

12:27.133 --> 12:28.700
THE L.A. COUNTY SHERIF

12:28.700 --> 12:30.400
DEPARTMENT CHOSE COMPTON AS

12:30.400 --> 12:36.700
TEST SITE BECAUSE IT'S A COMPACT

12:36.700 --> 12:39.267
CITY WITH A HIGH CRIME RATE.

12:39.267 --> 12:39.933
>> ANYWHERE WITHIN THAT WHOL

12:39.933 --> 12:42.400
AREA, WE CAN ZOOM DOWN LIVE OR

12:42.400 --> 12:44.800
AFTER THE FACT TO RESOLUTION

12:44.800 --> 12:47.000
JUST BARELY TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW

12:47.000 --> 12:47.667
PEOPLE

12:47.667 --> 12:49.267
>> MY FIRST INITIAL THOUGHT WA

12:49.267 --> 12:52.367
OH, BIG BROTHER.

12:52.367 --> 12:54.167
BUT IF IT WAS SURVEILLANCE, YO

12:54.167 --> 12:55.833
WOULD HAVE A ABILITY TO SOLVE

12:55.833 --> 12:57.133
LOT OF THE UNSOLVABLE CRIMES

12:57.133 --> 12:59.700
WITH NO WITNESSES, N

12:59.700 --> 13:00.900
VIDEOTAPES, NO FINGERPRINTS.

13:00.900 --> 13:03.100
>> FROM A MOBILE COMMAND CENTER,

13:03.100 --> 13:05.767
McNUTT MONITORS 911 CALLS LIKE

13:05.767 --> 13:07.333
THE ROBBERY CALL YOU HEARD

13:07.333 --> 13:08.033
EARLIER.

13:08.033 --> 13:09.767
>> THERE HAD BEEN A RASH O

13:09.767 --> 13:10.967
CRIMES IN COMPTON WITH PEOPL

13:10.967 --> 13:12.500
GETTING NECKLACES SNATCHED

13:12.500 --> 13:13.733
SO THE L.A.'S SHERIFF DEPARTMENT

13:13.733 --> 13:16.667
ASKED US TO INVESTIGATE THIS

13:16.667 --> 13:19.967
>> THIS IS WHERE THE ROBBERY

13:19.967 --> 13:20.300
OCCURRED

13:20.300 --> 13:22.033
JUST WALKING DOWN THE STREET

13:22.033 --> 13:23.600
SHE THINK HEADQUARTERS HE'S

13:23.600 --> 13:24.333
REGULAR PEDESTRIAN

13:24.333 --> 13:25.367
DOESN'T NOTICE ANYTHING ABOU

13:25.367 --> 13:25.633
HIM.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.600
GRABS THE NECKLACE OFF OF HE

13:27.600 --> 13:29.100
NECK, RUNS DOWN THE STREET

13:29.100 --> 13:30.967
>> WE WENT TO THE ADDRESS AND WE

13:30.967 --> 13:32.567
WATCHED IT

13:32.567 --> 13:33.700
AND WHAT WE SAW WAS SOMEBODY

13:33.700 --> 13:36.833
GETTING OUT OF A CAR HERE, AND

13:36.833 --> 13:39.267
THEN THE PERSON WALKS DOWN THE

13:39.267 --> 13:41.900
STREET HERE WHILE THE CA

13:41.900 --> 13:43.267
CIRCLES AROUND TO THE OTHER SIDE

13:43.267 --> 13:43.667
OF THE BLOCK

13:43.667 --> 13:46.433
WHAT YOU HAVE IS A PERSO

13:46.433 --> 13:47.300
WALKING DOWN THE ROAD THERE AN

13:47.300 --> 13:48.267
JUST A MOMENT HERE IS WHERE TH

13:48.267 --> 13:50.367
NECKLACE IS STOLEN RIGHT THERE

13:50.367 --> 13:51.933
AND THEN THE PERSON IS GOING T

13:51.933 --> 13:53.900
RUN OFF QUICKLY TO GET BACK INTO

13:53.900 --> 13:56.233
THE CAR THAT'S DRIVEN AROUND THE

13:56.233 --> 13:56.400
BLOCK.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.100
AND THEN WE CAN FOLLOW THA

13:58.100 --> 13:58.700
PERSON OFF

13:58.700 --> 14:00.800
>> THE SYSTEM DOESN'T HAVE THE

14:00.800 --> 14:02.767
RESOLUTION TO IDENTIFY LICENSE

14:02.767 --> 14:03.500
PLATE OR PEOPLE.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.000
A PERSON IS JUST A PIXEL

14:06.000 --> 14:07.367
ANALYSTS TRACK THE CAR AND REL

14:07.367 --> 14:09.933
ON CAMERAS AT TRAFFIC LIGHTS O

14:09.933 --> 14:11.600
GAS STATIONS TO CAPTURE

14:11.600 --> 14:12.633
CLOSEUP IMAGE.

14:12.633 --> 14:14.733
IN THIS CASE, THE SUSPECTS

14:14.733 --> 14:16.867
EVENTUALLY DROVE OUT OF CAMERA

14:16.867 --> 14:18.200
RANGE WITHOUT BEING IDENTIFIED

14:18.200 --> 14:19.567
BUT THE EXPERIMENT STILL GAV

14:19.567 --> 14:21.600
POLICE SOME VALUABLE LEADS

14:21.600 --> 14:23.767
>> NOW, WE KNOW THAT THAT CA

14:23.767 --> 14:24.600
WAS INVOLVED

14:24.600 --> 14:26.233
SO THAT WAY OUR DEPUTIES CAN

14:26.233 --> 14:27.900
START MONITORING THOSE STREETS

14:27.900 --> 14:31.600
MAYBE THEY WILL SEE THAT CAR

14:31.600 --> 14:33.267
WITH THE TWO BAD GUYS IN THERE

14:33.267 --> 14:34.867
AND MAYBE WE CAN STOP THEM AND

14:34.867 --> 14:35.667
ARREST HMM THEM.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.000
>> SO FAR, NO POLICE DEPARTMEN

14:37.000 --> 14:39.433
HAS PURCHASED THE SYSTEM WHICH

14:39.433 --> 14:42.300
McNUTT SAYS COST UNDER $

14:42.300 --> 14:44.433
MILLION, LESS THAN ONE POLIC

14:44.433 --> 14:44.800
HELICOPTER

14:44.800 --> 14:45.967
BUT THE TECHNOLOGY DOESN'T

14:45.967 --> 14:47.033
PROVIDE THE KIND OF DETAILED

14:47.033 --> 14:48.100
IMAGES THAT WOULD HOLD UP IN

14:48.100 --> 14:49.533
COURT.

14:49.533 --> 14:50.867
>> IT WAS A GREAT EXPERIMENT

14:50.867 --> 14:53.500
BUT IN THE END, THE RESOLUTION

14:53.500 --> 14:54.833
WASN'T ENOUGH FOR US TO USE IT

14:54.833 --> 14:57.167
HERE ON A DAY TO DAY BASIS

14:57.167 --> 14:58.933
>> WHILE SOME OFFICERS SAY THE

14:58.933 --> 15:01.433
RESOLUTION ISN'T SHARP ENOUGH,

15:01.433 --> 15:02.700
PRIVACY ADVOCATES WORRY THAT

15:02.700 --> 15:04.067
WIDE AREA SURVEILLANCE I

15:04.067 --> 15:05.900
ALREADY TOO POWERFUL

15:05.900 --> 15:07.433

15:07.433 --> 15:10.100
I THINK IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE O

15:10.100 --> 15:12.600
TECHNOLOGY ADVANCING AND

15:12.600 --> 15:13.900
COMPLETELY OUTPACING THE

15:22.600 --> 15:24.367

15:24.367 --> 15:26.167
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS LEGAL,

15:26.167 --> 15:28.067
THEY WILL SAY WELL, WE HAVE NO

15:28.067 --> 15:30.033
EXPECTATION OF PRIVACY I

15:30.033 --> 15:32.400
PUBLIC, BUT THE ABILITY TO

15:32.400 --> 15:34.900
BACKTRACK THROUGH TIME, TO MAP A

15:34.900 --> 15:37.433
CAR GOING FROM ONE LOCATION TO

15:37.433 --> 15:40.233
ANOTHER IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

15:40.233 --> 15:42.000
WITH SURVEILLANCE CAMERA THA

15:42.000 --> 15:44.367
CAN CAPTURE 2K5 SQUARE MILES

15:44.367 --> 15:46.600
IT'S CAPTURING A LOT OF PEOPLE'S

15:46.600 --> 15:48.667
ACTIVITIES WHO AREN'T DOIN

15:48.667 --> 15:49.433
ANYTHING WRONG, WHO ARE INNOCENT

15:49.433 --> 15:49.533
CITIZENS

15:49.533 --> 15:50.800
AND THAT'S A PROBLEM

WHAT DO THEY ALLEGE THES

18:26.867 --> 18:27.467
COMPANIES DID.

18:27.467 --> 18:29.533
DID ONE CEO CALL UP ANOTHER AN

18:29.533 --> 18:30.667
SAY DON'T HIRE MY GUY?

>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 64,00

18:32.533 --> 18:33.967
PEOPLE WHO JOINED THE CLASS IN

18:33.967 --> 18:34.567
THIS LAWSUIT

18:34.567 --> 18:35.667
IT WAS THE COMPANIES THAT YO

18:35.667 --> 18:35.867
MENTIONED.

18:35.867 --> 18:38.267
AND WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I

18:38.267 --> 18:39.233
ESSENTIALLY AN UNWRITTEN

18:39.233 --> 18:42.033
AGREEMENT, KIND OF A QUIET

18:42.033 --> 18:44.000
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN STEVE JOBS

18:44.000 --> 18:46.867
AND ERIC SCHMIDT WHEN HE WAS CEO

18:46.867 --> 18:48.433
OF GOOGLE AND THE CEO OF INTEL

18:48.433 --> 18:49.700
AND SOME OF THE OTHERS

18:49.700 --> 18:50.533
ENGINEERS ARE ESSENTIALLY TH

18:50.533 --> 18:51.333
KEY PEOPLE IN A LOT OF THESE

18:51.333 --> 18:52.467
THINGS

18:52.467 --> 18:55.000
AND, YOU KNOW, JOB COMPETITION

18:55.000 --> 18:55.867
IS VERY FIERCE

18:55.867 --> 18:57.200
AND SO THERE WAS SOME,

18:57.200 --> 18:58.700
ESPECIALLY COLORFUL E-MAILS THAT

18:58.700 --> 19:01.200
HAVE EMERGED AS EVIDENCE IN TH

19:01.200 --> 19:01.400
TRIAL.

19:01.400 --> 19:03.300
AND I THINK THE COMPANIES DIDN'T

19:03.300 --> 19:04.933
WANT TO SEE THOSE E-MAIL

19:04.933 --> 19:05.400
EXPOSED.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.000
THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED BUT THERE

19:07.000 --> 19:08.167
WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE,

19:08.167 --> 19:10.133
THINK, INFORMATION, A LOT MORE

19:10.133 --> 19:11.067
DISCLOSURE THAT WOULD HAVE BEE

19:11.067 --> 19:12.233
JUST AS COLORFUL

19:12.233 --> 19:14.267
>> IS THAT WHY THIS IS SETTLED

19:14.267 --> 19:15.200
>> I THINK SO.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.400
I THINK THIS IS BEING DESCRIBE

19:16.400 --> 19:18.333
AS KIND OF A BARGAIN

19:18.333 --> 19:20.567
THE PLAINTIFFS WERE SEEKING $3

19:20.567 --> 19:20.933
BILLION.

19:20.933 --> 19:22.567
HAD THEY PREVAILED, IT WOULD

19:22.567 --> 19:26.000
HAVE ALLOWED DAMAGES, $9

19:26.000 --> 19:26.133
BILLION.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.567
MONEY THEY CAN AFFORD.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.400
THEY COLLECTIVELY HAVE MORE THAN

19:29.400 --> 19:30.867
$200 BILLION OF CASH ON THEI

19:30.867 --> 19:32.600
BALANCE SHEETS BUT YOU DON'T T

19:32.600 --> 19:34.100
HAVE TO PAY THAT KIND OF MONEY

19:34.100 --> 19:35.167
BUT I WAS SURPRISED BY THE

19:35.167 --> 19:35.367
AMOUNT

19:35.367 --> 19:37.600
IT ACTUALLY WORKED OUT TO JUST A

19:37.600 --> 19:40.467
FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS PER

19:40.467 --> 19:40.733
EMPLOYEE

19:40.733 --> 19:43.200
THE EMPLOYEES WILL TAKE A CUT OF

19:43.200 --> 19:44.667
ABOUT $9 MILLION FOR THEIR

19:44.667 --> 19:45.033
EXPENSES

19:45.033 --> 19:46.167
AND THE LEAD PLAINTIFFS WILL

19:46.167 --> 19:47.300
PROBABLY GET BACK LARGER

19:47.300 --> 19:48.667
PAYMENT, BUT MOST OF THE PEOPL

19:48.667 --> 19:51.100
WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE CLASS

19:51.100 --> 19:51.500
$3,000

19:51.500 --> 19:53.633
>> ISN'T IT KIND OF TH

19:53.633 --> 19:54.133
PRINCIPLE OF THE THING

19:54.133 --> 19:55.900
IS YOU HAVE VERY, VERY TALENTE

19:55.900 --> 19:57.133
PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE PAID FOR

19:57.133 --> 19:57.900
THEIR TALENT

19:57.900 --> 19:59.833
AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT THESE

19:59.833 --> 20:00.867
COMPANIES DID WAS WE'RE NO

20:00.867 --> 20:02.333
GOING TO NECESSARILY PAY YOU FOR

20:02.333 --> 20:02.400
ALL YOUR TALENT.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.167
>> EXACTLY

20:04.167 --> 20:05.500
THESE COMPANIES ARE ALWAYS FIRST

20:05.500 --> 20:08.200
TO TALK ABOUT HOW QUICKLY, YOU

20:08.200 --> 20:10.467
KNOW, THEY WANT TO WORK IN A

20:10.467 --> 20:12.233
UNFETTERED MARKETPLACE AND NOT

20:12.233 --> 20:13.700
HAVE ANY EXTRA REGULATIO

20:13.700 --> 20:14.533
HOLDING THEM DOWN.

20:14.533 --> 20:16.733
AND YET THROUGH THIS KIND OF -

20:16.733 --> 20:18.833
THE EVIDENCE THAT'S BEEN SHOWN

20:18.833 --> 20:25.333
SO FAR HAS SHOWN THEY COLLUDED

20:25.333 --> 20:25.733
TO NOT EXTEND THAT TO THEI

20:25.733 --> 20:31.433
EMPLOYEES.

20:31.433 --> 20:32.200
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BROUGHT

20:32.200 --> 20:33.900
THIS TO LIGHT IN 2009.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.100
AND THEY SETTLED IN 2010

20:36.100 --> 20:37.767
SO THESE COMPANIES HAVE BEEN

20:37.767 --> 20:39.333
OPERATING UNDER SORT OF A -- I

20:39.333 --> 20:42.100
WOULDN'T CALL IT A CONSENT

20:42.100 --> 20:44.667
DECREE, BUT IT'S WITHOUT ANY

20:44.667 --> 20:46.700
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

20:46.700 --> 20:51.000
IT EXPIRES IN 2015

20:51.000 --> 20:52.867
THERE MAY BE HIGHER WAEJS.

20:52.867 --> 20:55.567
IT'S MUCH MORE FREE WORK PLACE

20:55.567 --> 21:00.367
MOOD BETWEEN WORK PLACE.

21:00.367 --> 21:00.967
>> THIS COMES AN AN INTERESTIN

21:00.967 --> 21:01.233
TIME

21:01.233 --> 21:05.033
WE HEARD ABOUT THE PROTESTS IN

SILICON VALLEY NEEDS TO LOSE THE

21:20.367 --> 21:21.967
ARROGANCE OR RISK DESTRUCTION.

21:21.967 --> 21:24.467
OVERSTATED OR IS IT REALLY A

21:24.467 --> 21:24.833
PROBLEM?

21:24.833 --> 21:27.467
>> THERE IS A SOCIAL MOMEN

21:27.467 --> 21:30.000
THERE IS A BIG POLITICAL MOMENT.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.033
SENSITIIIES ARE HIGH AND IT'

21:32.033 --> 21:33.200
ANOTHER REASON WHY THESE

21:33.200 --> 21:34.633
COMPANIES WOULD RATHER SETTL

21:34.633 --> 21:35.900
AND PUT THIS THING TO REST AND

21:35.900 --> 21:37.833
WRITE A RELATIVELY SMALL CHECK

21:37.833 --> 21:40.767
THE APPEARANCES IN LIGHT OF THIS

21:40.767 --> 21:41.533
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL MOMEN

21:41.533 --> 21:43.200
THAT'S OCCURRING RIGHT NOW, TH

THE FACT THAT HAVE THEY HAD THIS

21:48.533 --> 21:50.533
UNWRITTEN AGREEMENT TO BASICALLY

21:50.533 --> 21:52.367
HOLD DOWN SALARIES

21:54.333 --> 21:55.533
MUCH MONEY AND THE COMPANIES ARE

21:55.533 --> 21:57.333
MAKING SO MUCH MONEY
