00:11.745 --> 00:13.013
FOR SUNDAY, MARCH 1:

00:13.013 --> 00:14.414
CONGRESS GEARS UP TO CONTINUE

00:14.414 --> 00:15.949
THE DEBATE OVER FUNDING HOMELAND

00:15.949 --> 00:17.184
SECURITY.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.685
HOW THE ARREST OF THREE MEN IN

00:18.685 --> 00:20.754
NEW YORK AND FLORIDA THIS WEEK

00:20.754 --> 00:22.089
REVEALS THE DIFFICULTIES OF

00:22.089 --> 00:23.790
FIGHTING ISIS AT HOME.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.225
AND, IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:25.225 --> 00:26.760
FROM OHIO: THIEVES STEALING

00:26.760 --> 00:28.328
VALUABLE METAL, AND PUTTING THE

00:28.328 --> 00:29.863
PUBLIC IN DANGER.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.931
>> THE WOULD-BE-THIEVES CUT THE

00:30.931 --> 00:32.165
LINE SO IT DANGLED OVER THE

00:32.165 --> 00:33.166
INTERSTATE.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.401
WHEN AN S.U.V. GOT TOO CLOSE,

00:34.401 --> 00:35.669
THERE WAS A BRIGHT FLASH THAT

00:35.669 --> 00:37.170
BLEW OUT THE WINDSHIELD AND

00:37.170 --> 00:39.439
KNOCKED THE DRIVER UNCONSCIOUS.

00:39.439 --> 00:40.474
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:40.474 --> 00:41.942
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:41.942 --> 00:44.011
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:44.011 --> 00:45.679
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:45.679 --> 00:47.614
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:47.614 --> 00:48.348
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:48.348 --> 00:49.182
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:49.182 --> 00:49.983
THE FIGHT OVER FUNDING FOR THE

00:49.983 --> 00:50.984
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

00:50.984 --> 00:51.852
STARTS ALL OVER AGAIN ON CAPITOL

00:51.852 --> 00:54.354
HILL TOMORROW.

00:54.354 --> 00:55.522
CONGRESS HAS GIVEN ITSELF UNTIL

00:55.522 --> 00:56.823
MIDNIGHT FRIDAY TO COME UP WITH

00:56.823 --> 00:58.425
SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT.

00:58.425 --> 00:59.693
BUT THE RIFT AMONG REPUBLICANS

00:59.693 --> 01:02.796
CONTINUES TO ENDANGER ANY DEAL.

01:02.796 --> 01:04.564
A CONTINGENT OF HOUSE

01:04.564 --> 01:06.967
REPUBLICANS IS REFUSING TO FUND

01:06.967 --> 01:09.736
THE AGENCY UNLESS THE BILL MOVES

01:09.736 --> 01:11.371
TOWARD BLOCKING THE PRESIDENT'S

01:11.371 --> 01:12.973
IMMIGRATION REFORM PLAN.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.908
THE INTRA-PARTY DIVISION PUTS

01:14.908 --> 01:17.077
HOUSE SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER IN A

01:17.077 --> 01:18.478
TOUGH POSITION: SIDE WITH HOUSE

01:18.478 --> 01:20.013
MODERATES AND SENATE REPUBLICANS

01:20.013 --> 01:21.615
TO FUND THE AGENCY, OR SIDE WITH

01:21.615 --> 01:22.849
MORE CONSERVATIVE MEMBERS TO

01:22.849 --> 01:23.784
CHALLENGE THE IMMIGRATION

01:23.784 --> 01:25.218
POLICY.

01:25.218 --> 01:26.553
BUT THIS MORNING BOEHNER TOLD

01:26.553 --> 01:27.754
"FACE THE NATION" HIS PARTY IS

01:27.754 --> 01:28.689
UNITED IN ITS GOAL TO STAND UP

01:28.689 --> 01:31.158
TO PRESIDENT OBAMA.

01:31.158 --> 01:32.259
>> I MADE IT CLEAR WE'RE GOING

01:32.259 --> 01:33.794
TO DO EVERYTHING WE COULD TO

01:33.794 --> 01:35.395
BLOCK THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE

01:35.395 --> 01:37.297
OVER-REACH, AND THAT'S THE BASIS

01:37.297 --> 01:39.066
OF THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO

01:39.066 --> 01:43.170
DEAL WITH.

01:43.170 --> 01:44.338
>> Sreenivasan: DEMOCRATS STILL

01:44.338 --> 01:45.839
HOPE TO VOTE ON A LONG-TERM

01:45.839 --> 01:47.174
FUNDING BILL WITHOUT TIES TO

01:47.174 --> 01:49.409
IMMIGRATION.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.545
>> WE WANT A CLEAN BILL.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.380
WE HAVE PAST TAKEN VOTES ON A

01:53.380 --> 01:55.515
CLEAN BILL, IT'S WELL KNOWN.

01:55.515 --> 01:57.718
AND I SEE NOTHING ELSE

01:57.718 --> 01:58.418
HAPPENING, OTHER THAN A CLEAN

01:58.418 --> 02:01.254
BILL.

02:01.254 --> 02:02.456
>> Sreenivasan: ISRAELI PRIME

02:02.456 --> 02:03.657
MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU LEFT

02:03.657 --> 02:04.925
FOR THE UNITED STATES THIS

02:04.925 --> 02:06.026
MORNING, PREPARING FOR HIS

02:06.026 --> 02:07.060
CONTROVERSIAL APPEARANCE BEFORE

02:07.060 --> 02:08.729
CONGRESS ON TUESDAY.

02:08.729 --> 02:10.297
HOUSE SPEAKER BOEHNER INVITED

02:10.297 --> 02:12.065
NETANYAHU TO SPEAK, AND THIS

02:12.065 --> 02:13.767
MORNING, SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN

02:13.767 --> 02:15.102
KERRY CALLED IT ODD THAT THE

02:15.102 --> 02:16.536
ADMINISTRATION WASN'T INCLUDED

02:16.536 --> 02:18.105
IN THE PROCESS.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.806
BUT HE TOLD ABC'S "THIS WEEK"

02:19.806 --> 02:21.041
THE WHITE HOUSE DOESN'T WANT TO

02:21.041 --> 02:22.142
TURN THE VISIT INTO A "POLITICAL

02:22.142 --> 02:24.111
FOOTBALL".

02:24.111 --> 02:25.545
>> THE PRIME MINISTER OF ISRAEL

02:25.545 --> 02:26.747
IS WELCOME TO SPEAK IN THE

02:26.747 --> 02:28.215
UNITED STATES.

02:28.215 --> 02:30.317
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A CLOSER

02:30.317 --> 02:32.285
RELATIONSHIP WITH ISRAEL RIGHT

02:32.285 --> 02:33.353
NOW IN TERMS OF SECURITY THAN IN

02:33.353 --> 02:35.822
ANY TIME IN HISTORY.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.957
>> Sreenivasan: TENS OF

02:36.957 --> 02:38.358
THOUSANDS OF RUSSIANS MARCHED

02:38.358 --> 02:39.760
THROUGH THE STREETS OF MOSCOW

02:39.760 --> 02:41.228
TODAY, MOURNING THE DEATH OF ONE

02:41.228 --> 02:42.295
OF PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN'S

02:42.295 --> 02:43.630
MOST VOCAL CRITICS.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.265
OPPOSITION LEADER BORIS NEMTSOV

02:45.265 --> 02:46.633
WAS GUNNED DOWN JUST OUTSIDE THE

02:46.633 --> 02:48.135
KREMLIN FRIDAY NIGHT.

02:48.135 --> 02:49.669
TODAY MOURNERS PASSED THROUGH

02:49.669 --> 02:51.371
METAL DETECTORS, THEN MARCHED

02:51.371 --> 02:52.873
NEAR THE CRIME SCENE AMID A

02:52.873 --> 02:54.241
MASSIVE POLICE PRESENCE.

02:54.241 --> 02:55.509
RUSSIAN OFFICIALS ARE

02:55.509 --> 02:56.977
INVESTIGATING SEVERAL MOTIVES,

02:56.977 --> 02:58.512
INCLUDING WHETHER NEMTSOV WAS

02:58.512 --> 02:59.780
ASSASSINATED BECAUSE OF HIS

02:59.780 --> 03:01.014
CRITICISM OF PRESIDENT VLADIMIR

03:01.014 --> 03:02.883
PUTIN.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.317
DOCTORS IN SIERRA LEONE ARE

03:04.317 --> 03:05.519
REELING FROM A NEW WAVE OF EBOLA

03:05.519 --> 03:07.487
VICTIMS.

03:07.487 --> 03:09.089
SIERRA LEONE HAD SEEN A DROP IN

03:09.089 --> 03:10.624
CASES AND EVEN PLANNED TO LIFT

03:10.624 --> 03:11.725
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS AND RE-OPEN

03:11.725 --> 03:13.427
SCHOOLS.

03:13.427 --> 03:15.128
BUT LAST MONTH, SICK FISHERMEN

03:15.128 --> 03:16.997
RETURNED TO SHORE, SETTING OFF A

03:16.997 --> 03:18.365
NEW SERIES OF 21-DAY

03:18.365 --> 03:20.333
QUARANTINES.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.768
THE COUNTRY'S OWN VICE PRESIDENT

03:21.768 --> 03:23.537
HAS QUARANTINED HIMSELF AFTER

03:23.537 --> 03:24.771
ONE OF HIS SECURITY GUARDS DIED

03:24.771 --> 03:26.173
OF THE DISEASE.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.841
HERE IN THE U.S., EBOLA

03:27.841 --> 03:29.643
SURVIVOR, NURSE NINA PHAM, PLANS

03:29.643 --> 03:31.111
TO SUE THE TEXAS HOSPITAL WHERE

03:31.111 --> 03:32.879
SHE CONTRACTED THE DISEASE.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.815
ATTORNEYS CLAIM THE HOSPITAL

03:34.815 --> 03:36.349
DIDN'T PROPERLY TRAIN THE STAFF

03:36.349 --> 03:37.984
TO DEAL WITH THE OUTBREAK.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.419
EUROPEAN COUNTER-TERRORISM

03:39.419 --> 03:40.921
INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE AT LEAST

03:40.921 --> 03:48.495
SIXTY BRITISH WOMEN AND

03:48.495 --> 03:49.296
SCHOOLGIRLS MAY HAVE TRAVELED TO

03:49.296 --> 03:49.863
SYRIA TO JOIN ISIS.

03:49.863 --> 03:50.797
FIVE OF THEM ARE REPORTEDLY 15

03:50.797 --> 03:51.698
OR 16 YEARS OLD.

03:51.698 --> 03:52.666
THREE OF THOSE BRITISH TEENS

03:52.666 --> 03:53.667
WERE SPOTTED ON SECURITY VIDEO

03:53.667 --> 03:54.434
WHILE TRAVELLING IN TURKEY LAST

03:54.434 --> 03:55.135
MONTH.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.470
TURKISH POLICE ARE SEARCHING FOR

03:56.470 --> 03:57.571
THE GIRLS, BUT INVESTIGATORS

03:57.571 --> 03:58.538
FEAR THEY'VE ALREADY CROSSED THE

03:58.538 --> 03:59.773
BORDER INTO SYRIA.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.041
WE'LL HAVE MORE ON THE FIGHT

04:01.041 --> 04:01.975
AGAINST ISIS HERE IN THE UNITED

04:01.975 --> 04:03.477
STATES IN A MOMENT.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.178
A NEW REPORT FROM THE UNITED

04:05.178 --> 04:06.713
NATIONS SAYS AT LEAST 1,100

04:06.713 --> 04:08.415
IRAQIS WERE KILLED IN FEBRUARY.

04:08.415 --> 04:09.683
MORE THAN 600 OF THEM WERE

04:09.683 --> 04:11.384
CIVILIANS.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.086
THE U.N. BLAMES ISIS AND IS

04:13.086 --> 04:14.621
CALLING ON FRACTURED IRAQI

04:14.621 --> 04:15.455
LEADERS TO JOIN FORCES TO FIGHT

04:15.455 --> 04:17.090
BACK.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.925
BUT THERE'S ALSO SOME GOOD NEWS

04:18.925 --> 04:20.393
OUT OF BAGHDAD TONIGHT-- IRAQ'S

04:20.393 --> 04:22.262
NATIONAL MUSEUM HAS OFFICIALLY

04:22.262 --> 04:24.097
RE-OPENED, 12 YEARS AFTER IT WAS

04:24.097 --> 04:25.665
VANDALIZED IN THE AFTERMATH OF

04:25.665 --> 04:27.267
THE U.S.-LED INVASION.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.668
LOOTERS STOLE THE MUSEUM'S

04:28.668 --> 04:30.103
ANTIQUITIES DURING THE FIGHTING,

04:30.103 --> 04:31.338
BUT MANY OF THE OBJECTS HAVE

04:31.338 --> 04:32.772
BEEN FOUND AND RETURNED.

04:32.772 --> 04:34.474
THE OPENING COMES JUST AFTER

04:34.474 --> 04:36.009
ISIS RELEASED VIDEO OF MILITANTS

04:36.009 --> 04:38.245
DESTROYING STATUES IN MOSUL.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.679
HYUNDAI IS RECALLING ALMOST

04:39.679 --> 04:41.214
205,000 CARS BECAUSE THE POWER

04:41.214 --> 04:42.449
STEERING COULD SUDDENLY STOP

04:42.449 --> 04:44.351
WORKING.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.119
THE RECALL COVERS THE 2008-TO-

04:46.119 --> 04:48.054
2010 ELANTRA AND THE 2009-TO-

04:48.054 --> 04:50.891
2010 ELANTRA TOURING.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.559
HYUNDAI DID NOT MENTION ANY

04:52.559 --> 04:54.094
ACCIDENTS OR INJURIES RELATED TO

04:54.094 --> 04:55.562
THE STEERING PROBLEM.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.897
YOU CAN FIND THE SPECIFIC CARS

04:56.897 --> 04:57.998
GETTING RECALLED ON OUR WEBSITE,

04:57.998 --> 05:12.078
AT pbs.org/newshour.

05:12.078 --> 05:13.113
>> Sreenivasan: FEDERAL

05:13.113 --> 05:14.447
INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE THEY'VE

05:14.447 --> 05:15.715
MANAGED TO CAPTURE THREE

05:15.715 --> 05:17.284
SUSPECTED ISIS SYMPATHIZERS

05:17.284 --> 05:18.952
BEFORE THEY LAUNCHED AN ATTACK.

05:18.952 --> 05:20.086
ON WEDNESDAY, U.S. LAW

05:20.086 --> 05:21.454
ENFORCEMENT CHARGED THREE

05:21.454 --> 05:22.689
BROOKLYN MEN WITH PROVIDING

05:22.689 --> 05:24.291
MATERIAL SUPPORT TO A FOREIGN

05:24.291 --> 05:25.892
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.294
TWO OF THE SUSPECTS ALLEGEDLY

05:27.294 --> 05:28.562
PLANNED TO TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF

05:28.562 --> 05:29.763
MILES TO FIGHT UNDER THE FLAG OF

05:29.763 --> 05:31.031
THE ISLAMIC STATE.

05:31.031 --> 05:32.399
IF THAT DIDN'T WORK, THEY

05:32.399 --> 05:33.667
THREATENED TO CARRY OUT ATTACKS

05:33.667 --> 05:35.001
IN THE UNITED STATES.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.136
NEW YORK CITY POLICE

05:36.136 --> 05:37.537
COMMISSIONER WILLIAM BRATTON

05:37.537 --> 05:38.905
CHARACTERIZED THE ARRESTS

05:38.905 --> 05:40.273
SAYING, "THIS IS REAL.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.441
THIS IS THE CONCERN ABOUT THE

05:41.441 --> 05:42.676
LONE WOLF."

05:42.676 --> 05:43.810
WE ARE JOINED NOW FROM

05:43.810 --> 05:44.878
WASHINGTON, D.C. BY ANDREW

05:44.878 --> 05:45.879
GROSSMAN WHO HAS BEEN COVERING

05:45.879 --> 05:46.980
THIS STORY FOR THE WALL STREET

05:46.980 --> 05:48.014
JOURNAL.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.282
SO ANDREW, HOW DID

05:49.282 --> 05:50.350
THESE ARRESTS GO DOWN, WHAT

05:50.350 --> 05:51.384
KIND OF TOOLS DID THEY USE

05:51.384 --> 05:54.020
TO GET THEM?

05:54.020 --> 05:55.422
>> WHAT WE SAW HERE WAS A

05:55.422 --> 05:56.456
FAIRLY COMMON PATTERN THAT

05:56.456 --> 05:59.125
LAW ENFORCEMENT IN.

05:59.125 --> 05:59.793
U.S. HAS BEEN USING AGAINST

05:59.793 --> 06:00.794
PEOPLE WHO MIGHT BE PLOTTING

06:00.794 --> 06:03.330
TO CATCH ISIS OR OTHER

06:03.330 --> 06:04.364
FOREIGN TERRORIST GROUPS.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.365
THEY FIRST ATTRACTED

06:05.365 --> 06:06.066
AUTHORITIES ATTENTION

06:06.066 --> 06:08.501
ON-LINE WITH A POST ON AN

06:08.501 --> 06:10.203
UZBEK LANGUAGE WEB SITE

06:10.203 --> 06:11.137
ABOUT THREATENING TO KILL

06:11.137 --> 06:11.771
THE PRESIDENT.

06:11.771 --> 06:12.739
THAT GOT THE ATTENTION OF

06:12.739 --> 06:13.940
THE SECRET SERVICE.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.041
OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT IN NEW

06:15.041 --> 06:16.076
YORK AND THEY BEGAN TO KEEP

06:16.076 --> 06:18.111
AN EYE ON THESE GUYS,

06:18.111 --> 06:19.112
EVENTUALLY PUT THEM IN TOUCH

06:19.112 --> 06:20.080
WITH AN INFORMANT WITHOUT

06:20.080 --> 06:22.849
WORKED WITH THEM, SORT OF

06:22.849 --> 06:23.883
SUSSED OUT WHAT THEIR

06:23.883 --> 06:24.985
INTENTIONS WERE, AS THEY GOT

06:24.985 --> 06:26.586
CLOSER AND CLOSER, AT ONE

06:26.586 --> 06:27.687
POINT ONE OF THESE MEN WAS

06:27.687 --> 06:29.589
GOING TO GO GET ON A PLANE

06:29.589 --> 06:32.058
AT J-- JFK THAT IS WHEN THEY

06:32.058 --> 06:34.461
CAME AND MADE THE ARRESTS.

06:34.461 --> 06:35.462
>> WHAT ABOUT THE

06:35.462 --> 06:36.863
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY DIDN'T

06:36.863 --> 06:37.897
MAKE A THREAT TO THE LIFE OF

06:37.897 --> 06:38.565
THE PRESIDENT THAT THEY

06:38.565 --> 06:39.666
COULD HAVE GONE UNDETECTED

06:39.666 --> 06:40.634
ALL TOGETHER.

06:40.634 --> 06:41.468
>> THAT'S THE BIG WORRY

06:41.468 --> 06:42.168
HERE.

06:42.168 --> 06:46.072
I THINK THE PROLIFERATION OF

06:46.072 --> 06:47.507
ON-LINE PROPAGANDA IS REALLY

06:47.507 --> 06:49.209
A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD HERE.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.345
IT'S LURING PEOPLE LIKE THIS

06:52.345 --> 06:54.047
INTO-- IT GETS THEM

06:54.047 --> 06:55.482
INTERESTED IF GOING TO JOIN

06:55.482 --> 06:56.583
ONE OF THESE GROUPS.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.484
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND,

06:57.484 --> 06:58.518
AUTHORITIES CAN SEE A LOT OF

06:58.518 --> 06:59.219
THAT TRAFFIC.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.654
THEY CAN SEE WHEN PEOPLE ARE

07:00.654 --> 07:02.255
GETTING IN TOUCH WITH

07:02.255 --> 07:03.690
SOMEONE OVERSEAS WHO MIGHT

07:03.690 --> 07:04.891
WANT TO HELP THEM TRAVEL.

07:04.891 --> 07:07.560
SO YOU KNOW, IT IS -- THAT

07:07.560 --> 07:08.862
IS THE BIG WORRY IS THESE

07:08.862 --> 07:10.563
LONE WOLVES AS OPPOSED TO

07:10.563 --> 07:11.831
KNOWN WOLVES AS LAW

07:11.831 --> 07:12.632
ENFORCEMENT STARTED CALLING

07:12.632 --> 07:13.366
THEM.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.367
THE KNOWN WOLVES, AT LEAST,

07:14.367 --> 07:15.735
THEY CAN SEE AND KEEP AN EYE

07:15.735 --> 07:16.403
ON.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.805
THE LONE WOLFS WHO MIGHT BE

07:18.805 --> 07:19.806
RADICALIZED ABOUT THE

07:19.806 --> 07:21.241
PROPAGANDA AND CARRY OUT AN

07:21.241 --> 07:21.941
ATTACK HERE ARE THE BIG

07:21.941 --> 07:23.543
WORRY FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT.

07:23.543 --> 07:24.411
>> Sreenivasan: THERE'S ALSO

07:24.411 --> 07:25.745
CONCERNED THAT THE KNOWN

07:25.745 --> 07:26.780
WOLVES LIST IS SO LARGE THAT

07:26.780 --> 07:28.148
WE JUST DON'T HAVE THE

07:28.148 --> 07:29.783
BODIES TO KEEP UP AND DO

07:29.783 --> 07:31.151
SURVEILLANCE ON ALL THESE

07:31.151 --> 07:32.185
POTENTIAL THREATS.

07:32.185 --> 07:32.852
>> RIGHT.

07:32.852 --> 07:34.521
I THINK IT'S HUNDREDS OF

07:34.521 --> 07:36.956
THOUSANDS ON THE U.S.'S

07:36.956 --> 07:38.658
TERRORIST LIST ALONE.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.061
AND THE FEAR ALSO IS, YOU

07:41.061 --> 07:43.430
KNOW, THE U.S. HAS ABOUT 150

07:43.430 --> 07:45.198
PEOPLE WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO

07:45.198 --> 07:46.533
TRAVEL OR TRAVELED IT TO

07:46.533 --> 07:48.935
FIGHT IN SYRIA, NOT ALL FOR

07:48.935 --> 07:50.970
ISIS BUT FOR VARIOUS GROUPS

07:50.970 --> 07:52.706
THERE.

07:52.706 --> 07:53.540
THE EUROPEANS, FOR WESTERNERS,

07:53.540 --> 07:55.542
IT'S ABOUT 3,400 AND NOW

07:55.542 --> 07:57.110
THAT'S A WORRY FOR LAW

07:57.110 --> 07:58.211
ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE A LOT OF

07:58.211 --> 07:58.978
THOSE PEOPLE ARE FROM

07:58.978 --> 08:00.714
COUNTRIES THAT HAVE VISA

08:00.714 --> 08:02.082
WAIVERS THAT CAN EASILY COME

08:02.082 --> 08:03.049
TO THE U.S.

08:03.049 --> 08:04.451
OR THEY CAN CARRY OUT

08:04.451 --> 08:05.485
ATTACKS IN EUROPE IS SO IT'S

08:05.485 --> 08:07.187
A MUCH BIGGER PROBLEM FOR

08:07.187 --> 08:09.622
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND ALLIED

08:09.622 --> 08:10.623
COUNTRIES AS WE SAW IN

08:10.623 --> 08:12.292
FRANCE NOT TOO LONG AGO.

08:12.292 --> 08:12.959
>> Sreenivasan: IS THIS A

08:12.959 --> 08:14.327
SHIFT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT

08:14.327 --> 08:14.728
APPROACH.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.096
WE WERE TALKING IN THE

08:16.096 --> 08:16.763
NEWSROOM THIS MORNING T

08:16.763 --> 08:18.131
ALMOST SEEMS LIKE THE

08:18.131 --> 08:19.466
PRECRIME DIVISION FROM THE

08:19.466 --> 08:20.867
MOVIE "MINORITY REPORT"

08:20.867 --> 08:22.635
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT, BEFORE

08:22.635 --> 08:23.970
YOU COMMIT A CRIME, STOPPING

08:23.970 --> 08:24.270
YOU.

08:24.270 --> 08:25.638
>> THIS HAS ACTUALLY BEEN

08:25.638 --> 08:26.339
SOMEWHAT CONTROVERSY.

08:26.339 --> 08:27.874
THIS USE OF INFORMANTS.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.743
THE FBI HAS BEEN DOING THIS

08:29.743 --> 08:31.811
TO SOME DEGREE SINCE NOT

08:31.811 --> 08:33.179
LONG AFTER SEPTEMBER 11th.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.914
A LOT OF THESE CASES, YOU

08:34.914 --> 08:36.282
KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN CASES

08:36.282 --> 08:38.985
WHERE AN INFORMANT OR AN

08:38.985 --> 08:40.353
UNDERCOVER FBI OPERATIVE

08:40.353 --> 08:41.488
GETS IN TOUCH WITH SOMEONE

08:41.488 --> 08:43.790
WHO APPEARS TO BE INTERESTED

08:43.790 --> 08:45.525
IN DOING, CARRYING OUT SOME

08:45.525 --> 08:46.493
SORT OF ATTACK.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.927
AND REALLY WALKS THEM

08:47.927 --> 08:50.697
THROUGH THE STEPS NECESSARY

08:50.697 --> 08:51.998
TO GET THEM TO THE POINT

08:51.998 --> 08:53.366
WHERE THEY'RE ALMOST IN

08:53.366 --> 08:54.100
CERTAIN CASES HAVE THEIR

08:54.100 --> 08:55.468
HAND ON THE TRIGGER OF WHAT

08:55.468 --> 08:57.170
THEY THINK IS A BOMB, AS WE

08:57.170 --> 08:58.538
SAW, FOR EXAMPLE, IN A CASE

08:58.538 --> 08:59.205
IN CHICAGO.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.740
AND ONCE THEY GO PUSH THAT

09:00.740 --> 09:02.075
TRIGGER, IT TURNS OUT THAT

09:02.075 --> 09:03.777
THE WHOLE THING IS A SET UP.

09:03.777 --> 09:05.145
AND YOU KNOW, SOME OF THAT

09:05.145 --> 09:06.312
HAS BEEN CONTROVERSIAL.

09:06.312 --> 09:07.847
THE FBI SAYS THEY REALLY TRY

09:07.847 --> 09:09.549
TO STAY-- THEY DO STAY ON

09:09.549 --> 09:11.918
THE SIDE OF LETTING THE

09:11.918 --> 09:14.387
TARGET, THE SUSPECT DRIVE

09:14.387 --> 09:15.989
THE OPERATION.

09:15.989 --> 09:18.091
BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S A VERY

09:18.091 --> 09:19.125
CLOSE, FINE LINE BETWEEN

09:19.125 --> 09:20.760
THAT AND ENTRAPMENT.

09:20.760 --> 09:21.461
>> ALL RIGHT, ANDREW

09:34.174 --> 09:35.942
OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT.

09:35.942 --> 09:36.910
THIEVES HAVE BEEN HITTING STATES

09:36.910 --> 09:38.011
FROM CALIFORNIA TO PENNSYLVANIA

09:38.011 --> 09:39.512
STEALING METAL.

09:39.512 --> 09:40.780
IT'S A NATIONAL PROBLEM THAT'S

09:40.780 --> 09:42.148
BECOME AN INCREASING THREAT TO

09:42.148 --> 09:44.050
PUBLIC SAFETY.

09:44.050 --> 09:45.485
THE THEFTS HAVE CAUSED BLACKOUTS

09:45.485 --> 09:47.420
AND TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.755
IN THIS UPDATED SEGMENT THAT

PROBLEM AND PREVENT THE THIEVES

09:55.728 --> 09:59.532
FROM CASHING IN.

10:04.737 --> 10:06.506
SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CELL PHONE SHE

10:06.506 --> 10:07.874
COULD USE INSTEAD BECAUSE CELL

10:07.874 --> 10:09.576

10:09.576 --> 10:11.511
APPALACHIAN REGION OF OHIO WHERE

10:11.511 --> 10:12.879
SHE LIVES.

10:12.879 --> 10:14.180
AND AT THE HOUSE WHERE SHE WAS

10:14.180 --> 10:15.148
LIVING WITH HER DAUGHTER AND HER

10:15.148 --> 10:16.115
PARENTS, THERE'S NO CELL SIGNAL

10:16.115 --> 10:17.884
AT ALL.

10:17.884 --> 10:19.319
SO WHENEVER SHE HAD TO BE AWAY

10:19.319 --> 10:21.554
FROM HOME, SHE WORRIED

10:21.554 --> 10:24.524
ESPECIALLY ABOUT HER FATHER.

10:24.524 --> 10:26.493
>> HE HAD A HEART CONDITION, AND

10:26.493 --> 10:27.827
HE HAD HAD SEVERAL OPEN-HEART

10:27.827 --> 10:28.661
SURGERIES.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.063
HE HAD TRIPLE-BYPASS SURGERY.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.297
>> Reporter: A FEW DAYS AFTER

10:31.297 --> 10:32.165
CHRISTMAS, HE SAID HE WASN'T

10:32.165 --> 10:33.366
FEELING WELL.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.968
>> HE CALLED OVER TO TALK TO A

10:34.968 --> 10:36.936
NURSE, AND HE WAS HAVING

10:36.936 --> 10:39.706
PROBLEMS WITH THE PHONE.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.241
>> Reporter: HIS CONDITION

10:41.241 --> 10:42.775
DETERIORATED, AND FINALLY HE

10:42.775 --> 10:44.711
SAID HE NEEDED AN AMBULANCE. THE

10:44.711 --> 10:46.513
FAMILY CALLED 9-1-1, BUT THE

10:46.513 --> 10:48.114
LINE WAS SO BAD THAT THEY

10:48.114 --> 10:49.549
FINALLY GAVE UP AND DAY'S

10:49.549 --> 10:50.416
BROTHER RUSHED THEIR FATHER TO

10:50.416 --> 10:52.018
DOCTORS.

10:52.018 --> 10:53.319
BUT IT WAS TOO LATE.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.154
HE DIED THAT EVENING.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.556
>> IT WAS REALLY FRUSTRATING

10:56.556 --> 10:57.991
CLOSE TO THE WHOLE WEEK

10:57.991 --> 10:59.359
AFTERWARDS WE COULDN'T EVEN CALL

11:00.193 --> 11:01.327
WE COULDN'T EVEN CALL AND TELL

11:01.327 --> 11:02.695
FAMILY THAT HE HAD PASSED.

11:02.695 --> 11:03.897
I HAD TO GO TO MY WORKPLACE TO

11:03.897 --> 11:04.797
USE THE PHONE TO EVEN CALL THE

11:04.797 --> 11:06.599

STEALING TELEPHONE WIRES ALL

11:11.271 --> 11:13.339
OVER THE COUNTY.

11:13.339 --> 11:14.941
IT'S ONE OF THE POOREST IN OHIO,

11:14.941 --> 11:16.142
AND THE COPPER IN THE LINES WAS

11:16.142 --> 11:17.544
VALUABLE.

11:17.544 --> 11:19.145
THERE COULD BE HUNDREDS OF

STATE HAS LED THE NATION IN

11:36.863 --> 11:38.765
METAL THEFTS.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.500
AND FROM ONE CORNER OF OHIO TO

11:40.500 --> 11:41.868
ANOTHER, THIEVES HAVE PUT THE

11:41.868 --> 11:44.904

11:44.904 --> 11:46.839
ACCORDING TO POLICE HERE IN

11:46.839 --> 11:48.575

11:48.575 --> 11:50.510
THAT INTERSTATE HIGHWAY BEHIND

ME BECAUSE OF AN ATTEMPT TO

11:52.312 --> 11:53.913
STEAL COPPER WIRE FROM THE HIGH

11:53.913 --> 11:55.782
TENSION LINES BEYOND IT.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.617
THE WOULD-BE-THIEVES CLIMBED UP

11:57.617 --> 11:59.152

11:59.152 --> 12:00.687
OVER THE INTERSTATE UNDER

12:00.687 --> 12:02.388
THOUSANDS OF VOLTS OF TENSION.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.856
WHEN AN S.U.V. GOT TOO CLOSE,

12:03.856 --> 12:05.325
THERE WAS A BRIGHT FLASH THAT

12:05.325 --> 12:06.859
BLEW OUT THE WINDSHIELD AND

12:06.859 --> 12:08.728
KNOCKED THE DRIVER UNCONSCIOUS.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.496

12:11.397 --> 12:13.299
LUCKY.

12:13.299 --> 12:15.168

THIS DOWN.

13:28.207 --> 13:30.309
DEALERS HAVE TO RECORD EVERY

13:30.309 --> 13:32.111
DETAIL OF EVERY PURCHASE THEY

13:32.111 --> 13:33.780
MAKE SO THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAN

13:33.780 --> 13:35.748
INVESTIGATE THEFTS.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.450
COLUMBUS OFFICIALS SAY THOSE

13:37.450 --> 13:38.418
STEPS ARE HELPING TO REDUCE

13:38.418 --> 13:42.055
METAL THEFTS.

13:42.055 --> 13:42.889

SAYS WHEN COLUMBUS CRACKED DOWN,

14:15.321 --> 14:16.823
THIEVES WENT TO SCRAP YARDS

14:16.823 --> 14:18.691
OUTSIDE THE CITY LIMITS.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.126
NOW THAT THE WHOLE STATE IS

14:20.126 --> 14:21.394
CRACKING DOWN, THEY'LL JUST GO

14:21.394 --> 14:22.328

14:27.834 --> 14:29.335
LAXED ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAWS,

14:29.335 --> 14:30.503

15:41.474 --> 15:43.409
MELTED DOWN AND REUSED.

15:43.409 --> 15:45.278
THE LAW IN OHIO MAKES IT A CRIME

15:45.278 --> 15:47.079
FOR SCRAP DEALERS TO BUY CERTAIN

15:47.079 --> 15:49.182
ITEMS UNLESS SELLERS CAN PROVE

17:29.248 --> 17:36.956
ANSWERS.

17:36.956 --> 17:37.823
SOME CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH IS

17:37.823 --> 17:38.524
GIVING NEW HOPE TO CANCER

17:38.524 --> 17:39.258
PATIENTS.

17:39.258 --> 17:40.359
RESEARCHERS ARE ZEROING IN ON

17:40.359 --> 17:41.227
THE CAUSES OF SPECIFIC CANCERS

17:41.227 --> 17:42.128
AND ARE FINDING DRAMATICALLY

17:42.128 --> 17:42.995
DIFFERENT WAYS TO FIGHT THE

17:42.995 --> 17:43.696
DISEASE.

17:43.696 --> 17:44.463
TO EXPLAIN THE LATEST FINDINGS,

17:44.463 --> 17:45.231
I'M JOINED BY DR. DAVID HYMAN,

17:45.231 --> 17:46.132
AN ONCOLOGIST WITH MEMORIAL

17:46.132 --> 17:50.970
SLOAN KETTERING CANCER CENTER.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.772
SO AS WE TALK ABOUT CANCER,

17:52.772 --> 17:54.640
AS WE TALK ABOUT HOPE, LET'S

17:54.640 --> 17:57.009
JUST KIND OF CLARIFY, WHAT

17:57.009 --> 17:58.377
IS THE CURRENT WAY WE TREAT

17:58.377 --> 17:59.445
CANCERS AND WHAT ARE SOME OF

17:59.445 --> 18:00.746
THESE NEW STUDIES SHOWING?

18:00.746 --> 18:01.213
>>.

18:01.213 --> 18:02.248
>> THE HISTORIC WAYS THAT

18:02.248 --> 18:03.616
WE'VE ALWAYS TREATED CANCERS

18:03.616 --> 18:04.951
IS TREATING THEM BASED ON

18:04.951 --> 18:05.985
THE ORGAN THEY COME FROM.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.019
SO TREATING PATIENTS WITH

18:07.019 --> 18:08.554
BREAST CANCER OR COLON

18:08.554 --> 18:11.590
CANCER OR LUNG CANCER

18:11.590 --> 18:14.593
IDENTICALLY AM WHAT THESE ARE

18:14.593 --> 18:16.762
ASKING IS WHETHER WE CAN TARGET

18:16.762 --> 18:18.564
SPECIFIC MUTATIONS WHICH ARE

18:18.564 --> 18:19.665
MYSTICS IN THE GENES THAT

18:19.665 --> 18:21.334
ARISE IN TUMORS AND TREAT

18:21.334 --> 18:22.902
THEM THE SAME EVEN IF THEY

18:22.902 --> 18:24.470
COME FROM DIFFERENT ORGANS.

18:24.470 --> 18:25.438
SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE

18:25.438 --> 18:27.239
ARE CERTAIN MUTATIONS THAT

18:27.239 --> 18:29.775
WE FIND-- WE FIND ACROSS

18:29.775 --> 18:30.943
MULTIPLE DISEASE TYPES.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.311
AND SO ONE QUESTION IS CAN

18:32.311 --> 18:33.679
WE REALLY START TO THINK

18:33.679 --> 18:35.581
ABOUT THESE DISEASES AS

18:35.581 --> 18:37.149
DISEASES HARBORING MUTATION

18:37.149 --> 18:38.851
A OR B RATHER THAN LUNG

18:38.851 --> 18:40.519
CANCERS OR COLON CANCERS.

18:40.519 --> 18:41.887
>> AND SO HOW EFFECTIVE ARE

18:41.887 --> 18:43.589
THESE DRUGS WHEN THEY TARGET

18:43.589 --> 18:45.124
A SPECIFIC MUTATION INSTEAD

18:45.124 --> 18:46.659
OF A SPECIFIC REGION OF THE

18:46.659 --> 18:47.693
BODY THAT THE CANCER IS

18:47.693 --> 18:48.327
COMING FROM?

18:48.327 --> 18:49.695
>> THEY CAN BE VERY

18:49.695 --> 18:50.796
DRAMATICALLY EFFECTIVE IN

18:50.796 --> 18:52.398
WAYS THAT ARE REALLY

18:52.398 --> 18:53.866
PREVIOUSLY UNPRECEDENTED.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.701
SO WE KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE, IN

18:55.701 --> 18:58.671
LUNG CANCERS, CHEMOTHERAPY

18:58.671 --> 19:01.007
HAS A RESPONSE RATED BEST IN

19:01.007 --> 19:02.475
OT 30% RANGE.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.176
WE HAVE CERTAIN MEDICINES

19:04.176 --> 19:05.811
NOW THAT TARGET CERTAIN

19:05.811 --> 19:06.679
MUTATIONS IN LUNG CANCER

19:06.679 --> 19:07.580
WHERE THE MAJORITY OF

19:07.580 --> 19:09.348
PATIENTS HAVE BENEFITTED AND

19:09.348 --> 19:10.416
THEIR TUMORS SHRINK.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.817
SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO

19:11.817 --> 19:12.952
IS TAKE THOSE EARLY

19:12.952 --> 19:14.887
SUCCESSES IN LUNG CANCER,

19:14.887 --> 19:15.921
MELANOMA AND NOW EXTEND

19:15.921 --> 19:17.690
THOSE TO THE LARGER VARIETY

19:17.690 --> 19:19.058
OF CANCERS THAT WE SEE.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.059
>> SO HOW MUCH OF THE SEA

19:20.059 --> 19:21.360
CHANGE IS THIS?

19:21.360 --> 19:22.795
I MEAN WHEN YOU THINK B AS

19:22.795 --> 19:23.963
WE BEGAN THIS CONVERSATION,

19:23.963 --> 19:25.164
IN MY OWN HEAD I WAS

19:25.164 --> 19:26.866
THINKING LUNG CANCER, BREAST

19:26.866 --> 19:28.234
CANCER, COLON CANCER, JUST

19:28.234 --> 19:29.301
LIKE YOU SAID.

19:29.301 --> 19:30.536
NOW ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A

19:30.536 --> 19:31.337
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

19:31.337 --> 19:32.338
APPROACH TO EVEN LOOKING AT

19:32.338 --> 19:33.739
AND LEARNING THESE CANCERS

19:33.739 --> 19:35.207
AND SAYING HERE IS WHAT

19:35.207 --> 19:36.442
MAKES YOU, YOU.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.144
>> HERE IS WHAT MAKES THIS

19:38.144 --> 19:39.178
CANCER QUICK OR GROW.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.312
IT'S A REALLY BIG CHANGE IN

19:40.312 --> 19:41.914
THE WAY THAT WE THINK ABOUT

19:41.914 --> 19:42.314
CANCER.

19:42.314 --> 19:44.350
IT REALLY IS THIS IDEA OF

19:44.350 --> 19:45.718
PRECISION MEDICINE, YOU KNOW,

19:45.718 --> 19:47.086
NOT TREATING ALL PATIENTS

19:47.086 --> 19:48.788
THE SAME BUT TREATING THEIR

19:48.788 --> 19:50.756
INDIVIDUAL CANCERS BASED ON

19:50.756 --> 19:52.858
REALLY DETAILED ANALYSIS.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.226
AND I THINK IT REALLY

19:54.226 --> 19:55.227
REPRESENTS A SEA CHANGE.

19:55.227 --> 19:57.163
AND I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE

19:57.163 --> 19:58.697
IMPRESSION THAT THE ORGAN

19:58.697 --> 20:00.399
WHICH THE CANCER ARISES HAS

20:00.399 --> 20:01.100
NO IMPORTANCE.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.435
AND WHAT WE HAVE ACTUALLY

20:02.435 --> 20:03.869
SEEN IN THESE STUDIES IS

20:03.869 --> 20:05.237
THAT CERTAIN CANCER TYPES

20:05.237 --> 20:07.206
MAY NOT RESPOND THE SAME.

20:07.206 --> 20:11.343
SO A COLON CANCER THAT HAS

20:11.343 --> 20:12.478
A-- MUTATION MAY NOT RESPOND

20:12.478 --> 20:15.414
AS A MELANOMA WITH A B WRAP

20:15.414 --> 20:16.782
MUTATION SO I THINK IT'S A

20:16.782 --> 20:17.616
COMBINATION OF UNDERSTANDING

20:17.616 --> 20:19.185
THE GENETICS IN THE CANCERS

20:19.185 --> 20:20.886
THAT WE TREAT, AND ALSO

20:20.886 --> 20:21.854
UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF

20:21.854 --> 20:23.689
THE ORGAN WHERE THEY COME

20:23.689 --> 20:24.623
FROM.

20:24.623 --> 20:25.191
>> Sreenivasan: THESE

20:25.191 --> 20:26.025
CLINICAL TRIALS, ARE THEY

20:26.025 --> 20:27.393
DIFFERENT THAN THE CLINICAL

20:27.393 --> 20:28.394
TRIALS WE ARE USED TO WHERE

20:28.394 --> 20:30.062
PUN PERSON GETS THE PLACEBO

20:30.062 --> 20:31.430
AND THEY MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT

20:31.430 --> 20:32.431
IMPROVE AND THE OTHER GETS

20:32.431 --> 20:33.165
THE REAL DRUG?

20:33.165 --> 20:34.133
>> I THINK THEY ARE

20:34.133 --> 20:35.201
DIFFERENT IN A VARIETY OF

20:35.201 --> 20:35.534
WAYS.

20:35.534 --> 20:36.902
NUMBER ONE, MOST CLINICAL

20:36.902 --> 20:38.304
TRIALS IN CANCER HAVE

20:38.304 --> 20:39.305
REQUIRED SPECIFIC DISEASE

20:39.305 --> 20:39.638
TYPES.

20:39.638 --> 20:40.639
SO EVERYONE THAT GOES ON

20:40.639 --> 20:43.008
THAT TRIAL HAS ONE TYPE OF

20:43.008 --> 20:43.876
CANCER.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.411
THE CLINICAL TRIALS THAT

20:45.411 --> 20:46.779
WE'RE DOING NOW, SO THE

20:46.779 --> 20:48.814
CALLED BASKET STUDIES, ALLOW

20:48.814 --> 20:49.982
PATIENTS FROM ANY TYPE OF

20:49.982 --> 20:51.183
CANCER TO PARTICIPATE, AS

20:51.183 --> 20:52.685
LONG AS THEY HAVE A MUTATION

20:52.685 --> 20:54.987
IN THEIR TUMOR THAT WE THINK

20:54.987 --> 20:56.021
SUGGESTS THEY WOULD BENEFIT

20:56.021 --> 20:57.990
FROM THE DRUG BEING TESTED.

20:57.990 --> 21:00.159
THE OTHER POINT IS THAT

21:00.159 --> 21:02.027
THESE TRIALS ARE TYPICALLY

21:02.027 --> 21:03.562
NOT RANDOMIZED TRIALS.

21:03.562 --> 21:04.930
MEANING THAT EVERYBODY THAT

21:04.930 --> 21:06.398
PARTICIPATES GETS THE DRUG.

21:06.398 --> 21:08.033
WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE

21:08.033 --> 21:08.400
GETTING.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.735
AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS

21:09.735 --> 21:11.437
THAT THE BENEFIT THAT WE'RE

21:11.437 --> 21:12.805
LOOKING FOR IN THE FORM OF

21:12.805 --> 21:14.306
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS

21:14.306 --> 21:15.875
HAVE SIGNIFICANT SHRINKAGE

21:15.875 --> 21:19.078
OF THEIR TUMOR, IS SO HIGH,

21:19.078 --> 21:20.946
THAT IT'S PREVIOUSLY

21:20.946 --> 21:21.881
UNPRECEDENTED FOR THOSE

21:21.881 --> 21:22.648
DISEASES.

21:22.648 --> 21:23.916
SO WE DON'T REALLY NEED TO

21:23.916 --> 21:25.451
DO RANDOMIZED STUDIES

21:25.451 --> 21:26.485
BECAUSE IF HALF OF THE

21:26.485 --> 21:28.854
PATIENTS OR MORE ARE HAVING

21:28.854 --> 21:30.156
SHRINKAGE OF THEIR TUMOR,

21:30.156 --> 21:31.557
THERE IS REALLY NO QUESTION

21:31.557 --> 21:32.424
THAT THAT TREATMENT IS

21:32.424 --> 21:33.592
BETTER THAN THE ESTABLISHED

21:33.592 --> 21:34.894
CARE.

21:34.894 --> 21:35.828
>> Sreenivasan: DR. DAVID

21:35.828 --> 21:37.530
HYMAN, THANKS SO MUCH.

21:37.530 --> 21:39.598
>> THANK YOU.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.074
>> Sreenivasan: BEFORE WE LEAVE

21:49.074 --> 21:50.009
YOU TONIGHT, MINNIE MINOSO,

21:50.009 --> 21:51.110
KNOWN AS THE "CUBAN COMET" HAS

21:51.110 --> 21:52.611
DIED.

21:52.611 --> 21:53.879
MINOSO MADE HIS BASEBALL DEBUT

21:53.879 --> 21:55.014
IN CLEVELAND IN 1949 AND WAS

21:55.014 --> 21:56.115
LATER TRADED TO THE CHICAGO

21:56.115 --> 21:58.250
WHITE SOX.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.418
MINOSO PLAYED FOR 17 SEASONS,

21:59.418 --> 22:00.719
WAS A NINE-TIME ALL-STAR AND WON

22:00.719 --> 22:02.254
THREE GOLD GLOVES, BUT HE NEVER

22:02.254 --> 22:03.689
MADE THE HALL OF FAME.

22:03.689 --> 22:05.090
MINOSO WAS 90 YEARS OLD.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.392
COMING UP ON THE NEWSHOUR

22:06.392 --> 22:07.660
TOMORROW, THE AFFORDABLE CARE

22:07.660 --> 22:08.727
ACT GOES BACK TO THE SUPREME

22:08.727 --> 22:09.929
COURT THIS WEEK.

22:09.929 --> 22:11.163
AT STAKE ARE SUBSIDIES FOR

22:11.163 --> 22:12.831
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TO STATES

22:12.831 --> 22:14.466
THAT RELY ON THE FEDERAL HEALTH

22:14.466 --> 22:17.036
INSURANCE EXCHANGE.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.704
>> I NEED THIS SUBSIDY.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.473
THIS IS WHAT MAKES ME BE

22:21.473 --> 22:22.775
ABLE TO SUBSIST.

22:22.775 --> 22:24.510
AND IT'S JUST NO WAY I COULD

22:24.510 --> 22:25.878
FUNCTION WITHOUT IT.

22:25.878 --> 22:26.946
>> Sreenivasan: THAT'S IT

22:26.946 --> 22:27.713
FOR THIS EDITION OF PBS NEWSHOUR

22:27.713 --> 22:28.280
WEEKEND.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.348
I'M HARI SREENIVASAN.

22:29.348 --> 22:31.817
THANKS FOR WATCHING.
