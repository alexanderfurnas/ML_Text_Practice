04:29.669 --> 04:31.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR ROLE AND

04:31.638 --> 04:33.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HAPPENED HERE, RIGHT.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS OUR STORY SAID TODAY, THERE

04:35.609 --> 04:37.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS-- IT'S NOT-- U.S.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE HASN'T, YOU KNOW,

04:39.412 --> 04:40.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T FOR INSTANCE, HAVE

04:40.247 --> 04:42.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS ISSUED TO

04:42.616 --> 04:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ACTORS.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY LOOK, I MEAN, I THINK

04:45.752 --> 04:47.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS PART OF THE EMERGING

04:47.888 --> 04:50.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASE THAT THE C.I.A. AND OTHER

04:50.190 --> 04:52.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPY AGENCIES ARE REALLY BUSY

04:52.092 --> 04:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSEMBLING, AND THEIR

04:53.426 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDENTIFICATION OF THESE ACTORS

04:55.128 --> 04:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS A REALLY CRITICAL

04:56.062 --> 04:56.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BREAKTHROUGH.

04:56.963 --> 04:57.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: LET'S TALK ABOUT

04:57.697 --> 04:58.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE AGENCIES.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE C.I.A. HAS WEIGHED IN.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DIRECTOR OF THE N.S.A.,

05:02.068 --> 05:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMIRAL ROGERS, TOLD THE "WALL

STREET JOURNAL" LAST MONTH

05:05.205 --> 05:07.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WIKILEAKS THAT "IT WAS A

SPECIFIC EFFECT."

05:11.745 --> 05:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ABOUT THE F.B.I.?

05:14.414 --> 05:16.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE F.B.I. IS-- IS-- IS

05:16.750 --> 05:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LITTLE HARDER TO UNDERSTAND

05:18.218 --> 05:19.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THEY ARE ON THIS.

05:19.319 --> 05:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THERE'S BEEN LOTS OF

05:20.253 --> 05:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECULATION ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS

05:23.223 --> 05:25.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS THAT

05:25.325 --> 05:26.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE UNDER WAY DURING THE

05:26.626 --> 05:28.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION, BUT A LOT OF THAT

05:28.261 --> 05:30.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY REMAINS MURKY.

05:30.564 --> 05:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTOR COMEY, NOTABLY, DID NOT

05:33.333 --> 05:36.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGN OFF-- AT LEAST PUBLICLY--

05:36.036 --> 05:38.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE LETTER THAT THE DIRECTOR

05:38.038 --> 05:39.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND

05:39.306 --> 05:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIRECTOR OF HOMELAND SECURITY

05:40.607 --> 05:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUED IN LATE OCTOBER, ACCUSING

05:43.276 --> 05:45.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA, CONFRONTING RUSSIA, WITH

05:45.445 --> 05:46.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS KIND OF INTERVENTION.

05:46.947 --> 05:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT'S PARTLY

05:47.814 --> 05:49.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THE F.B.I. IS STILL

05:49.082 --> 05:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PURSUING THIS CASE.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S STILL TRYING TO ASSEMBLE A

05:51.418 --> 05:52.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF THIS INFORMATION AND IS

05:52.686 --> 05:54.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO STAY OUT OF THE

05:54.988 --> 05:56.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL FRAY THAT IS QUICKLY

05:56.823 --> 05:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENVELOPING THIS STORY.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: LET'S TALK ABOUT

05:59.426 --> 06:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POLITICS OF THIS.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT ANY POINT DURING THIS TIME,

06:02.829 --> 06:04.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID ANY OF THE AGENCIES OR

06:04.097 --> 06:05.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ADMINISTRATION OR ANYBODY

06:05.599 --> 06:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THESE

06:07.067 --> 06:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAKS REALIZE ALL THESE LEAKS

06:09.569 --> 06:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE ABOUT THE D.N.C., NOT THE

06:11.571 --> 06:13.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
R.N.C.?

06:13.006 --> 06:13.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT WASN'T LOST ON

06:13.974 --> 06:16.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC LAWMAKERS.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF YOU ADD UP, IF YOU STACK UP

06:18.011 --> 06:19.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE MATERIAL THAT HAS BEEN

06:19.179 --> 06:20.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELEASED HERE, IT ENDS UP ON ONE

06:20.981 --> 06:22.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIDE OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, HOW CAN YOU NOT DRAW THE

06:24.150 --> 06:25.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCLUSION THAT RUSSIA WAS

06:25.352 --> 06:27.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO STEER TO A PARTICULAR

06:27.220 --> 06:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTCOME HERE?

06:28.221 --> 06:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THE INTELLIGENCE

06:29.155 --> 06:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGENCIES WERE RELUCTANT TO MAKE

06:31.491 --> 06:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT LEAP UNTIL THEY HAD ENOUGH

06:33.526 --> 06:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVIDENCE TO BACK THAT UP, AND I

06:34.961 --> 06:35.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE STARTING

06:35.996 --> 06:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SEE NOW.

06:37.030 --> 06:37.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Thompson: SO WHAT COMES

06:37.831 --> 06:39.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEXT IN TERMS OF THE OBAMA

ADMINISTRATION'S CALLS FOR AN

06:40.634 --> 06:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTIGATION BY JANUARY 20?

06:43.903 --> 06:44.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I MEAN, TO ME-- THIS IS A

06:44.804 --> 06:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY INTERESTING TIME BECAUSE

06:46.806 --> 06:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS SETS UP A BIG SHOWDOWN.

06:50.043 --> 06:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE YOU HAVE AN OUTGOING

06:52.178 --> 06:54.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION ASSEMBLING A--

06:54.948 --> 06:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO ASSEMBLE A CONSENSUS

DETERMINATION ON RUSSIA'S ROLE

07:00.587 --> 07:02.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THIS PAST ELECTION, SOMETHING

07:02.022 --> 07:03.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT YOU CAN'T REALLY ARGUE

07:03.390 --> 07:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH, SOMETHING SO COMPELLING

07:05.191 --> 07:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT WILL OVERRIDE ALL OF THE

07:06.826 --> 07:07.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION.

07:07.827 --> 07:08.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S SETTING IT UP SO IT

07:08.795 --> 07:10.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL DELIVER THIS JUST AS THIS

07:10.297 --> 07:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW PRESIDENT IS SWORN IN, WHO

07:12.799 --> 07:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS DISMISSED THIS FROM THE VERY

07:14.567 --> 07:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEGINNING.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO TO ME, IT'S JUST A-- A

07:16.903 --> 07:19.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FASCINATING SHOWDOWN THAT AWAITS

07:19.739 --> 07:20.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:39.693 --> 07:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME DRAMATIC CHANGES DURING THE

LAST 20 YEARS.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

EARLIER THIS WEEK, I SPOKE WITH

08:04.050 --> 08:05.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL OF THE

SIR, WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST

08:13.293 --> 08:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIFT IN ATTITUDES IN THE PAST

08:15.261 --> 08:16.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
20 YEARS?

08:16.763 --> 08:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT IS INTERESTING IS WHEN

08:19.532 --> 08:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU COMPARE WHAT WAS SAID BY

08:21.000 --> 08:23.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE ACROSS THE WORLD IN 1999,

08:23.370 --> 08:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE TELLING US

08:24.704 --> 08:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY, YOU SEE TWO BIG SHIFTS.

08:26.606 --> 08:28.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE IS VERY CLEARLY RELATED TO

08:28.575 --> 08:32.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO

08:32.379 --> 08:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIANS, PEOPLE AFFECTED BY

08:34.647 --> 08:34.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT

08:36.349 --> 08:37.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, THEY ARE DEEPLY CONVINCED

08:37.751 --> 08:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF

08:39.052 --> 08:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR APPLIES AND SHOULD APPLY,

08:40.720 --> 08:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE SHOULD BE NO

08:42.622 --> 08:43.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCEPTIONS.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIANS SHOULD BE PROTECTED,

08:45.125 --> 08:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEALTH CARE SHOULD BE PROTECTED,

08:47.827 --> 08:48.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMANITARIANS SHOULD BE

08:48.695 --> 08:49.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTED.

08:49.095 --> 08:50.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEREAS PEOPLE IN COUNTRIES LIKE

08:50.130 --> 08:52.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S., U.K., FRANCE, EVEN

08:52.065 --> 08:53.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHINA AND RUSSIA, THEY ARE MAYBE

08:53.767 --> 08:55.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT AS ADAMANT AS THEY WERE

08:55.301 --> 08:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE SHIFTS.

08:57.504 --> 08:59.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE OTHER SHIFT IS CLEARLY

08:59.539 --> 09:02.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATED TO TORTURE IN TERMS OF

09:02.175 --> 09:04.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE ACCEPTING THAT IN SOME

09:04.978 --> 09:06.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION, TORTURE IS POSSIBLE.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: LET'S DRILL DOWN A

09:08.181 --> 09:09.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE BIT ON SOME OF THOSE

09:09.783 --> 09:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBJECTS AND SOME OF THOSE

09:10.784 --> 09:11.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBERS.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPORT, OBVIOUSLY,

09:12.252 --> 09:13.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGHLIGHTED THE CHANGING

09:13.820 --> 09:15.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTITUDE TOWARDS CIVILIANS, BUT

09:15.155 --> 09:17.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS VERY DIFFERENT, FENDING

09:17.357 --> 09:19.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE COUNTRY WHERE'S THE

09:19.225 --> 09:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION WAS ASKED.

09:20.760 --> 09:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
78% OF PEOPLE IN CONFLICT ZONES

09:22.195 --> 09:23.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY ATTACKING POPULATED AREAS IS

09:23.863 --> 09:24.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRONG.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHEN THAT QUESTION WAS ASKED

09:26.199 --> 09:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE PERMANENT FIVE IT'S

09:27.300 --> 09:29.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES, THE U.K., FRANCE,

09:29.002 --> 09:30.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA, AND CHINA-- THAT NUMBER

09:30.770 --> 09:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DROPS TO 50%.

09:32.138 --> 09:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THIS TREND ACROSS THE REPORT

09:34.340 --> 09:36.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THE P-5 HAVE A DIFFERENT

09:36.443 --> 09:37.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTITUDE VERSUS COUNTRY WHERE'S

09:37.310 --> 09:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S ACTUALLY CONFLICT?

09:38.845 --> 09:41.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, YOU CAN START TO SEE A

09:41.047 --> 09:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REAL SHIFT BETWEEN THE PUBLIC

09:42.782 --> 09:44.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPINION OF THE PEOPLE DIRECTLY

09:44.451 --> 09:47.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFECTED BY WAR AND PEOPLE IN

09:47.987 --> 09:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE P-5 SECURITY COUNCIL

09:50.423 --> 09:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY.

09:50.790 --> 09:51.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YES, THERE ARE ELEMENTS

09:51.825 --> 09:54.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE YOU SEE A BIT OF A

09:54.461 --> 09:54.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENCE.

09:54.861 --> 09:58.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THERE IS CONSISTENCE,

09:58.531 --> 09:59.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE THINK HEALTH CARE IS A

09:59.632 --> 10:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT THAT NEEDS TO BE GIVEN TO

10:00.867 --> 10:01.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.602 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYBODY WILL SAY THAT.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WILL ALSO SAY CIVILIANS

10:03.970 --> 10:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED TO BE PROTECTED IN GENERAL.

10:05.171 --> 10:06.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ON SPECIFICS, IT'S TRUE, YOU

10:06.806 --> 10:08.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN START TO SEE THAT MAYBE THE

10:08.308 --> 10:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT, MAYBE THE

10:10.076 --> 10:11.277 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT, ALSO WHAT

10:11.277 --> 10:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENS THE LAST 15 YEARS, MEANS

10:12.812 --> 10:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PEOPLE ARE MAYBE MORE

10:15.181 --> 10:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOLERANT IN COUNTRIES LIKE U.K.,

10:17.183 --> 10:19.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANCE, U.S., ABOUT CASUALTIES

10:19.152 --> 10:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN IT COMES TO CIVILIAN IN

10:21.254 --> 10:21.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: ONE OF THE VERY

10:22.655 --> 10:23.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING QUESTIONS IN THE

10:23.890 --> 10:27.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORT WAS ABOUT THE ATTACKING

10:27.360 --> 10:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELIGIOUS SITES AND HISTORICAL

10:28.995 --> 10:30.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONUMENTS AND HOW STRONGLY

10:30.430 --> 10:31.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE FELT THAT THAT WAS WRONG,

10:31.564 --> 10:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THAT WAS NOT A PART OF WAR.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS SURPRISED TO LEARN, I HAVE

10:35.835 --> 10:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SAY, THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

10:37.737 --> 10:38.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT CERTAIN MONUMENTS AND

10:38.872 --> 10:40.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HISTORIC SITES WERE ACTUALLY

10:40.473 --> 10:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTED UNDER THE LAWS OF WAR.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> BECAUSE IT IS ABOUT PEOPLE,

10:44.210 --> 10:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS ABOUT THE CULTURE, IT'S SO

10:46.379 --> 10:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTRAL TO ALL OF US.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S VERY TRUE TO SEE THAT

10:49.949 --> 10:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, DESPITE

10:51.784 --> 10:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE'VE SEEN-- OR MAYBE

10:53.820 --> 10:56.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OF WHAT WE'VE SEEN RIGHT

10:56.089 --> 10:57.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW IN THE MIDDLE EAST-- FEEL

10:57.357 --> 10:59.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY STRONGLY, THIS MONUMENT,

10:59.058 --> 11:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS CULTURE NEEDS TO BE

11:00.226 --> 11:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTED WHATSOEVER.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, BY THE WAY, IT'S

11:03.096 --> 11:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY ARE

11:03.897 --> 11:05.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THE SAME ABOUT HEALTH

11:05.765 --> 11:06.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARE.

11:06.099 --> 11:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M QUITE AMAZED BECAUSE YOU SEE

11:07.600 --> 11:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND THE WORLD, AT LEAST ONE

11:08.868 --> 11:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE PLACES AND THINGS WE ARE

11:11.504 --> 11:15.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WORRIED ABOUT, IS TO SEE

11:15.074 --> 11:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOSPITAL, HEALTH CARE WORKERS

11:16.009 --> 11:16.676 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUE TO BE ATTACKED.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: THE NUMBERS ARE

11:17.610 --> 11:18.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY CLEAR.

11:18.745 --> 11:21.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
82% OF RESPONDENTS SAY ATTACKING

11:21.047 --> 11:21.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOSPITALS, AMBULANCES, AND

11:21.881 --> 11:22.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEALTH CARE WORKERS IS WRONG,

11:22.916 --> 11:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT NUMBER EVEN JUMP

11:25.552 --> 11:27.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGHER, OBVIOUSLY, IN PLACES

11:27.487 --> 11:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THERE ARE CONFLICTS.

11:28.521 --> 11:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS AN INTERESTING TWIST,

11:30.256 --> 11:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGH.

11:30.723 --> 11:32.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS A QUESTION ASKED ABOUT

11:32.792 --> 11:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDING HEALTH CARE TO THE

11:33.526 --> 11:34.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER, TO THE ENEMY.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THE NUMBERS SHIFT.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY GO DOWN, CORRECT?

11:37.664 --> 11:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT IS CORRECT, YES.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT AGAIN IN EVERY COUNTRY, BUT

11:41.501 --> 11:43.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S VERY CLEAR WHEN PEOPLE ASK,

11:43.036 --> 11:47.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"YOU CAN PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN

11:47.273 --> 11:48.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSISTANCE, HEALTH CARE

11:48.174 --> 11:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASSISTANCE TO PEOPLE AFFECTED,"

11:50.209 --> 11:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WILL SAY YES.

11:51.844 --> 11:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THEY START TO SAY CAN YOU

11:53.846 --> 11:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO THAT TO YOUR ENEMY

11:55.915 --> 11:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMBATANTS PEOPLE ARE MORE

11:57.550 --> 11:57.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORRIED.

11:57.984 --> 11:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DEPENDS ON THE COUNTRY.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S VERY INTERESTING TO LOOK AT

12:01.921 --> 12:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFGHANISTAN FOR EXAMPLE OR SYRIA

12:04.557 --> 12:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR YEMEN WHERE PEOPLE STRONGLY

12:06.259 --> 12:08.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE THE WOUNDED, WHENEVER

12:08.127 --> 12:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SIDE THIS PERSON COULD BE,

12:09.495 --> 12:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEEDS TO RECEIVE HEALTH CARE.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEREAS AGAIN, IN SOME COUNTRY,

12:14.100 --> 12:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE ARE A LITTLE BIT MORE

12:16.102 --> 12:16.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELUCTANT, AND MAYBE AGAIN, THIS

12:16.970 --> 12:21.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS PART OF WHAT THEY SEE THROUGH

12:21.574 --> 12:22.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:24.777 --> 12:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH THEY ARE MAYBE EXPOSED TO,

12:25.979 --> 12:27.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE MAYBE YOU FEEL THE OTHER

12:27.947 --> 12:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS-- IS SOMEBODY THAT YOU DON'T

12:29.682 --> 12:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED ANY MORE TO PROTECT.

12:31.050 --> 12:33.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S, I MUST SAY, THE

12:33.086 --> 12:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORRYING TREND.

AND IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE

12:38.791 --> 12:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A LITTLEIT OF SHIFT

12:41.094 --> 12:42.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

12:42.762 --> 12:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO-THIRD OF RESPONDENTS, 66%

12:45.064 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID IT WAS WRONG, BUT A THIRD

12:47.367 --> 12:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVED CAPTURED ENEMY

12:49.235 --> 12:51.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OBTAIN MILITARY INFORMATION.

12:51.971 --> 12:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES' FIG OUR THIS

13:00.413 --> 13:02.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE NUMBERS AND THAT SHIFT.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK WE HAVE ALWAYS TO

13:04.150 --> 13:05.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK AT TWO ISSUES.

13:05.585 --> 13:06.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE, I THINK IT'S POSITIVE TO

13:06.686 --> 13:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THAT OVERALL, PEOPLE STILL

13:08.554 --> 13:10.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEEL TORTURE IS SOMETHING

13:10.590 --> 13:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOTALLY WRONG, AND I THINK MORE

13:12.158 --> 13:13.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN TWO-THIRDS OF PEOPLE,

13:13.760 --> 13:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDING PEOPLE EXPOSED ON--

13:15.128 --> 13:16.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, ON THE DAILY LIFE AT

13:16.729 --> 13:18.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS HAPPENING IN WAR, STILL

13:18.898 --> 13:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEEL TORTURE IS ABSOLUTELY

13:20.466 --> 13:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRONG.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING IS--

13:22.068 --> 13:24.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S THE OTHER ISSUE--

13:24.037 --> 13:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS WHEN YOU ASK MORE SPECIFIC

13:26.739 --> 13:27.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTIONS, IT'S TRUE.

13:27.507 --> 13:29.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SEE A GROWING TOLERANCE IN

13:29.542 --> 13:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFIC COUNTRY.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU MENTION NIGERIA, ISRAEL, BUT

13:32.845 --> 13:36.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO THE U.S., WHEN IT COMES TO

13:36.482 --> 13:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TORTURING AN ENEMY COMBATANT TO

13:38.551 --> 13:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET INFORMATION YOU SEE PEOPLE

13:39.719 --> 13:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE MORE OPEN TO THAT.

13:41.087 --> 13:43.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK MAYBE ONE OF THE REASONS

13:43.289 --> 13:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS BECAUSE PEOPLE FEEL ON THAT

13:45.024 --> 13:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASE IT WILL MAYBE HELP TO SAVE

13:47.093 --> 13:48.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS WHAT THEY'VE SEEN IN THE

13:49.662 --> 13:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDIA, RIGHT?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF I LOOK AT THE LAST 10 YEARS,

13:53.800 --> 13:55.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO MANY TIMES WHERE YOU TORTURE

13:55.201 --> 13:56.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ENEMY TO GET INFORMATION.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ON THE OTHER HAND, WE KNOW

13:58.004 --> 13:59.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TORTURE TO GET INFORMATION

13:59.105 --> 14:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS ABSOLUTELY NOT THE RIGHT WAY

14:00.173 --> 14:02.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GO, NOT ONLY MORALLY, NOT

14:02.141 --> 14:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY LEGALLY, BUT IT DOESN'T

14:04.844 --> 14:06.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION YOU

14:06.446 --> 14:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL GIVE

14:07.447 --> 14:08.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU INFORMATION THEY HAVE JUST

14:08.514 --> 14:09.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO NOT SUFFER.

14:09.615 --> 14:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT STILL, PEOPLE IN SOME

14:10.850 --> 14:12.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES FEEL THAT SOMEWHAT

14:12.151 --> 14:12.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ALLOWED.

14:12.952 --> 14:13.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK MAYBE THIS IS

14:13.653 --> 14:14.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING WHICH NEEDS TO BE

14:14.721 --> 14:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCUSSED AND NEED TO HAVE A

14:15.855 --> 14:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBATE ABOUT, WHY PEOPLE TODAY

14:17.490 --> 14:18.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK, AT LEAST IN CERTAIN

14:18.558 --> 14:20.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES, THAT YOU CAN TORTURE

14:20.259 --> 14:21.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN ENEMY COMBATANT.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: I HATE TO USE THE

14:23.963 --> 14:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHRASE "WAR FATIGUE" BUT IN

14:26.199 --> 14:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCUSSING THIS REPORT, READING

14:27.200 --> 14:29.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS REPORT, I WONDER IF IT IS

14:29.268 --> 14:30.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FATIGUE ABOUT WAR.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE HAD THESE LONG, ENDLESS

14:32.705 --> 14:34.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFLICTS THAT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE

14:34.073 --> 14:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SOME SITUATIONS, THAT THAT

14:35.842 --> 14:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS HAD AN IMPACT ON THE WAY

14:37.510 --> 14:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT WAR AND WHAT'S

14:39.879 --> 14:41.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCEPTABLE AND WHAT ISN'T.

14:41.681 --> 14:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:42.682 --> 14:43.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THERE IS MAYBE A

14:43.783 --> 14:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT DYNAMIC.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT IS TRUE, PEOPLE,

14:45.885 --> 14:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE HERE IN

14:46.853 --> 14:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR COUNTRY, WE ARE RATHER SAFE,

14:49.055 --> 14:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT?

14:49.388 --> 14:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE FEEL THAT SOMEWHAT THE WAR

14:52.425 --> 14:53.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTAINED FURTHER AND NOT

14:53.392 --> 14:55.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOUCHING US, AND POSSIBLY, WE

14:55.595 --> 14:57.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE TIRED WITH WHAT IS HAPPENING

14:57.296 --> 14:59.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW IN SOME OF THE

14:59.599 --> 15:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES THAT WE KNOW FROM A

15:01.167 --> 15:03.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG TIME-- AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ,

15:03.703 --> 15:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW SYRIA.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE FEELING IS IT'S LASTING

15:05.838 --> 15:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WILL CONTINUE TO LAST.

15:07.106 --> 15:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I DO UNDERSTAND THAT

15:10.076 --> 15:11.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL, "WHY

15:11.577 --> 15:11.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTHER?"

15:11.944 --> 15:14.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, IT'S FAR AWAY.

15:14.147 --> 15:15.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE OTHER HAND, WHAT I FOUND

15:15.882 --> 15:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND IS

15:18.751 --> 15:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THESE ISSUES WILL LESS AND

15:20.386 --> 15:21.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESS BE CONTAINED THERE.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE LESS AND LESS TAINTING

15:23.689 --> 15:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR OWN REALITY.

15:24.791 --> 15:25.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK AT MIGRATION.

15:25.792 --> 15:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PEOPLE ARE COMING TO US ARE

15:28.394 --> 15:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCED TO MIGRATE BECAUSE IN

15:31.130 --> 15:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THERE IS WAR.

15:32.398 --> 15:33.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IN FACT THE WAR OF LAW

15:33.432 --> 15:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS NOT RESPECTED.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO EVEN YOU DON'T BOTHER

15:36.302 --> 15:37.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEWHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING THERE

15:37.537 --> 15:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS AN INFLUENCE OVER YOU.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK WE WILL HAVE TO GET

15:40.540 --> 15:44.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
