JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: A
bestselling novelist
takes on war crimes.

00:04.333 --> 00:08.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown has our
latest addition to the
"NewsHour" Bookshelf.

00:08.133 --> 00:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: In 2004,
400 people were rounded
up from their homes in
a village in Bosnia,

00:14.300 --> 00:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and buried alive in
an old coal mine.

00:15.766 --> 00:18.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But did this mass
killing really happen?

00:18.333 --> 00:20.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, if so, who were
the perpetrators?

00:20.700 --> 00:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those questions must be decided
at the International Criminal
Court in the Netherlands.

00:25.400 --> 00:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the setting for a new legal
thriller titled "Testimony"
and a new setting for acclaimed

00:30.033 --> 00:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
author Scott Turow, the attorney
and writer whose work has sold
more than 30 million copies

00:36.233 --> 00:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
since his debut novel,
"Presumed Innocent."

00:38.400 --> 00:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to name all the
other bestsellers, Scott, but
it's nice to talk to you here.

00:41.533 --> 00:44.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW, Author,
"Testimony": Jeff, it's
nice to talk to you.

00:44.100 --> 00:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have
left behind the fictional
Kindle County, the
setting that many of us

00:47.400 --> 00:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are familiar with, that place
that's sort of familiar,
for a much broader palette.

00:50.800 --> 00:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why?

00:54.000 --> 00:56.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: You know, I
just sort of accumulated
a writer's bucket list,
and one of the things,

00:56.600 --> 01:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years ago, that I decided I
would write about at some point
is the International Criminal

01:01.066 --> 01:04.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Court and The Hague,
just because I had never
read anything set there.

01:04.533 --> 01:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you started
with the idea of the court.

01:06.966 --> 01:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: I did, for sure.

01:08.600 --> 01:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Something
intrigued you about
those kinds of trials?

01:10.666 --> 01:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: I had been in The
Hague in the year 2000, and
had found myself at a party

01:16.400 --> 01:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
surrounded by a bunch
of American lawyers
who were saying, you
have got to write about

01:19.366 --> 01:21.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this place.

01:21.333 --> 01:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And unlike most times when
people have ideas about Aunt
Tilly's watch or their divorce,

01:27.833 --> 01:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this sounded like it
would actually make an
interesting setting.

01:30.733 --> 01:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You have
the legal background,
and you're an attorney.

01:33.766 --> 01:37.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
How much research goes
into all of these -- the
stories that you write?

01:37.433 --> 01:39.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: A lot.

01:39.133 --> 01:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm a year off my usual
cycle, because I went to
the Netherlands twice.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I went to Bosnia once.

01:45.766 --> 01:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had a lot to learn about
first the court, even more to
learn about the Roma people,

01:53.800 --> 01:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, of course, the Bosnian
conflict, about which I
was inexcusably ignorant.

02:00.466 --> 02:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, this
is set in the aftermath
of the Bosnian War.

02:03.133 --> 02:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

02:05.100 --> 02:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's
about a group of Roma,
often known as gypsies...

02:07.233 --> 02:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

02:08.700 --> 02:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: ... who
are still living there...

02:09.500 --> 02:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

02:10.733 --> 02:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: ...
but resettled there.

02:11.533 --> 02:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Yes.

02:13.966 --> 02:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Resettled in the
fictional world, resettled
after the Bosnian War,
driven out of Kosovo,

02:20.266 --> 02:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and have chosen to live right
near the American NATO bases
in Bosnia, which were there for

02:28.000 --> 02:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a decade after the war to
sort of keep the peace.

02:30.633 --> 02:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So you
have this big story.

02:32.333 --> 02:34.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have this history.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the way in, as always,
is a particular character.

02:37.166 --> 02:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In this case,
a lawyer from Kindle County.

02:41.133 --> 02:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: From Kindle County.

02:42.133 --> 02:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

02:43.633 --> 02:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: The former U.S.
attorney in Kindle County.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A very successful
man, who - - but is unfulfilled.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

02:48.800 --> 02:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thrown his life up for grabs,
says that he has never felt
fully at home with himself.

02:54.933 --> 02:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that helps explain why
he'd be willing to leave the
United States to work overseas.

03:01.433 --> 03:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And is that
the way in for you, really?

03:03.533 --> 03:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: What interested
me was when I found that the
United States Congress had

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passed a law called the U.S.
Service-Members Protection Act,
which says that the president

03:15.466 --> 03:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has authority to forcibly
rescue anybody -- any
American serviceman charged
before the International

03:21.300 --> 03:22.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Criminal Court.

03:22.800 --> 03:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, of course, the novelist
says, ah, good, conflict.

03:27.200 --> 03:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the idea of an American
prosecutor investigating,
among other suspects, American

03:34.633 --> 03:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
service members was
immediately interesting.

03:38.500 --> 03:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We can't go into
all the details of this plot
here, but, I mean, it's fair

03:42.833 --> 03:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say that the book continues
what I think I can call your
own complicated relationship

03:49.333 --> 03:50.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the law?

03:50.333 --> 03:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Yes, I think so.

03:52.400 --> 03:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, as a
kind of a both noble calling,
but also the -- what's the

03:55.600 --> 03:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
word, a tawdriness, in
some ways of the law.

03:58.266 --> 04:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

04:00.300 --> 04:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There cannot be any greater
challenge to the law than
trying to adjudicate mass crimes

04:07.133 --> 04:08.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like war crimes.

04:08.133 --> 04:10.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

04:10.233 --> 04:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I keep thinking, in your work
and in this one, that most of
us look at the legal system

04:13.066 --> 04:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a way to get at the truth.

04:15.300 --> 04:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think of it as that,
or as a way to get at a truth,
or what's going on there,

04:22.800 --> 04:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and what is it that
helps translates for
you as a novelist?

04:25.633 --> 04:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Well, you know,
I really think of the trial
of a lawsuit as an exercise in

04:29.800 --> 04:31.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

04:31.833 --> 04:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And people are offering
competing visions of what
happened in the past.

04:38.266 --> 04:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the justice system
is willing to accept
either of those competing
visions and to impose

04:47.100 --> 04:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consequences as a result.

04:49.833 --> 04:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you think of it that way,
it's a little bit startling,
because we want to believe

04:53.500 --> 04:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there is one truth and,
therefore, one justice, whereas,
if you have practiced law

05:00.533 --> 05:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as long as I have, you realize
that there is actually a
range of acceptable outcomes.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, truth these days
is a kind of fraught concept.

05:07.666 --> 05:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Yes, it's...

05:09.766 --> 05:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But it always
has been -- it sounds like
it always has been for you.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Well, it
is in the courtroom.

05:12.866 --> 05:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it was frustrating
for me as a prosecutor.

05:16.300 --> 05:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I wrote "Presumed Innocent"
originally, I didn't say
who had committed the crime.

05:23.066 --> 05:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I had a long heart-to-heart
with myself about the
purpose of the mystery.

05:28.433 --> 05:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one thing the mystery does
is deliver to us a certainty
that life and the courtroom

05:32.600 --> 05:33.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very often can't.

05:33.866 --> 05:36.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Has
that continued?

05:36.200 --> 05:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I actually saw an
interview where you said, "I'm
a big believer in the fact

05:39.600 --> 05:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that all authors really
write only one book."

05:42.433 --> 05:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: Right.

05:43.433 --> 05:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think that's true.

05:45.400 --> 05:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the older I get, the
more I'm trying to figure
out what the book is and why.

05:49.233 --> 05:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I know that, in a
book like "Testimony,"
issues like identity are
enormously important.

05:55.533 --> 06:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No character is fully at home.

06:00.433 --> 06:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have a hard time isolating
what it is in myself that
makes me so fascinated with

06:06.933 --> 06:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that theme, because I
came from a normal upper
middle-class family.

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet, as I look back at my
books, the uses of power, issues
of identity, they have -- it's

06:19.566 --> 06:20.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recurrent.

06:20.566 --> 06:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It happens again and again.

06:22.633 --> 06:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, a lot of
people continue to read your one
book in its many forms, right?

06:26.200 --> 06:27.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:27.200 --> 06:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Fortunately for me.

06:28.200 --> 06:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Good for you.

06:29.333 --> 06:30.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SCOTT TUROW: I'm
grateful to all of them.

06:30.566 --> 06:31.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The new
one is "Testimony."

06:31.800 --> 06:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Scott Turow, nice
to talk to you.

06:32.466 --> 06:33.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

06:33.966 --> 06:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT TUROW: Jeff, it's
good to talk to you, too.
