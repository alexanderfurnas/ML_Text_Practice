JUDY WOODRUFF: One week
ago, Iraqi Prime Minister
Haider al-Abadi proclaimed
victory over ISIS

00:06.766 --> 00:08.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Mosul.

00:08.800 --> 00:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But reality on the
ground is different, as
the fight continues in
parts of the Old City

00:11.900 --> 00:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
against ISIS holdouts.

00:13.933 --> 00:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As special correspondent
Marcia Biggs and videographer
Alessandro Pavone report, the

00:20.166 --> 00:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
human toll of the fighting
is becoming apparent.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it is horrific.

00:24.533 --> 00:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A warning: Many viewers may
find images and accounts
in this story disturbing.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: This is
what so-called liberated
Mosul looks and sounds
like, in a small pocket

00:44.400 --> 00:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Old City, the war
against ISIS seemingly ongoing.

00:48.600 --> 00:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is the Old City
from ground level, a scene
of utter devastation,
entire neighborhoods

00:57.700 --> 01:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
flattened by coalition
airstrikes, leaving
the few survivors to
search for the remains

01:03.433 --> 01:06.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of their loved ones.

01:06.100 --> 01:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bashar and Ali's families were
together in this house hit
by an airstrike 28 days ago.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ali names the dead one by one.

01:14.633 --> 01:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALI, Mosul Resident (through
translator): My mother, three
brothers, three sisters,

01:20.866 --> 01:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my father, two
sisters-in-law, two nieces.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And you're the
only one left from your family.

01:25.633 --> 01:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALI (through translator): Yes.

01:27.166 --> 01:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Shu Bedak Tamel,
what are you going to do now?

01:29.633 --> 01:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
What can I do?

01:31.700 --> 01:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just want to take the
bodies out and bury them.

01:34.200 --> 01:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Mosul is the
capital of Nineveh Province and
it is the men of Nineveh's civil

01:41.133 --> 01:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defense unit that are
responsible for pulling
the dead out of the rubble.

01:46.333 --> 01:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They arrive with their crude
tools, an ancient jackhammer,
a broken sledgehammer, and when

01:52.566 --> 01:57.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all else fails, they
use their hands.

01:59.566 --> 02:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the family members is
adamant that the family is
under this spot in a washroom.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"Just open the hole,"
this family member says.

02:08.500 --> 02:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But trying to drill through
over a foot of concrete proves
impossible and one of the

02:13.400 --> 02:16.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relatives finds another
way into the house.

02:16.266 --> 02:19.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So we enter the
ruins in the dark.

02:19.000 --> 02:22.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So this was the washroom
they were talking about.

02:22.100 --> 02:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's saying there's
a baby inside.

02:26.400 --> 02:31.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
In total, they are
looking for 18 bodies.

02:31.200 --> 02:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were two families in the
adjoining houses that night.

02:34.600 --> 02:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bashar lost six members of
his family, including his
wife and four children.

02:39.366 --> 02:44.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASHAR, Mosul Resident (through
translator): We tried to
escape the day before, but ISIS

02:44.966 --> 02:46.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shot at us.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We ran back to the house and
the army told us, stay inside.

02:48.900 --> 02:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will evacuate you when
we make the area safe.

02:51.866 --> 02:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the next morning, the
airstrike hit our house.

02:54.300 --> 02:56.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There were two bombs.

02:56.033 --> 03:00.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Were you
in the house when the
explosion happened?

03:00.266 --> 03:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BASHAR (through translator):
Yes, but I was near the
front door of this house.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was the only one who
didn't get injured, along
with my neighbor's family.

03:06.666 --> 03:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And my youngest daughter
was rescued by the army.

03:09.233 --> 03:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's still alive.

03:11.166 --> 03:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The
remnants of life that
night are frozen in time.

03:17.266 --> 03:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Food sits uneaten on
the kitchen counter, but
the clock still runs.

03:22.300 --> 03:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hours pass, then
finally a breakthrough.

03:24.300 --> 03:26.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's a skull.

03:26.033 --> 03:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So they're telling me
they have no idea who
that little girl was.

03:29.400 --> 03:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were six or seven little
girls in that room, and the
body is so decomposed, all there

03:33.800 --> 03:35.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is, is a skull.

03:35.700 --> 03:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The search for remains
lasts all day, with
relatives waiting nervously.

03:41.966 --> 03:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"God protect them,"
this one says.

03:48.366 --> 03:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They found four bodies
out of 18, 14 left to go.

03:51.633 --> 03:53.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The smell of death
is unbearable.

03:53.433 --> 03:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the members of Mosul's civil
defense, it's an ordinary day.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The day before, they pulled
19 bodies from the rubble.

04:02.733 --> 04:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rabih Mishaal Mohamed is a
sergeant with the unit, all of
whom are working without pay.

04:10.033 --> 04:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RABIH MISHAAL MOHAMED,
Sergeant (through translator):
The hardest part is when
you see a child under

04:12.600 --> 04:15.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the rubble because he is
innocent, he is a child.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has nothing to do with
the army or ISIS or anyone.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Why
do you do this?

04:20.666 --> 04:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RABIH MISHAAL MOHAMED (through
translator): It is very
difficult for us, but they are

04:23.433 --> 04:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like family, our brothers our
fathers, mothers, friends.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If we don't take their bodies
out, who will come and do that?

04:29.900 --> 04:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So we withstand it.

04:31.333 --> 04:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to withstand it.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Withstand
it, they must.

04:35.866 --> 04:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a scene that will play
out again and again in the
days to come, a tiny sliver of

04:44.466 --> 04:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
comfort to the families,
who are clinging to what
little they can find.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
