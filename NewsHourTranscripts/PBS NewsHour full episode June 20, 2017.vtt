JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.500 --> 00:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
a looming deadline to
pass a health care bill.
Republicans scramble

00:13.200 --> 00:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to rally votes, but many
senators on both sides of the
aisle say they, and the public,

00:17.966 --> 00:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are being kept in the dark.

00:20.500 --> 00:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: a tragic homecoming.
American Otto Warmbier
dies after being flown
in a coma out of North

00:27.000 --> 00:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korea -- what it means for U.S.
relations with the Asian country
and for the three Americans

00:32.733 --> 00:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still being held there.

00:35.366 --> 00:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, young people and
social media. One school
district wades into the
tricky task of monitoring

00:41.400 --> 00:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
online activity without
infringing on students' privacy.

00:44.633 --> 00:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHAD MARLOW, American
Civil Liberties Union:
It is very important to
draw the line between

00:48.300 --> 00:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
punishing an action that occurs
on social media vs. thoughts
that are expressed on social

00:54.400 --> 00:56.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
media.

00:56.433 --> 01:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Jeffrey Brown
gets a glimpse into the life
of author and comedian David

01:00.000 --> 01:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sedaris through his series
of autobiographical essays.

01:03.433 --> 01:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS, Author, "Theft
By Finding": It used to be
about just racking up laughs,

01:07.966 --> 01:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right? But I think you need
some, like, sorrow to give
the laughter a bit of weight.

01:14.466 --> 01:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:17.933 --> 01:22.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:22.200 --> 01:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle
over tax cuts is heating up.

01:33.666 --> 01:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The speaker of the House of
Representatives, Paul Ryan,
promised today that Republicans

01:38.133 --> 01:42.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
are moving full-speed
ahead, despite divisions
over the issue.

01:42.266 --> 01:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a Washington speech,
he said the GOP majorities
in Congress must press for
he called transformational

01:49.200 --> 01:51.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax reform.

01:51.300 --> 01:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House: We have to get
this done in 2017. We cannot

01:53.766 --> 01:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let this once-in-a-generation
moment slip by. Yes,
the defenders of the
status quo -- and

02:00.800 --> 02:04.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are many of them -- they
are counting on us to lose
our nerve, to fall back, or

02:06.266 --> 02:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put this off altogether, but
we will not wait for a path
free of obstacles. Guess what?

02:11.200 --> 02:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't exist.

02:13.300 --> 02:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In turn, Senate
Democrats warned that they may
balk at raising the national

02:16.166 --> 02:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debt ceiling if Republicans
push for new tax
breaks for the wealthy.

02:20.500 --> 02:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voters in Atlanta's northern
suburbs went to the polls today
in a special election that

02:27.466 --> 02:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is now the most expensive
race ever for a seat in the
U.S. House. Total spending in

02:33.266 --> 02:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the contest between Republican
Karen Handel and Democrat Jon
Ossoff reached at least $50

02:37.833 --> 02:39.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
million.

02:39.833 --> 02:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The seat came open when Tom
Price took the job of secretary
of health and human services

02:45.266 --> 02:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for President Trump. It has
been in GOP hands since 1979.

02:51.033 --> 02:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been another incident
over Syria. An American fighter
plane shot down an Iranian-made

02:56.400 --> 02:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
armed drone overnight. U.S.
officials say it was flying
near a U.S. training camp along

03:01.633 --> 03:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Syrian-Jordan border. On
Sunday, American planes downed a
Syrian military jet that bombed

03:06.733 --> 03:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
near U.S.-backed rebels.
Russia, in turn, warned it
would target coalition planes.

03:13.433 --> 03:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, at the United Nations,
Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres urged restraint.

03:16.333 --> 03:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIO GUTERRES, United Nations
Secretary-General: These kind of
incidents can be very dangerous

03:20.866 --> 03:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a conflict situation in
which there are so many actors
and in which the situation

03:25.833 --> 03:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is so complex on the ground,
so, indeed, I am concerned.
And I hope that this will not

03:30.066 --> 03:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lead to any escalation of
the conflict that is already
as dramatic as it is.

03:37.633 --> 03:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the
U.S. coalition members,
Australia, announced today
that it has suspended

03:41.033 --> 03:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
airstrikes in Syria for now.

03:43.066 --> 03:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The United States and Russia
traded accusations today over
another incident. This one came

03:49.266 --> 03:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monday over the Baltic Sea. The
Pentagon says that a Russian
fighter jet swooped within

03:54.800 --> 03:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few feet of an American
reconnaissance plane in the air.
The Russians say the U.S. plane

03:58.966 --> 04:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
swerved too close to their jet.

04:02.033 --> 04:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country,
brand-new federal statistics
find the opioid abuse crisis
is swamping hospitals.

04:09.066 --> 04:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
According to the report,
there were nearly 1.3
million emergency room
visits and in-patient

04:15.800 --> 04:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stays for opioid problems in
2014. The emergency visits were
up 64 percent from 2005, while

04:22.933 --> 04:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in-patient stays nearly
doubled. Officials say the
epidemic is still getting worse.

04:29.933 --> 04:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Atlantic hurricane season
is only three weeks' old, and
already, the Gulf Coast is

04:33.066 --> 04:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bracing for a hit. Tropical
Storm Cindy formed today and
should reach the Texas-Louisiana

04:40.000 --> 04:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
border region late tomorrow
night. A foot of rain could
fall as far east as the Florida

04:44.866 --> 04:46.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Panhandle.

04:46.900 --> 04:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rain was already falling,
and the sea churning today
in New Orleans. Mayor Mitch

04:50.333 --> 04:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Landrieu urged
people to get ready.

04:52.400 --> 04:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH LANDRIEU (D), Mayor of
New Orleans, Louisiana: And we
have been through this many,

04:54.566 --> 04:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many times before. I don't want
anybody to panic. There's no
reason to do that. But this

04:59.066 --> 05:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to be a serious event.
We could get lucky, and it
could turn out to be nothing.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't expect that's going
to happen. It could be one
to three inches, or it could

05:08.133 --> 05:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be three to 12. And if those
bands hit us the wrong way
intimately over time, then we

05:11.633 --> 05:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could have some
serious flooding.

05:13.566 --> 05:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same
time, Tropical Storm Bret
weakened to a tropical wave, as

05:17.966 --> 05:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it blew across the
Southern Caribbean.

05:20.300 --> 05:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the Southwestern
U.S. is seeing one of its worst
heat waves in years on this

05:27.366 --> 05:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
first day of summer.
Temperatures reached
to near 120 degrees in
Phoenix today for the

05:32.433 --> 05:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first time in 22 years. The
conditions are also tough on
fire crews battling wildfires

05:38.500 --> 05:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Southern California
and elsewhere. Helicopters
and tanker planes have
reduced their loads

05:43.300 --> 05:46.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
because the superheated
air is thinner.

05:46.566 --> 05:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wall Street cooled off some
today, as falling oil prices
took the broader market lower.

05:53.500 --> 05:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly 62 points to close
at 21467. The Nasdaq fell

05:59.000 --> 06:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
51, and the S&amp;P 500 slipped 16.

06:04.000 --> 06:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a cultural note. Barbie's
longtime companion doll, Ken,
has a new look -- 15 of them, in

06:11.366 --> 06:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact. Toymaker Mattel unveiled
the revamped dolls today with
a range of body types, skin

06:18.333 --> 06:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tones and hair styles,
from cornrows to man
buns. Ken's makeover
follows a similar effort

06:23.566 --> 06:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make Barbie's image
more realistic and diverse.

06:27.633 --> 06:29.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's about time.

06:29.666 --> 06:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
two U.S. senators weigh in on
the prospects for replacing

06:33.400 --> 06:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obamacare; what an American's
death means for U.S. relations
with North Korea; the fine

06:40.500 --> 06:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
line between monitoring
students' social media
and invading their
privacy; and much more.

06:56.733 --> 07:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The effort by Senate Republicans
to replace the Affordable Care
Act picked up steam today,

07:01.733 --> 07:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as their leader promised
a first look at their bill
before the end of the week.

07:06.366 --> 07:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, Democrats remain unable
to stop it on their own. But
they mounted a public relations

07:12.433 --> 07:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attack as Republicans
counted votes.

07:15.733 --> 07:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The word came from Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell
that a draft of the
Senate GOP's health care

07:21.566 --> 07:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
package was on its way.

07:23.633 --> 07:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: Well, we're
going to lay out a discussion

07:25.800 --> 07:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
draft Thursday morning. And I
wouldn't want to compare it to
the House bill. It will speak

07:32.700 --> 07:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for itself. It'll be different,
and take a different approach
based upon these endless

07:39.733 --> 07:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussions we have had
with the only people
interested in changing the
law, which is Republican

07:44.233 --> 07:46.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
senators.

07:46.266 --> 07:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He spoke as
Democrats, in the minority, were
making their own symbolic stand

07:52.433 --> 07:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on health care on the
Senate floor. Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer
quoted what the president

07:56.900 --> 08:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reportedly said about the House
health care bill to attack
Republican efforts broadly.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY),
Minority Leader: For once, on
the topic of health care, I find

08:04.566 --> 08:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
myself agreeing with the
president. His health care bill
is mean. Cutting Medicaid to the

08:11.000 --> 08:12.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bone is mean.

08:12.933 --> 08:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: This is an insult
to the American people.

08:15.666 --> 08:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats and
their allies held the Senate
floor yesterday well into

08:20.300 --> 08:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the night, and took Republicans
to task for keeping their
work behind closed doors.

08:27.266 --> 08:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS
(I), Vermont: So, I
say to the Republican
leadership, what are you

08:30.433 --> 08:32.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
afraid of?

08:32.433 --> 08:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Today, the number
two Republican in the Senate,
Texas' John Cornyn, turned

08:38.366 --> 08:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the focus back to the
Democrats, charging that their
speeches were just that, talk.

08:43.633 --> 08:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R), Texas:
Unfortunately, they're spending
their time and energy giving

08:46.133 --> 08:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speeches to each other on the
Senate floor, and absolutely
contributing nothing toward

08:52.000 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a solution to this problem.

08:54.033 --> 08:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No details from
the Republican discussions have
been publicly released. But

09:00.233 --> 09:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Washington Post and others
reported that the Senate version
would make deeper Medicaid

09:05.500 --> 09:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cuts than those passed in
the House. They also would be
phased in more slowly. The House

09:10.433 --> 09:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill calls for cutting
$800 billion over 10 years.

09:14.800 --> 09:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, senators are
also reportedly considering
offering more generous insurance

09:21.766 --> 09:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
subsidies, especially for
older Americans, as well as
eliminating some, but not all,

09:27.600 --> 09:31.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the taxes put in
place by Obamacare.

09:31.466 --> 09:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whatever the eventual bill looks
like, Republicans don't expect
any Democrats to support it.

09:38.466 --> 09:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thus, they cannot afford to
lose more than two of their own
members. Yet, some GOP senators,

09:44.333 --> 09:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Tennessee's Bob Corker,
have said that, even up to now,
they remain out of the loop.

09:48.900 --> 09:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Have you seen the
Republican health care bill?

09:51.333 --> 09:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. BOB CORKER (R), Tennessee:
I have not. Have you? Have you?

09:54.733 --> 09:56.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: I have not.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BOB CORKER: I would have
liked, as you already know, for
this to be a more open process

09:58.266 --> 10:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and have committee hearings.
But that's not what we're doing.

10:00.466 --> 10:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Making sure that
Corker and other Republicans
not in on the drafting process

10:07.466 --> 10:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are on board is a priority
for the Republican leadership,
especially McConnell, as they

10:11.933 --> 10:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prepare for a possible
vote next week.

10:15.733 --> 10:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just a short while ago, I
spoke with two key voices in
the Senate about this health

10:20.033 --> 10:22.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care debate.

10:22.133 --> 10:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
John Barrasso is an
orthopedic surgeon from
Wyoming and chairman of
the Senate Republican

10:26.200 --> 10:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Policy Committee. And senator
Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat
from Maryland, he played a key

10:30.966 --> 10:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role in the House
leadership when Obamacare
was passed in 2009.

10:37.900 --> 10:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Barrasso, Senator
Van Hollen, thank you
both for joining us.

10:40.300 --> 10:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Barrasso, we just heard
the majority leader say that
this bill takes a different

10:44.933 --> 10:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approach than the bill
that came out of the House.
What makes it better?

10:49.333 --> 10:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R),
Wyoming: Well, look, the pain of
Obamacare is getting worse every

10:53.566 --> 10:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day. We're seeing it all
across the country, as premiums
continue to go up and choices

10:57.600 --> 10:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continue to go down.

10:59.700 --> 11:03.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're looking at ways
to make sure that anyone
with a preexisting
condition is protected.

11:03.766 --> 11:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're looking for ways to
stabilize the market and
also lower the skyrocketing
cost of insurance

11:10.766 --> 11:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then stabilize Medicaid
for the long run, because we
need a safe and secure program

11:16.633 --> 11:18.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there. It has to be strong,
and it's not strong now.

11:18.600 --> 11:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Van
Hollen, is there any part of
that the Democrats can support?

11:21.433 --> 11:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D),
Maryland: Well, Judy, of course,
we don't know what's in the

11:24.333 --> 11:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Republican bill, because
it's been kept in deep secret
from the American public,

11:30.800 --> 11:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no hearings, no
amendments in committee

11:34.233 --> 11:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Senator Cornyn, one of
the members of the Republican
leadership, said it was going

11:37.966 --> 11:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be 80 percent like the
House bill. The House bill is
a bill that President Trump

11:44.900 --> 11:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
celebrated in the Rose
Garden, but then, behind
closed doors, said was mean.

11:48.766 --> 11:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is mean because
it will mean 23 million
Americans who will not
have access to affordable

11:55.766 --> 12:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care who would otherwise have
it. People with preexisting
conditions will go back to being

12:02.800 --> 12:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to be victims of
discrimination by insurance
companies. It is why
virtually every patient

12:07.633 --> 12:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advocacy organization, in
fact, I think 100 percent, are
against that legislation, and

12:13.500 --> 12:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
every provider group I have
heard from is also against it.

12:16.633 --> 12:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will provide huge tax cuts
to the wealthiest Americans. If
you're a millionaire, you are

12:23.566 --> 12:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to get a $50,000, on
average, annual tax cut -- tell
me how that helps health care

12:25.933 --> 12:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - and cuts Medicaid by $830
billion. This is going to
wreak havoc on our health care

12:33.033 --> 12:34.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

12:34.566 --> 12:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's
just take a part of that.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Sure.

12:37.433 --> 12:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Barrasso,
what about the Medicaid
cuts? Again, we haven't seen

12:39.466 --> 12:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the Senate is coming up
with, but the reporting is
that it is going to be deeper

12:42.600 --> 12:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Medicaid cuts than what
the House bill had.

12:46.033 --> 12:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well, first
of all, it's hard to stand
here and hear Chris talk about

12:50.333 --> 12:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a bill he hasn't seen -- he will
see it Thursday - - and make a
number of attacks against it,

12:54.000 --> 12:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when, in his own state of
Maryland, insurance rates asked
for, for next are going up 58

13:00.200 --> 13:02.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
percent.

13:02.266 --> 13:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know how somebody
with a straight face can call
that affordable. And they went

13:04.433 --> 13:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up 24 percent last year. And
the president of the Maryland
care -- the care -- insurance

13:11.400 --> 13:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
company has said we're in the
beginning of the throes of a
death spiral of insurance.

13:15.433 --> 13:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have lost $600
million. Obamacare has
failed in Maryland.
It's failing all across

13:22.366 --> 13:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country. And for people
with preexisting conditions,
Judy, when you see all of these

13:25.666 --> 13:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
counties across the country
where no one is even willing
to sell Obamacare insurance,

13:33.100 --> 13:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you have a preexisting
condition and nobody
is going to be willing
to sell you insurance,

13:36.133 --> 13:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even with a subsidy, your
preexisting condition
is not covered, and
you have been deceived

13:42.233 --> 13:43.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by Obamacare.

13:43.766 --> 13:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I'm
glad John brought that up.

13:45.866 --> 13:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, the
largest insurer in the state of
Maryland, asked for a whopping

13:50.166 --> 13:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50 percent increase. Here's what
the president of Blue Cross/Blue
Shield told us, that well

13:57.666 --> 14:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over half of that increase
is due to deliberate
sabotage by the Trump
administration and cuts

14:02.900 --> 14:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Republicans made to
Obamacare/Affordable
Care Act payments.

14:05.900 --> 14:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A full 20 percent of the
increase they're asking for is
because the president issued

14:12.866 --> 14:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an executive order on the first
day of his administration saying
that they wouldn't enforce

14:16.166 --> 14:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the individual
mandate provision.

14:18.800 --> 14:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You tell people they don't
have to join, including
healthier people, it
means sicker people will

14:25.800 --> 14:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay a lot more. And, by the
way, that's why AARP is on the
warpath against this health

14:31.933 --> 14:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care bill, because they're
going to see dramatic increases.

14:35.200 --> 14:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, John, I have not
seen the Senate bill. Neither
has the country, which is a

14:39.566 --> 14:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shame on the democratic process.

14:41.700 --> 14:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, John didn't answer
your specific question about
Medicaid, which has nothing

14:46.633 --> 14:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do with the exchanges. It's
a whopping cut. I know his
state of Wyoming didn't take

14:51.466 --> 14:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Medicaid expansion, but
this will wreak havoc on tens
of millions of Americans.

14:55.866 --> 14:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Barrasso,
what about the point he made
about the criticism that

14:59.533 --> 15:04.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's what Republicans have
done that have undermined
Obamacare, but also the Medicaid

15:04.300 --> 15:06.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
question?

15:06.733 --> 15:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO:
Well, you know, insurance
company executives
prior to the election,

15:08.766 --> 15:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prior to the November election
were saying they're thinking
of pulling out in 2018, so

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this is nothing new.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Had Hillary Clinton gotten
elected president of the United
States, we'd be having to make

15:19.000 --> 15:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major changes to Obamacare,
trying to clean up the mess that
has been created by the Obama

15:26.000 --> 15:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care law. That's where
we are right now. The current
status is not sustainable.

15:29.533 --> 15:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
about the Republican
bill, though, Senator?

15:31.633 --> 15:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: We're
working on it in the Senate is
a different way to deal with

15:36.066 --> 15:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid to make sure that
states that did expand, because
there are a number of states

15:40.700 --> 15:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that did and states that didn't,
that states that did will
have a smoother glide path to

15:47.600 --> 15:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting to the point where,
for anyone on Medicaid in those
states, they're reimbursed

15:50.433 --> 15:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same way as was set
up initially for people
who are disabled, blind,
the elderly and children.

15:58.266 --> 16:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's who Medicaid was set up
for originally. Plus, I was in
the state Senate in Wyoming,

16:02.666 --> 16:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I will tell you, Judy, we
always felt, if we had more
control of that money, rather

16:07.233 --> 16:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than the one-size-fits-all
that comes out of Washington,
we could have helped a lot

16:14.266 --> 16:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more people in a lot better
ways with -- given some of the
flexibility and the freedom of

16:17.200 --> 16:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
choice that a state has,
instead of having to listen
to the mandates of Washington.

16:21.333 --> 16:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as to Chris' point of
the individual mandate,
it is the most hated
part of Obamacare. And

16:28.366 --> 16:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the judges that say, how do they
count the numbers, they say, if
you get rid of the individual

16:32.733 --> 16:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mandate, which I am committed
to do and the Republicans did,
they say millions and millions

16:37.333 --> 16:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of people will not buy
a mandated government
product they don't think
is worth the money.

16:41.633 --> 16:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: The
whole idea of insurance,
as John knows, is
everybody has got to be

16:45.000 --> 16:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of the pool. That's
the whole idea of social
insurance and health insurance.

16:51.966 --> 16:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The core of the Republican bill
in the House, and we suspect
in the Senate, is rotten. And

16:57.400 --> 17:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here's why: It cuts Medicaid
by $830 billion. That's huge.
It provides tax cuts of about

17:02.800 --> 17:05.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
$900 billion.

17:05.400 --> 17:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You tell me how cutting taxes
to millionaires and giving them
an average tax break of $50,000

17:12.366 --> 17:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has anything to do with making
health care better. In fact,
it takes two years off of

17:16.533 --> 17:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Medicare Trust
Fund, because, as part
of the Affordable Care
Act, we asked wealthier

17:21.133 --> 17:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Americans to put some
of their unearned income
into shoring up Medicare.

17:28.100 --> 17:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republicans give them a big
tax break. They hurt millions
of Americans in the process.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it is a bad deal.

17:34.666 --> 17:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Barrasso,
what about those tax cuts
for wealthier Americans that

17:37.300 --> 17:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would be realized
under -- presumably,
under the Senate plan?

17:40.166 --> 17:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: That's
still part of the debate we're
having, and the bill will come

17:42.866 --> 17:44.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out Friday.

17:44.900 --> 17:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to eliminate all the
taxes that raise premiums for
people, the medical device tax,

17:50.300 --> 17:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the health insurance tax, the
tax on prescription medication.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But getting back to Medicaid,
Judy, a third of the doctors
-- and I practiced medicine

17:56.866 --> 18:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for 25 years -- a third of the
doctors in this country will
not take new Medicaid patients,

18:03.833 --> 18:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and major hospitals around the
country have said, look, if
you have to make an appointment

18:07.133 --> 18:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for somebody either
with Medicaid or who has
traditional insurance,
don't give that appointment

18:14.066 --> 18:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to somebody with Medicaid --
this is what the Mayo Clinic
said -- because we have reached

18:17.633 --> 18:22.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a tipping point where
we can't continue even
paying the salaries at
the rate that Medicaid

18:23.233 --> 18:24.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
reimburses.

18:24.766 --> 18:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Medicaid is failing. We need to
strengthen it for the long term.

18:27.900 --> 18:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, their
answer is, it's failing, so
cut it by another $180 billion.

18:34.966 --> 18:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not sufficient to
completely reimburse
doctors now, so give
them even less, while

18:41.200 --> 18:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're giving tax breaks to
the very wealthy. That's nuts.
And I think the American people

18:43.733 --> 18:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know it. I think that's why
this has been kept in secret
in the Senate for so long.

18:47.900 --> 18:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hope that, at long last,
we will have a chance to
have a debate on this.

18:50.700 --> 18:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just finally,
to both of you, when the
public is told that the Senate

18:57.733 --> 19:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
version is going to stabilize
the health care coverage in
this country, quickly, Senator

19:02.233 --> 19:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Barrasso, how does it do that?

19:04.366 --> 19:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Well,
there are a number of different
provisions to do exactly that,

19:08.466 --> 19:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to help people at a significant
high risk of high medical costs.

19:12.166 --> 19:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's worked successfully around
the country. And part of it is
to just give more flexibility

19:17.100 --> 19:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the states, so they can
make decisions about what
insurance can be bought and sold

19:21.833 --> 19:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in those states to allow people
to get what they want and they
need and is right for their

19:26.633 --> 19:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family, not what the Democrats
who voted for Obamacare
said they have to have.

19:30.600 --> 19:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well,
listen, Judy, there are issues
with some of the exchanges.

19:34.933 --> 19:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We can fix them. There
are commonsense things
you can do about that,
rather than blow them

19:39.833 --> 19:42.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

19:42.266 --> 19:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with respect to Medicaid
-- and, in Maryland,
I can tell you, of the
people who are directly

19:44.633 --> 19:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
benefiting from the Affordable
Care Act, more than half are
from Medicaid. And John hasn't

19:51.633 --> 19:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said anything that's going to
explain how those people are
going to be better off when

19:54.100 --> 19:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they cut $830 billion
or whatever amount
they're going to cut from
the Medicaid program.

20:00.866 --> 20:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid already has lots of
waivers. It already has lots of
flexibility. We're using it in

20:04.733 --> 20:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state of Maryland. His
state of Wyoming did not take
the expansion, so maybe, you

20:11.166 --> 20:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, that's something he
doesn't feel strongly about.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I can tell you we're hearing
from Republican governors in
states that have, and they're

20:16.900 --> 20:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying do not do that kind of
damage to the Medicaid program.

20:20.566 --> 20:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO: Somebody
may have a Medicaid card, but
it doesn't mean they get to see

20:23.800 --> 20:25.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a doctor.

20:25.866 --> 20:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes, I
can tell you, when they take
$830 million away from them

20:28.666 --> 20:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and give it to wealthier
Americans, they are not going to
be better off. They are going

20:32.966 --> 20:35.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be a lot worse off.

20:35.066 --> 20:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Gentlemen, thank
you very much. We're going to
get our first peek at the bill

20:37.366 --> 20:39.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Thursday.

20:39.333 --> 20:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Chris Van Hollen,
Senator John Barrasso,
we thank you both.

20:42.066 --> 20:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO:
Thank you for having us.

20:48.233 --> 20:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SEN. CHRIS VAN
HOLLEN: Thank you.

20:51.633 --> 20:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
quiet and tragic end to the
sad story of Otto Warmbier, and

20:59.000 --> 21:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the implications for the United
States' dealings with his
former captors in North Korea.

21:04.733 --> 21:07.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has that.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Speaking in
the Oval Office, President
Trump condemned the
death of Otto Warmbier,

21:10.300 --> 21:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
who had been detained in
North Korea for nearly
a year-and-a-half.

21:14.266 --> 21:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: It's a total
disgrace, what happened to Otto.

21:17.333 --> 21:20.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It should never, ever
be allowed to happen.

21:20.500 --> 21:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Mr. Trump
also indirectly blamed
the Obama administration
for not getting him

21:25.133 --> 21:27.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home sooner.

21:27.233 --> 21:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He should have
brought home that same day.
The result would have been

21:29.333 --> 21:31.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lot different.

21:31.333 --> 21:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president's
spokesman said Warmbier's death
casts a shadow on Mr. Trump's

21:35.200 --> 21:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stated willingness to talk to
his North Korean counterpart
under the right conditions.

21:40.100 --> 21:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary: Clearly, we're
moving further away, not closer

21:43.466 --> 21:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to those conditions
being enacted.

21:45.533 --> 21:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, the president
seemed to abandon his goal of
enlisting China to pressure

21:49.966 --> 21:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea: "While I greatly
appreciate the efforts of
President Xi and China to help

21:56.600 --> 22:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with North Korea, it has
not worked out. At least
I know China tried."

22:02.633 --> 22:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
North Korea's release of
the 22-year-old Warmbier
has increased, not eased
tensions with Pyongyang.

22:08.166 --> 22:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He arrived in Ohio last week in
a coma. Doctors said Warmbier
suffered a severe neurological

22:14.400 --> 22:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
injury with extensive loss
of brain tissue, likely as a
result of a lack of blood to his

22:20.100 --> 22:22.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
brain.

22:22.200 --> 22:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. DANIEL KANTER, University
of Cincinnati Health: A state
of unresponsive wakefulness.

22:24.266 --> 22:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He'd been sentenced
in March 2016 to 15 years hard
labor for allegedly taking

22:30.433 --> 22:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a propaganda poster from a
Pyongyang hotel. In a statement,
Warmbier's parents said, "The

22:37.466 --> 22:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awful, torturous mistreatment
our son received at the hands
of the North Koreans ensured

22:41.600 --> 22:44.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that no other outcome
was possible."

22:44.666 --> 22:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an interview broadcast today
on CBS News, newly-elected
South Korean President Moon

22:50.800 --> 22:53.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jae-in joined in
condemning the North.

22:53.100 --> 22:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOON JAE-IN, South Korean
President (through translator):
I believe we must now have the

22:57.000 --> 23:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perception that North Korea
is an irrational regime.

23:00.700 --> 23:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Moon, who had
campaigned on engaging
North Korea, said all
options are on the table.

23:08.066 --> 23:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOON JAE-IN (through
translator): When it comes
to preemptive strike,
which you mentioned,

23:10.000 --> 23:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe that this is something
we may be able to discuss
at a later stage, when the

23:15.833 --> 23:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
threat has become
even more urgent.

23:17.533 --> 23:20.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: North Korea
still holds three other
Americans as prisoners.

23:20.233 --> 23:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a pair of U.S. B-1B
bombers, like these, flew
over South Korea, just
below the demilitarized

23:28.166 --> 23:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
zone, in a show of force.

23:30.400 --> 23:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, what effect will the
death of Otto Warmbier
have on the wider, and
seemingly intractable,

23:37.400 --> 23:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question of how the United
States should deal with North
Korea? What options are left?

23:43.266 --> 23:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To probe those questions
and more, we turn to veteran
diplomat Kathleen Stephens. She

23:49.033 --> 23:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was U.S. ambassador to South
Korea from 2008 to 2011. She's
now at Stanford University.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's where she
joins us tonight.

23:55.766 --> 23:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ambassador Stephens, thank you.

23:58.266 --> 24:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about that question?
Is this tragic story
of Otto Warmbier going
to affect, have any

24:05.500 --> 24:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
impact on the way the United
States approaches North Korea?

24:09.133 --> 24:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS, Former U.S.
Ambassador to South Korea:
Well, I certainly think it's

24:12.100 --> 24:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a reminder to us that the threat
and the danger that North Korea
poses, not just to the United

24:19.133 --> 24:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States, but to the region and
the world, goes even beyond
its nuclear missile programs,

24:23.900 --> 24:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
which we have been so
rightly focused on in
recent weeks and months.

24:30.833 --> 24:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also need to add, I myself
want to just express my deepest
condolences to the Warmbier

24:33.800 --> 24:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family and to all the
friends, and I know there
are many, and family of Otto.

24:40.766 --> 24:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The treatment that he received
while under North Korean
custody for a year-and-a-half

24:46.300 --> 24:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was appalling and outrageous.
And I think the North Koreans
owe a full explanation to

24:49.733 --> 24:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his family and to the United
States of what happened.

24:53.100 --> 24:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Does the approach,
is it complicated by the fact
that there are three Americans

24:57.133 --> 24:59.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
still being held?

24:59.266 --> 25:03.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Well,
I think it concentrates
the mind certainly of
the United States, and

25:04.766 --> 25:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope in Pyongyang as well,
that this is untenable.

25:08.300 --> 25:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would hope that, in the
coming days - - and I believe
this will happen -- that

25:13.133 --> 25:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there will be a renewed pressure
and effort to win the release
of these three Americans

25:20.666 --> 25:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are being held.
There are others of other
nationalities as well.

25:24.233 --> 25:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea in an area of
allowing access to foreigners
who have been arrested while

25:31.200 --> 25:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in North Korea, which it is
obligated to do under standard
diplomatic procedure, it hasn't

25:34.400 --> 25:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
met those obligations,
as it doesn't meet its
obligations in other areas.

25:37.966 --> 25:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It needs to do that. But it
really needs to move -- to
stop this practice of holding,

25:45.833 --> 25:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
arresting and holding
citizens, not allowing
their representatives
from their countries

25:49.166 --> 25:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have access to them, and
often using them as or hoping
to use them as leverage to -- as

25:55.333 --> 25:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hostages, essentially,
and as bargaining chips.

25:57.366 --> 26:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It needs to stop. It
needs to be a part of
our overall approach
and effort. It has been,

26:02.333 --> 26:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it needs to be reemphasized
going forward that this too
is part of the effort to get

26:09.366 --> 26:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea to live up to
some minimal standards of
international behavior.

26:12.400 --> 26:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Live up to some
minimal standards. We have had
sanctions in place for a long

26:16.400 --> 26:21.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
time. We have had
people describe it as
an irrational regime.

26:21.100 --> 26:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the real pressure
points on North Korea? What
can make a difference to North

26:27.100 --> 26:28.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea?

26:28.600 --> 26:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Well, it is
a very challenging question.

26:31.500 --> 26:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one thing that
remains very important
is, notwithstanding maybe
some welcome realism

26:39.466 --> 26:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about perhaps the limits of
what China can or will do,
China does remain an important

26:45.666 --> 26:48.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
actor in this, as
does South Korea.

26:48.400 --> 26:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, with meetings
coming up tomorrow in
Washington -- Secretary
Tillerson and Mattis

26:55.366 --> 26:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be meeting with their
Chinese counterparts. Next week,
the new South Korean president,

26:59.800 --> 27:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Moon Jae-in, will be meeting
with President Trump.

27:02.566 --> 27:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, North Korea will
be very much on the agenda,
but, in the context of what's

27:09.566 --> 27:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened, these are going to
be even more somber meetings.
And I think the effort will

27:11.600 --> 27:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be to look both at better
implementation of the pressure
and sanctions now in effect,

27:17.800 --> 27:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also into some new ones that
might bring greater pressure
to get North Korea to take

27:23.633 --> 27:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a different path and a path that
will lead to some discussion
of how it can meet its

27:29.400 --> 27:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
international obligations.

27:31.433 --> 27:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Moon,
of course, ran on a campaign
talking about engagement with

27:34.100 --> 27:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea. He wanted to go
to the -- to pressure North
Korea to the negotiating table,

27:41.100 --> 27:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while President Trump talks
about pressuring North Korea to
get rid of its nuclear program.

27:47.033 --> 27:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What are the chances
or the likelihood that
these two leaders can
find a common approach

27:49.500 --> 27:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to North Korea when they meet
here in Washington next week?

27:52.266 --> 27:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KATHLEEN STEPHENS: Well, it's
their very first meeting.
They're both very new in office,

27:58.133 --> 28:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Moon in particular.

28:00.233 --> 28:02.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think a lot is
going to depend on the
kind of relationship
and rapport they're able

28:02.400 --> 28:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to establish with each other.
President Trump established a
good rapport with the Japanese

28:06.466 --> 28:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prime minister, of course,
with the Chinese president, Mr.
Xi, although today he seemed

28:12.633 --> 28:14.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be a little bit
disappointed in him.

28:14.700 --> 28:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think, one, the personal
relationship is going to be
important. But, two, I think

28:17.166 --> 28:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it will be important for
President Moon to explain the
South Korean perspective. The

28:24.433 --> 28:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Koreans actually over
many decades have seen thousands
and thousands of their citizens

28:31.400 --> 28:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abducted and held in the North,
and six are being held right
now just within recent months

28:37.100 --> 28:39.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and years.

28:39.233 --> 28:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, this is a heartfelt
issue for South Korea,
as well, as well as, of
course, the continuing

28:43.033 --> 28:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security threat of North Korea.
So, they're under no illusions
about the threat. The challenge

28:50.033 --> 28:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be, as you suggest, how
to harmonize these approaches
and also harmonize them with

28:56.500 --> 29:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China's approach in the region,
which certainly sees the need
for a change in behavior in

29:00.300 --> 29:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
North Korea, but they're
worried about instability.

29:02.366 --> 29:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not going to be easy,
but having these meetings
is an important first step.

29:08.733 --> 29:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ambassador Kathleen
Stephens, thanks for joining us.

29:13.366 --> 29:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:20.033 --> 29:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
improving health care in the
nation's most rural communities;

29:24.600 --> 29:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and from the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf, humorist
David Sedaris and his
book of autobiographical

29:30.566 --> 29:32.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
essays.

29:32.966 --> 29:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Schools are
paying a lot more attention
to what students post
online, and that can

29:38.833 --> 29:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have severe consequences
for students and schools.

29:41.266 --> 29:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Harvard University
withdrew the admittance
of at least 10 incoming
freshmen who had reportedly

29:48.066 --> 29:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
posted violent, racist and
sexually explicit content
in a private Facebook group.

29:53.466 --> 29:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
High schools are cracking down,
too, with some hiring outside
companies to police social

29:58.700 --> 30:00.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
media posts.

30:00.700 --> 30:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But monitoring online behavior
is difficult, and civil
rights groups are watching.

30:06.633 --> 30:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Lisa
Stark with our partner Education
Week visited a school district

30:09.933 --> 30:12.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Arizona.

30:12.066 --> 30:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: It's just before
summer break at Dysart High
School in Surprise, Arizona,

30:17.833 --> 30:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside Phoenix. Students are
eating lunch, signing yearbooks,
and they're immersed in

30:22.166 --> 30:24.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
social media.

30:24.200 --> 30:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat,
Instagram, YouTube. More than
90 percent of teens say they go

30:31.200 --> 30:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
online every day, and
nearly a quarter are
online almost constantly.

30:37.633 --> 30:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me ask you, first of
all, do you all have phones?

30:39.633 --> 30:40.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Yes.

30:40.633 --> 30:42.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Yes, we do.

30:42.166 --> 30:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Do you ever
not have a phone with you?

30:43.900 --> 30:44.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: No.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It's always on.

30:46.933 --> 30:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: We sat down with
four Dysart students to talk
about how they use social media.

30:50.400 --> 30:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Snapchat, I post every single
day, like, every day, all day.

30:53.533 --> 30:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUDENT: I always like
post my thoughts, certain
way I'm feeling. Depends
on how I'm feeling

30:57.233 --> 30:59.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that day.

30:59.266 --> 31:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: When I'm done with all
my work, and if I don't have
any work from other classes,

31:00.933 --> 31:04.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just go on my phone
and see what's going on.

31:04.233 --> 31:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I don't really care
who sees it. Like, I'm just
posting it because I think

31:06.066 --> 31:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it's public. Like,
I'm open about it.

31:08.166 --> 31:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: The problem for
schools, what happens on social
media doesn't always stay

31:13.766 --> 31:15.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on social media.

31:15.733 --> 31:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I see a lot of bullying
on Facebook that it transfers
to the school. And then,

31:21.366 --> 31:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like, at the beginning of
this year, this girl got into
an altercation on Facebook,

31:26.933 --> 31:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and she ended up fighting
the girl at school.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY HARTJEN, Principal, Dysart
High School: When something's
posted on social media and

31:31.566 --> 31:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's being talked about
on campus and it disrupts
learning, that's when
we have to step in and

31:37.833 --> 31:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
decide if there's something
that we need to react to.

31:39.966 --> 31:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Nationwide, a
growing number of districts are
watching what's posted online

31:44.600 --> 31:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for anything that might
impact their schools.

31:47.700 --> 31:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Principal Amy Hartjen says the
number one concern is safety.

31:52.433 --> 31:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's like, OK, we have to
get involved here? Bullying,
would that be a red line?

31:56.966 --> 31:59.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY HARTJEN: Absolutely,
threats, intimidations.

31:59.466 --> 32:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: What if
someone posts something
that is offensive
language, racist, sexist?

32:02.266 --> 32:03.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY HARTJEN: Absolutely.

32:03.766 --> 32:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Really? And why
would that be a red line?

32:05.766 --> 32:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY HARTJEN: Because that
is just -- it's against
the campus culture.

32:12.533 --> 32:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Students threatening
to harm others or themselves
sometimes telegraph that on

32:18.566 --> 32:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
social media, and districts
have been sued for not paying
attention to online posts.

32:23.100 --> 32:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These days, the schoolyard
has new boundaries.

32:25.700 --> 32:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZACHERY FOUNTAIN, Dysart
District Communications
Chief: The information
space is just as important

32:28.733 --> 32:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the physical space anymore,
because it has that ability
to snowball at a really rapid

32:34.200 --> 32:36.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pace.

32:36.233 --> 32:38.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Zachery
Fountain is the Dysart
District Communications
Chief, and point man

32:38.966 --> 32:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on social media. He
trains staff on how to
document troublesome posts.

32:43.600 --> 32:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ZACHERY FOUNTAIN: That's
teaching them things like asking
for a screen shot of what has

32:50.633 --> 32:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happened, understanding that
a message could disappear in
five seconds, as soon as it's

32:53.166 --> 32:55.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
brought to their
attention by a student.

32:55.766 --> 33:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Nationwide,
both public and private
schools keep tabs on
social media in a variety

33:00.133 --> 33:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of ways: hiring firms
to actively monitor
students' accounts,
encouraging students to

33:07.566 --> 33:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report anything worrisome,
friending students to
gain access to posts
that may not be public,

33:13.233 --> 33:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and through simple alerts
every time the district
and its schools are
mentioned in any type

33:18.000 --> 33:20.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of media.

33:20.066 --> 33:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's anecdotal evidence, but
no hard data, to show that early
identification of troubling

33:25.866 --> 33:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
social media posts can help
schools head off problems.

33:31.466 --> 33:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
School officials here insist
they are most concerned about
safety. They're not trying

33:33.733 --> 33:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pry into students' lives.
But civil rights and privacy
groups say it can be a slippery

33:41.133 --> 33:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slope and that some
districts have gone too
far, that they have violated
students' constitutional

33:45.500 --> 33:47.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rights.

33:47.533 --> 33:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Students have been disciplined
for liking other posts, for
private online chats that

33:51.833 --> 33:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others made public, for
forwarding racist posts, even
in order to denounce them.

33:58.900 --> 34:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHAD MARLOW, American Civil
Liberties Union: Schools need
to think about, how do we take

34:01.100 --> 34:04.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on these issues in an
appropriate way that
doesn't have kind of
the collateral damage

34:06.033 --> 34:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect of destroying students'
privacy and free speech rights?

34:09.333 --> 34:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Chad Marlow is with
the American Civil Liberties
Union. He says, first and

34:13.900 --> 34:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foremost, school shouldn't
have open-ended access to
students' social media accounts.

34:20.033 --> 34:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You're saying no
fishing expeditions?

34:22.066 --> 34:25.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHAD MARLOW: No fishing
expeditions. And the
way to do that is by
not allowing passwords

34:25.100 --> 34:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be turned over, what we call
shoulder surfing. Log onto your
account, and the teacher will

34:29.866 --> 34:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stand over the student's
shoulder and say,
scroll, scroll, scroll.

34:32.733 --> 34:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Are you asking
students for passwords?

34:34.966 --> 34:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI, School
Resource Officer: No.

34:36.333 --> 34:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Or log-in
information or anything?

34:38.633 --> 34:40.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI: No.

34:40.700 --> 34:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: School resource
officer Wendy Klarkowski is
assigned to Shadow Ridge High

34:43.533 --> 34:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
School in the Dysart district.
Her morning routine includes
searching for school-related

34:48.233 --> 34:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
posts on social media. She's
uncovered criminal activity.

34:51.900 --> 34:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI: A young
man had decided to bring some
marijuana-laced brownies to

34:55.266 --> 34:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school, and he advertised
them on Twitter and, meet me
in the cafeteria. We got him

34:59.533 --> 35:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with all the brownies
still on him.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: And possible
campus disruptions.

35:03.433 --> 35:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI: Some kids
were going to protest something
they thought was unfair,

35:06.400 --> 35:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it was all over Twitter,
so we were able to get the kids
that were leading it, actually,

35:13.366 --> 35:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the night before, so that
they put an end to that, so
it didn't disrupt the campus.

35:16.100 --> 35:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: But why isn't
that their free speech right
to protest something they're

35:19.800 --> 35:22.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not happy about?

35:22.466 --> 35:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY KLARKOWSKI: It is
their right to protest,
but it is not their right
to disturb an educational

35:25.533 --> 35:27.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
institution.

35:27.433 --> 35:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: The ACLU's Marlow
worries about districts
stifling free speech.

35:30.800 --> 35:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHAD MARLOW: It is very
important to draw the line
between punishing an action that

35:37.766 --> 35:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
occurs on social media vs.
thoughts that are expressed on
social media. Once you start

35:41.033 --> 35:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policing and punishing
thoughts, you are into very,
very dangerous territory.

LISA STARK: Two of the Dysart
students we spoke with say they
tread more carefully online

35:51.666 --> 35:54.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
after each posted a
disparaging remark about
one of their teachers.

35:54.900 --> 35:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUDENT: I made a reference to
one of my teachers last year
on Facebook, and I almost got a

36:01.933 --> 36:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
referral for it, for what I
said about her. And then me and
the teacher ended up talking,

36:04.333 --> 36:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and now she's my
favorite teacher ever.

36:06.500 --> 36:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HADIN KHAN, Student: It
was funny at first. Then
I was like, OK, I need
to take some precautions

36:12.400 --> 36:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for next time, when I'm angry
about something, not mention
names or anything. I could say

36:14.866 --> 36:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
English teacher, as opposed
to saying their name.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: So, you
are censoring yourself
in a way, right?

36:18.900 --> 36:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HADIN KHAN: Yes, kind of. Yes.

36:20.366 --> 36:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: How do you feel
about having to do that?

36:22.266 --> 36:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HADIN KHAN: I don't really
have a problem with it, because
it's not that serious of

36:25.133 --> 36:27.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an issue.

36:27.200 --> 36:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Superintendent Gail
Pletnick insists the district
is careful not to violate free

36:32.000 --> 36:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
speech or privacy rights.

36:34.066 --> 36:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAIL PLETNICK, Superintendent,
Dysart Unified School District:
We're not crossing that line.

36:36.066 --> 36:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not monitoring people
24/7. We're not the social media
police. But we are concerned

36:42.533 --> 36:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about anything that we feel
will be harmful to our students.

36:49.466 --> 36:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Pletnick says
technology changes so quickly
that schools can find themselves

36:53.633 --> 36:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
operating in a gray area.

36:55.633 --> 36:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GAIL PLETNICK: Those laws,
those rules, those guidelines
that we're going to have to use

36:59.033 --> 37:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are being developed. So,
we're really not only flying
this plane while we build it,

37:04.900 --> 37:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
while it's being designed.

37:07.033 --> 37:10.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: It can be
a rough ride, so Dysart
and other districts are
increasingly starting

37:12.733 --> 37:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to teach digital
citizenship, the responsible
use of technology, to
impress upon students

37:17.266 --> 37:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to think before they click.

37:19.433 --> 37:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: I like
that. That's cute.

LISA STARK: For the "PBS

JUDY WOODRUFF: Fifty percent
of health care spending in
the U.S. can be traced to just

37:41.433 --> 37:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
5 percent of the population.
Those are the sickest and often
poorest Americans who spend

37:48.033 --> 37:51.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
much of their time
cycling in and out of
costly emergency care.

37:51.566 --> 37:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While congressional leaders
square off toward a vote next
week on the future of the health

37:56.033 --> 38:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care law, there are pilot
projects on the ground that
are focused on how to improve

38:02.933 --> 38:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treating this group of patients
and also to save money.
That's even the case in remote

38:06.933 --> 38:08.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
areas.

38:08.966 --> 38:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent
Jackie Judd has our report
from Kalispell, Montana.

38:12.700 --> 38:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Not so long ago,
Sheran Greene and her beloved
dog were living in a car in

38:19.766 --> 38:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
downtown Kalispell, Montana,
and routinely heading to the
local emergency room because

38:25.300 --> 38:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of chronic lung disease and the
need for an electrical outlet.

38:28.966 --> 38:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERAN GREENE, Patient: I
was there like clockwork
every day, sometimes
being treated, sometimes

38:35.966 --> 38:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having to charge up my oxygen
machine, which I used, because
I had no electricity, sometimes

38:42.933 --> 38:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just getting out of the cold.

38:45.266 --> 38:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: It is this cycle
of patients going in and out
of the hospital, at great

38:52.266 --> 38:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cost, with not much benefit,
that the group around this
table is trying to break.

38:55.266 --> 39:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: How can we avoid some
of these emergency room visits
that really are not necessary?

39:02.133 --> 39:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: A pilot program
funded by the federal government
and a foundation began

39:06.666 --> 39:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
late last year in Kalispell,
Billings and Helena.

39:08.966 --> 39:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: How are you?

39:09.966 --> 39:11.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Tired.

39:11.966 --> 39:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Health care players
already in the community now
team up in a very deliberate

39:18.400 --> 39:20.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way to identify high-needs
patients and to go well
beyond the traditional
bounds of medical

39:22.700 --> 39:24.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

39:24.700 --> 39:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LARA SHADWICK, Mountain-Pacific
Quality Health: Do you think
you can find housing that'll

39:25.633 --> 39:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take your Section 8 voucher?

39:26.366 --> 39:27.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Oh, yes.

39:27.866 --> 39:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Lara Shadwick
directs the Montana program.

39:30.533 --> 39:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LARA SHADWICK: Some of the
themes really rest on social
determinants of health, lack of

39:35.266 --> 39:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transportation, housing
insecurity, food insecurity,
economics, finances.
Those are really some

39:42.166 --> 39:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the drivers that
are the commonalities
for these patients.

39:45.166 --> 39:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The Kalispell
care team runs lean. There
are community health workers,

39:52.166 --> 39:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Jane Emmert, who are
trained to manage non-medical
issues works, and the head of

39:55.733 --> 39:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the team, registered
nurse Lesly Starling.

39:59.200 --> 40:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Together, they aim to reset the
paths these patients are on.

40:03.766 --> 40:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESLY STARLING, Kalispell
Regional Healthcare: They're so
sick. They have gotten so used

40:06.233 --> 40:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the way that they live. I
do feel like that patients get
very used to their environment,

40:13.166 --> 40:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they get very used to their
choices. They get very used
to their lifestyle. And it's

40:18.800 --> 40:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not -- it's almost like
they build up an immunity to
what their life looks like.

40:21.200 --> 40:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: David Dixon was
once a member of an emergency
medical team and a fishing

40:28.233 --> 40:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and hunting guide. Since
a disabling motorcycle
accident, he struggles
with chronic pain and

40:34.166 --> 40:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nausea, overuse of
medications and episodes
of depression and anxiety.

40:40.000 --> 40:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a 14-month period, Dixon
went to the E.R. 42 times.

40:44.100 --> 40:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID DIXON, Patient: I just
want to have a better life.
I want to be able to wake up

40:51.033 --> 40:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the morning and have a
halfway decent day. I would like
to be able to make plans for

40:55.933 --> 40:57.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
tomorrow morning.

40:57.966 --> 41:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: In just a few
weeks, the team has helped
Dixon to reconnect with a pain

41:04.533 --> 41:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specialist and link him up to
a pharmacist to sort out the
many medications he is on.

41:09.866 --> 41:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Are you taking that
one also pretty regularly?

41:12.566 --> 41:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID DIXON: There's so many
medicines I'm taking, that I
don't know which ones are really

41:17.000 --> 41:19.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
helping and which ones
aren't at this point.

41:19.166 --> 41:21.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: OK.

41:21.666 --> 41:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dixon,
like so many high-needs
patients, has mental
health issues. Specialists

41:24.833 --> 41:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Kalispell are in short
supply, so Starling typically
gets advice from an expert some

41:31.233 --> 41:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
distance away about how
best to work with patients.

41:34.066 --> 41:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It sounds like you have
been using a lot of those, some
of the motivational interviewing

41:38.100 --> 41:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skills that we have been
talking about, finding
what kind of barriers
there are for him, finding

41:44.066 --> 41:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what his goals are.

41:46.233 --> 41:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Sometimes, a
patient's need is as basic
as a roof over one's head.

41:52.766 --> 41:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The team found Sheran Greene
an affordable apartment, which
is no easy task in Kalispell.

41:59.933 --> 42:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Starling acts as a liaison
to Greene's primary
care doctor. And other
community workers literally

42:05.700 --> 42:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deliver Greene to Dr.
Jonathan Anderson's door.

42:08.933 --> 42:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. JONATHAN ANDERSON,
Greene's Physician: Good.

42:10.800 --> 42:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHERAN GREENE: So,
do I have a heart?

42:12.533 --> 42:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DR. JONATHAN ANDERSON:
It's still beating.

42:14.566 --> 42:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's allowing people into
her life, is what she's doing.
Before, it was basically the

42:19.066 --> 42:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.R. and the hospital, and then
she'd come in for follow-up
visits here, and then she'd

42:23.433 --> 42:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bounce around and come back.
Now she's allowing people from
the community to come in, and

42:28.200 --> 42:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allow them to help, either help
her move things, allow them
to kind of check in on her and

42:34.066 --> 42:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make sure she's doing all right.

42:36.166 --> 42:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: When Greene was
homeless, in one six-month
period, her Medicare charges

42:41.733 --> 42:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were $100,000. Since
November, hospital charges
are less than $6,000.

42:47.500 --> 42:52.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By the time this pilot program
ends, the hope is over $2
million will be saved. Programs

42:54.566 --> 42:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like these first came to urban
areas. Rolling one out in a
vast rural state like Montana

43:01.400 --> 43:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a very different kind of
experiment, with very unique
challenges, starting with simple

43:07.066 --> 43:09.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
geography.

43:09.066 --> 43:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE EMMERT, Director, ASSIST:
Sometimes, we're going on
mountainous roads that are

43:11.133 --> 43:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
icy and treacherous. Sometimes,
they're narrow dirt roads that
you aren't sure that you want

43:16.733 --> 43:18.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to go down.

43:18.700 --> 43:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: To get to a patient
can be a 60-mile round trip.
So Emmert frequently heads

43:24.700 --> 43:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out on her own to their homes,
as she did on this day, to
visit 25-year-old Mackenzie

43:31.666 --> 43:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kramer, who is slowly
recovering from major surgery.

43:38.700 --> 43:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE EMMERT: So, if you try to
do any of this, and it's tough
for you, just know what we'd

43:43.800 --> 43:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be glad to help you fill it out.

43:45.866 --> 43:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Emmert is there to
help him manage the paperwork
for disability, and to put him

43:51.566 --> 43:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in touch with Starling, who
can check up on many more
patients if she stays behind in

43:56.600 --> 43:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her Kalispell office.

43:57.866 --> 44:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LESLY STARLING: How
has the pain been?

44:01.266 --> 44:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: It's been manageable.
It's getting better, I think.

44:05.300 --> 44:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The team also
gently pushes Kramer to think
about his future once his health

44:11.333 --> 44:13.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stabilizes.

44:13.433 --> 44:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE EMMERT: He's got to have
something to look forward to.
So that's why we're looking

44:16.033 --> 44:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into possibilities with college,
or a job, that he could reclaim
the life of a 25-year-old

44:22.100 --> 44:24.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

44:24.133 --> 44:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Part of the goal is to help
you connect to things you
might not have already.

44:27.733 --> 44:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Somebody that knows
where to go, how to do it.

44:30.533 --> 44:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: You have a
whole team of people, right?

44:32.966 --> 44:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Well, I have a
whole team of people.

44:34.966 --> 44:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Progress with
these patients can come in
fits and starts. Less than 24

44:41.733 --> 44:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hours after a home visit filled
with encouragement to manage
his illnesses differently, David

44:46.633 --> 44:49.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dixon takes himself
back to the E.R.

44:49.100 --> 44:51.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: What happened?

44:51.100 --> 44:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID DIXON: I woke up nauseous
and vomiting, and took my
medicines and couldn't keep my

44:56.566 --> 45:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
medicines down, so I went for
a trip to the hospital again.

45:00.666 --> 45:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: Dixon's team
wasn't surprised that he went
to the hospital, his visit a

45:07.666 --> 45:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reminder of how fragile these
patients are and how much work
it takes to break the cycle.

45:14.066 --> 45:18.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID DIXON: It's taken
years to get me where I
am. They're starting to
understand it. They're

45:20.133 --> 45:23.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
starting to get programs
together that fill in
the gaps in the medical
profession, where

45:24.633 --> 45:26.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I had problems before.

45:26.666 --> 45:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't know everything.
It's not a magic wand, but
at least they're trying.

45:32.966 --> 45:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE JUDD: The pilot program
has another year to prove
these intensive interventions

45:37.966 --> 45:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can succeed, and, if so,
whether there is the funding
and the will to make them a new

45:43.033 --> 45:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
standard of care for the most
challenging people to treat.

45:49.266 --> 45:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "NewsHour,"
this is Jackie Judd
in Kalispell, Montana.

45:54.466 --> 45:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two quick
notes about Jackie's story.

45:58.200 --> 46:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is not yet clear
whether the moves by the
president and Republicans
to replace the Affordable

46:02.933 --> 46:06.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Care Act will affect the funding
of programs like this one.

46:06.700 --> 46:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, for the record, the Robert
Wood Johnson Foundation, which
helps to fund the Kalispell

46:11.666 --> 46:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pilot program, is also a
funder of the "NewsHour."

46:26.933 --> 46:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally tonight: Humorist David
Sedaris plumbs his own diaries
for his latest book showcasing

46:32.800 --> 46:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
life's idiosyncrasies.

46:35.200 --> 46:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown sat down with
Sedaris recently, amidst his
performing around the country in

46:40.800 --> 46:42.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some 120 cities.

46:42.833 --> 46:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A 60-year-old
hugely successful writer looking
back at his younger self, the

46:50.533 --> 46:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one before the millions of
books sold, the countless live
appearances before adoring

46:57.433 --> 47:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
audiences and often, in
his culottes, the regular
appearances on late-night TV.

47:04.133 --> 47:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On a recent morning, we joined
David Sedaris at the archives
of La MaMa Theatre in Lower

47:10.766 --> 47:14.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Manhattan, one of the
small stages where he
first told stories.

47:14.166 --> 47:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a new book titled "Theft By
Finding,®MD-B" Sedaris offers
a kind of fractured portrait

47:20.766 --> 47:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the artist behind
the stories, through
his personal diaries.

47:23.100 --> 47:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS, Author, "Theft
By Finding": Trying this
persona on and that persona on

47:26.566 --> 47:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, you know, trying acting,
and oh, now look, I'm trying
sculpture, and now, all the

47:33.833 --> 47:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sudden, I'm a painter. But
that you could kind of settle
on being yourself, completely

47:40.766 --> 47:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yourself, and have that be
the thing that works, is being
yourself, is, to me, incredible.

47:48.166 --> 47:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sedaris
was raised in a large
family in Raleigh,
North Carolina, and many

47:55.633 --> 47:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his stories involve
his parents and siblings,
including sister Amy,
a well-known humorist

47:59.933 --> 48:02.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in her own right.

48:02.433 --> 48:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His colorfully titled story
collections, including
"Me Talk Pretty One
Day," "Dress Your Family

48:08.233 --> 48:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Corduroy and Denim,"
and "Let's Explore
Diabetes With Owls," are
perennial bestsellers.

48:13.966 --> 48:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And NPR regularly replays
perhaps his most famous story,
"SantaLand Diaries," about the

48:19.933 --> 48:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
time he worked as
an elf at Macy's.

48:21.900 --> 48:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Twenty-two
thousand people came to see
Santa today, and not all of them

48:28.933 --> 48:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were well-behaved.
Today, I witnessed
fistfights and vomiting
and magnificent tantrums.

48:31.866 --> 48:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That experience
appears in his diaries
beginning on October 31, 1990,

48:38.700 --> 48:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when he is told:
"Congratulations, Mr.
Sedaris. You are an elf."

48:42.100 --> 48:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, you can't not
write and keep a diary?

48:45.200 --> 48:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Well, it's funny,
because, sometimes, people
would say, oh, that's very

48:48.933 --> 48:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disciplined. But it's not a
discipline. It is a compulsion.

48:51.833 --> 48:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I should be out doing things,
but I have to write about these
people I saw at dinner the

48:58.833 --> 49:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night before. I have to write
about the bellman at my hotel.
I have to write about something

49:05.633 --> 49:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that ultimately doesn't matter
at all. But I -- I don't
know. I can't move on until I

49:10.466 --> 49:12.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get that down.

49:12.400 --> 49:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you
overhear something or you record
something in your diary, is

49:16.033 --> 49:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
there kind of, aha, this
is something I can use?

49:19.833 --> 49:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: I flew here
from London. I was at Newark
Airport waiting for someone

49:24.033 --> 49:26.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to pick me up.

49:26.066 --> 49:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I saw a couple, and they
were in their mid-60s. And
then she said to him, where's

49:29.800 --> 49:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other suitcase? And he
said, what other suitcase? She
said, you left home dragging

49:36.800 --> 49:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two suitcases behind you. Now
you have got one. The other one
is mine. Where's my suitcase?

49:41.500 --> 49:43.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You lost my suitcase.

49:43.533 --> 49:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I thought, wow. I mean, I have
been in a similar situation,
right? And just the entire look

49:50.766 --> 49:55.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on her face, like, if I could
leave you now, or if I could
kill you now, I would do it.

49:57.766 --> 50:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I had to write about
that. Maybe one day, I would
write a story about arguing in

50:07.266 --> 50:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
public, and those would
come in handy in some way.

50:14.300 --> 50:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's also, like, if I were
going to remember yesterday,
I flew here in an airplane and

50:21.300 --> 50:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did this and that. But that
was really the moment yesterday
where I felt like I was living

50:29.333 --> 50:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my life, like I was in the
moment. I wasn't thinking about
the past or about the future.

50:36.333 --> 50:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was just right there living,
visiting and listening, watching
those people have an argument.

50:43.233 --> 50:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And that sense
is important to you somehow?

50:46.566 --> 50:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Well, because I
spend so much time like living
in the past or the future.

50:53.600 --> 50:57.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I think most people
do, really. And the moments
when you're really present in

50:59.333 --> 51:02.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your life can be
pretty rare, really.

51:02.366 --> 51:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sedaris'
stories appear regularly
in "The New Yorker." On
the day we got together,

51:09.033 --> 51:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he was just finishing a new one.

51:11.100 --> 51:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in the printed stories and
on stage, you're presenting, in
some sense, a character named

51:18.933 --> 51:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, David Sedaris,
right? Your family members,
your partner, Hugh.
Talking to you now, I'm

51:25.833 --> 51:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not sure if you think of
them as characters or you're
just writing yourself.

51:28.300 --> 51:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Well, I think
people are people in real life,
but the second you put them

51:34.500 --> 51:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on page -- on the page,
they become characters.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And how
worked over are your stories?

51:39.633 --> 51:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Gosh, the story
that -- I sent in a draft this
morning for this "New Yorker"

51:46.866 --> 51:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story that we're closing,
and it's the 21st draft.

51:48.233 --> 51:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN:
Twenty-first draft?

51:49.466 --> 51:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDARIS: Mm-hmm.

51:50.966 --> 51:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is it tinkering
over words or jokes or...

51:54.000 --> 51:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: It's tinkering
over words. I will go on tour
with, like, let's say three

51:58.366 --> 52:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new stories, and I will read
them and go back to the room
and rewrite them, and read them

52:01.933 --> 52:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and rewrite them.

52:03.966 --> 52:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what does
a story in the end have to
have to be successful, to work

52:08.400 --> 52:10.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for you?

52:10.533 --> 52:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDARIS: It used
to be about just racking
up laughs, right? But
I think you need, like,

52:16.133 --> 52:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some sorrow to give the laughter
a bit of weight. And that's
when you remember things.

52:23.600 --> 52:25.633 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Or that's when I
remember things.

52:25.633 --> 52:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So people come
and they want - - you think
they want laughter, but you want

52:31.700 --> 52:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
something more. You want
to give them something
more. What is that more?

52:35.133 --> 52:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: I want to
connect with them. I want them
to -- usually, it's the worst

52:42.133 --> 52:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing you can admit about
yourself that most people
can relate to. Right?

52:47.833 --> 52:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was so surprising to me when
I realized that, that when I
thought, well, if you write

52:53.266 --> 52:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about, say, your own jealousy,
people aren't going to think,
oh, he's a horrible person

52:59.633 --> 53:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because he's jealous. They
will think, that's me.

53:03.166 --> 53:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Was there
always an ambition? Was there
always a kind of craving to not

53:09.300 --> 53:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
only get to a bigger
world, but reach people?

53:13.166 --> 53:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID SEDARIS: Yes. It's
all I ever wanted. It's
all I ever thought about.

53:20.200 --> 53:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I go on tour and I'm on
stage and the lights come up
at the end and I see those

53:23.300 --> 53:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, people say, oh, that
must be awful. You go on tour
and you go to 40 cities in

53:30.266 --> 53:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
41 days. And then you have
the book signing. And that's
people standing in line to say

53:36.833 --> 53:38.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how much they love you.

53:38.166 --> 53:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes,
for hours sometimes.

53:39.866 --> 53:41.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDARIS: And I
don't see any part of
that that's negative.

53:41.900 --> 53:43.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

53:43.533 --> 53:47.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVID SEDARIS: It's all
I ever dreamed about
like from age to 6 up.

53:49.866 --> 53:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: David Sedaris
will continue to tell his
stories and write his diaries

53:55.533 --> 53:57.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in his travels at home
and abroad this summer.

53:57.666 --> 54:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown in New York.

54:04.666 --> 54:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online right now:
Six members of the Presidential
Advisory Council on HIV-AIDS

54:17.333 --> 54:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recently resigned, saying
President Donald Trump -- quote
-- "doesn't care about the

54:22.300 --> 54:24.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
disease."

54:24.266 --> 54:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"PBS NewsHour"'s Pamela
Kirkland interviews one of those
members who quit the council.

54:27.800 --> 54:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You can watch that
on our Facebook page,
Facebook.com/NewsHour.

54:34.233 --> 54:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
