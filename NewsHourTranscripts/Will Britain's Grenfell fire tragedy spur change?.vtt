JUDY WOODRUFF: But first:
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa
May has promised a national

00:04.333 --> 00:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation into the exterior
paneling, called cladding,
used in the construction

00:11.333 --> 00:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of high-rise buildings,
this in the wake of
the London apartment
fire two weeks ago that

00:15.533 --> 00:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
left at least 80 dead.

00:17.500 --> 00:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Testing shows that the paneling
is highly flammable, and is
found on apartment blocks

00:21.366 --> 00:22.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around Britain.

00:22.633 --> 00:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is thought to have
accelerated the fire.

00:25.266 --> 00:30.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The disaster at Grenfell
Tower has seriously
undermined confidence
in Prime Minister May's

00:31.333 --> 00:33.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Conservative
minority government.

00:33.433 --> 00:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many believe the tragedy could
mark a turning point in how
Britain cares for its poorest.

00:39.300 --> 00:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
From London, Malcolm
Brabant reports.

00:41.733 --> 00:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The faces
of Grenfell Tower haunt the
streets of North Kensington.

00:48.133 --> 00:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hope that the missing will
ever be found has long expired.

00:51.233 --> 00:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Two weeks on, the official
death toll remains at 79.

00:55.333 --> 01:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This traumatized community is
convinced at least 100 perished,
if not more, in what was

01:01.266 --> 01:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a high-rise crematorium.

01:03.266 --> 01:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LAMMY, Parliament Member:
Grenfell is a monumental
disaster on a scale that we have

01:08.133 --> 01:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not seen for a generation.

01:10.233 --> 01:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It raises huge issues about how
Britain cares for people that
are poorer in our social housing

01:19.033 --> 01:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in particular who need
the state to house them.

01:21.466 --> 01:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's absolutely clear that what
we have seen is gross negligence
or corporate manslaughter.

01:25.866 --> 01:30.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
memorials proffer silent
protests and demand reform.

01:30.766 --> 01:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lawmaker David Lammy, who
lost a friend in the fire,
is leading the charge.

01:35.566 --> 01:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LAMMY: At its heart,
Brits like to see themselves
as fair and as tolerant.

01:42.633 --> 01:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What they saw in Grenfell
has alarmed them.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They really saw the face
of a welfare state that
has largely disappeared.

01:49.800 --> 01:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I do believe Grenfell
is a turning point.

01:52.633 --> 01:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a Hurricane Katrina moment.

01:54.700 --> 01:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: During urgent
safety spot checks in 120
public housing blocks across

02:00.900 --> 02:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Britain, cladding in
every single case failed
fire resistance tests.

02:04.400 --> 02:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the London borough of
Camden, the risk to tenants was
compounded by other inadequate

02:09.033 --> 02:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fire protection measures and
considered so severe that the
council ordered the immediate

02:13.933 --> 02:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evacuation of 4,000
people over last weekend.

02:16.833 --> 02:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I think they're behaving
ridiculous, to be quite
honest with you, because they

02:23.233 --> 02:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have known for seven years
about all this stuff.

02:25.233 --> 02:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The system is broken,
it's cracking up, and it's
evident to see for everybody.

02:28.200 --> 02:33.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As
refugees from the wars
of former Yugoslavia,
Alen and Andrea Kevric

02:34.333 --> 02:36.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are used to leaving
home in a hurry.

02:36.400 --> 02:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The council gave them $7,500
for temporary accommodation
during repairs, but a private

02:41.700 --> 02:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rental agency rejected them.

02:43.766 --> 02:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREA KEVRIC, Nurse: They
actually realized who we are,
that we are plebs from social

02:48.733 --> 02:50.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
housing.

02:50.066 --> 02:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they don't want us there.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the reality, how people
are treated in this country.

02:56.700 --> 03:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: According to
local council officials, the
fire department recommended

03:00.766 --> 03:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evacuation, but hundreds of
residents refused to move.

03:04.500 --> 03:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Kevrices, who have four
children, are uncertain about
their immediate future in

03:08.933 --> 03:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a country that has
become their home.

03:11.100 --> 03:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In common with many immigrants,
they have low-paid jobs and
are priced out of London's

03:15.500 --> 03:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
expensive housing market.

03:17.600 --> 03:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREA KEVRIC: To make some
kind of decent living, I have
to be in social housing, which

03:25.733 --> 03:30.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm very lucky to be
in, because it's so rare
and hard to come by.

03:30.700 --> 03:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was lucky to get it.

03:32.733 --> 03:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so my rent is considerably
reduced, but, even with
that, we just make ends meet.

03:39.533 --> 03:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEN KEVRIC, Premises Manager:
The divide between rich and
poor unfortunately only gets

03:47.933 --> 03:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exposed with the worst
kind of disasters.

03:51.233 --> 03:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
History will teach us as well
that's the only way when we
can actually ask for change.

03:58.133 --> 04:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This crisis
coincides with a slew of
reports highlighting poverty in

04:01.766 --> 04:03.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Britain.

04:03.833 --> 04:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. children's agency,
UNICEF, says Britain has some of
the highest levels of hunger and

04:07.300 --> 04:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deprivation amongst the
world's richest nations.

04:10.533 --> 04:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It claims that one in
three British children
experience poverty in
terms of food, clothing

04:15.366 --> 04:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and social activities.

04:17.400 --> 04:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The housing charity shelter
warns a million families could
be made homeless by 2020.

04:24.366 --> 04:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Volunteers at this food bank
in the heart of London are
taking delivery of donations

04:27.933 --> 04:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that will help
sustain 50 people.

04:31.066 --> 04:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The food bank charity Trussell
Trust is reporting today that
four in five of its clients are

04:37.400 --> 04:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going hungry for days at a time.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOROTHEA HACKMAN, Trussell
Trust: A big group of those are
not receiving their benefits,

04:43.300 --> 04:44.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
benefit delayed.

04:44.566 --> 04:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The next biggest
group are low-income.

04:47.333 --> 04:50.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And these are people
who are just managing.

04:50.200 --> 04:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one crisis, a canceled
day's work, an additional bill,
a sick child, any of those

04:57.933 --> 05:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
issues can tip them
into desperately
needing more assistance.

05:01.833 --> 05:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dr.
Youssef El-Gingihy, a
general practitioner and
author who has campaigned

05:08.833 --> 05:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against cuts in the National
Health Service, believes that
Britain's political tide is

05:11.633 --> 05:12.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
turning irrevocably.

05:12.633 --> 05:14.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

05:14.066 --> 05:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
YOUSSEF EL-GINGIHY,
Activist: Austerity kills.

05:16.633 --> 05:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This terrible tragedy
with the Grenfell Tower
fire has unfortunately
become this grim monument,

05:21.666 --> 05:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this rather ghastly memorial for
the Conservative government's
austerity regime of massive cuts

05:27.666 --> 05:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to public spending,
particularly on public services.

05:30.900 --> 05:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
argument about austerity
erupted in Parliament today.

05:34.833 --> 05:37.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are there questions
for the prime minister.

05:37.766 --> 05:40.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jeremy Corbyn?

05:40.200 --> 05:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN, Leader,
Labor Party: This
disregard for working-class
communities, the terrible

05:45.733 --> 05:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
consequences of deregulation
and cutting corners, I urge the
prime minister to come up with

05:52.166 --> 05:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the resources needed to
test and remove cladding,
retrofit sprinklers,
properly fund the fire

05:59.633 --> 06:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
service and the police, so that
all our communities can truly
feel safe in their own homes.

06:08.100 --> 06:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: The cladding of
tower blocks didn't start
under this government.

06:17.500 --> 06:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It didn't start under the
previous coalition government.

06:22.433 --> 06:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The cladding of tower
blocks began under
the Blair government.

06:26.333 --> 06:30.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's
been 10 years since Tony
Blair was prime minister.

06:30.166 --> 06:35.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under Corbyn, Labor has
returned to its socialist
roots, and a rock star
welcome at last weekend's

06:37.100 --> 06:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Glastonbury music festival
showed his popularity
amongst young people.

06:39.633 --> 06:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN: Is it right that
so many people in our country
have no home to live in, and

06:45.900 --> 06:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
only a street to sleep on?

06:48.100 --> 06:50.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AUDIENCE: No!

06:50.166 --> 06:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMY CORBYN: Is it right that
so many people live in such
poverty in a society surrounded

06:57.400 --> 06:59.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by such riches?

06:59.133 --> 07:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, it obviously is not.

07:01.233 --> 07:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLAIRE-LOUISE LEYLAND, Camden
Councillor: Did you like it?

07:03.666 --> 07:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT:
Conservatives like Camden
Councillor Claire-Louise
Leyland are fighting

07:06.500 --> 07:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Corbyn's portrayal of the
Conservatives as uncaring.

07:09.833 --> 07:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE-LOUISE LEYLAND: It's
duplicitous and I think really
unhelpful for people who are

07:14.766 --> 07:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to deal with trauma
to try and turn this into
such a simple argument.

07:20.633 --> 07:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Difficult choices were made.

07:22.700 --> 07:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Things happened that shouldn't
have happened, and we need to
really explore what went wrong.

07:26.600 --> 07:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As the
politicians fight for the moral
high ground over Grenfell, there

07:30.633 --> 07:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is yet another report about
divided Britain by a commission
which says that successive

07:38.066 --> 07:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Labor and Conservative
governments have failed
to reduce the gap
between the haves and the

07:41.433 --> 07:43.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have-nots.

07:43.466 --> 07:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Social Mobility Commission
warns that, unless there is
urgent radical and reform,

07:46.600 --> 07:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the divisions in Britain
will get widen even,
threatening social cohesion
and economic prosperity.

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in London.
