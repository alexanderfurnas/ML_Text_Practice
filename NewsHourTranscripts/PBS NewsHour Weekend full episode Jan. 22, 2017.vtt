AS THESE TWO PRESIDENTS MEET?

06:28.433 --> 06:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THE BIGGEST ISSUE

06:31.033 --> 06:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WILL AFFECT MOST MEXICANS

06:32.733 --> 06:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THE TRADE ISSUE.

06:36.100 --> 06:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID HE'S

06:37.500 --> 06:38.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO SCRAP THE NORTH

06:46.967 --> 06:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IN THE PAST TWO DECADES HAVE

06:49.167 --> 06:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN PRETTY EXTREME AND THAT'S

06:50.533 --> 06:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING THEY DON'T WANT TO

06:51.500 --> 06:52.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOSE.

06:52.167 --> 06:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE WALL WHILE IT MAY

06:53.667 --> 06:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE A MORE SYMBOLIC

06:57.733 --> 06:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR-- SYMBOLIC IMPACT, THE TRADE

06:58.933 --> 07:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES ARE REALLY THE ONES THAT

07:01.200 --> 07:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKE FEAR INTO THE HEART OF.

07:04.633 --> 07:06.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT MEXICAN

07:06.067 --> 07:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALL THAT MR. TRUMP SAYS HE'S

07:08.067 --> 07:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO BUILD AND CLAIMS HE IS

07:09.967 --> 07:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO GET MEXICAN PAY FOR IT.

07:11.967 --> 07:13.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE HAS THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT

07:13.167 --> 07:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME DOWN ON THIS.

07:14.900 --> 07:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY HAVE BEEN CLEAR ALL

07:15.700 --> 07:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONG THEY ARE NOT GOING TO PAY

07:17.000 --> 07:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE WALL.

07:17.833 --> 07:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS ONE THING THEY HAVE BEEN

07:19.467 --> 07:20.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSISTENT WITH.

07:20.167 --> 07:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT SAID THAT

07:21.633 --> 07:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER AND OVER THAT MEXICAN

07:23.700 --> 07:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT NEATO SAID SO

07:25.733 --> 07:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDING JUST A COUPLE OF DAYS

AGO.

07:27.167 --> 07:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I

07:28.500 --> 07:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T THINK AT LEAST-- I DON'T

07:30.500 --> 07:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE.

07:31.933 --> 07:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> PENA NEATO'S APPROVAL RATING

07:34.300 --> 07:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL,

AT LEAST BY 12% IN ONE ACCOUNT.

07:38.800 --> 07:40.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW MUCH HAS THAT HAD TO DO WITH

HOW MUCH HE HAS HANDLED THINGS

07:42.000 --> 07:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT HOME, AND HOW MUCH HAS THAT

07:43.800 --> 07:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN HOW HE HAS HANDLED

07:45.900 --> 07:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MR. TRUMP THUS FAR?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HOW HE HAS HANDLED MR. TRUMP

07:48.467 --> 07:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS GIVEN HIS APPROVAL RATINGS

07:50.400 --> 07:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER KICK DOWNWARDS.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HASN'T BEEN POPULAR HERE FOR

07:53.367 --> 07:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A COUPLE OF YEARS.

07:54.167 --> 07:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF

SCANDALS HERE IN MEXICO DURING

07:58.400 --> 07:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS ADMINISTRATION.

07:59.833 --> 08:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ECONOMY IS NOT DOING VERY

08:01.000 --> 08:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL.

08:01.767 --> 08:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE'S NOT VERY POPULAR.

08:03.633 --> 08:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS NOT BEEN POPULAR FOR A

08:05.333 --> 08:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG TIME.

08:06.400 --> 08:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE TRUMP VISIT,

08:07.800 --> 08:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY AUGUST, WAS A BIG

08:08.967 --> 08:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL FOR A LOT OF MEXICANS.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT NEATO INVITED DONALD

08:19.233 --> 08:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DONALD TRUMP'S CAMPAIGN, EVEN

08:23.300 --> 08:26.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SO THAT WAS SEEN-- THAT WAS

08:29.000 --> 08:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING THAT REALLY WAS

08:30.000 --> 08:32.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNPOPULAR FOR A LOT OF MEXICANS.

08:32.267 --> 08:33.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SELF-CONFIDENCE, WITHOUT FEAR

08:42.267 --> 08:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:43.800 --> 08:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND POLITICAL IMPORTANCE THAT

08:45.000 --> 08:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:46.867 --> 08:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FRAMING IS VERY DIFFERENT

08:47.867 --> 08:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ARE SO INTERTWINED THAT MEXICO

08:53.167 --> 08:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INTERCONNECTED.

09:03.267 --> 09:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BILLION OF TRADE EACH YEAR BACK

09:07.633 --> 09:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:10.167 --> 09:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT YOU KNOW, IT'S ALSO CLEAR

09:11.967 --> 09:13.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MEXICO IS THE WEAKER

PARTNER HERE.

09:14.667 --> 09:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:16.967 --> 09:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE SECURITY OF OTHER COUNTRIES

22:15.000 --> 22:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONG THIS SIDE OF NATO BECAUSE

22:16.967 --> 22:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S THE LARGEST COUNTRY AND THE

22:19.267 --> 22:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE WITH THE MOST CAPABLE

22:21.233 --> 22:22.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY ITSELF.

22:22.167 --> 22:24.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT IN

22:24.167 --> 22:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES.

22:26.233 --> 22:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE WHO HAS QUESTIONED THE

22:27.167 --> 22:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES ROLE WITHIN NATO.

22:28.500 --> 22:31.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THERE ANY CONCERN THERE THAT

22:31.067 --> 22:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S. TROOPS WILL BE ASKED TO

22:32.933 --> 22:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME HOME TO RETURN HOME BY THE

22:34.867 --> 22:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION?

22:36.067 --> 22:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK THE GOVERNMENT

22:37.000 --> 22:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE PRESIDENT OF POLAND ARE

22:38.833 --> 22:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING A

22:40.800 --> 22:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETAILED-- THERE HAS BEEN SOME

22:41.733 --> 22:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTACT ALREADY.

22:42.933 --> 22:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO

22:44.000 --> 22:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVING A DETAILED CONVERSATION

22:45.700 --> 22:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE SECURITY IN THIS

22:46.733 --> 22:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGION AND ABOUT HOW THE UNITED

22:48.033 --> 22:50.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES IN POLAND, POLAND SEES

22:50.467 --> 22:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES AS ITS PRIMARY

22:52.333 --> 22:53.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRATEGIC ALLY.

22:53.167 --> 22:55.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE WHOLE ALLIANCE CAN

22:55.467 --> 22:56.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENSURE SECURITY IN THIS REGION.

22:56.567 --> 22:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ONE OF MR. TRUMP'S CRITICISMS

22:58.800 --> 23:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF NATO IS THAT ALL THE MEMBER

23:01.300 --> 23:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO DEVOTE

23:03.000 --> 23:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2% TO THEIR GDP TO DEFENSE.

23:05.633 --> 23:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY FIVE NATIONS TO DO, THE

23:08.000 --> 23:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES AND POLAND BEING

23:09.467 --> 23:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO OF THE FIVE.

23:10.167 --> 23:12.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IT-- IS THERE ANYTHING THAT

23:12.067 --> 23:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU AND OTHER DIPLOMATS CAN DO

23:13.767 --> 23:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CREATE MORE EQUITY IN THAT

23:14.900 --> 23:15.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION?

23:15.967 --> 23:17.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DOES IT EVER CAUSE TENSIONS

23:17.367 --> 23:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN THE MEMBER NATIONS?

23:19.033 --> 23:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, AS YOU SAY, POLAND

23:21.067 --> 23:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS CONTRIBUTING ITS TWO PERCENT.

23:22.600 --> 23:25.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ACTUALLY IS INVOLVED IN A

23:25.567 --> 23:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROADER MILITARY MODERNIZATION

23:27.333 --> 23:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES VERY

23:29.200 --> 23:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT PURCHASES OF

23:30.600 --> 23:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY EQUIPMENT, AND WEAPONRY

23:32.933 --> 23:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE UNITED STATES AS PART

23:34.700 --> 23:36.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THAT.

23:36.067 --> 23:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO BUT I THINK YOU SEE OVER ALL,

23:39.333 --> 23:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A GROWING SENSE WITHIN THE

23:41.000 --> 23:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLIANCE THAT WE HAVE TO PICK UP

23:43.200 --> 23:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PACE OF EVERY ALLY REACHING

23:45.733 --> 23:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TWO PERCENT AND EVERY ALLY

23:47.733 --> 23:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTRIBUTING.

23:48.533 --> 23:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE SEE THAT, REALLY, IN WHAT

23:50.400 --> 23:52.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS HAPPENING IN THIS PART OF THE

23:52.167 --> 23:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLIANCE.

23:52.900 --> 23:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS I SAY, POLAND IS A BIG

23:55.000 --> 23:57.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTRIBUTOR TO THAT.

23:57.267 --> 23:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
