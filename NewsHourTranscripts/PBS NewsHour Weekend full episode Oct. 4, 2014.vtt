00:13.247 --> 00:14.581
AMERICA’S TOP HEALTH EXPERTS

TALKS TO US ABOUT COMBATING

00:16.183 --> 00:18.652
EBOLA IN THIS COUNTRY; PRIME

00:18.652 --> 00:19.953
MINISTER DAVID CAMERON VOWS

00:19.953 --> 00:21.388
REVENGE FOR THE BEHEADING OF A

00:22.990 --> 00:25.225
MILITANTS; AND THE BIG BUSINESS

00:25.225 --> 00:26.793

00:26.793 --> 00:29.296
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.865
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:31.865 --> 00:33.400
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:33.400 --> 00:34.935
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.037
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.538
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.740
U.S. HEALTH OFFICIALS SAID TODAY

00:39.740 --> 00:42.209
THEY HAVE FIELDED INQUIRIES

00:42.209 --> 00:43.877
ABOUT 100 SUSPECTED CASES OF

00:43.877 --> 00:45.212
EBOLA SINCE THE FIRST CASE IN

00:45.212 --> 00:46.647
THE UNITED STATES WAS CONFIRMED

00:46.647 --> 00:48.181
IN DALLAS, BUT THAT NO NEW

00:48.181 --> 00:50.517
INFECTIONS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.652
THIS AFTERNOON, OFFICIALS FROM

00:51.652 --> 00:53.587
THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL

00:53.587 --> 00:55.155
RACED TO NEWARK AIRPORT TO MEET

00:55.155 --> 00:55.622
A PLANE THAT HAD LANDED FROM

00:55.622 --> 00:57.424
BRUSSELS.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.426
TWO PASSENGERS BELIEVED TO BE

00:59.426 --> 00:59.960
FROM LIBERIA BECAME ILL DURING

00:59.960 --> 01:01.628
THE FLIGHT.

01:01.628 --> 01:03.230
LATER, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAID THE

01:03.230 --> 01:03.730
TWO APPARENTLY DO NOT HAVE

01:03.730 --> 01:05.232
EBOLA.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.900
ANOTHER SIMILAR SCARE WAS

01:06.900 --> 01:08.602
REPORTED IN WEST FLORIDA TODAY.

01:08.602 --> 01:09.870
AND THOSE TWO SUSPECTED CASES IN

01:09.870 --> 01:11.471
THE WASHINGTON, D.C., AREA

01:11.471 --> 01:12.005
TURNED OUT NOT TO BE EBOLA,

01:12.005 --> 01:14.241
EITHER.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.043
BUT THOMAS ERIC DUNCAN, THE

01:16.043 --> 01:18.445
LIBERIAN MAN WHO ON THURSDAY

01:18.445 --> 01:19.546
BECAME THE FIRST PERSON IN THE

01:19.546 --> 01:21.415
U.S. WITH EBOLA, TODAY WAS

01:21.415 --> 01:22.616
DOWNGRADED FROM SERIOUS TO

01:22.616 --> 01:24.251
CRITICAL CONDITION.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.585
JOINING US NOW FROM WASHINGTON

01:25.585 --> 01:26.420
IS ONE OF THE NATION’S TOP

01:26.420 --> 01:27.854
HEALTH EXPERTS.

01:27.854 --> 01:28.889
DR. ANTHONY FAUCI IS THE

01:28.889 --> 01:29.990
DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL

01:29.990 --> 01:31.258
INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND

01:31.258 --> 01:33.994
INFECTIOUS DISEASES.

01:33.994 --> 01:34.728
THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SAYING

01:34.728 --> 01:35.562
THAT THEY ARE PREPARED, THAT

01:35.562 --> 01:36.530
THEY’VE BEEN SENDING OUT

01:36.530 --> 01:38.265
INFORMATION FOR WEEKS.

01:38.265 --> 01:40.067
IS THERE IN THAT INFORMATION A

01:40.067 --> 01:41.969
CHECKLIST FOR HOSPITALS TO GO

01:41.969 --> 01:43.470
THROUGH ON WHAT TO DO IF SOMEONE

01:43.470 --> 01:45.005
WALKS INTO THEIR EMERGENCY ROOM

01:45.005 --> 01:45.706
AND HAS THESE SYMPTOMS, WITH

01:45.706 --> 01:48.909
THIS TRAVEL HISTORY?

01:48.909 --> 01:49.676
>> INDEED, THERE IS.

01:49.676 --> 01:50.777
THERE IS A CERTAIN THING CALLED

01:50.777 --> 01:55.048
THE HAN- H-A-N-- THE HEALTH

01:55.048 --> 02:01.488
ALERT NETWORK.

02:01.488 --> 02:02.289
THE C.D.C. HAS BEEN SENDING OUT

02:02.289 --> 02:03.156
SEVERAL OF THESE OVER THE LAST

02:03.156 --> 02:03.857
WEEKS TO MONTHS TO UNDERSCORE

02:03.857 --> 02:04.591
SEVERAL THINGS.

02:04.591 --> 02:05.559
AND THE ONE THAT’S MOST RELEVANT

02:05.559 --> 02:06.326
TO WHAT WE’RE TALKING ABOUT

02:06.326 --> 02:07.661
TODAY IS THE SPECIFIC ALERT THAT

02:07.661 --> 02:10.831
IF SOMEONE COMES INTO AN

02:10.831 --> 02:16.770
EMERGENCY ROOM OR A CLINIC WITH

02:16.770 --> 02:18.438
SYMPTOMS THAT ARE SUGGESTIVE

02:18.438 --> 02:18.872
OF EBOLA, IT’S IMPORTANT THAT

02:18.872 --> 02:19.873
YOU TAKE A TRAVEL HISTORY.

02:19.873 --> 02:20.807
IF A PERSON TELL YOU THAT

02:20.807 --> 02:21.775
THEY’VE RECENTLY TRAVELED TO

02:21.775 --> 02:22.676
WEST AFRICA AND HAVE COME BACK,

02:22.676 --> 02:24.978
THAT YOU THEN TREAT THEM IN A

02:24.978 --> 02:26.613
WAY THAT KEEPS THEM TO BE

02:26.613 --> 02:28.482
OBSERVED BEFORE YOU RULE OUT THE

02:28.482 --> 02:29.049
POSSIBILITY THAT THEY HAVE

02:29.049 --> 02:32.319
EBOLA.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.220
SO, THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN IN

02:33.220 --> 02:34.755
INSTRUCTIONS AND ALERTS NOW FOR

02:34.755 --> 02:36.023
A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME.

02:36.023 --> 02:36.857
>> Sreenivasan: IS IT JUST A

02:36.857 --> 02:37.624
MATTER THAT SOME OF THESE

02:37.624 --> 02:38.392
HOSPITALS JUST DID NOT PAY

02:38.392 --> 02:39.593
ATTENTION TO?

02:39.593 --> 02:41.094
BECAUSE WHY DID THE CASE IN

02:41.094 --> 02:42.462
DALLAS TURN OUT THE WAY THAT IT

02:42.462 --> 02:47.601
DID IF THE HOSPITALS HAD THIS

02:47.601 --> 02:48.535
INFORMATION?

02:48.535 --> 02:49.269
>> WELL, THEY CERTAINLY HAD THE

02:49.269 --> 02:50.103
INFORMATION, AND WE JUST HAVE TO

02:50.103 --> 02:50.871
RECOGNIZE IT FOR WHAT IT IS AND

02:50.871 --> 02:51.271
WHAT IT WAS.

02:51.271 --> 02:52.572
IT WAS A MISSTEP.

02:52.572 --> 02:54.007
IT SHOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.742
THERE’S NO EXCUSE.

02:55.742 --> 02:58.412
BUT HOPEFULLY, RATHER THAN

02:58.412 --> 03:00.781
HAVING ANY BLAME GAME, WE WOULD

03:00.781 --> 03:02.682
LOOK FORWARD AND MAKE THIS A

03:02.682 --> 03:03.450
LESSONS LEARNED, THAT WE REALLY

03:03.450 --> 03:04.184
HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE

03:04.184 --> 03:06.386
C.D.C. ALERTS.

03:06.386 --> 03:07.988
AND I THINK PART OF THE POSITIVE

03:07.988 --> 03:10.357
SPIN-OFF OF ALL THE PUBLICITY

03:10.357 --> 03:12.659
THAT THE DALLAS CASE IS GETTING

03:12.659 --> 03:14.227
IS THE FACT THAT EMERGENCY ROOM

03:14.227 --> 03:16.063
AND CLINIC PHYSICIANS THROUGHOUT

03:16.063 --> 03:18.198
THE COUNTRY ARE NOW ACUTELY

03:18.198 --> 03:19.900
AWARE OF THIS MISSTEP.

03:19.900 --> 03:21.768
AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU, IF

03:21.768 --> 03:24.371
SOMEONE COMES INTO A CLINIC NOW

03:24.371 --> 03:26.173
WITH SYMPTOMS COMPATIBLE WITH

03:26.173 --> 03:28.642
EBOLA AND GETS ASKED BY A

03:28.642 --> 03:30.377
PHYSICIAN, "ARE YOU FROM WEST

03:30.377 --> 03:31.445
AFRICA?," THAT EVERY PHYSICIAN

03:31.445 --> 03:32.979
IS GOING TO ASK THAT QUESTION.

03:32.979 --> 03:33.914
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

03:33.914 --> 03:35.115
GOVERNMENT’S ROLE IN HELPING

03:35.115 --> 03:38.385
THOSE JUST BEYOND THE HOSPITAL?

03:38.385 --> 03:39.219
SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRST

03:39.219 --> 03:40.620
RESPONDERS; IF SOMEONE IS IN AN

03:40.620 --> 03:41.955
AMBULANCE, THEY ARE RESPONDING

03:41.955 --> 03:44.091
TO A CALL WITH SOMEONE WHO MIGHT

03:44.091 --> 03:44.391
HAVE FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS OR

03:44.391 --> 03:46.126
OTHERWISE.

03:46.126 --> 03:50.197
>> WELL, AGAIN, THERE’S

03:50.197 --> 03:52.566
INFECTION CONTROL AND PROTECTIVE

03:52.566 --> 03:53.800
MECHANISMS FOR A LOT OF

03:53.800 --> 03:54.334
DIFFERENT DISEASES, NOT ONLY

03:54.334 --> 03:56.470
EBOLA.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.705
BUT WHEN THERE IS A SUSPICION OF

03:58.705 --> 04:00.140
EBOLA, ONE SHOULD GO INTO WHAT

04:00.140 --> 04:02.776
WE CALL THE C.D.C. PROTOCOLS

04:02.776 --> 04:03.777
ABOUT PROTECTION OF THE HEALTH

04:03.777 --> 04:05.912
CARE WORKER.

04:05.912 --> 04:07.781
NOW, ONE OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS

04:07.781 --> 04:08.949
THAT WE NEED TO EMPHASIZE IS

04:08.949 --> 04:12.919
THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS IDENTIFIED

04:12.919 --> 04:14.955
AS EITHER WITH EBOLA SYMPTOMS

04:14.955 --> 04:16.790
PARTICULARLY-- LET’S TAKE THE

04:16.790 --> 04:18.625
CASE IN DALLAS-- ONCE YOU

04:18.625 --> 04:20.660
ESTABLISH A CASE OF EBOLA, THE

04:20.660 --> 04:23.530
IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURE

04:23.530 --> 04:25.499
TO PREVENT AN OUTBREAK IS THE

04:25.499 --> 04:27.267
CONTACT TRACING THAT IS

04:27.267 --> 04:29.436
CURRENTLY GOING ON IN DALLAS.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.038
BECAUSE, HISTORICALLY, FOR THE

04:32.038 --> 04:33.907
38 YEARS NOW THAT WE HAVE

04:33.907 --> 04:36.209
EXPERIENCE WITH DEALING WITH

04:36.209 --> 04:38.145
EBOLA ESSENTIALLY IN CENTRAL AND

04:38.145 --> 04:39.880
SOUTHERN AFRICA, IS THAT WHEN

04:39.880 --> 04:42.449
YOU GET THE CONTACTS UNDER

04:42.449 --> 04:44.184
OBSERVATION AND OBSERVE THEM FOR

04:44.184 --> 04:46.286
THE PERIOD OF TIME, WHICH IS 21

04:46.286 --> 04:47.921
DAYS, SO THAT YOU COULD RULE OUT

04:47.921 --> 04:50.390
WHETHER OR NOT THEY DO OR DO NOT

04:50.390 --> 04:51.258
HAVE EBOLA, THAT’S THE WAY YOU

04:51.258 --> 04:52.592
PREVENT AN OUTBREAK.

04:52.592 --> 04:54.728
AND THAT’S THE REASON WHY,

04:54.728 --> 04:56.863
DESPITE THE INITIAL MISSTEP, WE

04:56.863 --> 04:59.232
FEEL THAT WE HAVE THE HEALTH

04:59.232 --> 05:00.700
CARE INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE

05:00.700 --> 05:01.301
TO IMPLEMENT THAT AND PREVENT AN

05:01.301 --> 05:03.036
OUTBREAK HERE.

05:03.036 --> 05:03.703
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WHAT’S THE

05:03.703 --> 05:05.205
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT’S ROLE IN

05:05.205 --> 05:06.740
TRYING TO COORDINATE THOSE OTHER

05:06.740 --> 05:08.108
RESOURCES BEYOND THE HOSPITALS

05:08.108 --> 05:09.476
IN TERMS OF THE LOCAL

05:09.476 --> 05:11.578
AUTHORITIES?

05:11.578 --> 05:13.213
THERE SEEMS TO BE A GAP THERE IN

05:13.213 --> 05:14.581
TIME BETWEEN WHEN THIS PERSON

05:14.581 --> 05:16.483
WAS DIAGNOSED WITH EBOLA AND,

05:16.483 --> 05:18.818
SAY, WHEN A HAZMAT CREW GOT TO

05:18.818 --> 05:19.252
THEIR HOUSE OR HAD TO QUARANTINE

05:19.252 --> 05:22.055
THE FAMILY MEMBERS.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.924
>> THERE IS A HISTORIC, VERY

05:23.924 --> 05:26.493
STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN OUR

05:26.493 --> 05:28.061
CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND

05:28.061 --> 05:29.863
PREVENTION, OUR C.D.C., AND THE

05:29.863 --> 05:30.497
STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH

05:30.497 --> 05:32.399
AUTHORITIES.

05:32.399 --> 05:35.035
THEY TAKE THE SIGNALS FROM THE

05:35.035 --> 05:36.870
C.D.C., THE C.D.C. SETS DOWN THE

05:36.870 --> 05:39.005
GUIDELINES, AND, FOR EXAMPLE, AS

05:39.005 --> 05:42.943
SOON AS THE CASE WAS IDENTIFIED

05:42.943 --> 05:45.212
IN DALLAS, THE C.D.C. SENT AT

05:45.212 --> 05:47.013
LEAST TEN HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

05:47.013 --> 05:48.848
THERE AND LIKELY MORE TO COME TO

05:48.848 --> 05:50.150
BE ABLE TO HELP IN THE

05:50.150 --> 05:52.352
IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE

05:52.352 --> 05:53.820
PROTOCOLS, PARTICULARLY THE

05:53.820 --> 05:56.189
CONTACT TRACING PROTOCOLS.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.691
SO, THERE REALLY IS VERY GOOD

05:57.691 --> 05:59.292
INTERACTION BETWEEN THE NATIONAL

05:59.292 --> 06:01.328
LEVEL C.D.C. AND THE LOCAL AND

06:01.328 --> 06:02.762
STATE HEALTH AUTHORITIES.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.164
>> Sreenivasan: WE HAD DR.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.932
FRIEDEN ON THE NEWSHOUR JUST A

06:05.932 --> 06:07.033
COUPLE OF NIGHTS AGO, WHERE HE

06:07.033 --> 06:08.068
WAS SAYING REALLY THE BEST WAY

06:08.068 --> 06:09.135
TO GET THIS IS TO GET IT AT THE

06:09.135 --> 06:10.537
SOURCE IN AFRICA.

06:10.537 --> 06:11.838
AND OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF PEOPLE

06:11.838 --> 06:13.540
ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TRAVEL

06:13.540 --> 06:14.307
AND THE FREE-FLOW OF PEOPLE AND

06:14.307 --> 06:16.276
GOODS BACK AND FORTH.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.211
SO, IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO

06:18.211 --> 06:20.947
TO IMPROVE THE LEVEL OF

06:20.947 --> 06:22.782
QUARANTINE IN WEST AFRICA BEFORE

06:22.782 --> 06:24.351
PEOPLE GET ONTO THE PLANES AND

06:24.351 --> 06:24.918
GO WHEREVER THEY’RE GOING TO GO

06:24.918 --> 06:29.022
IN THE WORLD?

06:29.022 --> 06:29.789
>> WELL, THERE IS A PROCESS

06:29.789 --> 06:31.224
GOING ON THAT VERY FEW PEOPLE

06:31.224 --> 06:33.393
APPRECIATE.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.195
IF YOU OR I WERE LET’S SAY IN

06:35.195 --> 06:37.163
MONROVIA, LIBERIA, RIGHT NOW AT

06:37.163 --> 06:39.032
THE AIRPORT, AND WE HAD A FEVER,

06:39.032 --> 06:40.867
WHICH IS CHECKED FOR EVERYONE

06:40.867 --> 06:42.836
THAT IS TRYING TO GET ONTO A

06:42.836 --> 06:45.038
PLANE, WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

06:45.038 --> 06:47.040
GET ON A PLANE TO LEAVE LIBERIA

06:47.040 --> 06:48.275
TO COME TO THE UNITED STATES OR

06:48.275 --> 06:51.578
ANYPLACE ELSE.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.146
SO, IT’S THE EXIT SCREENING FROM

06:53.146 --> 06:53.980
THE COUNTRY WHICH REALLY PROVES

06:53.980 --> 06:56.283
TO BE QUITE EFFECTIVE.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.818
OBVIOUSLY, IF SOMEONE DOESN’T

06:58.818 --> 07:00.987
HAVE SYMPTOMS AND DOESN’T HAVE A

07:00.987 --> 07:04.891
FEVER AND IS IN THAT PHASE OF

07:04.891 --> 07:05.925
INCUBATION WHERE THEY ARE

07:05.925 --> 07:06.960
INFECTED AND THEY REALLY DON’T

07:06.960 --> 07:08.128
KNOW THAT THEY’RE INFECTED,

07:08.128 --> 07:10.263
THERE’S ALWAYS THE POSSIBILITY

07:10.263 --> 07:12.632
THAT THAT WOULD SLIP THROUGH, AS

07:12.632 --> 07:14.234
DID MR. THOMAS DUNCAN.

07:14.234 --> 07:17.704
THE PROBLEM IS, HE WAS ALSO

07:17.704 --> 07:18.605
ASKED A QUESTION AT THE EXIT

07:18.605 --> 07:20.240
PART AS TO WHETHER HE HAD

07:20.240 --> 07:21.608
CONTACT WITH A PERSON WITH

07:21.608 --> 07:24.177
EBOLA, AND EITHER HE DIDN’T

07:24.177 --> 07:25.612
REALIZE THAT HE DID OR I DON’T

07:25.612 --> 07:26.946
KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER TO THAT IS,

07:26.946 --> 07:27.981
BUT THAT SNUCK THROUGH.

07:27.981 --> 07:32.352
THAT WILL HAPPEN.

07:32.352 --> 07:32.986
BUT, ON THE OTHER END, WHEN A

07:32.986 --> 07:33.920
PERSON DOES GET HERE, ONCE

07:33.920 --> 07:35.722
THEY’RE IDENTIFIED, WE DO HAVE

07:35.722 --> 07:37.757
THE PROTOCOLS TO DO THE KIND OF

07:37.757 --> 07:39.793
IDENTIFICATION, ISOLATION,

07:39.793 --> 07:41.161

07:44.864 --> 07:46.232
PRACTICAL WAY TO KEEP ENTIRE

07:46.232 --> 07:48.368
POPULATIONS OF WEST AFRICA IN

07:48.368 --> 07:49.569
QUARANTINE FOR 21 DAYS BEFORE

07:49.569 --> 07:53.373
THEY BOARD A PLANE?

07:53.373 --> 07:55.342
>> AND THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO.

07:55.342 --> 07:55.909
AND I KNOW IT’S AN OBVIOUS

07:55.909 --> 07:57.444
QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ASK.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.012
I GET ASKED THAT ALL THE TIME,

07:59.012 --> 08:00.180
AND TOM FRIEDEN FROM THE C.D.C.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.215
GETS ASKED THAT ALL THE TIME.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.651
IF YOU LOOK HISTORICALLY AT

08:04.651 --> 08:07.654
TRYING TO ESSENTIALLY QUARANTINE

08:07.654 --> 08:09.756
A COUNTRY, THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS

08:09.756 --> 08:11.191
OF THAT REALLY OUTWEIGH ANY

08:11.191 --> 08:16.096
POSITIVE BENEFIT.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.063
IN FACT, HEALTH AUTHORITIES ARE

08:17.063 --> 08:18.298
IN AGREEMENT THAT YOU CAN ALMOST

08:18.298 --> 08:19.499
CERTAINLY HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT

08:19.499 --> 08:20.800
BECAUSE YOU PREVENT THE FREE-

08:20.800 --> 08:22.335
FLOW OF THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO

08:22.335 --> 08:24.170
CONTAIN THE EPIDEMIC.

08:24.170 --> 08:24.537
IT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH WORSE FOR

08:24.537 --> 08:26.139
THEM.

08:26.139 --> 08:28.341
AND AS WE’VE SAID, THE BEST WAY

08:28.341 --> 08:30.710
TO PROTECT THE UNITED STATES OF

08:30.710 --> 08:32.846
AMERICA IS TO COMPLETELY SHUT

08:32.846 --> 08:34.814
DOWN THE EPIDEMIC IN WEST

08:34.814 --> 08:36.149
AFRICA; NOT NECESSARILY TO

08:36.149 --> 08:38.017
QUARANTINE ANYBODY IN WEST

08:38.017 --> 08:40.820
AFRICA, BUT TO PUT INTO PLACE

08:40.820 --> 08:42.956
THE INFECTION CONTROL METHODS

08:42.956 --> 08:45.725
THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO BE ABLE

08:45.725 --> 08:47.527
TO SUPPRESS THAT.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.128
THAT’S THE BEST WAY TO PROTECT

08:48.128 --> 08:48.795
THE UNITED STATES-- STOP IT IN

08:48.795 --> 08:49.362
WEST AFRICA.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.029

09:05.211 --> 09:06.946
ATTACK ON J.P. MORGAN CHASE WAS

09:06.946 --> 09:08.248
APPARENTLY MUCH BIGGER THAN

09:08.248 --> 09:09.582
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.

09:09.582 --> 09:10.850
THE "NEW YORK TIMES" REPORTS

09:23.596 --> 09:25.932
AMERICAN OFFICIAL AS SPECULATING

09:25.932 --> 09:27.133
THAT THE ATTACK COULD BE

09:27.133 --> 09:29.269
RETALIATION FOR U.S. SANCTIONS

AGAINST RUSSIA.

NOW SOME PHOTOJOURNALISTS ARE

22:34.787 --> 22:36.488
USING INSTAGRAM TO TRY TO DEPICT

22:36.488 --> 22:38.257
A FULLER VERSION OF LIFE ON THAT

22:49.768 --> 22:51.604
PHOTOGRAPHER NAAN KOFI ACQUAH

22:51.604 --> 22:53.272
SAYS JOURNALISTS RARELY DOCUMENT

22:53.272 --> 22:54.773
DURING THEIR ASSIGNMENTS ACROSS

22:54.773 --> 22:55.975
AFRICA.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.076
>> TRADITIONALLY, IF YOU SEND A

22:57.076 --> 22:59.345
JOURNALIST, PHOTOJOURNALIST,

WRITER, TO AFRICA, YOU GAVE THEM

23:12.057 --> 23:13.792
MALNOURISHED CHILD.

23:13.792 --> 23:16.028
THAT’S WHEN THEY SEE THE STORY.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.265
>> Reporter: BUT ACQUAH IS ONE

23:19.265 --> 23:20.933

CONTINENT WHO SHARE CANDID

23:23.836 --> 23:26.372

23:28.307 --> 23:30.042

23:41.287 --> 23:42.454
FOLLOWERS.

23:42.454 --> 23:43.689
>> PEOPLE SEE A PHOTO OF MY KIDS

23:43.689 --> 23:45.457
PLAYING WITH AN iPAD, AND

23:45.457 --> 23:46.325
THEY’RE LIKE, "OH, KIDS

23:46.325 --> 23:48.060
IN AFRICA HAVE iPADS?"

23:48.060 --> 23:49.161
AND THAT IS THE DISCOURSE WE

23:49.161 --> 23:50.729
NEED TO HAVE.

23:50.729 --> 23:51.430
>> Reporter: THE PROJECT ISN’T

23:51.430 --> 23:52.531

23:53.932 --> 23:55.701
HARDSHIP, SAYS ACQUAH, BUT

23:55.701 --> 23:57.169
RATHER PAINTING A MORE COMPLETE

23:57.169 --> 23:58.537

23:58.537 --> 23:59.938
EXPERIENCE.

23:59.938 --> 24:02.007
>> I’M NOT AN ADVOCATE FOR

24:02.007 --> 24:03.742
PUSHING ONLY POSITIVE IMAGES

24:03.742 --> 24:05.611
BECAUSE THAT BECOMES PROPAGANDA.

24:05.611 --> 24:06.845
BUT IN THE BIGGER SCALE OF

24:06.845 --> 24:08.681
THINGS, THE POSITIVITY, THE

24:08.681 --> 24:11.850
LAUGHTER, THE WARMNESS, THE

24:11.850 --> 24:14.019
HUMANITY, THE JOY, THE

24:14.019 --> 24:15.721
EXPERIENCES FAR OUTWEIGH THE

24:15.721 --> 24:16.922
NEGATIVES.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.297
>> Sreenivasan: THAT’S IT FOR
