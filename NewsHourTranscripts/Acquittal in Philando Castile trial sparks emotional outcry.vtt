JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: It
was a shooting that captured
the nation's attention last

00:04.066 --> 00:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summer, at the same time it
was already grappling with
tensions over police shootings.

00:08.633 --> 00:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, today, the jury
reached a verdict in the
trial of the officer.

00:13.066 --> 00:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the latest.

00:15.133 --> 00:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Philando
Castile was shot when his car
was pulled over for a traffic

00:19.133 --> 00:21.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stop last July.

00:21.133 --> 00:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His girlfriend was in the car,
and live-streamed the aftermath
on Facebook moments later.

00:27.600 --> 00:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officer Jeronimo Yanez said
at the time that he believed
Castile was reaching for a gun.

00:33.233 --> 00:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Castile's family and
girlfriend disputed that.

00:35.300 --> 00:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yanez had been charged with
second-degree manslaughter
and endangering safety.

00:41.933 --> 00:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This afternoon, a jury acquitted
him of all charges after
five days of deliberations.

00:47.033 --> 00:49.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Soon after, his mother
and sister came out
and spoke to reporters.

00:49.033 --> 00:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE CASTILE, Mother of
Philando Castile: My son was
murdered, and I will continue to

00:53.500 --> 00:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say murdered, because where
in this planet do you tell
the truth, and you be honest,

01:01.400 --> 01:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you still be murdered by
the police of Minnesota, while
you have your seat belt on

01:09.066 --> 01:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you're in the company
with a woman and a child?

01:13.200 --> 01:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
My son would never jeopardize
anyone else's life.

01:16.466 --> 01:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLYSZA CASTILE, Sister of
Philando Castile: The system
really is wrong, and they really

01:20.333 --> 01:22.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
failed us.

01:22.000 --> 01:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They really failed us,
once again, because my
brother was a good man.

01:27.600 --> 01:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You never even heard
him raise his voice.

01:30.233 --> 01:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You never even heard him yell.

01:32.366 --> 01:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for that man to get on the
stand and lie, he got caught
in three, four, five different

01:40.033 --> 01:42.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lies.

01:42.533 --> 01:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It was
the most recent example
of an officer being
acquitted in a high-profile

01:45.733 --> 01:47.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shooting.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The jury had been
deadlocked in recent days.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tim Nelson of Minnesota
Public Radio has been covering
the trial and joins me now.

01:52.733 --> 01:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tim, first, you were
in the courtroom.

01:54.733 --> 01:56.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The reaction?

01:56.433 --> 02:00.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TIM NELSON, Minnesota
Public Radio: It was
swift and shocking.

02:00.733 --> 02:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Castile family was
sitting in the courtroom.

02:03.000 --> 02:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The judge had asked people to
be quiet while the verdicts
were read, but as soon as the

02:06.566 --> 02:11.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not-guilty verdict for the
manslaughter account was
returned, Valerie Castile
-- that's Philando's

02:13.400 --> 02:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mother -- got up and
started shouting profanity
in the courtroom.

02:18.733 --> 02:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had been -- the people in
the court had been told to wait
until all the verdicts were

02:21.133 --> 02:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
read before they left, and
she pushed her way out, was
joined by many of her friends

02:28.100 --> 02:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and family, visibly upset,
very, very angry about
the verdict here today.

02:33.366 --> 02:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other side, the friends
and family, some of the fellow
officers of Jeronimo Yanez

02:39.033 --> 02:43.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
were weeping as well,
clearly relieved that
this ordeal is over.

02:43.066 --> 02:45.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been going on
almost a year now.

02:45.166 --> 02:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was charged in November.

02:46.600 --> 02:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, a lot of angst
initially in the courtroom.

02:51.266 --> 02:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tim, the
county attorney when he was
bringing these charges said no

02:54.466 --> 02:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
reasonable officer
would have used deadly
force in this situation.

02:57.766 --> 02:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why wasn't he able
to convince a jury?

02:59.600 --> 03:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIM NELSON: Well, I think there
were three real factors here.

03:03.433 --> 03:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of them was, we saw for
the first time the squad car
video, the perspective of the

03:07.100 --> 03:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
officer, or at least
from his dash-cam.

03:09.266 --> 03:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what we saw was, this
happened very quickly.

03:12.866 --> 03:17.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you could feel the emotion,
you could feel the tension in
this situation as it happened.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's confounding.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't see what was
actually going on in the car.

03:23.700 --> 03:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that that
left some doubt there.

03:26.366 --> 03:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing is, the defense
continued to return to the
THC found in Mr. Castile's

03:32.666 --> 03:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
blood after he died.

03:34.733 --> 03:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They continued to suggest that
he had been smoking marijuana,
and that may have clouded

03:41.066 --> 03:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his judgment when he told the
officer that pulled him over
that he had a gun, that he

03:43.800 --> 03:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may not have done it in a way
that lessened the risk that
they both faced in this case.

03:50.833 --> 03:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the third thing
in this case was Officer Yanez
actually taking the stand last

03:54.533 --> 03:56.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Friday.

03:56.666 --> 04:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was near tears as he talked
about the fear he felt, the
tension he felt, the thoughts

04:00.400 --> 04:05.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his family running through
his mind as he encountered
Philando Castile for those

04:08.966 --> 04:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
first few seconds
of this incident.

04:12.333 --> 04:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it, I think, may have left
some doubt in the jury's mind.

04:19.333 --> 04:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, there are some
Supreme Court cases, Graham vs.
Connor, that give the benefit

04:22.600 --> 04:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the doubt in a lot of these
cases to a police officer.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They urge the jury to think
about it from the officer's
perspective in the moment, not

04:32.266 --> 04:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in perfect 20/20 hindsight.

04:34.366 --> 04:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tim, we
learned in this process that
Mr. Castile had a permit for

04:36.866 --> 04:38.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that weapon.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what's the level of concern
or anger in your community?

04:40.566 --> 04:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember, right after this
incident, there were protests
on your streets for days and

04:44.300 --> 04:45.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TIM NELSON: Not
just on our streets.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They closed an interstate
between the two cities in what
authorities later called a

04:53.466 --> 04:55.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
riot.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were police officers
injured in that incident.

04:58.433 --> 05:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The protesters occupied
the front of the governor's
mansion for weeks here.

05:02.000 --> 05:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, you remember,
this happened just after the
shooting in Louisiana and had

05:06.400 --> 05:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been -- it sort of added
to the tension there.

05:10.900 --> 05:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We haven't seen those kinds of
protests lately, but as soon as
I walked out of the courtroom

05:14.600 --> 05:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, as soon as I walked out
of the courthouse, there were
people with hand-lettered signs

05:17.733 --> 05:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shouting, making their
voices, their unhappiness
about this verdict.

05:22.666 --> 05:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's clear there are some
people who are very angry
about this, and we may see some

05:28.533 --> 05:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more of that coming up soon.

05:30.533 --> 05:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Tim Nelson of Minnesota
Public Radio, thanks so much.
