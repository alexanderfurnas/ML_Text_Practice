JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.906 --> 00:07.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.808 --> 00:11.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight": The
House Intelligence
Committee chairman voices doubt
that former

00:11.778 --> 00:15.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama ordered wiretaps
of Trump
Tower.

00:15.749 --> 00:19.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But President Trump stands by
his claim.

00:19.286 --> 00:24.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Wednesday:
Malcolm Brabant
takes us to Turkey, where
President Erdogan

00:24.157 --> 00:28.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is seeking more power during a
time of political
and religious tensions.

00:28.395 --> 00:33.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: President
Erdogan's popularity
and policies are about to be put
to the test

00:33.400 --> 00:39.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a referendum to decide
whether Turkey should
have a United States-style
presidency, but

00:39.306 --> 00:41.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without the checks and balances.

00:41.408 --> 00:47.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the
possibilities of
computer-connected
brains -- how researchers are
experimenting

00:47.180 --> 00:49.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with implants to help people
with paralysis.

00:49.950 --> 00:53.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS DEGRAY, Clinical Research
Participant:
It's very liberating.

00:53.520 --> 00:59.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To be able to utilize a portion
of my body
that has not worked to actually
cause and

00:59.559 --> 01:02.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
effect is great fun.

01:02.663 --> 01:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:10.604 --> 01:13.473 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:13.507 --> 01:22.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Short-term
interest rates are
going up again in the United
States for the

01:22.749 --> 01:24.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
second time in three months.

01:24.718 --> 01:29.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Federal Reserve announced
another quarter-point
increase today.

01:29.356 --> 01:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Policy-makers suggested in a
statement that
economic growth is improving,
and Fed Chair

01:34.061 --> 01:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Janet Yellen said that makes it
more likely
there will be two additional
rate hikes this

01:39.199 --> 01:40.968 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

01:41.001 --> 01:44.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: The simple
message is the economy is doing
well.

01:44.938 --> 01:51.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have confidence in the
robustness of the
economy and its resilience to
shocks.

01:51.545 --> 01:54.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's performed well over the
last several
years.

01:54.514 --> 02:00.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Fed is
predicting growth
at a rate of 2.1 percent this
year and next.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump has talked of 4
percent growth.

02:02.856 --> 02:08.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We will have more on the
potential economic
effects of the rate hike later
in the program.

02:09.029 --> 02:15.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: Two
Russian intelligence
officers and two cyber-hackers
now face U.S.

02:15.168 --> 02:21.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criminal charges in a Yahoo data
breach that
compromised 500 million
accounts.

02:21.241 --> 02:25.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The acting assistant attorney
general, Mary
McCord, announced the action
today.

02:25.579 --> 02:30.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the first to implicate
Russian officials
directly in cyber-crime.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY MCCORD, Acting Assistant
Attorney General:
We will not allow individuals,
groups, nation

02:34.888 --> 02:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states or a combination of them
to compromise
the privacy of our citizens, the
economic

02:40.694 --> 02:45.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interests of our companies, or
the security
of our country.

02:45.732 --> 02:49.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are no free passes for
foreign state-sponsored
criminal behavior.

02:49.936 --> 02:53.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the
hackers is in custody
in Canada.

02:53.073 --> 02:58.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The others remain at large, and
it's not clear
if they will ever see an
American courtroom,

02:58.311 --> 03:02.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since Russia has no extradition
treaty with
the United States.

03:02.282 --> 03:07.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, suicide bombers killed
at least
31 people in twin attacks in
Damascus, this

03:08.021 --> 03:11.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the country enters its sixth
year of civil
war.

03:11.391 --> 03:16.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state news agency says the
first attacker
blew himself up in the main
judicial building

03:16.830 --> 03:18.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as police started to search him.

03:18.799 --> 03:22.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A second bomb went off inside a
nearby restaurant.

03:22.102 --> 03:27.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the
death toll
from an assault on a military
hospital rose

03:27.074 --> 03:28.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to 50 today.

03:28.608 --> 03:33.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attack, a week ago, was
claimed by the
Islamic State group.

03:33.046 --> 03:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials said a suicide bomber
blew up his
car, and gunmen disguised in lab
coats stormed

03:38.819 --> 03:41.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the hospital in Kabul.

03:41.088 --> 03:45.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Ethiopia's
capital has now claimed 113
lives.

03:52.499 --> 03:58.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The death toll rose again today,
as search-and-rescue
efforts continued in mountains
of garbage

03:58.405 --> 04:04.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which collapsed on Saturday and
buried makeshift
huts at the site.

04:04.344 --> 04:09.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Voting has ended in the
Netherlands, and exit
polls show Dutch voters have
rejected a bid

04:09.749 --> 04:12.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for power by an anti-Islam
party.

04:12.519 --> 04:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Geert Wilders and his far-right
followers
did worse than expected against
center-right

04:18.325 --> 04:22.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who'd
warned against
electing Wilders.

04:22.295 --> 04:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK RUTTE, Prime Minister of
the Netherlands:
Having a political leader wants
to take away

04:25.999 --> 04:30.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Koran from Muslims in the
Netherlands,
who wants to close our mosques,
the wrong

04:30.604 --> 04:35.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
sort of populism is not
addressing the real
issues of the people, only
making them bigger,

04:35.942 --> 04:37.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
instead of solving them.

04:37.677 --> 04:42.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wilders
acknowledged that he'd
lost, but he vowed that he'd be
back.

04:42.582 --> 04:47.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the U.S.
Senate confirmed
former Indiana Senator Dan Coats
as director

04:47.821 --> 04:49.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of national intelligence.

04:49.656 --> 04:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will oversee 16 intelligence
agencies,
and could be a key player in
probes of Russian

04:55.095 --> 04:58.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
meddling in last year's
election.

04:58.298 --> 05:03.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump moved today to
dial back federal
rules on auto fuel economy.

05:03.403 --> 05:09.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just before President Obama left
office, the
EPA finalized a standard that
automakers reach

05:09.442 --> 05:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an average of 54 miles a gallon
by 2025.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's double the current
standard.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The industry strongly objected.

05:17.984 --> 05:23.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And today, in Ypsilanti,
Michigan, Mr. Trump
said the EPA is going back to
the drawing

05:23.190 --> 05:25.058 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
board.

05:25.091 --> 05:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
The assault on American auto
industry, believe

05:28.094 --> 05:29.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
me, is over.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.799 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's over.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Not going to have it anymore.

05:34.568 --> 05:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the standards threatened auto
jobs, then
commonsense changes could have
and should

05:41.608 --> 05:43.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have been made.

05:43.510 --> 05:47.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Environmentalists
have argued
the higher standard would
promote use of hybrids

05:47.480 --> 05:52.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and electric vehicles and cut
carbon dioxide
emissions.

05:52.452 --> 05:57.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House signaled again
today that
it's open to changing the
Republican replacement

05:57.724 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Obamacare.

05:59.492 --> 06:03.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A spokesman said the president
is working
with House Speaker Ryan and
other leaders.

06:03.663 --> 06:08.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was also word that more
than 12 million
people signed up for coverage
this year under

06:08.768 --> 06:13.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obamacare and enrolled on
federal and state
exchanges.

06:13.573 --> 06:18.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A portion of one of the
president's federal
income tax returns has surfaced
for the first

06:18.578 --> 06:20.347 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

06:20.380 --> 06:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leaked document shows that
for the 2005
tax year, Mr. Trump reported
earnings of $153

06:26.553 --> 06:30.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million, and paid $36 million in
taxes.

06:30.223 --> 06:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wrote off more than $100
million in business
losses.

06:35.195 --> 06:39.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House criticized the
leak, but didn't
challenge the document's
authenticity.

06:39.532 --> 06:44.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a tweet today, the president
called it
-- quote -- "fake news."

06:44.871 --> 06:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reports of sexual assault rose
at two of the
U.S. service academies this
year.

06:49.476 --> 06:54.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the Associated
Press, they were
up at the Naval Academy and the
military academy

06:54.881 --> 06:56.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at West Point.

06:56.182 --> 06:59.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Air Force Academy saw a
sharp drop.

06:59.486 --> 07:06.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The AP says a separate anonymous
survey found
sexual misconduct is actually
rising at all

07:06.059 --> 07:07.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
three schools.

07:07.560 --> 07:12.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks took
the latest
interest rate hike in stride.

07:12.165 --> 07:17.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained more
than 112 points to close at
20950.

07:17.904 --> 07:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 43 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added nearly 20.

07:23.510 --> 07:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what lawmakers
have and have not found in their
ongoing Russia

07:29.382 --> 07:35.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investigation; a key U.S. ally,
Turkey, is
set to decide whether its
strongman president

07:35.488 --> 07:45.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should have even broader power;
and much more.

07:45.532 --> 07:50.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should have even broader power;
and much more.

07:50.937 --> 07:56.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia's role in last year's
election, alleged
contacts between the Trump team
and Moscow,

07:56.409 --> 08:02.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and President Trump's allegation
that he was
wiretapped by his predecessor,
all these were

08:02.148 --> 08:04.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
front and center on Capitol Hill
today.

08:04.851 --> 08:05.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

08:05.852 --> 08:07.620 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES (R), California: I
don't think
that there was an actual tap of
Trump Tower.

08:09.456 --> 08:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Leaders of the House
Intelligence
Committee cast fresh doubt today
on President

08:14.094 --> 08:19.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump's claim that
then-President Obama illegally
wiretapped Trump Tower.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Committee Chairman Devin Nunes:

08:20.567 --> 08:22.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEVIN NUNES: President Obama
wouldn't physically
go over and wiretap Trump Tower.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So now you have to decide, as I
mentioned
to last week, are you going to
take the tweets

08:28.074 --> 08:29.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
literally?

08:29.242 --> 08:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you are, then clearly the
president
was wrong.

08:31.745 --> 08:36.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you're not going to take
the tweets
literally, and if there's a
concern that the

08:36.783 --> 08:45.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president has about other
people, other surveillance
activities looking at him or his
associates,

08:45.492 --> 08:49.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
either appropriately or
inappropriately, we
want to find that out.

08:49.796 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The committee gave
the Justice
Department until last night to
produce any

08:54.067 --> 08:56.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
evidence to support the
president's claim.

08:56.870 --> 09:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, the department got an
extension until
next Monday, when FBI Director
James Comey

09:02.609 --> 09:05.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is to testify before the panel.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Adam Schiff is the committee's
top Democrat.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM SCHIFF (D), California: I
do think it's
incumbent that, if we get to
March 20 and

09:10.884 --> 09:16.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have the testimony I think we
all expect
from the director that there was
no substance

09:16.222 --> 09:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the accusation that Barack
Obama illegally
wiretapped Trump Tower, that the
president

09:21.861 --> 09:23.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
explain himself.

09:23.696 --> 09:28.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this -- you can't level
an accusation
of that type without either
retracting it

09:28.435 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or explaining just why it was
done.

09:31.070 --> 09:35.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Senator Lindsey
Graham wants to
know if there's a warrant for a
wiretap.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:37.243 --> 09:38.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Congress
is going to flex its muscle
here.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will issue a subpoena to get
the information.

09:40.180 --> 09:45.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: FBI Director Comey
was on Capitol
Hill this afternoon to brief
leaders of the

09:45.351 --> 09:47.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senate Judiciary Committee.

09:47.320 --> 09:52.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chairman Chuck Grassley and top
Democrat Dianne
Feinstein want to know about
former National

09:52.358 --> 09:57.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security Adviser Mike Flynn's
contacts with
Russian officials.

09:57.297 --> 10:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flynn is one of several Trump
associates under
scrutiny for dealings with
Russians during

10:01.801 --> 10:03.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the campaign.

10:03.703 --> 10:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One-time Trump adviser Roger
Stone said today
he thinks a special surveillance
warrant uncovered

10:09.209 --> 10:14.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his contacts with a
Russian-linked hacker
who claimed credit for the
cyber-attack on

10:14.214 --> 10:16.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Democratic National
Committee.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

10:19.018 --> 10:24.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And late today
came word that,
in an interview to air tonight
on FOX News,

10:24.691 --> 10:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president was asked again
about his wiretapping
accusation, and he said:
"Wiretap covers a

10:30.830 --> 10:32.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lot of different things.

10:32.799 --> 10:37.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you're going to find
some very interesting
items coming to the forefront
over the next

10:37.337 --> 10:39.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two weeks."

10:39.205 --> 10:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back on Capitol Hill, lawmakers
from both
parties expressed frustration
with FBI Director

10:43.943 --> 10:49.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
James Comey, and what they say
is an unwillingness
to provide them with critical
information.

10:49.482 --> 10:54.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining us now, Democratic
Senator Joe Manchin,
a member of the Intelligence
Committee.

10:54.921 --> 10:56.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator, thank you for being
with us.

10:57.023 --> 11:00.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you getting the cooperation
you need from
the intelligence community?

11:00.393 --> 11:02.128 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN (D), West Virginia:
Well, Judy,
first of all, it's good to be
with you.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we are going to be able to
get that.

11:05.565 --> 11:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have been speaking to them.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have been out to the CIA.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We're looking at all the
documents, and they're
providing those to us.

11:11.871 --> 11:17.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Intel Committee is able to
get in-depth,
if you will, with all of our
different intelligence

11:17.810 --> 11:19.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
agencies.

11:19.279 --> 11:21.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have great confidence in them,
and we have
got to get to the bottom.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's an awful lot that's
going on here.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's two different paths.

11:25.885 --> 11:29.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have one with the Russians
involved in
our election process.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To what extent -- we know they
made an attempt.

11:31.224 --> 11:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They made more of an attempt
this time than
ever before.

11:34.994 --> 11:39.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that the outcome of the
election,
they were not able to intervene
or interfere

11:39.299 --> 11:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with that or disrupt that
whatsoever, but
their desire was there.

11:43.169 --> 11:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We must prevent that from ever
happening again
and also to help our allies.

11:46.973 --> 11:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then you have the other Russian
intervention,
if you will.

11:51.311 --> 11:54.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much of an association is
there?

11:54.747 --> 12:01.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there any type of with the
associates from
President Trump during the
campaign, his people,

12:01.854 --> 12:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
himself, his family, whatsoever?

12:03.923 --> 12:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And is there any intertwinement?

12:05.525 --> 12:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think the American people
want to know.

12:07.694 --> 12:12.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to get through this
and get -- come
to the conclusion, and do the
business of

12:13.032 --> 12:14.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this great country.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, right now, that's our --
that's the hot
topic.

12:16.836 --> 12:20.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, at this
point, do you
think you're any closer to
knowing whether

12:20.840 --> 12:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was any, as you call it,
intertwinement
or collusion between the Trump
campaign and

12:26.179 --> 12:27.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Russian officials?

12:27.180 --> 12:28.281 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN: I can only say what
we have seen
to date.

12:29.382 --> 12:32.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, I don't see any evidence of
that whatsoever.

12:32.385 --> 12:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're just in the start of
this.

12:33.853 --> 12:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it would be premature for me
to say anything,
a definite yes or no.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're going to look at
everything.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to turn over every
stone that
we possibly can.

12:41.861 --> 12:45.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to make sure we
interview and
bring people in that have --
names have been

12:46.032 --> 12:50.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
mentioned that you have
mentioned on your
"NewsHour," and we're going to
make sure that

12:50.169 --> 12:51.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we get the facts.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And intelligence is to provide
the facts to
us.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The facts will usually take you
to the truth.

12:56.776 --> 13:00.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when we get the truth,
we have got
to make the decisions and do
what's best for

13:00.213 --> 13:01.247 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this country.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:03.049 --> 13:04.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
let me just
stop you there and ask you about
this other

13:04.884 --> 13:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
strand of the story today.

13:06.653 --> 13:11.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is President Trump
saying in that
interview that we just mentioned
that we're

13:11.691 --> 13:18.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to see more, in his words,
in the next
few weeks come to the forefront
about the

13:18.331 --> 13:22.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
wiretap that he accused
President Obama of
being behind.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you know at this point
about that?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:26.539 --> 13:28.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN: Well, the only
thing I can discuss
and what I know about that is
what you all

13:28.207 --> 13:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been reporting on and what
has been reported
in the news today.

13:31.044 --> 13:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Sessions said he didn't
advise or didn't
say a thing about a wiretap and
knows of no

13:36.416 --> 13:37.583 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wiretap.

13:37.617 --> 13:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's no evidence of
showing any wiretap
to date.

13:41.387 --> 13:46.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there's other evidence to
come forth, we
will be happy to look at that
and evaluate

13:46.325 --> 13:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it and investigate it, but, as
of right now,
that has not come forth.

13:48.895 --> 13:52.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the end --
well, let me
just rephrase that.

13:52.231 --> 13:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it up to the White House, for
the president
to provide whatever evidence he
has?

13:56.602 --> 13:58.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN: Well, I would think
that, if
he has evidence that the
intelligence community

14:01.007 --> 14:05.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't have, and it's not being
brought forth,
and he wants to make sure that
that's considered

14:05.478 --> 14:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into this whole process, then I
would hope
that they would.

14:08.715 --> 14:13.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me turn you,
Senator, to
the other issue that we're
covering right

14:13.519 --> 14:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now on the Hill, and that is, of
course, health
care reform, the Republican
relationship legislation

14:19.759 --> 14:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that seems to be running into
more opposition
from Republican members of the
House and the

14:26.165 --> 14:27.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Senate.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where do you think that stands
right now?

14:28.167 --> 14:29.902 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:29.936 --> 14:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN: Well, it's over in
the House,
and I guess, if they put the
push on, they

14:33.239 --> 14:35.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can push that out and send it
over to the
Senate.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't see a receptive
audience.

14:37.477 --> 14:42.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know of one Democrat
that would vote
for the process they're sending
over for the

14:42.381 --> 14:43.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
piece of legislation.

14:43.916 --> 14:45.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not voting to repeal, Judy.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have been very clear.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I told President Trump this many
weeks ago.

14:49.856 --> 14:54.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no way I can vote to
repeal and throw
people off, when I know the
political toxic

14:54.293 --> 14:58.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
atmosphere that we have in
Washington, thinking
that we can come back and repair
it.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can get rid of it with 51
votes.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They don't need a Democrat.

15:02.435 --> 15:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they can't fix it unless
they have eight
of me, eight Democrats who are
willing to

15:06.372 --> 15:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sit down and work and fix some
of the market
conditions that we have that
make it so really

15:12.211 --> 15:19.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
costly and very hard, very much
a hardship
on a lot of people that didn't
get the expansion

15:19.952 --> 15:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or the subsidies or any of that.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I understand where the
problems are.

15:24.624 --> 15:26.359 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But no one seems to want to fix
it.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, I said this.

15:28.261 --> 15:32.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said, why don't we vote and
sit down, have
a working group voting on the
market repairs

15:32.398 --> 15:36.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we could do, and see if you
can get 60
votes, before you throw the baby
out with

15:36.903 --> 15:38.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bath water?

15:38.871 --> 15:44.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And have they
responded affirmatively
to any -- to your suggestion or
anything like

15:44.277 --> 15:45.244 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:47.146 --> 15:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN: I have only had one
-- one of
my colleagues -- Republican
Senator Bill Cassidy

15:49.882 --> 15:51.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come over.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have sat down twice to
see if there
was a pathway forward.

15:53.352 --> 15:55.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had a piece of legislation.

15:55.221 --> 15:56.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We looked at it.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We told him our concerns with
it, but we had
a dialogue going.

15:59.458 --> 16:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, basically, the House
has gone off
on their own, and the things
that we, Bill

16:04.730 --> 16:06.699 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I, were talking about didn't
materialize.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, nobody seems to want to do
anything.

16:09.001 --> 16:09.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:10.002 --> 16:11.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm sorry to
interrupt you.

16:11.671 --> 16:15.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just quickly, so, at this
point, where
do you see this legislation
headed?

16:15.141 --> 16:16.242 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN: I don't see it
moving on this
side.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really don't, on the Senate
side right now,
unless there are some tremendous
changes made.

16:21.647 --> 16:26.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, let me just tell you, the
state of West
Virginia, 172,000 people got the
expansion.

16:26.986 --> 16:32.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means the people that were
not on Medicaid,
but within the 139 percentile --
172,000.

16:32.625 --> 16:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another 36,000, 38,000 got some,
basically,
subsidies.

16:37.663 --> 16:41.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means, because of their
income, they
were subsidized about $388.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we had the donut hole
filled for
our seniors.

16:44.670 --> 16:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have a poorer population.

16:46.539 --> 16:52.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of a sudden now, all of a
sudden, they're
going to give the wealthiest of
the wealthiest

16:52.178 --> 16:59.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the country $575 billion tax
credits, $575
billion.

16:59.452 --> 17:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's going to be on the
backs of the
poor, the elderly, and those who
have been

17:03.923 --> 17:08.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
addicted and are getting in
treatment centers
or being able to get treated for
addiction,

17:08.361 --> 17:10.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is a horrible problem in
my state.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I get hit three ways.

17:12.398 --> 17:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The poor get hit harder, the
elderly pay more,
and the people that are addicted
are not going

17:17.069 --> 17:18.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get treatment that's needed.

17:18.437 --> 17:23.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Joe
Manchin of West
Virginia, we thank you.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:24.477 --> 17:31.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOE MANCHIN: Thank you, Judy.

17:31.817 --> 17:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on
questions about
the Trump campaign's connections
with Russia,

17:38.424 --> 17:44.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the battle over health care, and
the president's
newly leaked tax return, we turn
to Matt Schlapp.

17:44.497 --> 17:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is chair of the American
Conservative Union.

17:47.266 --> 17:53.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Karine Jean-Pierre, she was
a senior adviser
to MoveOn.org during the 2016
elections.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the program.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matt, I'm going to start with
you.

17:56.943 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been more than 10 days, I
think, since
President Trump tweeted that
President Obama

18:02.214 --> 18:03.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had wiretapped him...

18:03.683 --> 18:04.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House
Director
of Political Affairs: Right.

18:04.684 --> 18:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... during the
campaign.

18:05.885 --> 18:09.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, no evidence of this,
investigations
under way.

18:09.155 --> 18:10.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where does this stand?

18:10.957 --> 18:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, first of
all, this term
wiretap is kind of an
old-fashioned term.

18:16.162 --> 18:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have been reading about
in most of
the respected newspapers across
the country,

18:21.133 --> 18:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back before the election,
through the inauguration,
and afterwards, was that there
were people

18:25.604 --> 18:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Trump team, on the Trump
team who were
under investigation for
inappropriate ties

18:30.609 --> 18:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Russia, that there were
phone calls that
had been intercepted.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, all of this was reported.

18:37.149 --> 18:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The question is, was something
done inappropriately?

18:40.720 --> 18:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's what -- I
think that's
what the president wants to
know, and I think

18:43.956 --> 18:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of other people want to
know as well.

18:45.391 --> 18:48.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much urgency
is there around
this question, Karine?

18:48.728 --> 18:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic
Strategist:
I think there should be a lot
more urgency

18:50.663 --> 18:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than we're currently seeing.

18:52.598 --> 18:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think at this point up to the
FBI to really
step in and let us know, what is
really happening?

18:57.770 --> 19:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think one of the issues that
we're seeing
here is Donald Trump is not
being presidential.

19:03.075 --> 19:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He tweets without understanding
the consequences
of his tweet.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no measurement of what
he's saying.

19:10.483 --> 19:15.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's incredibly dangerous to
accuse your
predecessor of potentially
breaking the law.

19:15.688 --> 19:19.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, at the end of the
day, we have
to -- we have to really look and
ask the question,

19:19.792 --> 19:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what happens if there is a true,
actual national
security crisis?

19:25.464 --> 19:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are we going to believe Donald
Trump?

19:27.166 --> 19:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much does it
matter, Matt,
that we get to the bottom of
this?

19:30.136 --> 19:36.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: It matters to me a
lot, because
I actually think that if the
Obama administration

19:36.842 --> 19:41.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was investigating the Trump
campaign, that
is something we have not seen
before.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is historic.

19:42.982 --> 19:44.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I want to know why.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If that did happen, I want to
know why it
happened.

19:45.951 --> 19:49.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think there's some
explaining to do
to the American voter.

19:49.889 --> 19:54.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And if it didn't
happen, then
the question goes to, why did
President Trump

19:54.560 --> 19:55.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
make this allegation?

19:55.561 --> 19:56.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Of course.

19:56.962 --> 19:59.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's fair to say that
people want
to hear from the FBI.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this might shock of two of
you.

20:01.867 --> 20:05.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of us who have
lost a little
confidence in Jim Comey over the
years.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We probably want to hear from
more people
than just Jim Comey.

20:08.374 --> 20:14.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that calls to
mind, Karine,
there is this wider
investigation going on

20:14.280 --> 20:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into connections that Matt
alluded to a moment
ago between the Trump campaign
and Russian

20:20.786 --> 20:21.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
officials.

20:21.787 --> 20:23.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't know where that stands.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Right, and
we need to
have a full, thorough
investigation on that.

20:26.859 --> 20:31.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, there is circumstantial
evidence
that shows the Trump
organization has had

20:31.097 --> 20:35.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some sort of contact with
Russia, and we really
need to get to the bottom of it.

20:35.267 --> 20:39.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, there should be a special
prosecutor,
but I also think there should be
an independent,

20:39.405 --> 20:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bipartisan commission to really
get down to
the bottom of it, so we know
that that commission

20:44.009 --> 20:48.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has jurisdiction, that they
could have subpoena
power, and also that it's
public, so that

20:48.581 --> 20:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we know, the American people
know what's going
on.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But right now,
you have got
all these investigations under
way.

20:52.985 --> 20:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Step by step.

20:54.653 --> 21:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We haven't even filled the
Senate-confirmed
positions at the Department of
Justice.

21:00.159 --> 21:04.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both the House committees with
jurisdiction
need to do a full investigation,
and then

21:04.463 --> 21:06.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can draw conclusions of what
needs to do
done after that.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I think we
could do all
three.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think we have to do one
or the other.

21:10.536 --> 21:11.504 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:11.537 --> 21:12.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Don't we just want
the answers?

21:12.538 --> 21:13.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does it matter what way you
get the answers?

21:13.973 --> 21:16.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Well, I
think why not
give it to the public?

21:16.108 --> 21:18.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why not show the public what's
going on?

21:18.110 --> 21:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me -- I want
to turn you
both to something else that
we're watching

21:21.213 --> 21:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very closely, and that is health
care repeal
and replace, the American Health
Care Act.

21:26.819 --> 21:29.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matt, we are now seeing more and
more Republicans...

21:30.022 --> 21:31.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

21:31.891 --> 21:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... saying they
can't support
the Republican leadership bill
which the White

21:33.459 --> 21:35.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
House signed on to.

21:35.361 --> 21:36.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where is this headed?

21:37.029 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: What they decided
to do was
just roll this out and jam it
through.

21:40.065 --> 21:45.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 21st century American
politics, that
is a very difficult path to
take.

21:45.371 --> 21:47.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would be smarter to bring
people in.

21:47.540 --> 21:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nothing, it seems, Judy, gets
people more
passionate than the idea of
their health care

21:52.211 --> 21:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and their very life, and they
want to make
sure we get it right.

21:55.381 --> 21:58.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think jamming through a
piece of legislation
was the wrong way to start.

21:58.984 --> 21:59.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're now bringing people in.

22:00.019 --> 22:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president is bringing people
in.

22:02.154 --> 22:06.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's going to give it
a better chance
of passage, but it's not there
yet.

22:06.091 --> 22:10.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If this is truly
in trouble,
Karine, where do you see this
going next?

22:10.629 --> 22:15.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Well, what
they have presented,
the Republicans, with Trumpcare,
is, it seems

22:15.067 --> 22:17.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be a plan that's more of the
survival of
the fittest.

22:17.937 --> 22:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And like you were saying,
alluding to, health
care is incredibly personal.

22:21.674 --> 22:26.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Republicans had seven
years, seven
years to come up with something
that would

22:26.111 --> 22:28.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
work for everyone.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they jammed this thing
through, as you
mentioned.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They introduced it on March 7.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want to have a vote on it
on April 7.

22:35.154 --> 22:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And of course Republicans are
very upset about
it, because this is an assault
on seniors.

22:39.491 --> 22:43.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You have costs going up,
premiums going up
for people who really need it,
as they're

22:43.762 --> 22:45.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
getting older.

22:45.497 --> 22:49.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if this
version doesn't
work, we're going to look at
some changes

22:49.668 --> 22:51.370 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coming.

22:51.403 --> 22:54.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: If Republicans
don't pass a
replacement for Obamacare this
year, they

22:54.273 --> 22:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are going to be in a world of
hurt.

22:55.641 --> 22:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, maybe I could expand it and
say by the
midterm election.

22:58.677 --> 23:03.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there has to be a plan
that's put on place
and that passes, so they have to
figure out

23:03.949 --> 23:05.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a way to go forward.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they started off in the
wrong way.

23:07.653 --> 23:11.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think much of what's
included in this
plan does represent what needs
to be done

23:11.523 --> 23:13.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to fix the incredible mess
Obamacare left
us in.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quick.

23:15.427 --> 23:19.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two pages of Donald Trump's,
President Trump's
tax returns from the year 2005.

23:19.698 --> 23:23.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He paid a quarter of his income
in taxes.

23:23.869 --> 23:25.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much have we really learned
here?

23:25.304 --> 23:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I think it
brings up more
questions than answers.

23:28.207 --> 23:32.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's unfortunate that we have to
play this
cat-and-mouse game just to get
the president's

23:32.945 --> 23:34.046 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tax returns.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We still don't know, who does he
do business
with?

23:36.849 --> 23:38.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who does he owe money to?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.618 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We know he's in debt.

23:39.652 --> 23:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Which foreign banks does he owe
money to?

23:42.087 --> 23:46.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think all of these things
are important
to know, because he's putting
forth foreign

23:46.125 --> 23:50.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policy and domestic policy, and
we just don't
have those answers yet.

23:50.262 --> 23:51.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: He has complied
with the law.

23:52.665 --> 23:56.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He had to give thorough
financial disclosure
documents to the FEC.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those are all public documents.

23:58.170 --> 24:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People can go on right now
online and get
all those documents.

24:01.307 --> 24:05.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what we learned on this
rather ridiculous
television show the other day
with this leaked

24:05.577 --> 24:12.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tax return is that this
ridiculous concept
that he didn't pay taxes for the
last 10 or

24:12.184 --> 24:16.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
20 years was wrong, and,
actually, when you
look at this year, he paid a
higher percentage

24:16.622 --> 24:20.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his taxes -- or his tax rate
was higher
than President Obama, than
Bernie Sanders,

24:20.693 --> 24:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than Mitt Romney, than a lot of
the people
who have been criticizing him.

24:23.329 --> 24:26.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are going to
have to leave
it there, obviously a lot more
to talk about.

24:26.899 --> 24:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Matt Schlapp, Karine
Jean-Pierre, thank you
both.

24:27.966 --> 24:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Thanks,
Judy.

24:28.967 --> 24:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Great to be with
you.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Thank you.

24:33.005 --> 24:41.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:41.914 --> 24:47.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
what's behind
the Fed's interest rate hike?;
computers and

24:47.052 --> 24:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brain implants that restore the
ability to
communicate; and the artistic
process of putting

24:53.225 --> 24:54.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a face to fossils.

24:55.027 --> 25:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Citizens of Turkey
vote next month
in a referendum that could grant
President

25:01.567 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Recep Tayyip Erdogan
controversial new powers.

25:05.104 --> 25:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan's push led to a showdown
this week
with Dutch leaders who had
denied permission

25:10.442 --> 25:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to two of Turkey's government
ministers to
rally support among expatriate
Turks who live

25:16.315 --> 25:18.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Holland.

25:18.283 --> 25:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this comes amid an ongoing
purge of tens
of thousands of Turkey's own
government employees,

25:23.422 --> 25:28.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports
from Istanbul.

25:28.327 --> 25:38.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: "We won't shut
up, we're
not afraid, we will not obey,"
they chant.

25:39.004 --> 25:43.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's new outcasts are daring
to protest,
despite being labeled as enemies
of the state

25:43.942 --> 25:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the great purge following
last July's failed
coup attempt.

25:50.516 --> 25:55.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tens of thousands of teachers,
academics,
judges, police officers and
civil servants

25:55.254 --> 25:59.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been dismissed from their
jobs and stripped
of their passports.

25:59.725 --> 26:06.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Derya Keskin, an assistant
university professor,
was purged last September after
she signed

26:06.532 --> 26:09.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a petition calling for peace in
Turkey.

26:09.034 --> 26:12.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DERYA KESKIN, University
Professor: We can
make a comparison between the
McCarthy era

26:12.604 --> 26:15.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Turkey right now.

26:15.741 --> 26:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this is, I think, worse.

26:17.509 --> 26:20.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are similarities, I'm
sure, but this
is worse.

26:20.379 --> 26:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just a pretext to get rid
of all lefty
people, all Democrats, even
liberals.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is expanding to liberals,
actually.

26:30.656 --> 26:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The blanket
allegation made
by the government is that the
purged are followers

26:34.793 --> 26:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this man, Fethullah Gulen.

26:36.929 --> 26:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A supposedly moderate Muslim
preacher, Gulen
is a former ally of President
Erdogan who

26:42.501 --> 26:46.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
runs Islamist schools and has a
fervent following.

26:46.538 --> 26:49.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government alleges he runs a
terrorist
organization called FETO.

26:49.741 --> 26:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It accuses him of orchestrating
the coup attempt
and is demanding that the U.S.
extradites

26:55.314 --> 26:56.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him from exile in Pennsylvania.

26:56.949 --> 26:57.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you a Gulenist?

26:57.950 --> 26:58.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you a terrorist?

26:58.917 --> 27:01.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DERYA KESKIN: I'm not a
Gulenist.

27:01.186 --> 27:02.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not a terrorist.

27:02.688 --> 27:04.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm against all kinds of
violence.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I condemn every kind of
violence.

27:07.926 --> 27:09.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's why I signed the peace
petition.

27:09.761 --> 27:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMET KASIM HAN, Political
Scientist: During
the McCarthy era and during the
Stalin era,

27:12.364 --> 27:15.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the historical circumstances
were totally
different.

27:15.734 --> 27:21.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Political
scientist Ahmet
Kasim Han says Turks
traditionally favor stability

27:21.507 --> 27:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over liberty, and suggests there
is some merit
in the government's depiction of
Fethullah

27:26.545 --> 27:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gulen as a dark force trying to
destabilize
Turkey.

27:30.282 --> 27:35.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMET KASIM HAN: In Turkey,
there is an issue
which is very hard for the
Western mind to

27:35.087 --> 27:37.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grasp.

27:37.055 --> 27:44.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey has really gone through a
very aberrant
coup attempt, which has unfolded
a series

27:44.763 --> 27:54.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of events that has even made the
most informed
Turk surprised to the level of
infiltration

27:54.039 --> 27:57.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Gulenist movement to the
state.

27:57.876 --> 28:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: If politics is
a source of
division in Turkey, then so is
religion.

28:09.688 --> 28:12.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost all of the roughly 80
million Turks
are Muslims.

28:12.925 --> 28:17.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But opinion polls suggest around
half the
population opposes the growing
Islamization

28:17.729 --> 28:20.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the country under President
Erdogan.

28:20.299 --> 28:25.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 2002, when he became the
dominant figure
in Turkish politics, the state
has built an

28:25.704 --> 28:28.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
estimated 17,000 mosques.

28:28.240 --> 28:34.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This small, traditional mosque
will soon be
dwarfed by minarets of a new
Islamic landmark

28:34.513 --> 28:40.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slated for Taksim Square in the
secular heart
of Istanbul.

28:40.352 --> 28:45.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hasan Kara is the chief imam of
Sultanahmet,
Istanbul's blue mosque.

28:45.424 --> 28:49.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HASAN KARA, Chief Imam,
Sultanahmet (through
translator): Because Recep
Tayyip Erdogan

28:49.695 --> 28:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a Muslim, a man of character
and brave
who speaks out fearlessly, the
public have

28:55.000 --> 28:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
taken to him as a man of the
people and view
him as an idol and role model.

28:59.638 --> 29:04.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: What worries
tens of millions
of Turks is that the vision of
Kemal Ataturk,

29:04.743 --> 29:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the father of the modern nation,
is more seriously
under threat than ever before.

29:09.982 --> 29:15.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ataturk revolutionized Turkey in
the 1920s
by realigning it away from the
Eastern world

29:15.120 --> 29:20.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
towards the West, and enshrining
secularism
in the Constitution.

29:20.459 --> 29:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ataturk's legacy was at the
heart of this
campaign meeting to fight
against the growing

29:24.396 --> 29:31.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trend in Turkish education
whereby state schools
are transformed into overtly
religious institutions,

29:31.370 --> 29:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and creationism is promoted over
evolution.

29:34.239 --> 29:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aysel Celikel heads the Society
for the Promotion
of Contemporary Life.

29:38.443 --> 29:41.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYSEL CELIKEL, Society for the
Promotion of
Contemporary Life (through
translator): This

29:41.380 --> 29:45.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
situation is, of course,
worrying us, because
the political powers have said
they want to

29:45.851 --> 29:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
raise a religious generation.

29:47.886 --> 29:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With all these prayer rooms and
small mosques
opening up at schools with the
kind of education

29:52.758 --> 29:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're offering, they are
really pumping
this idea of a religious
generation.

29:56.461 --> 30:01.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This is Fatih,
a traditionally
conservative district of
Istanbul, where the

30:01.333 --> 30:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
majority of women cover their
heads.

30:03.702 --> 30:08.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have come to meet Ihsan
Eliacik, a renowned
Muslim theologian and writer.

30:08.640 --> 30:12.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He worries that the Turkish
leader might not
be able to control more radical
Islamists

30:12.878 --> 30:14.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
within the country.

30:14.713 --> 30:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's concerned about homegrown
extremists,
as well as Islamic State
militants, who, earlier

30:19.985 --> 30:23.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Syria conflict, enjoyed
fairly free
movement in Turkey.

30:23.288 --> 30:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IHSAN ELIACIK, Muslim Theologian
(through
translator): There might be a
danger of conflict,

30:27.225 --> 30:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because, with the ruling party,
Islamic extremists
became too powerful.

30:31.463 --> 30:34.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The ruling party unwittingly
helped them flourish.

30:34.132 --> 30:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And especially because of the
Syrian conflict,
they grew stronger.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They got ahold of weapons and
they got organized.

30:39.771 --> 30:41.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They thrived.

So it will take time to
eliminate them and
to neutralize them.

MALCOLM BRABANT: President
Erdogan inspires
adulation and disdain in fairly
equal measure.

30:50.082 --> 30:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He argues that changing the
constitution will
help make government more
efficient.

30:54.186 --> 30:57.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): Turkey has come to
a crossroads

30:57.723 --> 30:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on changing the system of
government.

30:59.491 --> 31:01.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The process has started.

31:01.359 --> 31:05.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: President
Erdogan's popularity
and policies are about to be put
to the test

31:05.230 --> 31:11.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a referendum to decide
whether Turkey should
have a United States-style
presidency, but

31:11.169 --> 31:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
without the checks and balances.

31:13.138 --> 31:18.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Erdogan wins, he will have
much more power,
he will be able to get rid of
the prime minister,

31:18.143 --> 31:20.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the role of Parliament will
be much reduced.

31:20.946 --> 31:25.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His opponents fear that victory
will mean
that an already authoritarian
leader will

31:25.584 --> 31:28.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
become a fully fledged dictator.

31:28.653 --> 31:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The changes could enable Erdogan
to stay in
office until 2029.

31:33.358 --> 31:38.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This pro-government rally was
addressed by
the prime minister, who was
effectively campaigning

31:38.196 --> 31:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the president to make him
redundant.

31:39.998 --> 31:43.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BINALI YILDIRIM, Turkish Prime
Minister (through
translator): These reforms are a
historic

31:43.535 --> 31:45.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opportunity for our country.

31:45.604 --> 31:51.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With a strong presidency,
military authority,
military coups and elite groups
will be history.

31:51.643 --> 31:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody will try to interfere in
the business
of people and politicians
elected by people.

31:55.814 --> 32:00.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I am
here for
the unity of our country and for
sake of our

32:00.786 --> 32:01.787 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
youth's future.

32:01.820 --> 32:05.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: "We don't want
to be in chains.

32:05.190 --> 32:11.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We won't allow anyone to lord
over us," cry
the no campaigners.

32:11.897 --> 32:16.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Erdogan's opponents
fear that his
victory on April the 16th will
accelerate

32:16.935 --> 32:21.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey towards becoming a
theocracy, or religious
state, like Iran.

32:21.973 --> 32:27.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's why Turkey's NATO
partners will be
watching this historic vote with
keen interest.

32:27.679 --> 32:33.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
in Istanbul.

32:33.485 --> 32:45.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After years of
holding interest
rates at near zero level, the
Federal Reserve

32:45.130 --> 32:50.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has entered a new phase, where
short-term
rates may be rising with greater
regularity,

32:50.302 --> 32:52.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as they did again today.

32:52.170 --> 32:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown looks at how the
Fed has changed
its outlook for the economy and
the path ahead

32:56.842 --> 32:58.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for policy-makers.

32:58.710 --> 33:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the past,
Federal Reserve
Chairwoman Janet Yellen has
expressed concerns

33:02.280 --> 33:04.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the strength of the
recovery.

33:04.316 --> 33:09.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, she told reporters,
"We have confidence
in the robustness of the economy
and its resilience

33:09.321 --> 33:10.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to shocks."

33:10.488 --> 33:13.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Wessel joins me now for
some Fed tea
reading.

33:13.758 --> 33:18.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's with the Brookings
Institution and a
contributing correspondent to
The Wall Street

33:18.330 --> 33:20.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Journal.

33:20.065 --> 33:24.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, a largely positive
message, right,
that sustainable growth
continues and can

33:24.569 --> 33:25.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
continue.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is the Fed seeing?

33:27.439 --> 33:28.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL, The Wall Street
Journal: Well,
the Fed is seeing that
unemployment has come

33:28.673 --> 33:31.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down to the level that they
consider full
employment.

33:31.076 --> 33:36.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They seem to have a great deal
of confidence
that the economy has finally got
some momentum.

33:36.381 --> 33:40.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Janet Yellen cited the
confidence of the business
community and consumers that is
showing up

33:41.019 --> 33:42.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in surveys.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I -- and she was very, very
upbeat, I
think.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Slightly higher
inflation,
but at a reasonable level,
right?

33:48.026 --> 33:50.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they're not worried about
overheating
this point.

33:50.295 --> 33:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: They're finally
getting to their
goals of getting inflation close
to 2 percent,

33:54.900 --> 33:56.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
getting unemployment down.

33:56.735 --> 34:00.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She noted that the labor force
participation
rate, the fraction of people who
are working

34:00.672 --> 34:06.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or looking for work seems to be
going up a
little bit, even though we have
an aging population.

34:06.244 --> 34:09.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, she seemed to be very happy
with the way
the economy is going.

34:09.214 --> 34:12.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But clearly
signaling that
this is the trend, right, that
there will

34:12.484 --> 34:13.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be more hikes to come?

34:13.485 --> 34:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: This is the trend,
but gradual.

34:15.253 --> 34:17.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a lot of talk about
gradual.

34:17.422 --> 34:20.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the forecast that
the members
of the Fed's policy-making
committee said,

34:20.926 --> 34:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're basically seeing a
couple of interest
rate increases this year.

34:25.030 --> 34:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That would still get us to,
like, maybe 1.5
percent by the beginning of next
year, still

34:30.402 --> 34:32.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very, very low.

34:32.270 --> 34:35.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you put
together today
and this kind of trend, what
impact on consumers?

34:35.807 --> 34:38.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Well, this will
mean that people
are going to pay more to borrow.

34:38.877 --> 34:40.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mortgage rates have already gone
up.

34:40.412 --> 34:44.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're around 4.2 percent for a
30-year mortgage.

34:44.049 --> 34:47.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were below 4 percent just a
few months
ago.

34:47.385 --> 34:50.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People will see -- who borrow on
their credit
cards will see more.

34:50.689 --> 34:54.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, eventually, although it
always takes
a long time, people who have
money in the

34:54.626 --> 34:58.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
banks, savings accounts,
certificates of deposit,
will see those rates start to
creep up.

34:58.697 --> 35:02.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, there has
been a lot of
discussion in recent weeks,
especially as

35:02.734 --> 35:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Fed rates -- raises the
rates, vs. this
-- with a steady growth in mind
-- vs. the

35:09.908 --> 35:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president, who talks about a
real push forward,
right?

35:11.676 --> 35:12.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

35:12.877 --> 35:14.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And really
getting the economy
going.

35:14.679 --> 35:18.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: I think what the
Fed fears is
that, if Donald Trump gets big
tax cuts and

35:18.583 --> 35:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big spending increases that take
effect right
now, when the economy is close
to full employment,

35:24.055 --> 35:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they will have to raise rates
more rapidly.

35:26.658 --> 35:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Janet Yellen made clear that
they're raising
rates now without much
anticipation of a big

35:31.730 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fiscal move.

35:33.064 --> 35:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they get one, I suspect they
will raise
rates more rapidly.

35:35.934 --> 35:39.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She did, of course, make the
point that if
Congress and the president could
agree on

35:39.537 --> 35:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that get the long-term
growth rate
up, the rate of productivity
growth or bringing

35:43.608 --> 35:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more people into the work force,
that's something
that the Fed would applaud.

35:46.711 --> 35:49.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We heard her talk
-- she was
asked a little bit about
relations with the

35:49.948 --> 35:51.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
new administration.

35:51.416 --> 35:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's always a little delicate
dance a bit,
right?

35:54.185 --> 35:55.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Yes.

35:55.186 --> 35:56.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think she was prepared for the
question.

35:56.187 --> 35:57.155 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

35:57.188 --> 35:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, clearly.

35:58.590 --> 35:59.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: She said wonderful
things about
the treasury secretary.

35:59.424 --> 36:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She said she had met Donald
Trump.

36:02.160 --> 36:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think her attitude is going to
be, we have
an independent Central Bank for
a reason.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to do what I think is
right.

36:08.800 --> 36:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I suspect that people at the
Fed realize
that, at some point, they're
likely to be

36:13.038 --> 36:17.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the target of an angry Donald
Trump tweet
when he thinks they're raising
rates too fast.

36:17.275 --> 36:20.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And just very
quickly, in the
meantime, the stock market just
keeps going

36:20.311 --> 36:21.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up, even with the rates going
up.

36:21.546 --> 36:22.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

36:22.547 --> 36:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They don't seem
to matter.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: The stock market
was relieved
that the Fed didn't sound
tougher today, and

36:26.418 --> 36:31.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the stock market seems to figure
that everything
they like about Donald Trump
will come true,

36:31.356 --> 36:34.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and everything they're afraid of
about Donald
Trump will not come true.

36:34.259 --> 36:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: David Wessel,
thank you, as
always.

36:39.097 --> 36:44.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome.

36:44.069 --> 36:51.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For decades,
researchers have
worked to create a better and
more direct

36:51.443 --> 36:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
connection between a human brain
and a computer
to improve the lives of people
who are paralyzed

36:57.382 --> 37:01.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or have severe limb weakness
from diseases
like ALS.

37:01.052 --> 37:07.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Those advances have been
notable, but now
the work is yielding
groundbreaking results.

37:07.258 --> 37:09.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Cat Wise
has the story.

37:09.627 --> 37:13.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our Breakthroughs
reporting and
for our weekly segment about the
Leading Edge

37:13.932 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of science and technology.

37:16.768 --> 37:25.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dennis Degray is a
64-year-old quadriplegic
who is writing a sentence on the
computer

37:25.376 --> 37:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
screen in front of him using
only his brain.

37:29.914 --> 37:35.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A former volunteer firefighter,
Degray had
a bad fall 10 years ago which
severed his

37:35.987 --> 37:37.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spinal cord.

37:37.856 --> 37:42.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As part of an early stage
clinical research
study led by Stanford
University, Degray and

37:42.460 --> 37:47.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two other volunteer participants
with ALS
had small sensors implanted in
their brains

37:47.799 --> 38:00.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in an area called the motor
cortex, which
controls movement.

38:00.078 --> 38:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though Degray can no longer
physically
move his arms, the neurons in
that part of

38:04.082 --> 38:08.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his brain, and in the brains of
many other
paralyzed individuals, remain
active.

38:08.720 --> 38:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sensors in his brain listen
in to those
neurons, which emit different
electrical signals

38:13.057 --> 38:16.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
depending on the direction
Degray thinks about

DENNIS DEGRAY, Clinical Research
Participant:
To move the pointer around, I
imagine a ball

38:19.898 --> 38:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lying on a table and with my
hand lying on
the ball.

38:22.500 --> 38:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as I roll the ball forward,
the pointer
goes up, and as I roll the ball
back toward

38:28.273 --> 38:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, the pointer goes down, and,
of course,
left and right correspondingly.

38:31.643 --> 38:36.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The neural signals are
transmitted
to the computer through two
devices that screw

38:36.714 --> 38:42.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into small pieces of equipment
called pedestals
protruding from Degray's scalp.

38:42.554 --> 38:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the computer, sophisticated
algorithms
turn the movements in his mind
into cursor

38:47.625 --> 38:49.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
movements on the screen.

38:49.127 --> 38:51.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DENNIS DEGRAY: It's very
liberating.

38:51.095 --> 38:57.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To be able to utilize a portion
of my body
that has not worked to actually
cause and

38:57.135 --> 39:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect is great fun, just great
fun.

39:02.907 --> 39:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAIMIE HENDERSON, Stanford
University: If
you had asked me five years ago
if I thought

39:04.742 --> 39:09.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would see these types of
systems becoming
available any time within my
lifetime, I would

39:09.581 --> 39:11.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have been pretty skeptical.

39:11.182 --> 39:14.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would say now that, within
the next
10 years or so, we will probably
begin to

39:14.786 --> 39:18.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see systems that can restore
function to people
with paralysis.

39:18.323 --> 39:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dr. Jaimie Henderson
is a professor
of neurosurgery at Stanford
University.

39:33.137 --> 39:37.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He implanted the sensors in
Degray's brain,
and he is one of the leaders of
a scientific

39:37.375 --> 39:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team from several universities
around the
country working on the
technology called BrainGate.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.382 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:44.415 --> 39:46.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAIMIE HENDERSON: The principles
by which
we're reading out brain signals
are well-established.

39:46.217 --> 39:50.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The research advance is using
the computer
algorithms to figure out what
the brain is

39:50.555 --> 39:55.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing, an operating system that
can read out
signals on millisecond time
scales and feed

39:55.393 --> 40:00.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that back to the user, so that
they can be
in very tight feedback loop with
the machine

40:00.064 --> 40:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and use it more efficiently.

40:01.833 --> 40:05.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CAT WISE: That improved
efficiency in the
BrainGate operating system,
which has been

40:05.970 --> 40:10.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in development for more than a
decade, is
at the heart of a new research
paper Dr. Henderson

40:10.808 --> 40:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and his colleagues released.

40:12.710 --> 40:17.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The study, which was funded in
part by the
National Institutes of Health,
also a "NewsHour"

40:17.448 --> 40:21.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
funder, highlighted the typing
results of
Degray and the two others in the
study.

40:21.119 --> 40:22.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:22.887 --> 40:25.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAIMIE HENDERSON: Our
participants in this
study were able to type at
anywhere between

40:25.990 --> 40:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
20 to up to almost 40 correct
characters per
minute, which translates to
somewhere between

40:31.229 --> 40:37.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four and eight words per minute,
which is
the fastest typing now
demonstrated in people

40:37.602 --> 40:41.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with paralysis by a factor of
anywhere from
two to four.

40:41.372 --> 40:47.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This allows you to type at
speeds that are
now approaching what you can use
on a cell

40:47.145 --> 40:48.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
phone.

40:48.913 --> 40:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Surveys of those with
paralysis
show that speed of communication
is important

40:51.816 --> 40:53.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

40:53.584 --> 40:57.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's one of the frustrations
with current
systems that track eye and face
movements.

40:57.388 --> 41:02.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the goals of the research
now is evaluate
the safety of brain-computer
interfaces, but

41:02.827 --> 41:08.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there are still a lot of
questions and concerns
about connecting brains to
computers.

41:08.132 --> 41:09.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a debate the Stanford team
embraces.

41:09.967 --> 41:14.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KRISHNA SHENOY, Stanford
University: Over
the past few decades, we have
become increasingly

41:14.105 --> 41:18.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comfortable with having various
devices implanted
in our bodies.

41:18.976 --> 41:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Study co-author
Krishna Shenoy says
his broader research with neural
prosthetics

41:24.115 --> 41:29.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shows people are comfortable
with much more
now than just knee replacements,
for example,

41:29.253 --> 41:31.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
electrodes to control
Parkinson's tremors.

41:31.289 --> 41:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRISHNA SHENOY: Fifteen years
ago, society
started to become comfortable
with deep brain

41:37.328 --> 41:38.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stimulators.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you turn the system on, the
tremor essentially
stops.

41:41.199 --> 41:42.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's like magic.

41:43.000 --> 41:48.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tens of thousands of people are
walking around
every day with these electronic
systems in

41:48.639 --> 41:50.541 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their brains.

41:50.575 --> 41:56.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the question is, is there
something sacrosanct
about the brain, that we
shouldn't go there?

41:56.381 --> 42:01.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is extremely important to
be guided by
bioethics, neuroethics.

42:01.119 --> 42:08.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a case where we can
do tremendous
good if this is developed and
deployed correctly.

42:08.760 --> 42:14.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: Dennis Degray says
that, while he's
able to utilize a range of
communication systems,

42:14.866 --> 42:19.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's participating in the trial
to help advance
a technology that may benefit
those who don't

42:19.270 --> 42:20.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have as many options.

42:20.571 --> 42:24.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENNIS DEGRAY: What we're
performing here
is basic science.

42:24.642 --> 42:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're building a foundation upon
which the
roboticists, the communicators,
the mechanical

42:31.749 --> 42:38.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engineers, medical prosthetic
device manufacturers,
all of them will be able to
utilize the controls

42:38.923 --> 42:40.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we are learning about at
this point.

42:40.825 --> 42:42.660 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:42.693 --> 42:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAIMIE HENDERSON: We have, I
think, made slow,
but steady progress, and are
getting to the

42:46.864 --> 42:52.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point where we can now really
imagine systems
that can be fully implanted,
wireless, able

42:52.870 --> 42:56.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be used 24 hours a day
without calibration.

42:56.073 --> 43:00.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we're still a ways away
from that,
but we're getting closer.

43:00.211 --> 43:04.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAT WISE: The Stanford research
team hopes
to enroll another trial
participant in the

43:04.649 --> 43:06.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
next year or two.

43:06.317 --> 43:10.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are now exploring ways
to connect
people and their brains to new
devices.

43:10.621 --> 43:13.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Cat
Wise in Palo
Alto, California.

43:14.025 --> 43:15.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fascinating.

43:15.827 --> 43:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be back shortly with
a look at
an artist who brings dinosaur
fossils to life.

43:20.898 --> 43:24.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

43:24.669 --> 43:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on
the air.

43:36.280 --> 43:43.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

43:43.054 --> 43:46.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that might be

44:07.612 --> 44:10.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you, too.

44:10.081 --> 44:20.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Nothing captures the
imaginations of children
and adults alike quite like
dinosaurs.

44:20.525 --> 44:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for one artist, a childhood
love of prehistoric
creatures inspired a unique, and
prolific,

44:31.102 --> 44:32.069 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
career.

44:32.103 --> 44:33.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent David
Biello explains.

44:33.137 --> 44:35.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Julius Csotonyi is
a paleoartist.

44:35.540 --> 44:40.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His job is using his artistic
skills to bring
fossilized bones back to life.

44:40.278 --> 44:44.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIUS CSOTONYI, Paleoartist: We
can't go
out there and photograph it
anymore.

44:44.815 --> 44:53.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that this is why
paleoart is crucial
to communicating certain aspects
of the science.

44:53.658 --> 45:00.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Csotonyi's skills
are highly
sought after by paleontologists
such as Michael

45:00.698 --> 45:06.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ryan, the curator of vertebrate
paleontology
at the Cleveland Museum of
Natural History.

45:06.704 --> 45:11.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL RYAN, Cleveland Museum
of Natural
History: It takes our research
one step further

45:11.576 --> 45:18.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than we could do it on our own.

45:18.549 --> 45:26.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Ryan's specialty
is horned dinosaurs,
known as Ceratopsians, of which
Triceratops

45:26.057 --> 45:28.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is the most famous example.

45:28.125 --> 45:38.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Ryan discovers uncovers a
new Ceratopsian,
he often calls on Csotonyi to
bring it back

45:38.169 --> 45:47.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Ryan discovers uncovers a
new Ceratopsian,
he often calls on Csotonyi to
bring it back

45:47.044 --> 45:48.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to life.

45:48.746 --> 45:58.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL RYAN: Julius is one of
the best of
the current crop of new dinosaur
artists.

45:58.222 --> 46:08.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did a beautiful piece when we
named a new
horned dinosaur from Southern
Alberta called

46:08.332 --> 46:17.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did a beautiful piece when we
named a new
horned dinosaur from Southern
Alberta called

46:17.508 --> 46:19.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Xenoceratops.

46:19.377 --> 46:25.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BIELLO: When a new
dinosaur is identified,
Csotonyi and Ryan discuss its
major anatomical

46:25.583 --> 46:28.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
features and what its living
environment may
have been.

46:28.753 --> 46:30.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then Csotonyi gets to work.

46:30.488 --> 46:34.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIUS CSOTONYI: I mostly start
at the head.

46:34.191 --> 46:44.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over several rounds of revision
and review,
we come to a rough sketch that
is agreeable

Over several rounds of revision
and review,
we come to a rough sketch that
is agreeable

46:57.648 --> 47:07.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to everybody, and then I start
to add the
color layers to it.

47:07.992 --> 47:14.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: The final piece
shows what a
dinosaur like Xenoceratops might
have looked

47:14.598 --> 47:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like in real life.

47:16.367 --> 47:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL RYAN: We're trying to
get our research
out to the public.

47:20.104 --> 47:22.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can do that by writing
scientific papers.

47:23.007 --> 47:28.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We can put the

47:28.345 --> 47:33.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We can put the

50:58.255 --> 51:03.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bones

51:03.527 --> 51:08.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bones

52:10.995 --> 52:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that make up those fossils on
display in museums.

52:16.133 --> 52:19.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of -- the best way to
get images out
of what these things look like
is to work

52:19.303 --> 52:20.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with artists.

52:20.671 --> 52:23.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People visually cue off a nice
colorful painting
of a dinosaur.

52:23.173 --> 52:28.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BIELLO: Every year,
millions of people
see Csotonyi's work in books, in
magazines,

52:28.145 --> 52:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and at more than 20 museums
around the world.

52:30.881 --> 52:34.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIUS CSOTONYI: I would be
doing it in my
