JUDY WOODRUFF: The battle to
dislodge ISIS from its makeshift
capital, Raqqa, in Syria

00:05.233 --> 00:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is intensifying, as U.S.-backed
militia press the offensive.

00:09.066 --> 00:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for years, a group of
citizen journalists have
documented life inside the city.

00:16.033 --> 00:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their work started when the
uprising began in 2011 against
Syria's president, Bashar

00:20.400 --> 00:22.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
al-Assad.

00:22.433 --> 00:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it continues today
under even more deadly and
dangerous circumstances.

00:25.433 --> 00:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has their story.

00:27.466 --> 00:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: They call
themselves Raqqa is Being
Slaughtered Silently.

00:31.066 --> 00:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And last year, the Committee to
Protect Journalists awarded the
group its International Press

00:35.600 --> 00:37.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Freedom Award.

00:37.233 --> 00:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Their story is now
told in a documentary
titled "City of Ghosts."

00:40.800 --> 00:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And joining me is the film's
director, Matthew Heineman,
and Abdul-Aziz al-Hamza, one of

00:46.566 --> 00:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the group's members.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

00:49.366 --> 00:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA,
Raqqa is Being Slaughtered
Silently: Thank you.

00:51.466 --> 00:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Aziz, I want
to -- you and your friends and
colleagues are not fighters.

00:52.966 --> 00:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were not journalists
before all of this started.

00:56.166 --> 00:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In your own words, what are you?

00:58.633 --> 01:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you describe yourselves?

01:00.800 --> 01:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: Before the
Syrian revolution, before all
what happened in Syria, I was a

01:04.333 --> 01:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
normal teenager who was
studying biochemistry.

01:07.366 --> 01:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I had nothing to
do with politics.

01:09.533 --> 01:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Even my family had like
no political background.

01:13.266 --> 01:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I was as any college
student anywhere.

01:17.333 --> 01:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then, when
this started, you and your
friends felt you had to document

01:22.866 --> 01:24.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

01:24.933 --> 01:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: The way
how the Syrian regime and ISIS
prevented the international

01:27.600 --> 01:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media organizations to come and
cover what's going on, it was
like kind of a duty to cover

01:32.366 --> 01:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the atrocities of both of them.

01:36.366 --> 01:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So we decided first with
our mobile phones to
film the demonstrations.

01:40.033 --> 01:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At our own, we developed
our skills to document
what the human rights
violations against the

01:46.700 --> 01:48.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

01:48.733 --> 01:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Matthew,
many stories are told about
Syria, why was this the one you

01:52.066 --> 01:54.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wanted to tell?

01:54.200 --> 01:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW HEINEMAN, Director,
"City of Ghosts": You know, I
was really fascinated by this

01:56.200 --> 01:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
war of ideas, this war of
propaganda, this information
war between ISIS on one hand and

02:00.966 --> 02:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RBSS on the other.

02:03.166 --> 02:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ISIS uses these slick,
almost Hollywood-style
videos to disseminate
fear across the world

02:09.700 --> 02:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to attract followers
and proclaim a safe haven,
a paradise for Muslims.

02:17.166 --> 02:22.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RBSS and the work of
Aziz and his colleagues
totally counter that and
show the extraordinarily

02:24.800 --> 02:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
awful human rights violations
that they're committing
almost on a daily basis.

02:29.000 --> 02:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, that's what
initially drew me to the film,
but the film became much more

02:32.033 --> 02:34.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than that to me.

02:34.033 --> 02:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It became a -- ultimately, it
became a story of them fleeing,
being forced to flee from

02:37.733 --> 02:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Syria, to Turkey,
and Turkey to Europe.

02:39.666 --> 02:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It became an immigrant story.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It became a story of rising
nationalism in Europe.

02:44.500 --> 02:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It became a story about trauma
and the cumulative effects of
trauma, so it became much more

02:49.233 --> 02:51.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than that.

02:51.266 --> 02:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, let's
take a look at a clip that
shows a little bit of the work

02:52.433 --> 02:53.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of your group.

02:53.733 --> 02:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: We are made up
to have two groups.

02:56.000 --> 03:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The internal group is in
Raqqa and is made up of
around 17 correspondents.

03:12.066 --> 03:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The internal group's mission
is to film, photograph
and deliver urgent news.

03:25.433 --> 03:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The primary mission
of the external term
group is to communicate
with the group inside.

03:37.366 --> 03:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Rashidi, go to the door.

03:40.366 --> 03:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A girl is going to
bring you stuff.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She is wearing a
deep red head scarf.

03:45.500 --> 03:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The internal group then
sends us the information.

03:49.000 --> 03:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
There's a big airstrike
in the north from our
correspondent Iyan Issa

03:56.000 --> 03:57.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(ph).

03:57.500 --> 04:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We, the external group,
then distribute it to the world.

04:00.600 --> 04:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Aziz, the
film mostly, necessarily,
spends its time with you and

04:07.333 --> 04:09.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your colleagues who
are outside Raqqa.

04:09.566 --> 04:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those who are inside,
who we just saw, how are
they able to do their work?

04:14.266 --> 04:16.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And what kind of
dangers do they face?

04:16.366 --> 04:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: So, they
are like -- in every second
and every moment they are like

04:19.833 --> 04:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a dangerous and
a risky situation.

04:22.266 --> 04:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they could be
killed by ISIS, the
airstrikes, the shelling.

04:29.366 --> 04:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they are risking their
lives daily to show the
reality of what's going on.

04:33.233 --> 04:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Matthew, you and
I talked about your last film,
which was really around the

04:36.966 --> 04:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
border area in the U.S., and
the way you told that story,
sort of embedding yourself into

04:44.300 --> 04:45.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the violence.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a little different.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell me how you made this film.

04:48.966 --> 04:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MATTHEW HEINEMAN: Yes,
so this was a different
experience for me.

04:51.700 --> 04:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was forced to -- I
wasn't able to go to Raqqa.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would be killed instantly.

04:56.300 --> 05:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I started filming them
in Turkey after they were forced
to flee, after some of the

05:01.933 --> 05:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
members of their
group were killed.

05:04.000 --> 05:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the sort of through-line
of the film is basically me
with them as they are escaping

05:10.200 --> 05:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from safe house to safe house,
ultimately landing in Europe.

05:13.533 --> 05:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I think these issues
of ISIS and Syria are so
often relegated to headlines

05:20.933 --> 05:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to stats, and I
really wanted to put a
human face to this topic.

05:25.133 --> 05:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: What
is the situation now?

05:27.300 --> 05:32.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, the battle for Raqqa
is going on, and we read about
airstrikes, civilians being

05:33.333 --> 05:34.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hurt.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the situation
for your colleagues?

05:36.666 --> 05:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: For the
people of Raqqa, so they are
suffering not only by ISIS, by

05:39.933 --> 05:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the airstrike of the
international coalition.

05:41.933 --> 05:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, the
Russians are still bombing
the city, the Syrian regime.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, everyone is like
bombing the city.

05:47.966 --> 05:50.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The local are besieged
between all these sides.

05:50.733 --> 05:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The condition is the city,
the services are like so bad.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Everything is getting
expensive day after day.

05:56.900 --> 06:01.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
People are missing
like many things for
their necessary lives.

06:01.166 --> 06:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And many people were kind of
trying to flee the city, but
the land mines -- so it's a

06:06.966 --> 06:08.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
horrible situation.

06:08.966 --> 06:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: With the outcome
in Raqqa still so uncertain,
do you know whether you will

06:14.933 --> 06:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to return or to
what kind of city you
will be able to return to?

06:17.033 --> 06:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABDUL-AZIZ AL-HAMZA: I hope
that one day, I will be able
to return to Raqqa, to my city.

06:21.800 --> 06:26.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So that's the reason
why I started this group
with my colleagues, so
to fight for our city,

06:28.700 --> 06:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able one day to go
back and lead the rest of
our lives in Raqqa and Syria.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I don't want to be
like a fugitive anymore.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Matthew,
what do you hope people take
from this, from your film?

06:40.200 --> 06:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW HEINEMAN: Bombs
are not going to fix ISIS.

06:43.366 --> 06:47.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This ground war that
we're fighting is not
going to end ISIS.

06:47.066 --> 06:49.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ISIS is an idea.

06:49.066 --> 06:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have to fight
this idea with the same
tools that they're using.

06:52.900 --> 06:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think, you know, we,
as a global community, we,
as the United States, we as

06:59.833 --> 07:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
journalists, have to figure out
ways to combat ISIS' ideology,
ISIS' extremist ideology,

07:06.466 --> 07:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not just with guns and bombs,
but with words, with campaigns
like the amazing work that

07:13.666 --> 07:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this group is doing.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
new film is "City of Ghosts."

07:17.300 --> 07:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matthew Heineman and
Abdul-Aziz al-Hamza,
thank you both very much.

07:21.100 --> 07:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATTHEW HEINEMAN: Thank you.
