Gwen Ifill.
Judy Woodruff is on assignment.

00:07.708 --> 00:13.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: the
race for the
White House moves from coffee
shops to tarmacs,

00:13.213 --> 00:18.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the map expands to 12 more
states for Super
Tuesday.

00:18.318 --> 00:24.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: missiles, bombers,
and submarines.
We look at America's aging
nuclear triad.

00:24.758 --> 00:31.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former NSA and CIA Director
Michael Hayden
talks about his new book on
American intelligence

00:31.865 --> 00:33.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the age of terror.

00:33.867 --> 00:38.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN (RET.),
Former CIA Director:
I sat there with the order to
authorize extended

00:38.171 --> 00:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sleep deprivation on one of the
detainees,
Mohammad Rahim, and I never
forgot he was

00:43.110 --> 00:44.311 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a human being.

00:44.344 --> 00:51.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.785 --> 00:54.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.755 --> 01:04.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama
today insisted
he will send a resistant Senate
a Supreme

01:04.698 --> 01:10.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court nominee. Senate Republican
say they
will hold no hearings or vote
and will, instead,

01:10.971 --> 01:14.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wait until a new president takes
office next
year.

01:14.241 --> 01:19.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in an Oval Office meeting
with the king
of Jordan, the president said
he's going to

01:19.079 --> 01:21.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his job, and senators should do
theirs.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I recognize the

01:23.450 --> 01:35.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics are hard for them,
because the easier
thing to do is to give in to the
most extreme

01:35.562 --> 01:44.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voices within their party and
stand pat and
do nothing. But that's not our
job. Our job

01:44.838 --> 01:47.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to fulfill our constitutional
duties.

01:47.240 --> 01:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: At the same time, it
was widely
reported the White House is
vetting Republican

01:52.279 --> 01:57.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Governor Brian Sandoval of
Nevada as a possible
nominee. He confirmed he's
discussed it with

01:57.584 --> 02:02.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state's two senators,
Minority Leader
Harry Reid and Republican Dean
Heller. We

02:02.522 --> 02:06.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will delve into all of the court
fight later
in the program.

02:06.326 --> 02:10.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Senate did confirm a new
commissioner
of the Food and Drug
Administration today.

02:10.731 --> 02:15.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robert Califf has been the
agency's number
two official. Before that, he
was a well-known

02:15.669 --> 02:19.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
cardiologist and medical
researcher at Duke
University.

02:19.339 --> 02:24.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, the president
nominated Carla
Hayden to be the 14th librarian
of Congress.

02:24.411 --> 02:29.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's currently head of the
Enoch Pratt Free
Library in Baltimore, and will
be the first

02:29.082 --> 02:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
woman, and African-American, to
serve in the
post.

02:32.652 --> 02:37.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Republicans now say
they're gearing
for a legal fight if President
Obama tries

02:37.424 --> 02:43.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to close the Guantanamo
detention center and
transfer prisoners to U.S. soil.

02:43.163 --> 02:49.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaker Paul Ryan today warned
the president
not to use executive action to
bypass a congressional

02:49.202 --> 02:51.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ban against moving inmates.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
We are making legal
preparations, if the president

02:54.908 --> 03:02.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tries to break the law. And what
boggles my
mind is that the president is
contemplating

03:02.949 --> 03:07.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
directing the military to
knowingly break
the law.

03:07.754 --> 03:11.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our law is really clear. And, by
the way,
Democrats wrote this law when
they were in

03:11.958 --> 03:17.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the majority, when they ran
Congress, which
is these detainees cannot come
to American

03:17.831 --> 03:19.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
soil.

03:19.499 --> 03:22.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Top Senate
Republicans said they
would join in any legal
challenge.

03:22.869 --> 03:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Austria and Balkan nations
agreed in Vienna
today to tighten border controls
against migrants.

03:29.643 --> 03:35.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Government ministers met amid
rising security
concerns and shrinking
resources. Greece complained

03:35.482 --> 03:41.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it wasn't invited, but the
Austrians said
Athens has done nothing to stop
the flow.

03:41.588 --> 03:45.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, an estimated 20,000
people are
stranded in Greece, after
countries to the

03:45.859 --> 03:52.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
north began barring migrants.
U.N. workers
handed out blankets and other
aid. Russia

03:52.332 --> 03:57.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has ramped up diplomatic efforts
to sell a
cease-fire in Syria. President
Vladimir Putin

03:57.737 --> 04:03.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made phone calls today to Syrian
President
Bashar al-Assad, plus the king
of Saudi Arabia,

04:03.343 --> 04:08.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president of Iran and the
prime minister
of Israel.

04:08.248 --> 04:13.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov met with
former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn,
chiding those

04:13.920 --> 04:15.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who've questioned the
cease-fire.

04:15.922 --> 04:21.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through
translator): On the very day
when the presidents

04:21.194 --> 04:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Russia and the United States
approved the
joint initiative on the
cease-fire in Syria,

04:26.099 --> 04:31.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voices could be heard both from
the capitals
of the U.S. allies and from
Washington which

04:31.404 --> 04:36.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doubted the feasibility of this
agreement.
There is a call for war, and not
for peace,

04:36.376 --> 04:38.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in these voices.

04:38.044 --> 04:41.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Secretary of State
John Kerry
said again today he cannot vouch
that the

04:41.448 --> 04:46.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
truce will work. He and Lavrov
also spoke
today by phone.

04:46.520 --> 04:50.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Severe weather threatened nearly
90 million
people along the U.S. East Coast
today. The

04:50.557 --> 04:55.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
powerful system killed three
people in Virginia
after killing three others in
the Gulf states

04:55.362 --> 05:00.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overnight. Officials say at
least seven tornadoes
struck Louisiana and
Mississippi, and left

05:01.001 --> 05:06.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thousands without power. Drone
video captured
the destruction in Pensacola,
Florida, where

05:06.907 --> 05:09.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than 70 homes were damaged.

05:09.176 --> 05:13.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a major snowstorm
blasted parts
of the Midwest today, canceling
more than

05:13.747 --> 05:17.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1,000 flights to and from
Chicago.

05:17.751 --> 05:22.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Stanford University has
announced the world's
largest fully-endowed
scholarship program.

05:23.023 --> 05:28.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nike co-founder Phil Knight is
donating $400
million to an endowment that's
expected to

05:28.762 --> 05:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reach $750 million. It will fund
100 full
scholarships each year for
master's and doctorate

05:35.635 --> 05:39.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
degrees. Candidates will be
nominated by their
undergraduate programs.

05:39.539 --> 05:45.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wall Street managed to stave off
another day
of losses. The Dow Jones
industrial average

05:45.278 --> 05:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gained 53 points to close at
16485. The Nasdaq
rose 39 points, and the S&amp;P 500
added eight.

05:54.588 --> 05:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Big Apple is no longer
home to the
most billionaires in the world.
A Chinese

05:59.793 --> 06:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
firm reports that that its
latest yearly rankings
-- in its latest yearly
rankings, Beijing

06:05.398 --> 06:11.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the new title holder, with
100 billionaires.
New York has only 95. The shift
highlights

06:11.738 --> 06:17.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how China's elite are piling up
vast wealth,
even as the nation's economy
cools.

06:17.310 --> 06:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump
gains momentum ahead of Super
Tuesday; a look

06:22.816 --> 06:27.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the showdown between the
president and
the Republican Congress; should
the U.S. rebuild

06:28.021 --> 06:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its entire nuclear arsenal?; and
much more.

06:42.068 --> 06:48.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's off to the races, as
the 2016 campaign
turns into a scattershot chase
among Democrats

06:48.241 --> 06:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Republicans for votes across
dozens of
states.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins reports.

06:53.680 --> 06:57.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump is
on a roll.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

06:59.719 --> 07:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: After winning
in Nevada last
night, he's sprinting to Super
Tuesday states,

07:03.923 --> 07:05.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like Virginia today.

07:05.759 --> 07:08.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think we're
really doing well.
It looks like we're in a great
trend, and

07:08.862 --> 07:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have tremendous support, and
we have amazing
people in this country.

07:12.465 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Out of the
first four Republican
contests, Trump has won three
straight: New

07:17.304 --> 07:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire, South Carolina,
Nevada. But now
the map and the game is changing
dramatically,

07:23.576 --> 07:28.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no more one-state-at-a-time
campaigning; in
the next three weeks, a blitz of
states will

07:28.848 --> 07:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote. In fact, half of the
states in the country
will go to the polls between now
and March

07:33.853 --> 07:35.655 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
15.

07:35.689 --> 07:40.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's why Trump tackled
Virginia today, and
John Kasich was in Mississippi
and Louisiana.

07:40.493 --> 07:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Marco Rubio, who
placed second
in Nevada, plus third-place Ted
Cruz and fourth-place

07:46.299 --> 07:53.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ben Carson, they were all in
Texas, the crown
jewel of Super Tuesday, with 155
convention

07:53.506 --> 07:55.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
delegates.

07:55.308 --> 07:59.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For Lone Star Senator Cruz, it's
a must-win
state. And he's telling
supporters the stakes

07:59.579 --> 08:01.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
next Tuesday are high.

08:01.414 --> 08:05.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
This call from Texas to the
country, we have

08:05.118 --> 08:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six days to stand together and
say we will
not give up on our country, we
will not give

08:12.759 --> 08:16.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up on our freedoms, we will not
give up on
our children!

08:16.763 --> 08:18.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

08:18.665 --> 08:21.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Also, look
who's sitting
next to Cruz there, Texas
Governor Greg Abbott,

08:21.868 --> 08:23.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who endorsed him today.

08:23.670 --> 08:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. GREG ABBOTT (R), Texas:
Unlike far too
many in Washington, the Ted Cruz
we have seen

08:27.674 --> 08:31.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the Senate is the same Ted
Cruz we elected.

08:31.711 --> 08:35.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As Republicans
fan out, the
Democratic front-runner, Hillary
Clinton,

08:35.782 --> 08:41.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was in South Carolina focusing
on a theme,
African-American voters.
Democrats there vote

08:41.554 --> 08:43.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Saturday.

08:43.490 --> 08:47.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, she shook hands with
members of a social
justice group, and then spoke of
racial equity

08:47.227 --> 08:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a black sorority luncheon.
Clinton is also
using endorsements, like one
today from Senate

08:52.399 --> 08:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic Leader Harry Reid, to
argue that
she has momentum.

08:55.869 --> 08:59.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. HARRY REID (D-NV), Minority
Leader: I
think the middle class would be
better served

08:59.672 --> 09:01.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by Hillary.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Bernie Sanders
has a different
strategy. He started the day in
South Carolina

09:05.545 --> 09:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well. But he told reporters
he's already
looking past the Palmetto State.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
The nature of the world is that
we have got

09:12.385 --> 09:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go out to other states. I
think I'm leaving
for Oklahoma in a little while,
where we think

09:16.990 --> 09:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have a shot to win. We think
have a shot
to win in Massachusetts,
Colorado, Minnesota,

09:20.427 --> 09:22.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and in other states.

09:22.162 --> 09:25.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: From there,
Sanders flew
to Missouri, and Oklahoma, and
the bigger

09:25.632 --> 09:31.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Super Tuesday map. And so it is
for both sides.
As February melts away into
March, the 2016

09:31.938 --> 09:36.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
race has shifted into a
cross-country scramble
to stay alive.

09:36.042 --> 09:38.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

09:38.311 --> 09:43.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now we take a closer
look at two
key upcoming states, with Andy
Shain of The

09:43.850 --> 09:49.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State newspaper in Columbia,
South Carolina,
and in Houston, Texas, Abby
Livingston, the

09:49.222 --> 09:52.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington bureau chief for The
Texas Tribune.

09:52.091 --> 09:56.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andy Shain, what has been the
pitch that the
candidates have been making
heading into this

09:56.229 --> 09:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democratic primary in South
Carolina?

09:58.097 --> 10:03.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDY SHAIN, The State: Well,
both candidates
are trying to win over the
African-American

10:03.970 --> 10:05.705 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

10:05.738 --> 10:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They make up a majority of the
Democratic
voters here in South Carolina.
It's crucial

10:08.241 --> 10:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you are going to win here in
South Carolina.
And at this moment, Hillary
Clinton is doing

10:12.479 --> 10:18.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a much better job. She has been
winning over
African-Americans as part of an
effort that

10:18.251 --> 10:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's been doing for a number of
years now,
as she's built the ground work
for her campaign.

10:23.323 --> 10:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, of course, she was a major
factor in
the 2008 primary, where she
didn't beat Barack

10:29.162 --> 10:32.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama here in South Carolina.
But, of course,
those are relationships that she
was able

10:32.265 --> 10:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to carry over. Senator Sanders
has been working
very hard to try to win over
African-Americans,

10:38.004 --> 10:42.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
especially by visiting
African-American churches,
working with African-American
lawmakers. It

10:42.575 --> 10:44.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just hasn't made the inroads
that he was hoping.

10:44.344 --> 10:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In fact, today, he
had a press
conference. He didn't throw in
the towel,

10:48.781 --> 10:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but he sounded a little resigned
to the possible
outcome.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDY SHAIN: He has.

10:54.821 --> 10:59.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His pollster told our Jamie Self
yesterday
that he understands that he
doesn't want folks

10:59.993 --> 11:04.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look at the margins, because
it is going
to be fairly big. Right now,
Secretary Clinton

11:04.864 --> 11:09.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is leading by 28 points in the
most recent
polls. It's not looking good.

11:09.636 --> 11:13.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Sanders was here for the
news conference
today. And he said, "I'm not
giving up on

11:13.306 --> 11:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Carolina," and then he
flew off to the
Midwest to obviously look at
some Super Tuesday

11:18.411 --> 11:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states, where he is hoping to do
better.

11:19.779 --> 11:22.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's talk
about Super Tuesday,
Abby Livingston.

11:22.315 --> 11:26.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas is one of the jewels in
the crown that
everyone is waiting to see which
way it goes.

11:26.119 --> 11:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the Republican primary,
at least, it
has a home state favorite son,
as it were,

11:32.659 --> 11:36.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Ted Cruz, who today got the
governor's
endorsement, not a big surprise,
but certainly

11:36.829 --> 11:38.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a sign of things to come.

11:38.331 --> 11:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABBY LIVINGSTON, The Texas
Tribune: Absolutely.

11:40.767 --> 11:44.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz is definitely a native
son and he's
a favorite among the base voters
who will

11:44.170 --> 11:50.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show up in a Republican primary.
He ran a
brilliant 2012 Senate campaign.
He knows how

11:50.043 --> 11:54.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get the vote out. But the
problem for Ted
Cruz is, he can't just narrowly
win. And Donald

11:54.981 --> 11:59.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is coming in with a
headwind of momentum.
An Ted Cruz really has to run up
the delegate

11:59.786 --> 12:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
count to upset wins that Donald
Trump might
get elsewhere.

12:03.823 --> 12:08.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's -- we're not quite
sure. Cruz will
probably come out far ahead of
Trump, but

12:08.227 --> 12:09.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how much is the big question.

12:10.029 --> 12:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, so, Texas is a
big state,
I don't need to tell you. How
does campaigning

12:13.900 --> 12:19.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happen there, especially hard on
after these
other back-to-back-to back
primaries? Are

12:19.038 --> 12:22.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people all over the state?
Is it playing
out differently than we would
expect?

12:22.875 --> 12:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABBY LIVINGSTON: It's been very
quiet.

12:25.111 --> 12:29.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's almost as if Texas was is
in the back
of everyone's minds in these
political campaigns.

12:29.048 --> 12:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were just trying to survive
week to week.
And, suddenly, the juggernaut of
delegates

12:33.086 --> 12:34.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is upon these campaigns.

12:34.887 --> 12:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what they seem to be
doing, it is almost
too late to book television ads,
too late

12:38.758 --> 12:43.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to send direct mail. So,
instead, they are
blowing into these cities. A
bunch -- the

12:43.329 --> 12:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans are in town with the
Houston debate
tomorrow night, so they are
doing local appearances

12:47.266 --> 12:49.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here in Houston.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're going into Dallas,
which are the
two largest cities and the two
largest television

12:52.338 --> 12:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
markets. But beyond that, it's
fairly dormant.

12:54.340 --> 12:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's pop back to
South Carolina
and talk about the delegates.
We're talking

12:57.677 --> 13:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about proportional allocation of
the delegates
after the primary. Does that
mean that Bernie

13:02.248 --> 13:06.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders has a chance to walk
away without
his hands completely empty?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDY SHAIN: That's for sure.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, you have a majority of
the delegates
here in South Carolina that will
go to the

13:11.891 --> 13:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
winner, but you're going to have
three delegates
in each of our seven
congressional districts

13:15.862 --> 13:17.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are up for grabs.

13:17.664 --> 13:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Bernie is able to capture
at least
15 percent of the vote in any of
the congressional

13:23.670 --> 13:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
districts, he will be able to
walk away with
at least one delegate.

13:26.773 --> 13:30.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, he won't come away
empty-handed, but he
-- it doesn't look like he is
going to come

13:30.710 --> 13:32.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away with a large number of
delegates here.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And there is a
treasure trove
of delegates in Texas, Abby.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABBY LIVINGSTON: Absolutely.

13:38.051 --> 13:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's 155 on the Republican
side. Fifty-five
-- or about 57 of those are
awarded statewide.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Ted Cruz, if he could break
50 percent,
he might be able to walk away
with those,

13:46.626 --> 13:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but that is very unlikely.

13:48.461 --> 13:54.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The rest are three for
congressional districts.
And so this is a big, big state,
but it also

13:54.300 --> 13:58.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is feeling smaller in recent
days, as Donald
Trump has been winning in
multiple states.

13:58.471 --> 14:03.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
Donald Trump
effect, especially in Texas,
coming in after

14:03.576 --> 14:05.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this kind of momentum.

14:05.378 --> 14:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we saw him in the Nevada
caucuses come
out pretty strongly last night.
Is that when

14:10.650 --> 14:15.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people perk up and pay
attention, or is there
a way that things work in Texas
that maybe

14:15.555 --> 14:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
none of these candidates have
figured out
yet?

14:17.657 --> 14:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ABBY LIVINGSTON: Texas just
hasn't been that
relevant in primary campaigns.

14:21.794 --> 14:25.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're usually too late, and
we're pretty bitter
about it. And so, this time,
Texas is totally

14:25.832 --> 14:31.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relevant. And it's very much
like a national
campaign. There are 20 media
markets. Typically,

14:32.004 --> 14:35.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the past, when you run a
state campaign,
you get on a private plane, and
you bolt from

14:35.508 --> 14:37.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
place to place.

14:37.343 --> 14:41.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, here, they are just heading
up the local
markets in Dallas and Houston,
and just trying

14:41.848 --> 14:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make their case. Donald Trump
has a big
rally in Fort Worth, Texas, on
Friday, and

14:45.885 --> 14:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's competing with Marco Rubio
in Dallas.

14:48.321 --> 14:51.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's all pinned around
this debate
tomorrow night. And the rest are
bolting onto

14:51.924 --> 14:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other states and trying to
hit up the
rest of the March 1 primaries.

14:55.027 --> 14:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As we saw in Nevada,
for both
the Democrats and Republicans,
lots of conversation

14:58.831 --> 15:03.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the Latino vote. How big a
factor is
that in the Democratic primary
especially

15:03.503 --> 15:08.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- well, on the Republican
primaries? It doesn't
matter which primary in Texas.

15:08.474 --> 15:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABBY LIVINGSTON: Republicans say
that the
Latino vote is consequential,
that there are

15:12.612 --> 15:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plenty of Hispanics who are
business owners
and religiously conservative, so
there is

15:17.016 --> 15:18.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an appeal.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, boy, in the Democratic
primary, it's
powerful. Secretary Clinton
began her political

15:22.321 --> 15:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career in 1972 registering South
Texas voters.
And so they are certainly coming
back. They

15:27.827 --> 15:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are reminding all of their old
friends of
these relationships.

15:31.130 --> 15:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I was down in South Texas
last week. And
I started to sense some tremors
that the local

15:36.202 --> 15:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
colleges, some of the kids were
starting to
feel the Bern and were loving
Bernie Sanders.

15:39.872 --> 15:45.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's much like what we
are seeing play
out in South Carolina. You have
these voting

15:45.278 --> 15:49.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blocs that the Clintons are
trying to remind,
hey, we have been there you for
decades.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the kids are just starting
to revolt some.

15:51.517 --> 15:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, Andy Shain, in
South Carolina,
you are probably getting ready
for all these

15:54.387 --> 15:59.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ads to go off the air. But what
are voters
seeing and what are they saying
in their mailboxes,

15:59.458 --> 16:01.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on their radio and on
television?

16:01.928 --> 16:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDY SHAIN: Well, for the most
part, it's
been on television.

16:05.598 --> 16:10.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we are seeing mostly is
Hillary Clinton
ads at the moment. Between
Hillary Clinton

16:10.036 --> 16:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bernie Sanders, they have
spent about
-- this is of last week -- about
$1.5 million

16:14.740 --> 16:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here in the state. That's about
the same as
Donald -- what Donald Trump
spent. And he

16:17.977 --> 16:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was by -- he was way behind Jeb
Bush and Marco
Rubio and Ted Cruz.

16:22.381 --> 16:25.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, they haven't really
saturated the market
here, I think in part because of
just the

16:26.018 --> 16:28.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wide margin that Secretary
Clinton has held.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: OK.

16:30.256 --> 16:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Andy Shain of The State
newspaper in
Columbia, Abby Livingston of The
Texas Tribune,

16:33.926 --> 16:34.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have fun.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ABBY LIVINGSTON: Thank you for
having me.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDY SHAIN: Thank you.

16:38.130 --> 16:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And be sure to tune
in tomorrow
night for Judy Woodruff's
pre-primary report

16:41.601 --> 16:52.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from South Carolina.

16:53.012 --> 16:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separation of powers is at the
heart of American
democracy, and it seems the
powerful have

16:57.216 --> 16:59.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never been more separate.

16:59.218 --> 17:03.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, Republicans said they
will block
any nominee the president sends
for the Supreme

17:03.322 --> 17:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court. They have also rejected
outright his
plan to close the Guantanamo Bay
detention

17:08.494 --> 17:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center and refused earlier this
year to grant
even pro forma consideration to
his budget

17:13.866 --> 17:15.601 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
blueprint.

17:15.635 --> 17:19.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Against this backdrop of
resistance, the rise
of Republican front-runner
Donald Trump.

17:19.505 --> 17:25.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, how different, how
unprecedented, how
permanent is this growing split?

17:25.344 --> 17:29.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we turn to two authors
of books
about the political turning
point at hand.

17:29.615 --> 17:34.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
E.J. Dionne is a liberal
columnist for The
Washington Post, and the author
of "Why the

17:34.620 --> 17:39.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Right Went Wrong." And
conservative Matt Lewis
is a senior contributor for The
Daily Caller

17:39.525 --> 17:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and author of "Too Dumb to
Fail."

17:41.527 --> 17:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, thank you both for
joining us.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matt Lewis, what is happening,
if anything,
to the Republican party?

17:47.066 --> 17:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT K. LEWIS, The Daily Caller:
Well, I think,
with the rise of Donald Trump,
clearly, you

17:50.736 --> 17:52.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have a populist moment.

17:52.705 --> 17:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really do worry that we're
going to -- if
Donald Trump wins the
nomination, he will

17:57.476 --> 18:02.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
redefine what it means to be a
conservative,
what it means to be a
Republican. And no longer

18:02.882 --> 18:07.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will it be a party about ideas,
about free
markets, about defending the
unborn.

18:07.453 --> 18:13.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it instead will become a
white, identity
politics, angry, protectionist,
populist party.

18:13.826 --> 18:19.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that is a
radically different
direction and something that,
fingers crossed,

18:19.932 --> 18:21.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will not happen.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, E.J., given
what we have
seen unfold here in Washington
just in the

18:23.803 --> 18:26.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past few days, it seems like
it's about more
than Donald Trump.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE, Columnist, The
Washington Post:
Oh, absolutely.

18:28.774 --> 18:34.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think this is something that
has been happening
to conservatism over 50 years. I
mean, the

18:34.046 --> 18:39.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first sentence in my book is,
the history
of contemporary American
conservatism is a

18:39.418 --> 18:42.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story of disappointment and
betrayal.

18:42.121 --> 18:46.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think Republican
politicians have made
a series promises to their base
that they

18:46.892 --> 18:53.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
couldn't possibly keep, about
the rise -- about
shrinking government, about
rolling back cultural

18:53.232 --> 18:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change, changing the ethnic
makeup of the
country.

18:56.302 --> 19:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the base has gotten angrier
and angrier.
And I think that has led to
Donald Trump.

19:01.007 --> 19:06.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the leadership in
Congress has
had to take and has chosen to
take a harder

19:06.145 --> 19:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and harder line against a
Democratic president.

19:10.149 --> 19:15.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you can say, of course,
Democrats
have opposed presidential
nominees for the

19:15.955 --> 19:20.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court in the past, but I
think what
you have seen over the last few
weeks is really

19:20.292 --> 19:20.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unprecedented.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Well...

19:22.061 --> 19:25.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: We won't even hold
a hearing
on your nominee.

19:25.531 --> 19:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was a story in The Des
Moines Register
today that Chuck Grassley
wouldn't even meet

19:29.368 --> 19:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the president to talk about
a nominee.
At least that's where it was.
That really

19:34.440 --> 19:34.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
goes beyond.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:35.908 --> 19:37.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask Matt
Lewis about that.

19:37.643 --> 19:41.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this about conservatism
changing shape?
Is it about Republicanism
changing shape?

19:41.514 --> 19:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or is E.J. right? The Democrats
have always
done the same thing, or would if
they could.

19:46.485 --> 19:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT K. LEWIS: Yes, look, I
think there's
really two different things
happening here.

19:50.456 --> 19:56.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the Donald Trump
phenomenon is unique.
And I think that, really, Trump
is tapping

19:56.695 --> 20:03.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a -- more of a -- not a
Republican sort
of incremental change, but a
populist cyclical

20:03.202 --> 20:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
movement, from -- you know, from
Andrew Jackson,
to William Jennings Bryan, to
George Wallace,

20:08.774 --> 20:12.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Pat Buchanan, to Ross Perot,
and now to
Donald Trump.

20:12.445 --> 20:16.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that Trump is actually
appealing to
a lot of people who aren't
necessarily the

20:16.615 --> 20:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican base. In some cases,
they are liberal
or moderate-leaning Republicans,
or, in some

20:22.021 --> 20:25.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cases, what -- I guess what we
used to call
Reagan Democrats.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's different from
the phenomenon
that we are seeing with this
gridlock, which

20:28.661 --> 20:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think is a bipartisan problem,
but I think
is much more in keeping with the
Ted Cruz-ization

20:34.500 --> 20:35.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Republican Party.

20:35.367 --> 20:36.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:36.535 --> 20:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT K. LEWIS: If Ted Cruz were
the front-runner
today...

20:37.670 --> 20:39.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Go ahead, E.J.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT K. LEWIS: If Ted Cruz were
the front-runner
today, I think we could make
sort of more

20:42.374 --> 20:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a straight line between the
obstructionism
and the presidential race.

20:47.146 --> 20:48.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: E.J.?

20:48.981 --> 20:51.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: Yes, I agree with
Matt that there
is populism here, but I think it
is much more

20:51.884 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a part of the Republican Party
and something
Republicans have courted.

20:56.489 --> 20:59.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the points I make in the
book -- and
it is not just a liberal like me
saying this

20:59.959 --> 21:04.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- it's people like Ross
Douthat, the conservative
columnist for The New York
Times, or Reihan

21:04.096 --> 21:09.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Salam, a conservative
intellectual -- it's
that the Republican Party has
relied on white

21:09.301 --> 21:16.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working-class votes election
after election,
and has not delivered anything
to those voters.

21:16.242 --> 21:22.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think those voters in --
very much in
the Republican Party are sick of
being ignored.

21:22.815 --> 21:29.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so you have this odd
phenomenon of a billionaire
like Donald Trump leading a
class war inside

21:29.221 --> 21:30.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republican Party.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me try
this.

21:32.258 --> 21:38.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matt, is it possible that, on
resisting the
Guantanamo Bay plan, on
resisting the president's

21:38.631 --> 21:43.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insistence on sending a nominee
to the court,
on resisting his budget, that
perhaps that's

21:43.903 --> 21:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Senate Republicans are
doing, delivering
what they believe they are owed
-- or they

21:49.041 --> 21:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
owe to their constituencies?

21:50.809 --> 21:55.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT K. LEWIS: Well, now, look,
I guess I
should begin by saying, you
know, obviously,

21:55.714 --> 21:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can tell by the book "Too
Dumb to Fail"
that I'm more than comfortable
criticizing

21:59.718 --> 22:05.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans and conservatives
and the dumbing
down of conservatism. And I
certainly think

22:05.324 --> 22:10.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the shutting down of
government was a
stupid move that could never --
it was never

22:10.129 --> 22:12.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to defund Obamacare.

22:12.798 --> 22:18.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so -- but, having said that,
I am a conservative.
And I think that, although I
oppose Republican

22:18.604 --> 22:24.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stupid moves, I completely
understand, for
example, why they would want to
wait and see

22:24.276 --> 22:29.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if there is a new president
before changing
the court, for example, one of
the examples

22:29.481 --> 22:31.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of obstructionism.

22:31.617 --> 22:36.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it is in the eye of the
beholder. And,
really, frankly, I think they
are all hypocrites,

22:36.121 --> 22:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it is Chuck Schumer and
Barack Obama
and Joe Biden, or today Mitch
McConnell and

22:43.762 --> 22:50.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republicans. So, look, I
think that one
man's obstructionism is another
man's balance

22:50.903 --> 22:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of power, separation of power,
checks and
balances.

22:54.306 --> 22:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that, if you are a
Republican,
the smart move is to try to
obstruct right

22:58.544 --> 23:02.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now when it comes to changing
the face of
the court for a generation.

23:02.081 --> 23:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, OK, E.J., if
that's true,
if that is the smart move for
Republicans

23:05.884 --> 23:10.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now, what should the
Democrats be doing?
Does the president just sit back
and take

23:10.356 --> 23:14.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, or is there a way to push
back that actually
cuts through, or does he just
stay out of

23:14.860 --> 23:16.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the fight?

23:16.629 --> 23:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.J. DIONNE: Again, I just want
to emphasize
that, while I agree, obviously,
that both

23:20.499 --> 23:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parties can play politics and
don't want a
court to move far in one
direction or the

23:25.838 --> 23:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other, I really think that what
they are doing
now goes beyond what we saw in
the past.

23:29.308 --> 23:34.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it is a response to
conservative judicial
activism that gave us Citizens
United and

23:34.680 --> 23:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weakened the Voting Rights Act.
And I think,
because they have gone this far,
this gives

23:39.618 --> 23:44.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a real opening to Democrats,
because there
are a lot of Republicans running
for reelection

23:44.456 --> 23:50.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Senate from Democratic
states or purple
states, when look at states like
Illinois,

23:50.963 --> 23:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where Senator Kirk has already
said, oh, gee,
I don't want to do this, or you
look at Pennsylvania

23:55.801 --> 23:57.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or you look at Wisconsin.

23:57.569 --> 24:02.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the Democrats have ways
of really
turning this into an issue. And
I think the

24:02.574 --> 24:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more the president reaches out
to Republicans
and said, look, I would love to
talk to you

24:07.413 --> 24:13.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about whether we can find a
nominee who is
a middle-of-the-roader, and the
Republicans

24:13.452 --> 24:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refuse even to engage in those
conversations,
I think that is going to put the
Republicans

24:19.224 --> 24:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a very difficult spot.

24:21.026 --> 24:25.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Final thought, Matt
Lewis, not
your job, but what should the
Democrats do?

24:25.798 --> 24:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT K. LEWIS: Oh, what should
the Democrats
do?

24:28.567 --> 24:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would nominate somebody,
probably a minority
who is incredibly sympathetic,
who has a great

24:33.572 --> 24:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
biography, a great story to
tell. I would
let the Republicans refuse to
hold hearings,

24:39.011 --> 24:42.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
refuse to meet with this
sympathetic nominee.
Then I would demagogue the heck
out of it.

24:42.881 --> 24:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would win elections and I
would drive the
country farther apart, as I
think Barack Obama

24:48.687 --> 24:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will probably take my advice in
this case.

24:50.656 --> 24:55.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, there is a
nice cheerful
outcome of driving the country
further apart.

24:55.294 --> 24:59.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matt Lewis, the author of "Too
Dumb to Fail,"

24:59.331 --> 25:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

25:13.312 --> 25:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
Bush era NSA
and CIA director takes a hard
line on wiretapping,

25:20.486 --> 25:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water-boarding and rendition;
and why a former
Goldman Sachs executive wants to
overhaul

25:26.392 --> 25:28.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wall Street.

25:28.293 --> 25:33.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, first, for over a
half-a-century, the
United States has maintained a
large and diverse

25:33.699 --> 25:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear arsenal to deter other
countries from
even contemplating a nuclear
strike against

25:39.371 --> 25:41.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

25:41.240 --> 25:45.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, as the Pentagon embarks on
a wide-ranging,
and hugely expensive, plan to
modernize what's

25:45.177 --> 25:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
known as the triad, bombers,
submarines and
missiles, there are calls to
rethink whether

25:51.049 --> 25:52.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all three are needed.

25:52.951 --> 25:57.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Jamie
McIntyre has our
report, produced in partnership
with the Pulitzer

25:57.289 --> 25:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
center on Crisis Reporting.

25:59.825 --> 26:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Behind this
massive eight-ton
door 60 feet below the frozen
fields of North

26:05.831 --> 26:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dakota, a 27-year-old first
lieutenant heads
a two-person team with a
singular mission.

26:14.006 --> 26:22.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The two junior Air Force
officers are missileers
entrusted with executing the
most consequential

26:22.681 --> 26:30.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of presidential orders. At
almost the same
time, at nearby Minot Air Force
Base, a B-52

26:30.155 --> 26:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stratofortress that's been
flying for more
than half-a-century is drenched
with deicing

26:34.793 --> 26:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fluid. Its aging jet engines
roar to life
with the help of eight explosive
charges,

26:41.533 --> 26:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a method developed during the
Cold War to
give the bomber a quick
kick-start in a crisis.

26:49.541 --> 26:54.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the while, hundreds of feet
beneath the
Pacific Ocean, sailors aboard a
U.S. ballistic

26:54.279 --> 27:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missile submarine methodically
perform their
weekly doomsday drill, three
ways to do the

27:00.319 --> 27:05.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same thing, end the world as we
know it, by
launching nuclear weapons.

27:05.991 --> 27:07.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Weapons away.

27:07.926 --> 27:14.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Missiles,
bombers, subs, America's
nuclear triad, a three-pronged
approach to

27:14.333 --> 27:21.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deterrence that dates back to
the 1960s, when
the former Soviet Union was the
enemy, MAD,

27:21.306 --> 27:27.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mutual assured destruction, the
strategy,
and thermonuclear war seemed a
real possibility.

27:27.079 --> 27:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADM. CECIL HANEY, U.S. Strategic
Commander:
The real key here, as you look
at the combination

27:31.216 --> 27:37.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the triad, is making the
adversary's problem
very complex, very costly, so
that restraint

27:37.990 --> 27:39.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a better option.

27:39.825 --> 27:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: U.S. Strategic
Commander Cecil
Haney is the four-star admiral
in charge of

27:43.562 --> 27:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America's nuclear arsenal. He
says the triad
endures because it's still the
surest way

27:49.368 --> 27:54.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to guarantee that, even if hit
with a first
strike, plenty of U.S. nuclear
weapons would

27:54.940 --> 28:01.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survive, enough to allow Haney
to present
the president a full range of
options.

28:01.980 --> 28:10.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a strategy based on
redundancy, having
backups for backups. But to
critics, maintaining

28:10.689 --> 28:17.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and rebuilding all three legs of
the triad
in the 21st century amounts to
expensive overkill,

28:17.095 --> 28:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
among those critics, former
Defense Secretary
William Perry.

28:20.532 --> 28:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY, Former U.S.
Defense Secretary:
Well, you can have belts and
suspenders, and

28:23.135 --> 28:26.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then belts and suspenders for
the belts and
the and suspenders. And that is
what we are

28:26.705 --> 28:28.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
getting into here.

28:28.507 --> 28:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Perry says the
current strategy
is based on the folly of winning
a nuclear

28:32.578 --> 28:37.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conflict, the kind of Cold War
thinking caricatured
in the classic movie "Dr.
Strangelove."

28:37.783 --> 28:43.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Mr. President, I'm not
saying we wouldn't
get our hair mussed. But I do
say no more

28:43.555 --> 28:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than 10 to 20 million killed,
tops, depending
on the breaks.

28:46.892 --> 28:52.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY: The whole sort of
"Dr. Strangelove"
rationale that went with how you
use nuclear

28:52.464 --> 28:58.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
weapons, which was endemic to
the Cold War,
I don't think is in place today.
If we regard

28:58.103 --> 29:02.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear weapons, the role of
nuclear weapons
today, as preventing the use of
nuclear the

29:02.541 --> 29:04.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weapons against us, then all of
that goes
away.

29:04.743 --> 29:09.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: The United
States is at the
point where, to maintain the
safety and reliability

29:09.481 --> 29:17.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of its aging nuclear arsenal,
largely designed
in the 1950s and '60s, almost
everything needs

29:17.055 --> 29:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an upgrade. There are plans for
new submarines
and stealth bombers, along with
upgraded bombs

29:23.061 --> 29:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and missiles to go with them.

29:25.297 --> 29:32.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Add in the possibility of next
generation
land-based intercontinental
ballistic missiles,

29:32.204 --> 29:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ICBMs, and the price tag comes
to an eye-popping
$1 trillion over 30 years.
Despite the substantial

29:40.212 --> 29:45.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cost, trimming the triad is not
an issue that's
gotten any serious examination
on the presidential

29:45.784 --> 29:47.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign trail.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It did come up once in last
December's GOP
debate.

29:50.789 --> 29:54.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Of the three legs of
the triad,
though, do you have a priority?
I want to

29:54.359 --> 29:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go to Senator Rubio after that
and ask him.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I think -- I think, for me,
nuclear is just

29:57.996 --> 30:00.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the power, the devastation is
very important
to me.

30:00.499 --> 30:05.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: If Donald Trump
had an understanding
of the triad, he gave no hint,
and it fell

30:05.470 --> 30:07.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Marco Rubio to fill in the
gap.

30:07.339 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
The triad is our ability of the
United States

30:09.875 --> 30:14.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to conduct nuclear attacks using
airplanes,
using missiles launched from
silos or from

30:14.046 --> 30:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ground, and also from our
nuclear subs.

30:16.314 --> 30:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Each leg of the
triad has
its advantages. Submarines are
stealthy, virtually

30:22.888 --> 30:26.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
undetectable, and therefore
nearly invulnerable.

30:26.725 --> 30:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bombers are slow enough to be
recalled at
the last minute. It's the third
leg, the intercontinental

30:34.866 --> 30:38.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ballistic missiles, on
hair-trigger alert,
that are under the microscope.

30:38.804 --> 30:46.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're flying over the missile
field that essentially
surrounds Minot Air Force Base,
150 ICBMs

30:46.178 --> 30:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
buried in silos underground
spread across
8,500 square miles of North
Dakota.

30:52.050 --> 30:58.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just one of three missile
fields that
cover five states, Montana,
Wyoming, Nebraska,

30:58.490 --> 31:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colorado, and North Dakota, 450
ICBMs altogether.
Were it not for the security
fence, this silo

31:06.431 --> 31:12.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be barely visible in the
snow. But the
locals know where it is, and so
do America's

31:12.170 --> 31:16.208 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enemies.

31:16.241 --> 31:21.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having so many missiles in
fixed, known locations
makes them a tempting target if
an adversary

31:21.980 --> 31:27.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were to contemplate a first
strike, which
in turn, critics argue, creates
pressure to

31:27.085 --> 31:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
launch right away, at the first
sign of attack.

31:31.089 --> 31:35.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among those critics, no less
than former U.S.
Strategic Commander General
James Cartwright.

31:35.127 --> 31:38.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. JAMES CARTWRIGHT (RET.),
Former Vice
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs:
You have automatically

31:38.597 --> 31:45.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forced the president, in our
case, to make
a decision to use his weapons or
lose them.

31:45.504 --> 31:49.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't make a lot of
sense. Use or lose
doesn't contribute to
deterrence.

31:49.608 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Cartwright is
now chair of
studies at Global Zero, a
disarmament advocacy

31:55.147 --> 31:59.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organization. He thinks the day
of the ICBM
may have come and gone.

31:59.484 --> 32:04.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. JAMES CARTWRIGHT: I believe
that the
current ICBM structure, the way
it's based

32:04.523 --> 32:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the way it operates, is
probably not something
that we need to carry to the
future.

32:09.294 --> 32:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: Jim Miller was
undersecretary
of defense for policy during the
Obama administration,

32:14.666 --> 32:20.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and led the Pentagon's review of
nuclear weapons
policy. He argues that
land-based ICBMs are

32:20.739 --> 32:23.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a hedge against unforeseen
complications.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MILLER, Former U.S.
Undersecretary of
Defense for Policy: Without a
substantial

32:25.177 --> 32:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of ICBMs in the United
States, if we
had some problem, a technical
problem, or

32:31.183 --> 32:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a vulnerability because of any
submarine warfare
of potential adversary with our
submarines,

32:36.755 --> 32:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we'd be left with an adversary
having to undertake
an attack involving only a
handful of aim

32:41.827 --> 32:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points in order to take out a
deterrent.

32:43.728 --> 32:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: At Minot Air
Force Base, Colonel
Kelvin Townsend, vice commander
of the 91st

32:48.834 --> 32:54.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Missile Wing, stressed that
neither subs,
which have to be contacted at
sea, nor bombers,

32:54.105 --> 32:58.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which have to be put on alert
and fly to their
launch points, can match
land-based missiles

32:58.977 --> 33:00.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for speed of response.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COL. KELVIN TOWNSEND, Vice
Commander, 91st
Missile Wing: Anywhere on the
planet, we can

33:02.447 --> 33:07.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be within moment's notice. And
within roughly
30-plus minutes, we can be
there.

33:07.285 --> 33:12.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: But that quick
reaction time
makes the ICBM potentially the
most destabilizing

33:12.958 --> 33:16.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leg of the triad, argues former
Defense Secretary
William Perry:

33:16.795 --> 33:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY: If you're going
to blow up
the whole world, what is the
hurry? Why do

33:21.633 --> 33:28.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you mind waiting another 20
minutes to do
that? I don't see either the
common sense

33:28.240 --> 33:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or even the strategic argument
for doing that.

33:31.009 --> 33:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: And Perry says
no one has
found any reliable way to detect
or defeat

33:35.480 --> 33:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
submarines at sea. Bombers and
submarines
can do the job, he argues, with
a high degree

33:41.119 --> 33:42.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of confidence.

33:42.988 --> 33:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Air and Space Museum in
Washington,
Joe Cirincione gazes at a
Minuteman-III ICBM

33:48.960 --> 33:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on display. He's president of
the Ploughshares
Fund, which advocates deep cuts
in the U.S.

33:55.967 --> 34:01.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nuclear arsenal. He says
supporters of keeping
all three legs of the triad have
lost touch

34:01.973 --> 34:03.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the destructive power of
the weapons.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH CIRINCIONE, President,
Ploughshares
Fund: One nuclear weapon on one
city would

34:06.411 --> 34:12.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be a disaster that we haven't
seen since World
War II. Ten nuclear weapons on
10 cities would

34:12.417 --> 34:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be catastrophe beyond historical
experience.
And hundreds of weapons on
hundreds of cities

34:18.924 --> 34:22.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
could end human history
altogether. Why do
you need 5,000?

34:22.827 --> 34:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMIE MCINTYRE: For now, the
debate over the
triad is purely academic. The
latest Pentagon

34:28.433 --> 34:34.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
budget funds plans to begin
rebuilding all
three legs, and no one in
Congress is mounting

34:34.205 --> 34:37.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
any serious opposition.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jamie McIntyre.

34:39.744 --> 34:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's a lot more
online about
rebuilding America's triad. You
can see excerpts

34:45.350 --> 34:54.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of key interviews and view a
photo essay,
all that at PBS.org/NewsHour.

34:54.225 --> 35:06.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We move now from defense to
intelligence,
and how the country has changed
since the

35:06.071 --> 35:08.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attacks of September 11.

35:08.073 --> 35:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The privacy vs. security debate
has surfaced
again in the wake of the FBI's
appeal to tech

35:13.345 --> 35:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giant Apple to unlock an iPhone
that belonged
to one of the San Bernardino
shootings. And

35:19.050 --> 35:22.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is renewed campaign debate
over torture.

35:22.253 --> 35:27.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan has our
conversation with
one man who was at the center of
U.S. intelligence

35:27.459 --> 35:29.227 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Retired Air
Force General
Michael Hayden is the only
person to ever

35:31.963 --> 35:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
serve as both the director of
the CIA and
the head of the National
Security Agency.

35:37.002 --> 35:41.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His tenure at both agencies came
during a
critical period, as the U.S.
launched and

35:41.840 --> 35:44.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecuted the global war on
terror.

35:44.409 --> 35:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's just written a book about
his time in
government called "Playing to
the Edge."

35:48.046 --> 35:49.014 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He joins me now.

35:49.047 --> 35:50.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

35:50.415 --> 35:52.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN (RET.),
Former CIA Director:
Thank you, Hari.

35:52.150 --> 35:52.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, let's
start with some
things that are in the news
right now.

35:52.784 --> 35:53.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: Sure.

35:53.351 --> 35:55.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Sure.

35:55.320 --> 35:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, just earlier this week, the
administration
says the very existence of the
prison at Guantanamo

35:58.156 --> 36:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bay is a recruiting tool for our
enemy. You
can see it in the orange
jumpsuits that you

36:04.429 --> 36:07.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see in every horrible beheading
video that
ISIS produces. You agree?

36:07.399 --> 36:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: I don't
think it's a
powerful recruitment tool for
jihadism.

36:11.870 --> 36:17.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let me add one additional
thought. If
and when he brings these
prisoners to North

36:17.075 --> 36:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America, he's still going to
insist on indefinite
detention without trial for a
whole bunch

36:22.113 --> 36:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them. All he's done is moved
them from
a warm to a cold climate.

36:26.217 --> 36:30.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's still sticking to the
legal principle
that some other countries object
to that we

36:30.755 --> 36:34.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually can treat them as
prisoners of war
and keep them for the duration
of the conflict.

36:34.959 --> 36:36.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

36:36.761 --> 36:40.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other big story right now is
obviously
this tension between Apple and
the government.

36:40.265 --> 36:45.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this conversation, you have
said that you
come down on the side of Apple
more often

36:45.170 --> 36:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than not. In this specific case,
with this
specific device, you are on the
side of the

36:49.774 --> 36:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government in trying to open it
up. This is
the phone, of course, that was
used by the

36:52.811 --> 36:54.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attacker in San Bernardino.

36:54.579 --> 36:58.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You know, one of Apple's
arguments has been,
listen, this will set a
precedent, it will

36:58.817 --> 37:03.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
create a back door. And, sure
enough, there's
at least nine or 10 other cases
where Apple

37:03.188 --> 37:04.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is being asked to open up that
phone.

37:04.889 --> 37:06.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: Absolutely.

37:06.624 --> 37:09.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the U.S. attorney in
Manhattan says he
has got 175 of these instruments
sitting in

37:09.861 --> 37:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a room that he wants to be
reopened. So, in
this particular case, the
original ask from

37:15.733 --> 37:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the FBI, going back months now,
was some sort
of universal back door that
would allow them

37:21.172 --> 37:26.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get into Apple and other
companies' encrypted
devices.

37:26.244 --> 37:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frankly, Hari, I think American
safety, American
security -- put the privacy
argument aside,

37:33.384 --> 37:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is quite powerful. But I'm
a security
guy. I think American security
is better served

37:39.657 --> 37:42.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with end-to-end unbreakable
encryption.

37:42.894 --> 37:46.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I recognize that makes the
life of the
FBI more difficult, may even
make the life

37:46.898 --> 37:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of my old agency more difficult.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK.

37:50.668 --> 37:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking of tools, you have said
that enhanced
interrogation techniques, what
most American

37:54.772 --> 37:59.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would consider torture, worked.
In the case
of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, he
had been water-boarded

37:59.744 --> 38:04.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I want to get this right --
183 times,
kept awake for seven-and-a-half
days, been

38:04.215 --> 38:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in multiple stress positions.

38:05.917 --> 38:10.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a Senate report just a couple
of years
ago, it found that a lot of the
information

38:10.588 --> 38:14.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he gave us was either
misinformation or he
would confirm something after
the government

38:14.993 --> 38:17.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
showed him that, hey, we have
this from another
source already.

38:17.695 --> 38:21.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I'm wondering, why does
America still
need these techniques?

38:21.533 --> 38:24.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: Well, I
came to the agency
in '06, all right?

38:24.802 --> 38:29.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most of this was already
history. I could
have walked away from it. But I
studied the

38:29.908 --> 38:35.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program over the summer of '06.
And I detailed
kind of my personal journey in
this. And I

38:35.113 --> 38:40.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decided that -- and a lot of
things had changed.
We were safer. We knew about the
enemy more.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some laws had changed, all
right?

38:42.487 --> 38:47.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I was fairly willing to pull
the program
back. But I wasn't judging what
my predecessors

38:47.825 --> 38:54.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had done. And I wanted some form
of program
to go forward, so that the
president would

38:54.465 --> 38:56.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have that option.

38:56.267 --> 38:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You might not
judge your
predecessors, but the American
people certainly

38:58.903 --> 39:00.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do. Right?

39:00.805 --> 39:05.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you felt like were you on
solid legal footing,
why do this -- why do this in
renditions,

39:05.710 --> 39:12.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in black sites? Why destroy the
tapes of what
these events looked like?
Because that seems

39:12.250 --> 39:15.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like almost a tacit admission
that, guess
what, somebody back home isn't
going to think

39:15.954 --> 39:17.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
too highly of this.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: Well, what
I try to suggest
-- and actually point out in
some detail in

39:19.691 --> 39:24.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the book -- is, for example, the
U.S. policy
on renditions is the same under
this president

39:24.562 --> 39:27.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as it was under President Bush.
That hasn't
changed.

39:27.498 --> 39:32.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right? These were extreme
circumstances.
No one is arguing that this
should be a fast

39:32.503 --> 39:38.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or an easy decision. I tell the
story in the
book. Although I emptied the
sites in '06,

39:38.610 --> 39:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we kept them open. We wanted to
have the option
of using them.

39:41.846 --> 39:47.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I put two people in them. And I
relayed in
the story that I sat there with
the order

39:47.719 --> 39:52.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to authorize extended sleep
deprivation on
one of the detainees, Mohammad
Rahim, and

39:52.724 --> 39:54.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I never forgot he was a human
being.

39:54.492 --> 39:57.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: General, in a
recent op-ed
in The New York Times, which was
an excerpt

39:57.428 --> 40:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the book, you defended the
policy of drone
strikes.

40:02.233 --> 40:07.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you said in there that the
signature strikes
were thoroughly researched, and,
to use your

40:07.939 --> 40:12.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
words, 'Intelligence for
signature strikes
always had multiple threads and
deep history.

40:12.310 --> 40:14.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The data was near encyclopedic."

40:14.245 --> 40:19.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, interestingly enough, in
that same chapter,
you point out where you got the
wrong one-legged

40:19.284 --> 40:19.917 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guy.

40:19.951 --> 40:21.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: Right.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you had an
after-action
to figure out what went wrong.
Right?

40:23.421 --> 40:27.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the question on the
minds of a
lot of people is, what is our
actual ratio

40:27.091 --> 40:32.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of innocent bystanders or
collateral damage
to every person we have? We have
outside estimates

40:32.230 --> 40:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from the Investigative
Journalism Bureau and
other places that say that these
could be

40:36.134 --> 40:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the hundreds or thousands.

40:37.802 --> 40:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You say: Listen, based on the
intelligence
I have seen, that's not the
case.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: Yes.

40:42.940 --> 40:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But the irony
is, is that,
well, we're kind of left to fill
the vacuum

40:45.710 --> 40:47.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if that information never
actually becomes
public.

40:47.779 --> 40:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: No. Hari,
you are absolutely
right. And I regret that.

40:51.149 --> 40:55.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, I went to my
own limits,
playing to the edge, with what
it was I could

40:55.987 --> 41:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
write about. So, I fully admit
-- I think
I described the targeted killing
program as

41:00.892 --> 41:05.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
necessary, precise and
imperfect. All right?

41:05.730 --> 41:11.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I fully admit, and I
actually give examples
as you suggest where we actually
made mistakes.

41:11.602 --> 41:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we moved heaven and earth to
do the right
thing, to make sure we targeted
legitimate

41:17.108 --> 41:22.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
targets. And I actually say in
there, this
may be the most precise
application of firepower

41:22.580 --> 41:24.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the history of modern
conflict.

41:24.182 --> 41:28.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The underlying
question
also is, I guess, one of trust.

41:28.519 --> 41:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is just -- you have said
that, for example,
when you found out that the
Snowden revelations

41:34.092 --> 41:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were going to happen, that it
was going to
uncover the information
collection program

41:37.729 --> 41:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you helped set up at the
NSA, that, on
a personal level, you felt that
there was

41:41.999 --> 41:42.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a betrayal of trust.

41:42.934 --> 41:44.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: Right.

41:44.736 --> 41:47.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You can
understand then
how perhaps the country would
feel betrayed

41:47.438 --> 41:50.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that one of our liberties was
being taken
away by our own government.

41:50.675 --> 41:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: If I'm out
there working
for an agency, and if I have got
the president

41:55.546 --> 42:00.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to authorize it, and Congress to
legislate
it or oversee it, and the courts
to perform

42:00.952 --> 42:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their functions when the law
requires, I think
I have got the Madisonian
trifecta. This is

42:05.723 --> 42:09.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really important. The political
culture has
shifted underneath us, all
right?

42:09.994 --> 42:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of good Americans, not
just ones
wearing tinfoil on their heads,
if you understand

42:14.165 --> 42:18.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what I mean, very serious,
thinking Americans
are now looking at that and
saying, in today's

42:19.003 --> 42:23.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political culture, what you just
described,
Hayden, is no longer consent of
the governed.

42:23.908 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That is consent of the
governors. You may
have told them, but you didn't
tell me.

42:28.813 --> 42:35.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, now we have what is
unarguably an existential
question for American espionage.
How will

42:35.319 --> 42:41.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we be able to conduct espionage
in the future,
inside a broader political
culture that demands

42:41.092 --> 42:46.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more transparency and more
public accountability
from every aspect of national
life?

42:46.531 --> 42:53.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a fundamental question.
And one final
point. We, the spy guys, have to
accommodate

42:53.971 --> 42:56.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to the broader political
culture, not the
other way around.

42:56.674 --> 42:58.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: General
Michael Hayden.

42:58.309 --> 43:00.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The book is called "Playing to
the Edge."

43:00.178 --> 43:01.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks so much for joining us.

43:02.013 --> 43:08.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEN. MICHAEL HAYDEN: Thank you.

43:08.719 --> 43:15.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now to another
reignited debate,
this one about the role and size
of the country's

43:15.726 --> 43:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
big banks, Wall Street, and
accountability.

43:18.963 --> 43:22.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's been playing out
periodically in the
presidential campaign, and is
once again a

43:22.967 --> 43:26.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
subject of attention and debate
in the world
of finance.

43:26.204 --> 43:30.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we start a series of
occasional conversations
on the subject.

43:30.541 --> 43:32.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our first.

43:32.410 --> 43:36.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Last week came a
strong argument
that -- quote -- "The biggest
banks continue

43:36.681 --> 43:39.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pose a significant, ongoing
risk to our
economy."

43:40.017 --> 43:42.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it came from an unusual
source.

43:42.453 --> 43:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Neel Kashkari is a former
investment banker.
He started his career at Goldman
Sachs, then

43:47.124 --> 43:52.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
joined the Bush Treasury
Department in 2006,
later serving as a key player in
the government's

43:52.296 --> 43:57.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
response to the financial crisis
as administrator
of the TARP program, which
helped bail out

43:57.101 --> 43:58.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the big banks.

43:58.836 --> 44:03.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2014, he ran for governor of
California
as a Republican, losing to
incumbent Jerry

44:03.307 --> 44:08.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brown. He's now president of the
Federal Reserve
Bank of Minneapolis, and joins
us now.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

44:10.081 --> 44:14.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, still too big to fail,
you're saying.
This is in spite of Dodd-Frank,
in spite of

44:14.151 --> 44:18.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all we have seen. You are
suggesting a crisis
could still happen and big banks
would still

44:18.856 --> 44:20.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need bailing out?

44:20.725 --> 44:22.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEEL KASHKARI, President,
Federal Reserve
Bank of Minneapolis: Yes.
Unfortunately, that's

44:22.360 --> 44:24.161 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
true.

44:24.195 --> 44:26.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dodd-Frank has made a lot of
progress. The
banks are stronger. They have
more capital,

44:26.998 --> 44:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so they can withstand bad things
happening.
But if something -- if a big
shock were to

44:31.602 --> 44:35.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hit the U.S. economy, I'm afraid
that the
taxpayers would likely still
have to step

44:35.740 --> 44:37.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in and bail out the banks.

44:37.909 --> 44:42.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In my view, based on my
experience during
the crisis, we have not yet
solved the too-big-to-fail

44:42.613 --> 44:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
problem. And we do need to.

44:44.415 --> 44:47.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And so things
like the stress
test, you have already had some
people push

44:47.518 --> 44:52.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back at your critique, stress
test and others
things. You're just -- you don't
think those

44:52.223 --> 44:54.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are strong enough; you don't
trust them?

44:54.258 --> 44:56.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEEL KASHKARI: Well, here's the
thing.

44:56.460 --> 45:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The crisis in 2008 was so
devastating for
the U.S. economy, millions of
jobs were lost,

45:02.199 --> 45:06.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tens of trillions of dollars of
wealth was
destroyed by that terrible
crisis. I think

45:06.504 --> 45:09.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we all agree that we never want
to have that
happen again.

45:09.307 --> 45:13.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we need to be able to allow
banks to run
into trouble without bringing
down the whole

45:13.744 --> 45:19.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. economy. If you remember
the tech bubble
in the 1990s, it was a big boom
and then it

45:19.717 --> 45:24.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crashed. That was painful for
Silicon Valley,
but it didn't risk the whole
U.S. economy.

45:24.121 --> 45:27.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We need to make sure our
financial system
is that strong, so that it can
withstand the

45:27.858 --> 45:29.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shock without hurting the rest
of us.

45:29.961 --> 45:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just to be clear,
how serious
or how dire is the situation? Is
the financial

45:36.033 --> 45:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system at risk now? Is that what
you are suggesting?

45:39.403 --> 45:44.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEEL KASHKARI: No, I think the
financial system
is strong right now. But the key
is, now is

45:44.141 --> 45:49.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the time, when it's strong, for
us to make
these big transformational
changes, so that

45:49.280 --> 45:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10 years from now or 20 or 30
years from now,
we don't have another crisis.

45:53.651 --> 45:57.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, as a society, we tend
to repeat
the same mistakes. A lot of
mistakes that

45:57.722 --> 46:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
led to the Great Depression, we
repeated in
2000 -- in the 2000s, leading to
the great

46:02.326 --> 46:06.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crash. And so we need to make
sure that we
make the changes now, so that 20
or 30 years

46:07.031 --> 46:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from now, we're not back in the
same situation.

46:09.000 --> 46:12.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, in the
options that you
laid out in a speech last week,
option number

46:12.470 --> 46:16.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
one was break -- was the
straightforward break
up the big banks.

46:16.107 --> 46:22.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, how would you do that? How
do you decide
what is big? And why, for
example, would 10

46:22.780 --> 46:26.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moderate-sized banks be less
dangerous than
five big ones?

46:26.817 --> 46:28.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEEL KASHKARI: Sure.

46:28.586 --> 46:31.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, what we're doing in
Minneapolis is,
we're bringing experts together
from around

46:31.589 --> 46:35.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country who have different
proposals for
how to solve too big to fail.
So, we haven't

46:35.760 --> 46:40.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picked which one we think is
best yet. We
want to bring the experts in,
analyze their

46:40.331 --> 46:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
proposals, and come out with our
recommendations
at the end of the year.

46:43.501 --> 46:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But look at the -- in the 1980s,
roughly 1,000
Savings &amp; Loans failed in the
S&amp;L crisis.

46:48.906 --> 46:53.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, that was devastating for
those communities
and for those banks, but it
didn't risk an

46:53.644 --> 46:59.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
entire nationwide economic
collapse. So, there
is a precedent of having smaller
banks, they

46:59.850 --> 47:03.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might make similar mistakes
without bringing
down the whole economy.

47:03.554 --> 47:07.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We want to analyze these
objectively and figure
out what's the right solution
and how do we

47:07.792 --> 47:09.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go forward.

47:09.727 --> 47:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As you know, a
number of bankers
in the past and even after you
gave your talk,

47:12.897 --> 47:17.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have said that bigger is in
some ways
better, right, that they can
offer more services,

47:17.234 --> 47:22.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that if U.S. banks were not
allowed to be
so big, international banks,
China and elsewhere,

47:22.073 --> 47:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would swoop in and take the
business.

47:24.041 --> 47:28.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEEL KASHKARI: Well, you know,
if other countries
want to take huge risks with
their financial

47:28.646 --> 47:33.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systems, we can't stop them. My
view is, we
should do what's right for the
United States,

47:33.551 --> 47:37.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come up with one set of rules
for any bank
that wants to do business here,
and then enforce

47:37.688 --> 47:39.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
those rules evenly.

47:39.490 --> 47:44.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, hopefully, we can lead the
rest of the
world to follow our path, follow
our example.

47:44.395 --> 47:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to address this. It's
not only American
banks that are too big to fail.
As you indicated,

47:48.699 --> 47:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are some banks outside the
U.S. too.
But it's time for us to show
leadership on

47:52.503 --> 47:54.371 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this issue.

47:54.405 --> 47:58.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I read your
speech. You did
not suggest or propose bringing
back Glass-Steagall.

47:58.576 --> 48:04.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder why not. Why not go
farther to once
again separate commercial
banking from investment

48:04.482 --> 48:06.283 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
banking?

48:06.317 --> 48:09.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEEL KASHKARI: You know, I don't
have a strong
opposition to bringing back
Glass-Steagall.

48:09.954 --> 48:14.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just know, based on the crisis
that we just
went through, it really wasn't
the combination

48:14.258 --> 48:18.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of investment banking and
commercial banking
that triggered that crisis. It
was the fact

48:18.462 --> 48:23.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a lot of banks made a lot
of bad loans.
It was plain vanilla lending
that went off

48:23.801 --> 48:25.603 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
course.

48:25.636 --> 48:28.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we need to make sure our
banking system
and non-banks, our insurance
companies, et

48:28.973 --> 48:32.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cetera, that they are all safe
and secure
and that they can't risk
bringing down the

48:32.710 --> 48:34.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whole U.S. economy.

48:34.512 --> 48:39.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you know, in 2008, AIG, one
of the largest
insurance companies, that became
a systemic

48:39.583 --> 48:44.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
risk that almost brought us
down, and it required
a taxpayer bailout. I think we
all agree we

48:44.355 --> 48:46.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never want to do that again.

48:46.157 --> 48:49.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm proposing, let's take
action now to
make sure we're never in that
situation.

48:49.393 --> 48:53.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And let me just
ask you, when
you made this speech and got a
lot of attention

48:54.031 --> 48:59.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last week, a lot of the focus
was on the messenger,
an unlikely messenger, a lot of
people thought,

48:59.270 --> 49:04.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a former banker now telling us
the banks are
too big, a former regulator
telling us that

49:04.375 --> 49:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essentially regulators are not
able, even
now, to act in a way that still
might hurt

49:10.581 --> 49:13.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the economy, still might have to
bail out
the banks.

49:13.884 --> 49:18.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A reformed -- a reform person,
what -- how
do you describe yourself? How
are we to see

49:18.856 --> 49:19.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this?

49:19.924 --> 49:22.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEEL KASHKARI: Well, I am an
experienced person.

49:22.092 --> 49:27.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was a strong free market
ideologue going
into Washington. Then we all
lived through

49:27.765 --> 49:32.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the terrible economic crisis.
And I think
I learned humility about markets
can make

49:32.870 --> 49:35.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mistakes. Regulators are not
omniscient.

49:35.039 --> 49:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I asked people, I said, did you
predict that
the price of oil would drop from
$150 to $30?

49:40.477 --> 49:44.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't see it. There are a lot
of things
that can happen in the world
economy that

49:44.381 --> 49:47.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're not going to be able to
predict. So,
we need to make sure that our
financial system

49:47.952 --> 49:53.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is robust, so that if those
things happen,
the system can be strong and not
require taxpayer

49:53.190 --> 49:56.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bailouts, and not cause
devastation to the
American people.

49:56.293 --> 49:59.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Neel Kashkari,
thank you so
much.

GWEN IFILL: Tune in later
tonight on PBS for
a documentary focusing on the
massive amount

50:15.746 --> 50:19.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of digital data that we record
every day.

50:19.083 --> 50:24.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The human face of big data looks
at the indelible
digital trail we all leave
behind and explores

50:24.955 --> 50:30.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how it can be used to address
some of our
biggest challenges, hunger,
pollution, disaster

50:30.427 --> 50:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
response and health. But it
turns out it can
also help us understand how
babies learn words.

50:36.400 --> 50:43.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEB ROY, MIT: At MIT, Deb Roy
and his colleagues
wanted to see if they could
understand how

50:43.507 --> 50:46.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
children acquire language.

50:47.011 --> 50:51.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we realized that no one
really knew, for
a simple reason. There was no
data.

50:51.148 --> 50:55.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: After he and his wife,
Rupal, brought
their newborn son home from the
hospital,

50:55.753 --> 50:59.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they did what every parent would
do, mount
a camera in the ceiling of each
room in their

50:59.990 --> 51:05.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home and record every moment of
their lives
for two years, a mere 200
gigabytes of data

51:05.596 --> 51:07.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
recorded every day.

51:07.598 --> 51:15.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DEB ROY: We ended up
transcribing somewhere
between eight and nine million
words of speech.

51:15.306 --> 51:23.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as soon as we had that, we
could go and
identify the exact moment where
my son first

51:23.113 --> 51:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said a new word. We started
calling them births.
We took this idea of a word
birth, and we

51:34.091 --> 51:39.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started thinking about, why
don't we trace
back in time and look at the
gestation period

51:39.063 --> 51:42.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for that word?

51:42.333 --> 51:49.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One example of this was water.
So, we looked
at every time my son heard the
word water,

51:49.173 --> 51:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what was happening? Where in the
house were
they? How were they moving
about? And using

51:55.579 --> 52:01.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that visual information to
capture something
about the context within which
the words are

52:01.719 --> 52:03.520 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
used.

52:03.554 --> 52:08.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We call them wordscapes. Then we
could ask
the question, how does the
wordscape associated

52:08.058 --> 52:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the word predict when my
son will actually
start using that word?

52:12.896 --> 52:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: What they learned from
watching
Deb's son was that the texture
of the wordscapes

52:17.401 --> 52:22.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had predictive power. If most of
the previous
research had indicated that the
way language

52:22.473 --> 52:27.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was learned was through
repetition, then this
analysis of the data showed that
it wasn't

52:27.311 --> 52:31.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
actually repetition that
generated learning,
but context.

52:31.615 --> 52:36.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Words with more distinct
wordscapes, that
is words heard in many varied
locations, would

52:36.653 --> 52:38.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be learned first.

52:38.522 --> 52:43.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's kind of
fascinating. "Big
