Summit -- what they agreed to

00:22.256 --> 00:25.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the issues that
still divide them.

00:25.692 --> 00:31.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: a young black man's

Man's Education": Walking
through racism is important, but
how are we dealing with talking

00:36.069 --> 00:41.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about patriarchy and misogyny
and homophobia and class race
elitism and mental illness?

00:41.008 --> 00:43.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not including these things
in the narrative around young
black men.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All that and more

01:08.302 --> 01:10.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to win the White House.

01:10.504 --> 01:14.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LISA DESJARDINS: Labor Day in

curb-to-curb union members,
lines of trucks,

01:21.114 --> 01:25.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and one retired worker, former
President Bill Clinton.

01:25.485 --> 01:30.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A holiday for most Americans,
today marks crunch time for
candidates.

01:30.390 --> 01:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
hit the trail, as did their
surrogates, spread out in key

01:33.860 --> 01:36.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

01:36.363 --> 01:40.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump was swamped at a
Youngstown, Ohio, fair, pulling
out a bullhorn at one point.

01:40.467 --> 01:43.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: We're going to bring
jobs back to Ohio.

01:43.704 --> 01:46.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to bring jobs
back to our country.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not going to make these
horrible trade deals anymore.

01:50.310 --> 01:53.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: While for
Clinton, something recently
rare, a short chat with the
press

01:53.180 --> 01:55.949 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
corps.

01:55.949 --> 01:56.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: Last
moments before the mad dash for
the next

01:56.850 --> 02:00.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
two months, so I hope
you guys are ready.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton and her
new plane were on the way to
Cleveland, where she stressed

02:02.589 --> 02:05.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her message on labor
and the economy.

02:05.625 --> 02:11.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: This is
the kind of difference that this
election really poses,

02:11.865 --> 02:18.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people like Tim and me who want
to create more good jobs with
rising wages and benefits

02:18.305 --> 02:24.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for everybody willing to work
hard, and somebody who stiffed
people, took bankruptcy and laid

02:24.311 --> 02:26.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
off people.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of his bankruptcies put
1,000 people out of work.

02:29.383 --> 02:32.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The fight for
Ohio meant a fight for space on
the Cleveland tarmac

02:32.019 --> 02:34.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

02:34.287 --> 02:38.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right next to Clinton's campaign
plane, sure enough, that's
Donald Trump's.

02:38.258 --> 02:42.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was also making his own
pitch to Cleveland workers.

02:42.429 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Our country, in
terms of manufacturing, in terms
of jobs, is going to hell.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's going to hell.

02:49.269 --> 02:52.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our jobs are being taken
out of our system.

02:52.606 --> 02:55.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton would
be a disaster.

02:55.675 --> 02:59.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Outside of Ohio
was left to candidates'
supporters, like Vermont Senator

02:59.913 --> 03:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, the former
Clinton opponent now promoting
her to workers.

SEN.

03:05.519 --> 03:09.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont:
Hillary Clinton understands that
the $7.25 minimum wage is

03:09.356 --> 03:11.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a starvation wage.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It must be raised
to a living wage.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

LISA DESJARDINS: In

Presidential Candidate: Hey,
Pittsburgh.

03:21.568 --> 03:23.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How you guys doing?

03:23.970 --> 03:26.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And the man
Kaine a hopes to replace, Vice
President Biden, on the day's

03:26.306 --> 03:28.742 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
theme.

03:28.742 --> 03:28.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United States: Does anybody
think there would be

03:28.942 --> 03:32.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a minimum wage without
union workers?

03:32.712 --> 03:37.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump and his
choice for V.P. spent the major
campaign day traveling

03:37.551 --> 03:40.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Trump plane together,
where the nominee made it clear
he will be at all three
presidential

03:40.887 --> 03:42.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debates.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Are you doing
a lot of prep work?

03:44.458 --> 03:45.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm doing some.

03:45.826 --> 03:48.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm doing some.

03:48.361 --> 03:51.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen people do so much
prep work that, when they get
out there, they can't speak.

03:51.031 --> 03:52.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have seen that.

03:52.599 --> 03:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Do you plan
to have -- I'm sorry.

03:53.900 --> 03:54.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Do you plan to have mock
sessions where someone does play
her?

03:54.835 --> 03:55.936 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
DONALD TRUMP: I
hadn't planned on it.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I never did it before.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That crucial
first debate comes in three
weeks.

04:01.741 --> 04:06.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Until then, as they did today in
Michigan, Virginia, Pennsylvania
and New Hampshire,

04:06.313 --> 04:11.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the two campaigns plan a
frenzied focus on just a few key
states.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

04:14.554 --> 04:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Late this afternoon,
Hillary Clinton says she's
concerned about reports in The

04:19.392 --> 04:25.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington Post and elsewhere of
Russian cyber-attempts to
interfere with the election.

04:25.298 --> 04:28.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news, the
Group of 20 major economies
wound up their week-long summit

04:28.335 --> 04:30.570 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in China.

04:30.570 --> 04:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The leaders failed to set limits
on a glut of cheap Chinese steel
exports.

04:35.942 --> 04:39.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a much-anticipated climate
change announcement, and
meetings between world leaders
on the

04:39.579 --> 04:41.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sidelines, highlighted
the gathering.

04:41.615 --> 04:45.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have a full report
after the news summary.

04:45.352 --> 04:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the G20 Summit, President
Obama and Russian President
Vladimir Putin failed to reach a

04:49.756 --> 04:53.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deal on a cease-fire in Syria.

04:53.660 --> 04:57.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That came as ISIS claimed
responsibility for a series of
attacks across Syria.

04:57.531 --> 05:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At least 48 people were killed.

05:00.500 --> 05:05.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attacks included six suicide
bombings and a remote-controlled
bomb.

05:05.138 --> 05:08.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They all happened during
the morning rush hour.

05:08.041 --> 05:13.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, at least 24 people
died in twin bombings in
Afghanistan.

05:13.246 --> 05:18.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Taliban said it carried out
the attacks near the Defense
Ministry in Kabul.

05:18.752 --> 05:24.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first blast hit a crowded
area near a government building,
a market and a main
intersection.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second blast struck as
authorities responded to the
first.

05:27.961 --> 05:34.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): When
the first explosion happened,
people crowded near the site.

05:34.134 --> 05:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the second blast
occurred, which was really
powerful and killed lots of
people,

05:37.571 --> 05:39.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including workers,
women and children.

05:39.706 --> 05:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All those killed were poor
people and breadwinners of their
families.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All innocent people
were killed here.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Two of the
dead were generals.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
More than 90 others
were wounded.

05:49.716 --> 05:54.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea has fired off three
more medium-range ballistic
missiles.

05:54.788 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were launched about 30
miles south of Pyongyang, flew
more than 600 miles, and landed

05:59.459 --> 06:02.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Japanese waters.

06:02.229 --> 06:05.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The United States, Japan and
others condemned the tests.

06:05.765 --> 06:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.N. Security Council said
it will discuss the situation
tomorrow.

06:10.737 --> 06:16.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tropical storm system Hermine
slowly whirled up the U.S.
Eastern Seaboard today, staying

06:16.009 --> 06:19.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
offshore, but chasing
people off the beaches.

06:19.579 --> 06:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The storm kicked up waves up to
20-feet high and rip currents
from New York to Cape Cod.

06:25.518 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The storm had winds of 70 miles
an hour, but it's expected to
weaken.

Nurses went on strike today at
five hospitals in Minnesota.

06:33.827 --> 06:38.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're striking over health
insurance, workplace safety and
staffing.

06:38.365 --> 06:43.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Minnesota Nurses Association
represents about 4,800 members.

06:43.470 --> 06:48.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It called the strike after a
22-hour bargaining session ended
Saturday without an agreement.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And some good news
for the giant panda.

06:51.811 --> 06:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A group that tracks animal
populations says it's no longer
endangered.

The International Union for
Conservation of Nature says
giant panda numbers rose 17
percent

07:02.722 --> 07:06.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the last 10 years
to nearly 1,900.

07:06.926 --> 07:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's thanks to stepped-up
protections by China.

07:11.264 --> 07:16.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the major agreements and
disagreements from the G20

07:16.036 --> 07:21.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
summit; the role of labor unions
in today's politics; a Web
series that lets Israelis

07:21.174 --> 07:37.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Palestinians say exactly
what they think; and much more.

07:37.190 --> 07:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama is on his final
trip to Asia as president.

07:41.127 --> 07:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His first stop was in China to
meet with leaders of the world's
20 largest economies.

07:45.632 --> 07:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

has just concluded
with great success.

07:55.408 --> 07:59.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The

President Xi Jinping, closed the
proceedings

07:59.446 --> 08:03.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
praising the leaders for
commitments to free trade and
economic growth.

08:03.917 --> 08:09.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on the major issue of
China's glut of steel
production, Xi made only limited
concessions.

08:09.956 --> 08:15.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He agreed to greater cooperation
on the problem, but not to any
binding limits on steel exports.

08:15.261 --> 08:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. and Europe say cheap
Chinese steel has cost jobs
worldwide.

08:19.866 --> 08:23.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama said today it
will take time to get concrete
gains on the issue.

08:23.036 --> 08:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: It was one of a
number of examples that aren't

08:27.006 --> 08:32.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always sexy and don't attract a
lot of headlines of where issues
that we have raised in the

08:32.645 --> 08:38.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
G20 get adopted and then a bunch
of work gets done, and the
following year, you start seeing

08:38.518 --> 08:44.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
action, and slowly we strengthen
and build up international
norms.

08:44.557 --> 08:47.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The conflict
in Syria was also addressed this
weekend, but, again, with

08:47.794 --> 08:50.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
little to show for it.

08:50.497 --> 08:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama met with Russian
President Vladimir Putin for 90
minutes.

08:54.567 --> 08:58.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They talked about possible
military cooperation and a
lasting cease-fire between the
Russian-backed

08:58.338 --> 09:01.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Syrian government and
U.S.-backed rebels.

09:01.641 --> 09:05.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he said later that a number
of sticking points remained, and
he suggested he's skeptical

09:05.745 --> 09:08.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Russia would uphold
its end of any bargain.

09:08.782 --> 09:16.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Given the gaps of
trust that exist, that's a tough
negotiation.

09:16.523 --> 09:22.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we haven't yet closed the
gaps in a way where we think it
would actually work.

09:22.495 --> 09:25.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For his part,
Putin sounded much more
optimistic.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
I have grounds to believe that

09:28.935 --> 09:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the agreements will be reached
in the next few days.

09:32.305 --> 09:35.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One
headline-making moment from the
weekend came from the sidelines
of

09:35.408 --> 09:39.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the G20 on the issue
of climate change.

09:39.879 --> 09:43.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama and Chinese
President Xi announced Saturday
their governments will formally
join

09:43.082 --> 09:47.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
last year's landmark
Paris agreement.

09:47.320 --> 09:52.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sets up a framework for
dozens of nations to reduce
greenhouse gases in the coming
decades.

09:52.158 --> 09:55.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president said the U.S. and
China standing together on the
issue sends a clear message

09:55.395 --> 09:57.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the world.

09:57.831 --> 10:01.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Our entrance into
this agreement continues the
momentum of Paris and should

10:01.901 --> 10:07.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
give the rest of the world
confidence, whether developed or
developing countries, that a

10:07.607 --> 10:10.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
low-carbon future is where
the world is heading.

10:10.844 --> 10:14.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With the G20
now over, Obama flew on to Laos
today for a summit with South

10:14.180 --> 10:16.850 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Asian leaders.

10:16.850 --> 10:20.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had planned to meet there
with the Philippines' new
president, Rodrigo Duterte.

10:20.887 --> 10:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, today, Duterte angrily
warned he won't discuss
widespread killings of drug
suspects,

10:25.825 --> 10:28.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he aimed a profanity
at Mr. Obama.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODRIGO DUTERTE, Philippine
President (through translator):
Son of a (EXPLETIVE DELETED),

10:29.729 --> 10:32.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I will swear at you
in that forum.

10:32.398 --> 10:36.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hours after
hearing that, President Obama
his planned meeting with
Duterte.

10:36.069 --> 10:40.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president will be
in Laos until Thursday.

10:40.673 --> 10:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on what happened during
the G20, and what's to come for
the rest of the president's

10:42.976 --> 10:46.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
trip to Asia, we turn
to Edward Alden.

10:46.713 --> 10:49.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations,
where he focuses on U.S. trade

10:49.048 --> 10:51.251 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And David Ignatius, foreign
policy columnist at The
Washington Post.

10:53.553 --> 10:55.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gentlemen, thank you both
very much for being here.

10:55.622 --> 10:58.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David, I would start with you.

10:58.057 --> 11:00.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You watched what went
down this weekend.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What was your take
on what happened?

11:02.328 --> 11:05.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS, Columnist, The
Washington Post: I think,
basically, in terms of bilateral

11:05.765 --> 11:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S.-China relations, this was a
reinforcement of the pattern
that we have seen for the last

11:09.769 --> 11:12.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
couple of years.

11:12.272 --> 11:17.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. and China work together
on issues of mutual interest.

11:17.210 --> 11:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Climate change has been the
obvious example since 2014.

11:21.347 --> 11:27.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They did a significant step
forward in agreeing to enter the
Paris pact on climate change.

11:27.320 --> 11:31.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was the headline
achievement of the summit.

11:31.758 --> 11:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on so many other issues
where they are not in synch, the
South China Sea most obviously,

11:38.231 --> 11:43.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but just the kind of prickly of
the U.S.-China relationship,
this whole fracas about when

11:43.069 --> 11:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's plane landed
about who would get off by what
ramp -- why, ramp gate, I

11:48.875 --> 11:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was thinking they should call
this -- it's obvious that there
is just a lot of distance

11:52.912 --> 11:55.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
between the two.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that's a snapshot of
where the relationship is, as
Barack Obama's presidency

11:57.884 --> 12:00.486 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ends.

12:00.486 --> 12:03.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Edward Alden,
I know this -- we touched on
this briefly in the beginning,

12:03.489 --> 12:06.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the issue of this deal.

12:06.025 --> 12:09.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Chinese deal, this was
something the president hoped to
take a crack at, but didn't
really

12:09.729 --> 12:12.398 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
succeed.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you explain for those who
haven't really been following
this, what is the issue that

12:14.300 --> 12:16.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the U.S. and other
nations have with China?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD ALDEN, Council on Foreign
Relations: Well, I think trade
is one those areas that

12:19.906 --> 12:23.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David mentioned where relations
have really gotten more tense
over the eight years of

12:23.042 --> 12:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Obama administration.

12:25.111 --> 12:26.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Steel is really a
good example of it.

12:26.312 --> 12:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
China entered the WTO in 2001.

12:29.315 --> 12:34.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the hope of the
United States at the time and of
the West was that China

12:34.354 --> 12:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would gradually become a more
market-oriented economy, would
start to look more like the

12:38.391 --> 12:42.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capitalist economies of the West
and really adopt those rules in
terms of how it structured

12:42.328 --> 12:43.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
its economy.

12:43.997 --> 12:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We haven't really
seen that play out.

12:46.966 --> 12:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, particularly in the heavy
industries, Chinese governments
at very levels heavily

12:51.204 --> 12:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
subsidize those industries.

12:53.640 --> 12:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what we have seen is
Chinese production increase
very, very dramatically.

12:57.977 --> 13:01.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And steel is by far the
worst offender here.

13:01.748 --> 13:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you go back to 2000, the
United States and China produced
about the same about of

13:05.385 --> 13:06.486 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
steel.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

13:08.021 --> 13:09.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Fifteen years ago.

13:09.922 --> 13:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD ALDEN: Fifteen years ago,
roughly the same amount, 130
metric tons each, roughly.

13:13.126 --> 13:17.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Since that time, China's
production has grown by 990
million metric tons.

13:17.263 --> 13:19.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's increased
basically 10-fold.

13:19.932 --> 13:24.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. production has dropped a
little bit over that period of
time.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the rest of the world is
saying to China, look, you have
got to change these

13:25.938 --> 13:28.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
practices.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not just steel, but steel
is the biggest one, where you
are subsidizing industries

13:31.678 --> 13:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to produce far beyond what
the market is dictating.

13:35.682 --> 13:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's creating a lot of
tensions with your trading
partners.

13:38.317 --> 13:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: David, another
one of the issues that the
president tried to bring up

13:41.721 --> 13:46.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in his meeting with Vladimir
Putin was the issue of Syria.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they tried to -- apparently
had a long conversation about
can there be some sort

13:47.794 --> 13:50.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a cease-fire?

13:50.363 --> 13:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president was very open,
as open as you can in these
types of meetings, to say,

13:55.968 --> 13:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even if we got an agreement,
which they didn't get, I'm not
sure, the United States can't

13:59.672 --> 14:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be sure that Putin will live
up to his end of the bargain.

14:02.575 --> 14:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: The level of
suspicion in the U.S.-Russia
relationship now is as high

14:07.246 --> 14:12.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as I think any time since the
fall of the Soviet Union.

14:12.719 --> 14:20.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Putin is very aggressive in his
behavior in Syria, in Ukraine.

14:20.326 --> 14:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The technical details of the
Syria agreement have been held
up for a couple of weeks, but,

14:30.269 --> 14:33.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fundamentally, the problem here
is that Putin is allied with
Bashar al-Assad, who the U.S.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regards as the source
of the problem.

14:36.542 --> 14:41.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the U.S., although it says
otherwise, is fighting alongside
the al-Qaida affiliate

14:41.380 --> 14:43.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Syria, the Nusra Front.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's renamed itself, but it's
still the al-Qaida affiliate.

14:46.285 --> 14:49.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a very awkward
position for us to be in.

14:49.455 --> 14:55.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's just not clear how you
get an agreement when those are
the basic elements.

14:55.294 --> 14:58.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: David is
talking about this issue of
trust with regards to Russia.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The issue of trust with regards
to China comes up as well,
particularly about climate
change.

15:01.434 --> 15:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we saw them signing these
Paris accords on Saturday.

15:05.371 --> 15:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These were accords that were
agreed to back in January.

15:08.307 --> 15:14.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A lot of critics of that
agreement say the U.S. can put
whatever smiley face it wants

15:14.881 --> 15:18.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to on these agreements and do
what it can to cut carbon
emissions, but that the Chinese

15:18.384 --> 15:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- it's a voluntary agreement
-- they won't do the same.

15:22.021 --> 15:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to the same point, do you
think that the U.S. can trust
China on this particular issue?

15:26.826 --> 15:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD ALDEN: I think, on
climate, there is the potential
for a different dynamic.

15:30.062 --> 15:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that falls more into
David's first basket of areas
where the U.S. and China really

15:33.900 --> 15:35.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
see a common interest.

15:35.601 --> 15:39.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you look at trade, the
Chinese see it very zero sum.

15:39.872 --> 15:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if they produce less steel,
other countries are going to
produce more steel.

15:41.908 --> 15:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're going to export less.

15:42.909 --> 15:43.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're going to import more.

15:43.609 --> 15:45.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They lose.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They see trade in zero
sum, mercantilist terms.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the climate issue
really is different.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, first, the Chinese do
recognize the reality of global
climate change.

15:53.119 --> 15:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They recognize their role in it.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think they are genuinely
worried about that.

15:57.857 --> 16:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Domestically, they have got an
enormous problem with pollution.

16:01.127 --> 16:04.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So to the extent that they
continue to use dirty coal, that
causes domestic unrest, because

16:04.397 --> 16:06.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you can't breathe in
the major cities.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: David,
last question to you.

16:09.235 --> 16:12.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is obviously the
president's last trip to Asia,
after his much heralded pivot to

16:12.004 --> 16:14.674 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Asia.

16:14.674 --> 16:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think, now that we're
hearing the end of the Obama
presidency, that that has borne

16:18.377 --> 16:20.346 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
fruit for the
president's policies?

16:20.346 --> 16:24.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: I think it
was sound conceptually.

16:24.750 --> 16:29.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the tragedies of Barack
Obama's presidency is that he's
been unable to escape the
gravitational

16:29.388 --> 16:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
field of the Middle East.

16:31.657 --> 16:33.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's ended up fighting
a war against ISIS.

16:33.226 --> 16:34.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's back in Iraq.

16:34.894 --> 16:39.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's in Syria, although
he doesn't want to be.

16:39.031 --> 16:43.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, for countries in Asia,
they see a rising China pushing
its weight around more

16:43.236 --> 16:45.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and more.

16:45.705 --> 16:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to feel that the U.S.
is really there to stay as a
reliable, dependable ally.

16:51.244 --> 16:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's last big effort
is going to be to try to pass
the Trans-Pacific Partnership,

16:54.780 --> 16:56.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the big trade agreement.

16:56.082 --> 16:57.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:57.817 --> 16:58.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Huge
congressional opposition.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: Well, there's a
lot of congressional opposition.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There's also quite
a lot of support.

17:03.289 --> 17:09.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think Obama rightly sees
that, in terms of our
credibility in Asia to countries
like

17:09.695 --> 17:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vietnam, the Philippines, even
Australia, it's crucial that he
get this passed, or do

17:16.469 --> 17:20.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
everything he can in the
lame-duck session to -- as a
demonstration to people we're
still

17:20.606 --> 17:23.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
-- we're still here, we
still care about Asia.

17:23.242 --> 17:28.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the president leaves office
with that going down in a
tailspin, I think we're going to

17:28.547 --> 17:36.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see a story of China asserting
itself with new power and
credibility, because America

17:36.022 --> 17:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will have been seen as the
ally that couldn't deliver.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD ALDEN: Can I just say
that I agree very much with
David on that, but I'm not

17:42.795 --> 17:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
optimistic about the TPP getting
through in this administration.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why not?

17:47.099 --> 17:50.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD ALDEN: I have watched the
votes on every big trade deal
going back to NAFTA.

17:50.937 --> 17:55.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what you have seen is a
hardening of opposition in the
Democratic Party and a
fracturing of

17:55.608 --> 17:58.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Republican Party, under the
influence of Donald Trump, who
has, of course, come

17:58.477 --> 18:01.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out very strongly against
these trade agreements.

18:01.147 --> 18:04.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the past, Democratic
presidents could rely on pretty
strong Republican support.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think that's vanished.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Gentlemen,
thank you both very much for
being here.

18:08.888 --> 18:13.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EDWARD ALDEN: Thank you.

18:13.826 --> 18:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID IGNATIUS: Thank you.

18:19.165 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On this Labor Day,
we turn now to organized labor.

18:25.137 --> 18:30.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Union membership has been on the
decline in the United States for
decades: According to

18:30.142 --> 18:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Labor Department, just 11.1
percent of wage and salary
workers belonged to a union

18:34.647 --> 18:36.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last year.

18:36.716 --> 18:39.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's almost half the union
membership rate in the 1980s.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has our story.

18:42.555 --> 18:47.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more now
on the state of labor, we're
going to by Mary Kay Henry,

18:47.493 --> 18:51.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
president of the Service
Employees International Union,
or SEIU, and Harley Shaiken, a
professor

18:51.397 --> 18:54.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and labor expert at the
University of California,
Berkeley.

18:54.633 --> 18:57.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Professor Shaiken, let
me start with you.

18:57.103 --> 19:00.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we think of the labor
movement, we certainly think
that it's smaller than it used
to be,

19:00.606 --> 19:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but what are the challenges that
the movement is facing today?

19:03.476 --> 19:06.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARLEY SHAIKEN, University of
California, Berkeley: Well,
there are many challenges

19:06.078 --> 19:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are out there right now,
but it's a particularly critical
and urgent time for the labor
movement

19:10.950 --> 19:14.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and I think for the United
States more generally.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the last three decades,
labor has declined from
representing one out of every
five members

19:18.991 --> 19:22.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to one out of every 10 today.

19:22.728 --> 19:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But recent polls from Bloomberg
and others indicate that over
half of people polled would

19:27.500 --> 19:30.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like to join a union.

19:30.269 --> 19:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does that square with
11 percent being in unions?

19:34.407 --> 19:39.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, here, I think we're looking
at tough employer opposition,
laws that don't facilitate

19:39.979 --> 19:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a free choice, and some broader
changes in the economy.

19:43.983 --> 19:47.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, Mary Kay
Henry, how do you square that
gap, if people are interested

19:47.420 --> 19:51.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still in being part of a union,
but the reality is that they're
not?

19:51.290 --> 19:53.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY KAY HENRY, President,
Service Employees International
Union: Twenty million people

19:53.826 --> 19:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have got more money in their
pockets just in the last four
years because 200 fast food

19:59.165 --> 20:05.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
workers had the guts to make a
decision to strike and possibly
lose their job, threaten

20:05.704 --> 20:11.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their whole family's stability,
and make a demand that people
laughed at four years ago,

20:11.544 --> 20:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$15 in a union, and now it's a
standard against which people
are organizing saying, hey, why

20:16.782 --> 20:19.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do I have to wait so
long to get to $15?

20:19.185 --> 20:23.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or, in Birmingham, Alabama, the
city council raises wages.

20:23.789 --> 20:27.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Alabama state
legislature overrides it.

20:27.927 --> 20:32.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In
Scandinavian countries, they
have almost set a wage floor,
even without

20:32.431 --> 20:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
having a minimum wage, because
about 80 percent of the people,
say, in Denmark are already

20:35.267 --> 20:36.202 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unionized.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

20:38.504 --> 20:40.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The private sector says, to be
competitive, I have to raise my
wages up.

20:40.639 --> 20:43.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is the inverse happening
in the United States?

20:43.409 --> 20:48.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With such a small unionized
population, it seems the private
sector doesn't see unions

20:48.247 --> 20:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as much of a threat or an
incentive to try to pull their
wages up by themselves.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY KAY HENRY: Right.

20:53.986 --> 20:59.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the absence of government,
working people and employers
sharing a vision for what
everybody

20:59.391 --> 21:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deserves in the country, we have
the grossest inequality that our
generation has ever seen

21:04.163 --> 21:06.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in this country.

21:06.532 --> 21:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And fast food workers are asking
themselves, hey, if McDonald's,
Wendy's and Burger King

21:11.504 --> 21:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can provide $20 in Denmark,
where 80 percent of the people
have a union, why can't they

21:15.941 --> 21:19.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do the same thing in the
United States of America?

21:19.445 --> 21:21.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Professor
Shaiken, tell us a little bit
about how unions are adapting

21:21.914 --> 21:23.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to what's happening in
the sharing economy.

21:23.282 --> 21:26.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

21:26.051 --> 21:30.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems that there was a
different relationship that we
had with an employer, where
perhaps

21:30.356 --> 21:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not thinking about working for
one company for 40 years to get
the Rolex watch, and then

21:34.560 --> 21:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we moved into an era where we
were thinking, all right, maybe
five years, six years.

21:38.430 --> 21:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we're saying, well, I want
to dedicate 20 minutes of my
time to driving a shared

21:41.267 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
car.

21:43.335 --> 21:44.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And then I might have a
difference service that I might
provide.

21:44.503 --> 21:46.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What happens to benefits?

21:46.372 --> 21:50.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What happens to that
relationship with a union or an
employer?

21:50.276 --> 21:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARLEY SHAIKEN: Well, the
sharing economy is a critical
challenge for unions today.

21:54.880 --> 21:57.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The sharing economy is not
something that exists in nature.

21:57.950 --> 22:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is also an employer strategy,
in many cases, to avoid unions.

22:04.523 --> 22:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, companies such as Uber or
Lyft define the jobs in a way
where they're essentially

22:09.328 --> 22:13.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying part-time workers,
flexible workers can't have a
union.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're independent contractors.

22:15.267 --> 22:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mary Kay
Henry, how do you adapt to that?

22:18.470 --> 22:21.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It seems that if you're
bargaining with an employer, one
of the fundamentals is, when

22:21.840 --> 22:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will my employee actually
be here and working for me?

22:25.511 --> 22:29.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if we're walking into a
world in the next 15, 20 years
where people parse their work

22:29.181 --> 22:32.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out so much, how do you
negotiate on their behalf?

22:32.685 --> 22:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY KAY HENRY: Independent flat
janitors in Chicago got together
when their employers

22:37.856 --> 22:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were all different building
owners, and formed a union and
negotiated a contract.

22:42.361 --> 22:46.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Home care providers were seen
as nothing more than servants.

22:46.165 --> 22:50.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They got together, formed an
employer, and actually raised
wages.

22:50.469 --> 22:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we believe those same
principles need to be applied in
the sharing economy.

22:55.507 --> 23:00.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our members in many cities
around the country are
supporting the organizing of
Uber

23:00.212 --> 23:04.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drivers or other unions that are
working in the sharing economy.

23:04.083 --> 23:07.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's 1 percent of the
economy right now.

23:07.453 --> 23:11.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Professor
Shaiken, pivoting just a bit to
politics, since there is an

23:11.056 --> 23:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election coming up, it seems
that Bernie Sanders and Donald
Trump rally their bases by
saying,

23:15.828 --> 23:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hey, you know what, politicians
are not hearing the voices of
American workers.

23:19.565 --> 23:22.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Well, what happened?

23:22.701 --> 23:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What created that gap and that
opportunity for these two
politicians, especially in the

23:25.704 --> 23:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
context of the union movement?

23:28.107 --> 23:31.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARLEY SHAIKEN: Well, I would
start by saying these are very
different politicians who went

23:31.844 --> 23:34.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in very different directions.

23:34.680 --> 23:41.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they both did, as you point
out, essentially channel this
deep anger, apprehension and

23:41.053 --> 23:45.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
frustration that so many
people are experiencing.

23:45.624 --> 23:50.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In part, it reflects two things
that Mary Kay Henry has pointed
to, the extreme inequality

23:50.629 --> 23:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that exists in this country.

23:53.299 --> 23:58.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not really a question of
inequality, but extreme
inequality that takes us beyond

23:58.437 --> 24:05.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Gilded Age in some ways, and
the immediate manifestation to
millions of workers of stagnant

24:05.277 --> 24:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or declining wages, and few
opportunities to advance
themselves, let alone their
children.

24:11.050 --> 24:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mary Kay
Henry, do unions still have the
power to get out the vote,

24:15.020 --> 24:17.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
especially in this
coming election?

24:17.690 --> 24:22.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, also, there seems to be a
little bit of a fracture, where
the leadership of unions

24:22.428 --> 24:25.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
might be supporting
overwhelmingly Hillary Clinton,
while there still seems to be an

24:25.664 --> 24:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunity for Donald Trump to
speak to the base, the rank and
file.

24:28.634 --> 24:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY KAY HENRY: Seventy percent
of SEIU members support Hillary
Clinton.

24:32.371 --> 24:38.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yes, the labor unions
absolutely do have the power to
be an essential part of the
entire

24:38.377 --> 24:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coalition of partners that needs
to make the case to our members
about why voting matters

24:44.083 --> 24:48.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the future for our children
and our grandchildren.

24:48.153 --> 24:51.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our members all across this
country -- I will be in
Pittsburgh.

24:51.890 --> 24:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are doing phone-banking and
door-knocking in L.A. One-on-one
communication, based on

24:59.064 --> 25:05.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationship, we think is
turnkey to people understanding
why elections matter and why

25:05.371 --> 25:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need to stay in the streets
after the election and hold
every elected official
accountable

25:10.642 --> 25:14.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to an agenda that addresses the
worst inequality of our
generation.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Mary Kay Henry from the SEIU,
Harley Shaiken, thank so much

25:17.082 --> 25:18.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for joining us.

25:18.317 --> 25:19.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARLEY SHAIKEN: Thank you.

25:19.318 --> 25:21.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY KAY HENRY: Thank you.

25:21.653 --> 25:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Online, we get two
more views of labor unions and
workers' rights.

25:26.525 --> 25:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, find eight ideas to help
workers thrive as labor unions
decline, plus an interview

25:32.398 --> 25:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a leading labor organizer
about the need to reinvent
employee bargaining.

25:37.035 --> 25:51.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Find that on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

25:51.049 --> 26:02.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how much does organized
labor matter in modern-day
presidential campaigns?

26:02.094 --> 26:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are Donald Trump's efforts to
court African-Americans winning
voters, black or otherwise?

26:07.299 --> 26:11.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what to expect, if anything,
when Congress returns to
Washington tomorrow?

26:11.904 --> 26:13.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With all these questions and
more, it's the perfect time for
this Labor Day edition of

26:13.839 --> 26:16.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Politics Monday.

26:16.875 --> 26:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for that, we are joined by
Stu Rothenberg of The Washington
Post and The Rothenberg

26:21.013 --> 26:25.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
&amp; Gonzales Political Report, and
Susan Page, the Washington
bureau chief for USA Today.

26:25.651 --> 26:27.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Susan, Stu, thanks
for joining us.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

26:30.088 --> 26:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming out of that conversation
about labor unions today, Susan,
what is the influence

26:35.360 --> 26:38.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of labor in a political
campaign like this year's?

26:38.897 --> 26:40.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today: Well, labor
leaders are pretty influential

26:40.365 --> 26:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Democratic Party, but
they may or may not be able to
deliver many of their actual

26:44.169 --> 26:46.605 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

26:46.605 --> 26:50.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Labor union members, especially
white men, are the target group
for Donald Trump.

26:50.175 --> 26:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's had a lot of success
in getting their support.

26:53.078 --> 26:57.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's not at all clear that
labor unions will be able to do
as much as they once could

26:57.483 --> 27:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get their members to actually
vote for the candidate the union
itself supports.

27:01.453 --> 27:04.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, Stu, what does
an endorsement mean these days?

27:04.623 --> 27:05.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Editor and
Publisher, The Rothenberg &amp;
Gonzales Political Report: Well,

27:05.657 --> 27:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not as much as it meant in
the '70s or '80s certainly.

27:09.495 --> 27:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back then, the endorsement was a
big thing, whether it was Walter
Mondale or Howard Dean.

27:14.166 --> 27:21.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it brings some money and
it brings the stamp of approval
from organized labor.

27:21.139 --> 27:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, look, the Democratic
coalition has changed.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It includes environmentalists
and women's groups.

27:26.011 --> 27:28.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very different party.

27:28.881 --> 27:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so labor is still a part of
it, but it's not the dominant
part that it once was.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Donald Trump this
past week went -- this past
weekend, went to a black church

27:35.654 --> 27:37.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Detroit.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you make of this?

27:39.424 --> 27:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What -- his outreach to black
voters, or apparent outreach to
black voters?

27:43.061 --> 27:46.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I would give him
some credit for going to speak
to African-American voters.

27:46.798 --> 27:49.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He hadn't done that before.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not an audience that he
would expect to be particularly
friendly to him, so I think

27:51.637 --> 27:54.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that's a good thing that
presidential candidates
sometimes do.

27:54.239 --> 27:57.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, I don't think his
real target are African-American
voters.

27:57.442 --> 28:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is hard to imagine that
Donald Trump gets into
double-digit support when it
comes to

28:01.580 --> 28:04.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
African-Americans.

28:04.049 --> 28:07.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think he has found that,
in order to reach
college-educated white voters,
he needs

28:07.786 --> 28:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to address some of the concerns
that he has had racist appeals,
racist and provocative

28:12.658 --> 28:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
language about Mexicans and
Muslims and about
African-Americans.

28:15.761 --> 28:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's more of what
he's trying's to do with these
events.

28:19.231 --> 28:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Stu, there was an
interesting point in The New
York Times this morning talking

28:21.900 --> 28:28.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about focus groups in Florida
and Ohio among African-American
voters.

28:28.607 --> 28:33.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We know the historical
connection between Bill Clinton
and black voters.

28:33.245 --> 28:38.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they found that younger
black voters have reservations
about Hillary Clinton.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I think
younger voters across the races
have concerns about her.

28:42.921 --> 28:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't see her the way older
African-Americans see her or her
husband.

28:48.760 --> 28:53.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you know, she's going to
have to try harder to get
younger voters of all races.

28:53.665 --> 28:58.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think she will do as
well as Barack Obama, but that's
a pretty high standard.

28:58.136 --> 29:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think her advantage still
is not her strength and her
appeal, but it is the fact

29:02.207 --> 29:05.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that Donald Trump has no
standing in the community.

29:05.844 --> 29:09.014 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
And he can go to
African-American churches from
now until next Thursday, and
it's not

29:09.014 --> 29:11.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to change that.

29:11.249 --> 29:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He really has never built any
sort of fundamental base with
that community.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's a big problem.

29:17.055 --> 29:19.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, we're two months away
from the election, and voters
know that.

29:19.858 --> 29:21.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
White voters know that.

29:21.026 --> 29:22.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Asian-American voters know that.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And African-American
voters know that.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they have become
cynical, as they should.

29:26.765 --> 29:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: But you think about
younger African-Americans not
being as supportive of Hillary
Clinton

29:31.603 --> 29:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as they were of Barack Obama
or even of Bill Clinton.

29:34.673 --> 29:36.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the same problem she has
with younger women, women under
35.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: And I think
experiences of the millennial
generation is just different
from

29:40.779 --> 29:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the experiences of their parents
and their grandparents.

29:44.549 --> 29:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so some of these political
distinctions are going to
change.

29:47.386 --> 29:51.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think you see fewer
differences on race with voters
under 35 than you do with older

29:51.657 --> 29:54.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

29:54.259 --> 29:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: But it's not
as if younger voters are going
to be attracted to Donald

29:54.626 --> 29:55.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump either.

29:55.594 --> 29:57.796 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SUSAN PAGE: No.

29:57.796 --> 29:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: He has shown
no ability to get that
electorate either.

29:58.930 --> 30:02.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: But to Gary Johnson
maybe or to Jill Stein, I think
their highest levels of

30:02.901 --> 30:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support, even though they're not
that high, their highest levels
of support are among

30:04.503 --> 30:06.972 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
younger voters.

30:06.972 --> 30:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Is there anything she
can do, Hillary Clinton can do,
to get try to those younger

30:08.907 --> 30:11.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voters back?

30:11.476 --> 30:14.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had trouble with them when
she was competing with Bernie
Sanders in the primaries, but

30:14.146 --> 30:16.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is there anything she can do?

30:16.214 --> 30:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Oh, I think
it's all about Trump and
ratcheting up the risk of what a

30:20.285 --> 30:23.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump presidency would mean to
the country and to these younger
voters, who are -- tend

30:23.755 --> 30:27.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be -- favor diversity and
tolerance and they're more open.

30:27.459 --> 30:30.262 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're more progressive
in their cultural views.

30:30.262 --> 30:33.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump, last time I
looked, wouldn't be described in
those terms.

30:33.865 --> 30:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Although there are
only, what, 64 days left until
-- the campaign.

30:37.335 --> 30:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not very long, and these
are two candidates who are
pretty well known.

30:41.373 --> 30:42.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, we are going
to have three presidential
debates and the vice
presidential

30:42.874 --> 30:45.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debate.

30:45.644 --> 30:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are going to have weeks in
which voters are really
intensely looking at this
campaign.

30:49.281 --> 30:53.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think there is still room
for things to change, for
candidates to either do really

30:53.318 --> 30:55.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well in debates and have people
take a second look or to do
really poorly and have the
opposite

30:55.854 --> 30:57.789 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
effect.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, there are
other races on the ballot.

30:59.791 --> 31:03.061 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congress, for instance, will be
-- the entire House will be up.

31:03.061 --> 31:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will be back tomorrow
briefly to try to get some
business done.

31:07.332 --> 31:09.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do we expect anything to happen
on the Hill in the next what --
how long are they here?

31:09.935 --> 31:11.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Four weeks?

31:11.536 --> 31:12.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: They're
here for four weeks.

31:12.404 --> 31:14.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have just taken
seven weeks off.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These are jobs we should
all aspire to have.

31:15.474 --> 31:18.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:18.009 --> 31:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I think there are
only two things you should
really expect Congress to do.

31:20.579 --> 31:24.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is to pass a short-term
funding bill, because it's not
in their political interest

31:24.316 --> 31:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to shut down the government when
the fiscal year comes into
effect, the new fiscal year,

31:26.685 --> 31:28.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on October 1.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The second thing, I
think, is Zika funding.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This has been put off and
off for months and months.

31:32.958 --> 31:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The situation in Florida and
elsewhere just keeps getting
worse.

31:36.094 --> 31:39.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think there is a
bipartisan sense that they need
to pass that $1.1 billion Zika
funding

31:39.164 --> 31:40.165 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bill, and quick.

31:40.165 --> 31:41.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JOHN YANG: Stu?

31:41.433 --> 31:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: No, I agree.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not going to do anything
substantive beyond that.

31:45.303 --> 31:47.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have got to keep the -- the
Republicans have to keep the
government open.

31:47.305 --> 31:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They certainly don't want to
be dogged with that problem.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Zika funding, there is
significant support, but, of
course, there has been support
for

31:53.011 --> 31:57.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
many weeks now.

31:57.482 --> 31:58.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Senate was unable
to deal with it initially.

31:58.717 --> 31:59.885 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, we will see.

31:59.885 --> 32:02.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think it's possible.

32:02.053 --> 32:05.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think even Zika
funding is a slam dunk.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: We had a USA
Today-Suffolk University poll
that came out today, and it
showed that

32:09.961 --> 32:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
three out of 10 Americans say
that someone in their family,
themselves or someone else

32:13.899 --> 32:16.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their families have changed
their plans for travel or other
things because of fear

32:16.701 --> 32:18.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Zika virus.

32:18.336 --> 32:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's really an enormous
number of Americans.

32:22.307 --> 32:27.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And almost two-thirds said, yes,
Congress should pass this bill,
including most overwhelming

32:27.279 --> 32:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of Democrats, but a
plurality of Republicans as
well.

32:29.748 --> 32:33.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I do think there is a head of
steam behind Zika funding.

32:33.218 --> 32:39.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There was another
poll in USA Today last week
about that there is all this
talk

32:39.024 --> 32:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about will the Democrats take
back the Senate and try to take
back the House, and there

32:43.328 --> 32:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was an interesting finding
about ticket-splitting.

32:45.297 --> 32:48.033 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SUSAN PAGE: So,
here's what we found.

32:48.033 --> 32:52.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A majority of Hillary Clinton
supporters say they are likely
to split their ticket.

32:52.337 --> 32:54.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they will vote for Hillary
Clinton, but they will vote for
Republicans for the Senate

32:54.472 --> 32:57.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or governor or some other
races down the ballot.

32:57.475 --> 33:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a majority of Donald Trump
voters said they wouldn't split
their ticket.

33:01.146 --> 33:03.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're going to stick
on the Republican side.

33:03.682 --> 33:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is very good news for those
endangered Republican Senate
incumbents who are fighting

33:07.752 --> 33:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so hard in swing states where
Donald Trump is having a lot of
trouble.

33:11.923 --> 33:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I think we
will see more of this don't give
Hillary Clinton a blank

33:15.360 --> 33:19.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
check from Republicans in the
House and the Senate in states
that are competitive.

33:19.064 --> 33:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think Republicans actually
do have a fighting chance to
hold on onto the Senate.

33:21.867 --> 33:23.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I didn't think so six
months ago, but I do now.

33:23.702 --> 33:26.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: We have less
than a minute left.

33:26.137 --> 33:29.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There was a story in The
Washington Post this morning
that said that federal officials
are

33:29.507 --> 33:35.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking into a broad covert
Russian operation to sow public
distrust in the election, the

33:35.013 --> 33:36.348 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
hacking and all
the other things.

33:36.348 --> 33:40.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How big a problem could this be?

33:40.819 --> 33:45.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Could there be questions about
the legitimacy of this election
in November?

33:45.357 --> 33:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I think this is just
a huge issue about Russian
actions to try to meddle in

33:48.660 --> 33:50.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our politics.

33:50.262 --> 33:53.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's amazing
and very disturbing.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the last thing we need in
this country are people not
believing that they're getting

33:56.268 --> 33:58.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an accurate count of the vote.

33:58.904 --> 34:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I think, more
broadly, people are very
suspicious about government

34:03.241 --> 34:07.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and vote counters and election
watchers on both sides of the
aisle, particularly on the

34:07.612 --> 34:10.315 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump side.

34:10.315 --> 34:15.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I imagine that, after the
results are in, we will hear
from some corners some
complaints

34:15.320 --> 34:18.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about, can we really
trust these numbers?

34:18.089 --> 34:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And if you want to
make it hard for a new president
to govern, just let there

34:19.791 --> 34:21.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
be questions about how
he or she were elected.

34:21.426 --> 34:22.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Right.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Exactly.

34:24.095 --> 34:28.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Susan Page, Stu Rothenberg,
thanks for joining us.

34:28.099 --> 34:32.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

34:32.203 --> 34:36.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Thanks, John.

34:36.074 --> 34:40.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Stay with us.

34:40.412 --> 34:44.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
clothing company keeps jobs in
America; and growing up black

34:44.716 --> 34:48.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the age of President
Barack Obama.

34:48.620 --> 34:53.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: We look at the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict
through the lens of
Canadian-Israeli

34:53.258 --> 34:54.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Corey Gil-Shuster.

34:54.993 --> 34:58.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He runs The Ask Project.

34:58.430 --> 35:02.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gil-Shuster solicits questions
from the Web and then hits the
streets of Israel and the

35:02.667 --> 35:06.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
West Bank to ask serious and at
times provocative questions.

35:06.771 --> 35:10.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He posts the answers,
unedited, on YouTube.

35:10.809 --> 35:16.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"PBS NewsHour" contributor
Justin Kenny recently followed
Gil-Shuster and produced this
report.

35:16.348 --> 35:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Corey Gil-Shuster, The Ask
Project: If you were driving on
the highway and there was

35:19.617 --> 35:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Palestinian on the side of the
highway that seemed to need
help, would you stop and help?

35:22.287 --> 35:25.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: If I'm by myself in the
car, I won't stop to anyone.

35:25.423 --> 35:29.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't matter if it's a man,
a woman, in the middle of the
road.

35:29.794 --> 35:38.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I am with someone, like my
husband, and we see something,
maybe we will stop.

35:38.937 --> 35:41.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: My name
is Corey Gil-Shuster.

35:41.806 --> 35:45.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I run The Ask an Israeli,
Ask a Palestinian Project.

35:45.443 --> 35:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you were driving on the
highway and you saw an Israeli
on the side of the road that

35:48.013 --> 35:49.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needed help, would you stop?

35:49.247 --> 35:51.416 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
SAMI HABASH,
Palestinian: Why not?

35:51.416 --> 35:55.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some day, he will help me.

35:55.186 --> 36:00.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But if I saw -- if I see that he
is shooting, I will shoot back.

36:00.392 --> 36:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: The project
is about finding out what
Israelis and Palestinians really

36:02.660 --> 36:07.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believe and think
about the conflict.

36:07.365 --> 36:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People from all around the world
send me questions through
e-mail.

36:10.335 --> 36:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I choose the questions, and then
I go out to the streets of
Israel and Palestine to

36:15.006 --> 36:17.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ask random Israelis and
Palestinians to answer the
questions themselves.

36:17.776 --> 36:21.946 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
I don't edit any
content out of it.

36:21.946 --> 36:29.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DURA, Palestinian: Most, the
majority, they want two states,
an Israeli state and a
Palestinian

36:29.821 --> 36:31.523 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RISHON LEZION, Israeli:
They are very primitive.

36:33.858 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they cannot build a
country like we did.

36:37.228 --> 36:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): For
sure, the Israelis will be
destroyed because Palestine

36:42.867 --> 36:45.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is not their right.

36:45.537 --> 36:49.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER:
Destroyed as in killed?

36:49.207 --> 36:53.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
They should be killed, yes.

36:53.912 --> 36:56.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: What are you
willing to compromise for peace?

36:56.648 --> 36:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DROR, Israeli: Everything.

36:57.749 --> 37:00.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
My pants.

37:00.185 --> 37:03.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: The question
is, don't you think Israel is
committing suicide by

37:03.354 --> 37:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
holding onto the West Bank?

37:07.292 --> 37:11.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOGA TARNOPOLSKY: I think
that's a really bad question.

37:11.429 --> 37:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: OK, why?

37:13.031 --> 37:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NOGA TARNOPOLSKY: Because
it's a leading question.

37:15.133 --> 37:18.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: A lot of the
questions I get are what I call
gotcha questions.

37:18.103 --> 37:21.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're a little bit over the
top, or exaggerated, or have a
very overly simplistic way of
looking

37:21.339 --> 37:24.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the conflict.

37:24.175 --> 37:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ask them exactly that way,
or try to as much as possible,
because I think it's

37:32.117 --> 37:35.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interesting for Israelis or
Palestinians to hear what people
from outside think.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I want them to
answer in an honest way.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NOGA TARNOPOLSKY: The answer is
sometimes I do and sometimes I
don't.

37:39.924 --> 37:41.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: OK, what way
-- OK, so, give me an example.

37:41.126 --> 37:46.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why do you think yes and
why do you think no?

37:46.898 --> 37:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NOGA TARNOPOLSKY: I think the
investment that Israel is making
in the territories is
unjustified.

37:51.636 --> 37:56.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that the emphasis on the
West Bank in the Israeli
political arena is absolutely

37:56.374 --> 38:01.713 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
outsized.

38:01.713 --> 38:04.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I say no, I say no
because I think that other
things are happening in the
world.

38:04.749 --> 38:06.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think Israel has
many problems.

38:06.985 --> 38:09.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think Israel
is committing suicide.

38:09.854 --> 38:15.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: I'm often
accused of asking these leading
questions purposely, as if it's

38:15.293 --> 38:18.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
my politics or if that's where I
want the agenda of the videos to
go, and it really

38:18.930 --> 38:21.132 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
isn't.

38:21.132 --> 38:23.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It really is -- I'm trying to
speak in the voice of the person
asking.

38:23.301 --> 38:30.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We are on our way now to
Qalandiya checkpoint into the
West Bank.

38:30.842 --> 38:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And from there, we are going
to head out to Nablus.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is the Qalandiya
checkpoint.

38:41.286 --> 38:46.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a major checkpoint,
actually much more for
Palestinians coming into Israel
who have

38:46.491 --> 38:51.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
permits or Jerusalem --
Palestinian Jerusalemites who
work in the West Bank, so they
go back

38:51.062 --> 38:53.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and forth.

38:53.531 --> 38:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nablus is actually my favorite
-- I think this is my favorite
city in the West Bank.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It kind of has everything.

38:58.803 --> 39:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It has poor, rich, middle-class.

39:02.207 --> 39:07.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A variety of different
groups live there.

39:07.111 --> 39:09.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And people love to shop.

39:09.614 --> 39:11.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, that's true all
over the West Bank.

39:11.149 --> 39:14.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's just really
lively all the time.

39:14.986 --> 39:20.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The law is that Jewish Israelis
are not allowed legally to be in
certain areas of the West

39:20.491 --> 39:22.260 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bank.

39:22.260 --> 39:24.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Technically, it's not
legal, what I'm doing.

39:24.996 --> 39:27.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
My family is really not
supportive of me going to the
West Bank.

39:27.232 --> 39:27.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They really believe I'm
going to be killed.

39:27.765 --> 39:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MANAR: My name is Manar.

39:28.733 --> 39:30.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a translator.

39:30.235 --> 39:36.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm 30 years old, and
I'm from Ramallah.

39:36.040 --> 39:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some people find it, I won't say
offensive, but they don't like
that he lives in Tel Aviv.

39:40.178 --> 39:44.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't say that he is Israeli.

39:44.215 --> 39:48.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's better, because people
would be more comfortable that
way.

39:48.353 --> 39:57.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: Do you think
this project will have much of
an impact?

39:57.395 --> 40:00.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MANAR: I hope so.

40:00.298 --> 40:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I really hope so, because it's
about bringing people closer
together.

40:04.569 --> 40:09.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY GIL-SHUSTER: I do this
because I think it's so
important that, if you want to
solve

40:09.040 --> 40:11.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a conflict, you need
to problem-solve.

40:11.843 --> 40:16.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if you want to
problem-solve, you need to know
what you're dealing with.

40:16.848 --> 40:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you don't know what you're
dealing with, then no solution
is ever going to help.

40:23.688 --> 40:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Next: one company's
attempt to bring textile jobs to
rural America through

40:36.267 --> 40:38.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an unusual approach.

40:38.803 --> 40:42.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan is
back with that story.

40:42.440 --> 40:48.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It doesn't
look like the textile mill towns
of New England and it's

40:48.313 --> 40:51.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
certainly not Silicon Valley.

40:51.683 --> 40:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet here in Pagosa Springs,
Colorado, a mountain town of
less than 2,000 people, an
upstart

40:57.088 --> 41:02.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
company hopes to disrupt the
textile industry using a
high-tech, outside-the-box
approach.

41:02.593 --> 41:06.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The company is called Voormi, a
made-up name for a mythological
mountain creature.

41:06.431 --> 41:12.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was started by former

41:12.070 --> 41:18.042 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
His idea?

41:18.042 --> 41:23.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To manufacture a brand-new kind
of fabric from locally sourced
materials and then sew

41:23.214 --> 41:26.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the garments in small
micro-factories in rural
communities.

41:26.984 --> 41:32.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN ENGLISH, Founder, Voormi:
It's more like a craft approach,
kind of like the beer industry.

41:32.123 --> 41:37.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We like to think, if we can take
a small batch mentality and turn
things quicker, that consumers

41:37.929 --> 41:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
want new, fresh things
on a regular basis.

41:42.100 --> 41:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The clothing
is made for recreation in harsh
conditions, whether that's

41:46.204 --> 41:50.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mountain biking under the
blazing sun, fishing in icy cold
streams, or climbing in all
kinds

41:50.575 --> 41:54.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of weather.

41:54.879 --> 41:58.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
English wanted to build his
company in a region where his
products could be sewn in the
morning

41:58.015 --> 42:01.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and tested in the afternoon.

42:01.085 --> 42:05.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So he chose Pagosa Springs,
surrounded by two million acres
of national forest.

42:05.923 --> 42:11.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN ENGLISH: We have a large
staff of so-called mountain
professionals, whether they're
ski

42:11.529 --> 42:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
patrollers, or river guides or
fly fishing guides, or hunting
outfitters, that love to

42:15.800 --> 42:17.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
test our gear.

42:17.502 --> 42:21.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And these guys give us
honest, straight feedback.

42:21.873 --> 42:27.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: English has
chosen not to outsource to large
sewing facilities in Asia,

42:27.612 --> 42:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where much of the once-strong
U.S. textile industry ended up.

42:30.982 --> 42:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That shift left many communities
in the U.S. devastated.

42:34.619 --> 42:39.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN ENGLISH: What we hope to do
is provide an industry in small
rural towns that allow

42:39.690 --> 42:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people to live here, play here,
and work here without having to
have multiple jobs throughout

42:45.563 --> 42:48.032 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the year.

42:48.032 --> 42:51.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: English
eventually hopes to have as many
as 10 facilities, each with

42:51.135 --> 42:54.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
eight to 10 sewers, scattered
throughout Colorado.

42:54.739 --> 43:01.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Currently, he has just three,
including this one at the
company headquarters.

43:01.479 --> 43:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Twenty-four year old Joan Walker
says being able to work in the
area where she grew up

43:03.748 --> 43:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
has been a dream come true.

43:06.684 --> 43:09.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She graduated from college two
years ago with a degree in
fashion design.

43:09.887 --> 43:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOAN WALKER, Voormi: I was
pretty convinced that I was just
going to have to settle in

43:13.558 --> 43:17.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a city for a couple of years, or
probably longer than a couple of
years, until I could

43:17.562 --> 43:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do something differently to get
back to where I really wanted to
be.

43:21.666 --> 43:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Melinda Volger
wasn't as lucky when she
graduated from college 35 years

43:25.369 --> 43:28.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

43:28.005 --> 43:32.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She too was a fashion design
major who wanted to return to
her hometown, but because there

43:32.109 --> 43:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were no full-time sewing jobs,
she became a secretary, and did
sewing alterations on

43:36.080 --> 43:39.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the side.

43:39.150 --> 43:43.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now she designs and sews
full-time for Voormi, and has
just a one-minute commute,
walking

43:43.454 --> 43:46.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
across the back alley from
her home to the shop.

43:46.591 --> 43:51.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELINDA VOLGER, Voormi: I get to
give input on the design process
from the start, through

43:51.796 --> 43:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the pattern-making, through
making the initial prototypes.

43:56.267 --> 44:00.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they're very accepting of
any suggestions that I have, and
we work as a team back and

44:00.071 --> 44:02.640 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forth.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Like all of
the employees at Voormi, Volger
and Walker wear many hats.

44:05.576 --> 44:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Not only do they design and sew.

44:07.545 --> 44:11.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They also take shifts working
at the retail store.

44:11.249 --> 44:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CEO English says that makes the
company more responsive to the
needs of customers.

44:14.919 --> 44:17.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAN ENGLISH: It's a new
way of manufacturing.

44:17.054 --> 44:20.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's what we believe is the
future of manufacturing.

44:20.291 --> 44:23.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a very -- it's a much
more nimble experience.

44:23.327 --> 44:25.630 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And it's a wider
range of skill set.

44:25.630 --> 44:27.698 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
And that's what
we're focused on.

44:27.698 --> 44:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we think that's repeatable
and scalable across the United
States, and especially in

44:31.636 --> 44:35.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rural communities that
need economic development.

44:35.773 --> 44:40.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: University of
Denver business professor Kerry
Plemmons:

44:40.912 --> 44:44.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KERRY PLEMMONS, University of
Denver: Somebody like Voormi who
can say, I see a trend, jump

44:44.081 --> 44:48.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right on that trip with what we
would call agility, and an
agility to jump on a trend,

44:48.085 --> 44:51.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then be first to market, in
that -- because the thing about
Voormi that I think important

44:51.255 --> 44:53.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is, they know who their
target market is.

44:53.658 --> 44:56.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's a niche.

44:56.260 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not broad, like Target or
Wal-Mart, but they have a
specific segment.

44:59.063 --> 45:00.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They can address that segment.

45:00.998 --> 45:03.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That
segment is very high-end.

45:03.100 --> 45:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A simple T-shirt costs $80.

45:06.437 --> 45:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lightweight jackets start in the
mid-$200s and go up from there.

45:10.241 --> 45:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
English admits he's serving
a specific market.

45:13.678 --> 45:19.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN ENGLISH: We have a saying
here, that our goal is to make
competition irrelevant.

45:19.750 --> 45:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if we try to do the same
thing that other big brands are
doing, you know, it just won't

45:22.887 --> 45:25.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

45:25.556 --> 45:28.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Voormi
clothing has been getting
positive reviews in sports
magazines.

45:28.426 --> 45:32.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But whether the company will be
able to meet increasing demand
while keeping its commitment

45:32.196 --> 45:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to rural economic development
remains to be seen.

45:35.399 --> 45:42.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

45:42.273 --> 45:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Finally tonight: the
story of a black man growing up
in a society fraught

45:53.918 --> 45:56.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with racial tension.

45:56.954 --> 46:00.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the latest
addition to our "NewsHour"
bookshelf.

46:00.625 --> 46:03.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "I started this
book with the question, how did
you learn to be a black

46:03.761 --> 46:06.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man?"

46:06.564 --> 46:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That line comes from the new
book titled "Invisible Man, Got
the Whole World Watching: A
Young

Author Mychal Denzel Smith is a
contributing writer for "The
Nation" and other publications.

46:16.073 --> 46:17.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is his first book.

46:17.541 --> 46:19.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you.

46:19.944 --> 46:19.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH, Author,
"Invisible Man, Got the Whole
World Watching: A Young Black

46:19.977 --> 46:21.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Man's Education": Thank
you for having me.

46:21.712 --> 46:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let's start with
that question, how did you learn
to be a black man?

46:22.647 --> 46:24.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why was that the question?

46:24.148 --> 46:27.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why was that still
the question today?

46:27.284 --> 46:31.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH: Well, so
the book has its Genesis after
George Zimmerman killed

46:31.155 --> 46:35.092 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Trayvon Martin
February 26, 2012.

46:35.092 --> 46:40.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After that event, we were having
a conversation about the lives
of black men in America, and

46:40.498 --> 46:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
particularly young black men and
the experience of walking
through a world that's still --
where

46:46.270 --> 46:52.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
racism persists, and the
judgment on the basis of
stereotype has this effect where
one's

46:52.176 --> 46:55.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
life could be taken.

46:55.112 --> 46:59.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we were having a
conversation about the talk that
black parents would give to
young

46:59.984 --> 47:03.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black men about how to survive
in this country, how to comport
oneself with authorities.

47:03.054 --> 47:04.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How to behave.

47:04.255 --> 47:06.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH:
How to behave.

47:06.257 --> 47:10.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what it did was, it was
flattening the experience of
what it is to be a young black

47:10.461 --> 47:14.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
man in America, and to say that
that's the only thing that we
have to concern ourselves

47:14.265 --> 47:17.034 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

47:17.034 --> 47:23.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, it's a big deal to --
continually to exist in a
country that upholds racist
ideas

47:23.274 --> 47:28.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and racist structures, but the
interior of black men's lives
are a thing that we don't

47:28.212 --> 47:33.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really talk too much about,
right, the nuances of our
experience.

47:33.284 --> 47:36.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Walking through racism is
important, but how are we
dealing with talking about
patriarchy

47:36.854 --> 47:41.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and misogyny and homophobia and
class race elitism and mental
illness?

47:41.325 --> 47:44.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not including these things
in the narrative around young
black men.

47:44.361 --> 47:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, you do that
by taking us through your
education, looking to role

47:47.932 --> 47:50.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
models that you looked to,
right, leaders, writers,
musicians.

47:50.601 --> 47:53.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH: Yes.

47:53.003 --> 47:56.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You also refer to
a kind of traditional black
narrative.

47:56.941 --> 48:02.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You said, the traditional black
narrative, I experienced racism,
I overcame racism.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're specifically doing
something different or feeling
something different.

48:04.715 --> 48:06.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH: Yes.

48:06.117 --> 48:08.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think that it's
something to overcome.

48:08.352 --> 48:13.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that these are systems
that we are experiencing and
need to be dismantled, but

48:13.524 --> 48:20.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that there is a feeling,
particularly in black
communities, that one does the
hard

48:20.030 --> 48:25.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
work and does -- and presents
himself as twice as good and as
respectable, and that you will

48:25.336 --> 48:31.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be spared the sting of racism,
because it cannot touch you if
you present yourself as

48:31.709 --> 48:33.244 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
impenetrable to it.

48:33.244 --> 48:35.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's just not true.

48:35.112 --> 48:37.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: Mr. Speaker...

48:37.214 --> 48:40.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH: We have
lived through eight years of a
black presidency, and we

48:40.918 --> 48:45.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have seen the amount of racist
attacks against him, a man who,
by all measures, is the most

48:45.890 --> 48:51.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
respectable black man that the
United States has ever produced,
and achieved the highest

48:51.395 --> 48:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
office in the land and can still
be hit with racism and has faced
the most recalcitrant

48:56.433 --> 49:00.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Congress in history,
on the basis of racist backlash.

49:00.271 --> 49:04.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that idea just does not sit.

49:04.208 --> 49:08.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Barack Obama,
this presidency that we have
lived through, is perhaps the

49:08.612 --> 49:11.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most pivotal figure in this book
for your life and for our times.

49:11.949 --> 49:14.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH: Yes.

49:14.218 --> 49:17.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But, for you,
most interestingly, what comes
through is the deep ambivalence

49:17.822 --> 49:22.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you feel about him, right, that
he is almost not who you wanted
to be.

49:22.960 --> 49:25.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH: Yes, well,
he's not -- it's not a question
of whether I want him to be

49:25.529 --> 49:26.564 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anyone.

49:26.564 --> 49:29.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

49:29.066 --> 49:33.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that he is who he is,
and he's a product of certain
traditions and ideology.

49:33.537 --> 49:38.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's only -- he's only
president -- the first black
president possible because of

49:38.642 --> 49:43.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the ideology that he espouses,
because he is sort of -- he is a
very centrist, mainstream

49:43.614 --> 49:49.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrat whose politics are not
going to challenge the status
quo in radical ways.

49:49.420 --> 49:54.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, yes, he's successful
in large part because of that.

49:54.325 --> 49:59.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he's the first black
president in part because his
narrative, his story doesn't
remind

49:59.630 --> 50:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people of America's racism, in
the same ways that a person who
is a descendent of slavery

50:03.133 --> 50:04.702 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
would.

50:04.702 --> 50:08.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is not of that.

50:08.405 --> 50:13.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there are certain things
that make Barack Obama possible
and make him an inspirational

50:13.677 --> 50:17.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figure in a lot of ways, but
then there is the way in which
he talks to and about black

50:17.848 --> 50:20.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

50:20.551 --> 50:27.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that a lot of what he --
the work that he has done in
assuring voters who turned

50:27.324 --> 50:31.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, white voters to turn out
for him, was that he wasn't
going to play favoritism to

50:31.929 --> 50:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black America, that he wasn't a
race man, that he wasn't
concerned about the idea of

50:36.500 --> 50:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
racism to the point of policy
changes and an actual shift in
the way in which we conduct

50:41.672 --> 50:44.174 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
business here in
the United States.

50:44.174 --> 50:48.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you wanted
something more from him and from
yourself, from others?

50:48.979 --> 50:54.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH: I would
like to see more movement on the
ground and
consciousness-shifting

50:54.084 --> 51:00.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and discuss -- and discourse in
our everyday lives, so that we
produce the kind of politicians

51:00.024 --> 51:03.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that respond to that.

51:03.160 --> 51:08.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would like to see more of us
engaged in reckoning with the
history of the United States.

51:08.332 --> 51:13.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would like to see more of us
dealing with what the present of
racism looks like, so

51:13.437 --> 51:18.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we understand how this
country is built and who it's
meant to benefit.

51:18.042 --> 51:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in that way, when we, as
voting constituencies, shift the
way that we're thinking about
it,

51:25.983 --> 51:28.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our politicians have no other
choice but to respond.

51:28.152 --> 51:30.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what about
for yourself, finally?

51:30.788 --> 51:34.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You write near the end of the
book about wanting to become, as
you say, an honest black man

51:34.024 --> 51:35.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and a good black writer.

51:35.726 --> 51:37.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does that mean?

51:37.328 --> 51:39.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you aspiring to?

51:39.830 --> 51:46.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MYCHAL DENZEL SMITH: The honesty
is that -- is knowing that there
has been a very masculinist

51:46.603 --> 51:51.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
narrative around black life in
the United States, and that
someone in my position, as

51:51.608 --> 51:58.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a cisgender, heterosexual black
man, knows what that experience
is and can continue to

51:58.782 --> 52:02.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
repeat it over and over again,
and never have to interrogate
complicity within other
structures

52:02.353 --> 52:05.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of oppressions.

52:05.055 --> 52:11.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think being honest means
that we start doing the work of
that interrogation for
ourselves,

52:11.462 --> 52:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that gets us to a politics
that's more open and more
inclusive and talking about

52:15.366 --> 52:18.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
equality and just
for all people.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book is
