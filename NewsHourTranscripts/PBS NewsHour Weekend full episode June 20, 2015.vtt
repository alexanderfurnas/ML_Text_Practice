00:19.219 --> 00:20.487
WITH THE TRAGEDY.

00:20.487 --> 00:22.089
>> IF THAT YOUNG MAN THOUGHT HE

00:22.089 --> 00:23.957
WAS GOING DIVIDE THIS COMMUNITY

00:23.957 --> 00:25.726
OR DIVIDE THIS COUNTRY WITH HIS

00:25.726 --> 00:28.528
RACIAL HATRED, HE MISERABLY

00:28.528 --> 00:33.233
FAILED.

CONGREGATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:35.335 --> 00:37.004
SHOW THEIR SUPPORT.

00:37.004 --> 00:38.171
>> THIS CHURCH, THE AFRICAN

00:38.171 --> 00:39.973
METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH, BORN

00:39.973 --> 00:43.977
OUT OF THE EMERGENT NEEDS OF

00:43.977 --> 00:46.313

HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:57.424 --> 00:58.258
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:58.258 --> 00:59.092
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:59.092 --> 00:59.993
WE START WITH NEW DETAILS ABOUT

00:59.993 --> 01:01.094
THE YOUNG MAN CHARGED WITH

01:01.094 --> 01:02.229
KILLING NINE BLACK PARISHIONERS

01:02.229 --> 01:03.330
IN AN HISTORIC CHARLESTON

01:03.330 --> 01:04.264
CHURCH.

01:04.264 --> 01:04.965
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ARE

01:04.965 --> 01:05.966
REPORTEDLY INVESTIGATING A

01:05.966 --> 01:07.734
WEBSITE THAT CONTAINS PICTURES

01:07.734 --> 01:09.803
OF 21-YEAR OLD DYLANN STORM ROOF

01:09.803 --> 01:11.471
WHICH WERE POSTED ALONG WITH

01:11.471 --> 01:13.073
WHAT IS DESCRIBED AS A WHITE

01:13.073 --> 01:14.708
SUPREMACIST MANIFESTO.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.109
ROOF APPEARS TO BE POSING IN

01:16.109 --> 01:17.344
DOZENS OF PICTURES, HOLDING

01:17.344 --> 01:19.012
WEAPONS, BURNING FLAGS AND

01:19.012 --> 01:20.480
VISITING CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS'

01:20.480 --> 01:21.348
GRAVES.

01:21.348 --> 01:22.382
SOME OF THE PHOTOS APPEAR TO

01:22.382 --> 01:23.617
HAVE BEEN TAKEN JUST HOURS

01:23.617 --> 01:24.952
BEFORE THE SHOOTING.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.320
IT IS NOT CLEAR WHO WROTE THE

01:26.320 --> 01:28.455
MANIFESTO OR TOOK THE PICTURES.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.090
BUT IN A SECTION TITLED "AN

01:30.090 --> 01:32.726
EXPLANATION," THE AUTHOR WROTE

01:32.726 --> 01:34.661
THAT CHARLESTON DOESN'T HAVE ANY

01:34.661 --> 01:37.130
SKINHEADS OR REAL KKK, SO,"

01:37.130 --> 01:39.232
WELL, SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE THE

01:39.232 --> 01:40.834
BRAVERY TO TAKE IT TO THE REAL

01:40.834 --> 01:42.336
WORLD, AND I GUESS THAT HAS TO

01:42.336 --> 01:43.437
BE ME."

01:43.437 --> 01:44.838
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN FRIEND OF

01:44.838 --> 01:46.006
THE SUSPECT TOLD THE ASSOCIATED

01:46.006 --> 01:47.407
PRESS THAT HE HAD BEEN DRINKING

01:47.407 --> 01:49.343
WITH ROOF AND OTHERS LAST WEEK

01:49.343 --> 01:50.744
WHEN ROOF ANNOUNCED HE WAS

01:50.744 --> 01:52.512
PLANNING A MASS SHOOTING AT THE

01:52.512 --> 01:54.114
COLLEGE OF CHARLESTON.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.983
CHRISTON SCRIVEN SAID HE THOUGHT

01:55.983 --> 01:57.918
IT WAS JUST DRUNKEN BLUSTER, BUT

01:57.918 --> 01:59.553
ANOTHER FRIEND HID ROOF'S

01:59.553 --> 02:02.422
HANDGUN UNTIL ROOF SOBERED UP.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.558
>> I DON'T EVEN THINK THE CHURCH

02:04.558 --> 02:06.893
WAS HIS PRIMARY TARGET, BECAUSE

02:06.893 --> 02:08.328
HE WENT, HE TOLD US HE WAS GOING

02:08.328 --> 02:10.330
FOR THE SCHOOL, BUT I THINK HE

02:10.330 --> 02:11.398
>> Sreenivasan: TONIGHT, WE'RE

02:11.398 --> 02:12.666
ALSO LEARNING THAT ROOF WAS ABLE

02:12.666 --> 02:13.800
TO GET THAT GUN THROUGH A

02:13.800 --> 02:14.735
LOOPHOLE IN THE GUN LAWS.

02:14.735 --> 02:16.470
FEDERAL LAW PROHIBITS DEALERS

02:16.470 --> 02:17.804
FROM SELLING A FIREARM TO

02:17.804 --> 02:18.805
SOMEONE FACING PENDING FELONY

02:18.805 --> 02:19.840
CHARGES.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.241
ROOF, WHO WAS CHARGED WITH

02:21.241 --> 02:22.743
POSSESSION OF SUBOXONE, A

02:22.743 --> 02:24.211
PRESCRIPTION NARCOTIC, HAD

02:24.211 --> 02:26.246
ACCESS TO THE WEAPON BECAUSE,

02:26.246 --> 02:27.547
ACCORDING TO THE "WASHINGTON

02:27.547 --> 02:29.716
POST," HE GOT THE GUN FROM HIS

02:29.716 --> 02:31.385
FATHER AS A GIFT, MAKING IT A

02:31.385 --> 02:33.687
PRIVATE GUN TRANSACTION WITH NO

02:33.687 --> 02:35.255
REQUIRED BACKGROUND CHECK IN THE

02:35.255 --> 02:36.590
STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA.

02:36.590 --> 02:37.924
DYLANN ROOF'S FAMILY ISSUED A

02:37.924 --> 02:39.059
STATEMENT LATE LAST NIGHT,

02:39.059 --> 02:40.761
SAYING THE FAMILY IS DEVASTATED

02:40.761 --> 02:42.062
AND PRAYING FOR PEACE AND

02:42.062 --> 02:43.130
HEALING.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.164
THE JUDGE IN THE CASE CALLED FOR

02:44.164 --> 02:45.332
SYMPATHY AND HELP FOR THE

02:45.332 --> 02:47.567
VICTIMS INCLUDING ROOF'S FAMILY

02:47.567 --> 02:48.668
MEMBERS.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.703
LAST NIGHT, CHURCH AND CITY

02:49.703 --> 02:50.771
LEADERS IN CHARLESTON SPOKE

02:50.771 --> 02:52.272
ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE VIOLENCE

02:52.272 --> 02:54.007
ON THEIR COMMUNITY:

02:54.007 --> 02:56.843
>> WE'RE HERE TO ENCOURAGE THE

02:56.843 --> 03:00.313
NINE FAMILIES, THE LEADERSHIP

03:00.313 --> 03:04.251
OF THE CHURCH, TO ACKNOWLEDGE

03:04.251 --> 03:06.653
AND WRESTLE WITH WHAT MUST BE

03:06.653 --> 03:09.689
DONE ABOUT THE VIOLENCE THAT

03:09.689 --> 03:12.092
TOOK NINE LIVES WHILE THEY

03:12.092 --> 03:15.595
SPREAD THE WORD OF GOD, AND

03:15.595 --> 03:18.031
FELLOWSHIP, ONE WITH THE OTHER.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.566
>> IF THAT YOUNG MAN THOUGHT HE

03:19.566 --> 03:21.435
WAS GOING DIVIDE THIS COMMUNITY

03:21.435 --> 03:23.136
OR DIVIDE THIS COUNTRY WITH HIS

03:23.136 --> 03:25.005
RACIAL HATRED, HE MISERABLY

03:25.005 --> 03:26.039
FAILED.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.742
CONGREGATIONS ACROSS CHARLESTON

03:28.742 --> 03:30.110
ARE SYNCHRONIZING THEIR CHURCH

03:30.110 --> 03:31.912
BELLS AS A SIGN OF UNITY TO RING

03:31.912 --> 03:34.014
THEM ALL EXACTLY AT 10:00 A.M.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.282
TOMORROW.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.183
>> Sreenivasan: REUTERS REPORTER

03:36.183 --> 03:37.551
LUCIANA LOPEZ HAS BEEN IN SOUTH

03:37.551 --> 03:38.752
CAROLINA COVERING THE STORY.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.387
SHE JOINS ME NOW FROM MOUNT

03:40.387 --> 03:41.621
PLEASANT SOUTH CAROLINA.

03:41.621 --> 03:43.990
WHAT MORE DO WE KNOW TODAY ABOUT

03:43.990 --> 03:47.594
DYLANN ROOF AND HIS MOTIVATIONS?

03:47.594 --> 03:49.996
>> WELL, ONE INTERESTING THING

03:49.996 --> 03:51.731
THAT SURFACED IS THAT WHAT

03:51.731 --> 03:53.600
APPEARED TO BE A WHITE

03:53.600 --> 03:55.335
SUPREMACIST MANIFESTO HAS

03:55.335 --> 03:57.270
SURFACED, AND WE'RE TRYING TO

03:57.270 --> 03:59.439
VERIFY THAT THIS DOES, INDEED,

03:59.439 --> 04:01.241
COME FROM DYLANN ROOF, BUT IT

04:01.241 --> 04:02.976
LAYS OUT A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HOW

04:02.976 --> 04:05.078
HE WAS RADICALIZED, LOOKING UP

04:05.078 --> 04:06.246
INFORMATION ABOUT TRAYVON

04:06.246 --> 04:07.681
MARTIN, AND IT LAYS OUT SOME OF

04:07.681 --> 04:10.217
HIS FEELINGS ABOUT OTHER RACIAL

04:10.217 --> 04:12.185
GROUPS AS WELL.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.820
AGAIN, WE'RE TRYING TO VERIFY

04:13.820 --> 04:15.188
THAT THIS IS, INDEED, HIS, BUT

04:15.188 --> 04:16.490
THIS GOES A LITTLE BIT DEEPER

04:16.490 --> 04:18.592
INTO HIS IDEOLOGY.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.392
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHAT'S IN

04:19.392 --> 04:20.293
THERE?

04:20.293 --> 04:22.529
WHAT DOES HE THINK OF AND WAS

04:22.529 --> 04:23.697
THERE AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY HE

04:23.697 --> 04:26.566
DID THIS?

04:26.566 --> 04:27.968
>> THERE IS AN EXPLANATION OF

04:27.968 --> 04:28.835
SORT.

04:28.835 --> 04:29.870
AGAIN, HE TALKS ABOUT HOW HE WAS

04:29.870 --> 04:31.037
RADICALIZED AND LOOKING UP

04:31.037 --> 04:33.540
INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT

04:33.540 --> 04:35.208
RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE

04:35.208 --> 04:37.377
UNITED STATES, AND HE SAYS HE'S

04:37.377 --> 04:38.879
PICKED CHARLESTON, IN FACT,

04:38.879 --> 04:40.680
BECAUSE OF ITS SIGNIFICANCE, AND

04:40.680 --> 04:42.082
BECAUSE OF ITS HISTORICAL

04:42.082 --> 04:43.450
SIGNIFICANCE.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.318
AND HE SAYS HE FELT LIKE HE

04:45.318 --> 04:46.553
REALLY NEEDED TO MAKE A

04:46.553 --> 04:48.121
STATEMENT AND THAT WAS REALLY

04:48.121 --> 04:49.489
THE PLACE TO DO IT.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.924
AND HE ALSO IMPLIES THAT THERE

04:50.924 --> 04:52.859
WASN'T ANYONE ELSE TO DO THIS,

04:52.859 --> 04:54.161
AND SO HE FELT LIKE THIS WAS

04:54.161 --> 04:55.962
SOMETHING THAT HE HAD SOME SORT

04:55.962 --> 04:57.164
OF MISSION TO GO OUT THERE TO

04:57.164 --> 04:58.365
DO.

04:58.365 --> 04:59.166
>> Sreenivasan: YOU'VE BEEN

04:59.166 --> 05:00.734
REPORTING THERE SINCE THIS

05:00.734 --> 05:02.335
TRAGEDY HAPPENED.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.870
HAS THE DISCUSSION STARTED TO

05:03.870 --> 05:07.374
INCLUDE THE CONFEDERATE FLAG OR

05:07.374 --> 05:09.442
GUN CONTROL, OR IS IT STILL JUST

05:09.442 --> 05:12.479
PEOPLE GRIEVING RIGHT NOW?

05:12.479 --> 05:13.747
>> THERE'S BEEN QUITE A LOT OF

05:13.747 --> 05:15.182
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE CONFEDERATE

05:15.182 --> 05:16.049
FLAG.

05:16.049 --> 05:18.618
IN FACT, IT'S EMERGED AS ONE OF

05:18.618 --> 05:20.153
THE FLASHPOINT HERE FOR

05:20.153 --> 05:21.488
DISCUSSIONS.

05:21.488 --> 05:23.023
SO, FOR EXAMPLE, YESTERDAY AT

05:23.023 --> 05:25.025
N.A.A.C.P., THERE WAS A LOT OF

05:25.025 --> 05:26.293
DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW THE FLAG

05:26.293 --> 05:28.361
NEEDS TO COME DOWN BECAUSE IT IS

05:28.361 --> 05:31.298
VIEWED AS A SYMBOL OF HATRED AND

05:31.298 --> 05:33.233
VERY SAD TIME IN AMERICAN

05:33.233 --> 05:34.501
HISTORY.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.203
I WAS ACTUALLY JUST AT A CHURCH

05:36.203 --> 05:38.505
EARLIER TODAY, AND THE PASTOR

05:38.505 --> 05:40.373
THERE, NELSON RIVERS, TALKED

05:40.373 --> 05:41.841
ABOUT THE CONFEDERATE FLAG, AND

05:41.841 --> 05:43.810
HE DIRECTLY ADDRESSED PEOPLE WHO

05:43.810 --> 05:45.345
SAID, "OH, THE FLAG IS A SYMBOL

05:45.345 --> 05:46.980
OF SOUTHERN HERITAGE."

05:46.980 --> 05:49.216
AND HIS RESPONSE WAS, "I KNOW

05:49.216 --> 05:50.350
WHAT TIME IT IS."

05:50.350 --> 05:52.886
AND HE ACTUALLY CALLED WORSHIP

05:52.886 --> 05:54.321
OF THE FLAG, IN A SENSE,

05:54.321 --> 05:56.189
IDOLATRY AND HE SAID THE LIVES

05:56.189 --> 05:57.891
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED IN

05:57.891 --> 06:00.660
THIS TRAGEDY ARE MORE IMPORTANT.

06:00.660 --> 06:01.928
IN FACT, WE EVEN HAD MITT ROMNEY

06:01.928 --> 06:03.797
TWEETING OUT TODAY ABOUT THE

06:03.797 --> 06:05.031
CONFEDERATE FLAG AND ABOUT

06:05.031 --> 06:06.266
TAKING IT DOWN, WHICH WAS PRETTY

06:06.266 --> 06:07.300
SIGNIFICANT.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.668
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT ABOUT

06:08.668 --> 06:11.571
THE CONVERSATIONS ON THE STREETS

06:11.571 --> 06:13.673
WHEN YOU TALK TO PEOPLE?

06:13.673 --> 06:15.208
THIS IS ONE SPECIFIC CHURCH IN

06:15.208 --> 06:17.043
ONE SPECIFIC PART OF TOWN.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.579
HOW HAS THIS IMPACTED ALL OF

06:19.579 --> 06:22.415
CHARLESTON?

06:22.415 --> 06:24.017
>> WELL, THIS IS ONE SPECIFIC

06:24.017 --> 06:25.418
CHURCH, BUT IT'S A CHURCH WITH A

06:25.418 --> 06:27.821
LONG AND STORIED HISTORY, AND

06:27.821 --> 06:29.723
IT'S A CHURCH THAT'S VIEWED AS,

06:29.723 --> 06:31.358
IN SOME SENSE, BELONGING TO ALL

06:31.358 --> 06:32.993
OF CHARLESTON, NOT JUST THE

06:32.993 --> 06:34.828
PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED IT.

06:34.828 --> 06:35.996
AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK

06:35.996 --> 06:37.764
HAS REALLY SHAKEN PEOPLE BECAUSE

06:37.764 --> 06:39.899
THERE IS A STRONG TRADITION OF

06:39.899 --> 06:41.701
CHURCHGOING HERE IN TOWN, AND

06:41.701 --> 06:43.970
THERE IS THIS IDEA THAT CHURCH

06:43.970 --> 06:45.839
SAY HOLY SPACE, AND THAT SOMEONE

06:45.839 --> 06:47.974
COULD COME INTO THIS HOLY SPACE

06:47.974 --> 06:49.109
AND TRY TO TURN IT INTO

06:49.109 --> 06:50.510
SOMETHING ELSE, TRY TO TAKE IT

06:50.510 --> 06:52.178
AWAY, THAT'S HIT PEOPLE VERY

06:52.178 --> 06:53.446
CLOSE TO HOME.

06:53.446 --> 06:54.848
WHETHER OR NOT THEY GO TO MOTHER

06:54.848 --> 06:56.549
EMANUEL, WHETHER OR NOT THEY'VE

06:56.549 --> 06:58.518
EVER EVEN SET FOOT HERE.

06:58.518 --> 06:59.686
FOR EXAMPLE, I SPOKE WITH ONE

06:59.686 --> 07:01.888
MAN LAST NIGHT WHO WAS THERE FOR

07:01.888 --> 07:03.523
THE SECOND DAY IN A ROW AT THE

07:03.523 --> 07:05.091
CHURCH TO PAY HIS RESPECTS.

07:05.091 --> 07:06.860
HE DOESN'T GO TO THAT CHURCH.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.261
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYONE, IN FACT,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.030
WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THIS

07:10.030 --> 07:11.631
TRAGEDY, BUT WHAT HE SAID WAS

07:11.631 --> 07:13.133
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR HIM TO

07:13.133 --> 07:15.135
GO THERE SO THAT HE CAN REMEMBER

07:15.135 --> 07:17.304
WHAT THIS FEELS LIKE, SO THAT HE

07:17.304 --> 07:18.738
DOESN'T LET THIS BECOME JUST

07:18.738 --> 07:20.106
PART OF THE BACKGROUND NOISE OF

07:20.106 --> 07:21.708
LIFE BUT THAT THIS IS IN FACT

07:21.708 --> 07:23.043
SOMETHING THAT COULD SPUR HIM

07:23.043 --> 07:25.312
TOWARD LOVING PEOPLE MORE AND IN

07:25.312 --> 07:26.946
FACT, TOWARD LIVING A BETTER

07:26.946 --> 07:28.381
LIFE.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.616

07:29.616 --> 07:31.184
NOT PERSONALLY INVOLVED IN THIS

07:31.184 --> 07:32.352
AT ALL.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.586
BUT IT STILL MEANT SOMETHING

07:33.586 --> 07:34.854
VERY DEEP TO HIM, AND SOMETHING

07:34.854 --> 07:36.389
THAT HE VERY SPECIFICALLY WANTED

07:36.389 --> 07:37.524
TO TAKE WITH HIM INTO THE

07:37.524 --> 07:38.391

07:46.533 --> 07:47.434
TRUSTEES WHO IS ALSO A

07:47.434 --> 07:48.435
CHARLESTON CITY COUNCILMAN,

07:48.435 --> 07:49.502
WILLIAM DUDLEY GREGORIE.

07:49.502 --> 07:50.837
HE CALLS THE SHOOTINGS RACIALLY

07:50.837 --> 07:52.038
MOTIVATED TERRORISM.

07:52.038 --> 07:53.273
THANKS FOR JOINING ME.

07:53.273 --> 07:54.974
THERE SEEM TO BE COMPETING

07:54.974 --> 07:57.077
NARRATIVES HERE, ON THE ONE HAND

07:57.077 --> 07:59.479
THAT THIS IS A CRAZY INDIVIDUAL,

07:59.479 --> 08:00.613
AND ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT THIS

08:00.613 --> 08:03.316
IS A SYMPTOM OF DEEPER SYSTEMIC

08:03.316 --> 08:04.784
RACISM IN YOUR CITY OR YOUR

08:04.784 --> 08:07.821
STATE.

08:07.821 --> 08:12.058
I THINK THAT IT IS DOMESTIC

08:12.058 --> 08:15.061
TERRORISM BECAUSE I DO THINK

08:15.061 --> 08:16.696
THAT THE BASIS OF TERRORISM IS

08:16.696 --> 08:18.264
HATE.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.834
HOWEVER, I THINK IT'S VERY

08:20.834 --> 08:23.036
IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THE

08:23.036 --> 08:25.839
GUNMAN IS NOT FROM THE CITY OF

08:25.839 --> 08:27.607
CHARLESTON.

08:27.607 --> 08:30.143
THE GUNMAN IS FROM ABOUT 100,

08:30.143 --> 08:32.812
125 MILES AWAY.

08:32.812 --> 08:36.116
OUR CITY IS A CITY THAT IS ONE

08:36.116 --> 08:39.419
CHARLESTON, AND WE CLEARLY FEEL

08:39.419 --> 08:42.355
THAT WITH THIS INCIDENT-- WHAT

08:42.355 --> 08:43.790
THIS INCIDENT HAS DONE IS MAKE

08:43.790 --> 08:47.861
OUR ONE CHARLESTON MORE AND MORE

08:47.861 --> 08:49.662
COMING TOGETHER AS ONE.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.097
>> Sreenivasan: SO YOU'VE ALSO

08:51.097 --> 08:53.066
HAD THE UNFORTUNATE CASE OF THE

08:53.066 --> 08:54.601
WALTER SCOTT SHOOTING JUST A

08:54.601 --> 08:55.702
COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.703
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND IN THE

08:56.703 --> 08:58.605
AFTERMATH OF THE-- IN TERMS OF

08:58.605 --> 09:00.073
RACIAL TENSIONS THAT MIGHT

09:00.073 --> 09:02.876
EXIST?

09:02.876 --> 09:04.077
>> I THINK SO THAT WE HAVE TO

09:04.077 --> 09:07.180
REALLY SEPARATE.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.883
THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

09:09.883 --> 09:12.552
THE CITY OF CHARLESTON AND THE

09:12.552 --> 09:15.989
CITY OF NORTH CHARLESTON WHERE

09:15.989 --> 09:17.857
THE WALTER SCOTT INCIDENT

09:17.857 --> 09:19.993
OCCURRED.

09:19.993 --> 09:25.899
AND I HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF

09:25.899 --> 09:27.500
RESPECT FOR MAYOR SUMY, WHO FROM

09:27.500 --> 09:31.004
THE ONSET, WAS VERY CLEAR THAT,

09:31.004 --> 09:32.572
THAT WAS A WRONG DEED THAT

09:32.572 --> 09:35.909
OCCURRED, AND THE OFFICER WHO

09:35.909 --> 09:38.445
WAS INVOLVED SHOULD BE PUNISHED

09:38.445 --> 09:40.113
ACCORDINGLY.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.614
BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

09:41.614 --> 09:43.917
TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW

09:43.917 --> 09:46.519
THAT THESE ARE TWO DISTINCT

09:46.519 --> 09:48.788
CITIES-- THE CITY OF CHARLESTON

09:48.788 --> 09:49.956
AND THE CITY OF NORTH

09:49.956 --> 09:50.857
CHARLESTON.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.258
>> Sreenivasan: EVEN IF YOU

09:52.258 --> 09:54.060
LOOKED AT YOUR CITY DISCRETELY

09:54.060 --> 09:55.995
FROM NORTH CHARLESTON OR THE

09:55.995 --> 09:57.564
STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, THERE

09:57.564 --> 09:59.132
SEEM TO BE THESE COMPETING OR

09:59.132 --> 10:00.300
CONFLICTING FACTS.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.968

10:12.178 --> 10:14.514

10:14.514 --> 10:17.851
STEPS OF THE STATE CAPITOL.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.153
>> WELL, FOR ME RIGHT NOW, WE

10:20.153 --> 10:22.489
ARE GOING TO HAVE TIME TO DEAL

10:22.489 --> 10:23.756
WITH THAT ISSUE.

10:23.756 --> 10:28.094
BUT AS A MEMBER OF EMANUEL, A

10:28.094 --> 10:30.563
LIFELONG MEMBER, WHAT WE WANT TO

10:30.563 --> 10:32.866
FOCUS ON AS A CHURCH AND AS A

10:36.503 --> 10:39.706
THROUGH THE HEALING PROCESS SO

10:39.706 --> 10:41.908
THAT WE CAN GET TO FORGIVENESS

10:41.908 --> 10:44.110
AND MOVE FORWARD ACCORDINGLY.

10:44.110 --> 10:45.411
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A LOT OF

10:45.411 --> 10:47.380
TIME TO DISCUSS THE CONFEDERATE

10:47.380 --> 10:50.316
FLAG AND GUN CONTROL.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.018
BUT RIGHT NOW, WHAT WE WANT TO

10:52.018 --> 10:55.555
DO IS FOCUS ON OUR EMANUEL

10:55.555 --> 10:57.957
A.M.E. FAMILY AS WE GET THROUGH

10:57.957 --> 11:00.426
THIS CRISIS AND HEAL AND

11:00.426 --> 11:02.028
FORGIVE.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.430
SO UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, AT

11:04.430 --> 11:06.065
LEAST AS A MEMBER OF THE EMANUEL

11:06.065 --> 11:09.168
CHURCH, ARE WE GOING TO ENGAGE

11:09.168 --> 11:12.572
IN POLITICIZING THE DEATH OF

11:12.572 --> 11:15.475
NINE OF OUR PARISHIONERS OF

11:15.475 --> 11:18.344
WHICH WE NOW HAVE TO PLAN FOR

11:18.344 --> 11:20.713
NINE FUNERALS.

11:20.713 --> 11:23.016
SO WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF TIME

11:23.016 --> 11:25.118
AFTER WE BURY OUR DEAD TO DEAL

11:25.118 --> 11:26.719
WITH THE POLITICAL ISSUES THAT

11:26.719 --> 11:30.490
YOU JUST QUESTIONED ME ON.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.991
>> Sreenivasan: SO YESTERDAY

11:31.991 --> 11:33.359
ONE OF THE MOST MOVING THINGS I

11:33.359 --> 11:34.961
THINK FOR ANYONE WATCHING IN THE

11:34.961 --> 11:36.596
COUNTRY WAS LISTENING TO THE

11:36.596 --> 11:39.098
AUDIO OF FAMILY MEMBERS LOOKING

11:39.098 --> 11:41.167
AT THE PERSON OR THE SUSPECT WHO

11:41.167 --> 11:42.335
COULD HAVE TAKEN THE LIVES OF

11:42.335 --> 11:43.937
THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS AND

11:43.937 --> 11:45.204
FORGIVING THEM.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.372
I MEAN, JUST THE POWER OF

11:46.372 --> 11:48.241
WITNESSING AND HEARING SOMEONE

11:48.241 --> 11:49.175
FORGIVE.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.376
WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND?

11:50.376 --> 11:51.844
THESE ARE-- THESE ARE FELLOW

COMMUNITY.

11:55.315 --> 11:58.952
>> AND I WAS NOT SHOCKED AT ALL

11:58.952 --> 12:02.155
BECAUSE MOTHER EMANUEL A.M.E.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.892
CHURCH IS A FORGIVING BODY.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.227

12:08.227 --> 12:11.664
FIGHT HATE WITH HATE, THEN YOU

12:11.664 --> 12:14.200
ALSO HAVE FAILED.

12:22.976 --> 12:25.478
IS ABOUT HOPE.

WITHOUT HOPE IS LIKE LIVING IN

CONTINUOUS DARKNESS.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.052
ACCORDING TO THE F.B.I., VIOLENT

15:53.052 --> 15:54.954
CRIME NUMBERS HAVE STEADILY BEEN

15:54.954 --> 15:56.122
DECLINING OVER THE LAST TWO

15:56.122 --> 15:57.523
DECADES, BUT WHAT ABOUT HATE

15:57.523 --> 15:59.592
CRIMES?

15:59.592 --> 16:01.060
>> HATE CRIMES ARE BASICALLY

16:01.060 --> 16:02.595
FLAT, AND THAT'S KIND OF AN

16:02.595 --> 16:03.963
INTERESTING-- IT'S AN

16:03.963 --> 16:05.398
INTERESTING SLICE OF DATA.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.066
BASICALLY, THERE ARE NUMBERS

16:07.066 --> 16:08.401
FROM BOTH THE F.B.I. AND THE

16:08.401 --> 16:09.902
BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.270
THE BUREAU OF JUSTICE STATISTICS

16:11.270 --> 16:13.639
SHOWS THERE ARE ABOUT 300,000

16:13.639 --> 16:15.441
HATE CRIMES EACH YEAR.

16:15.441 --> 16:16.542
AND THAT'S BEEN PRETTY STEADY

16:16.542 --> 16:19.045
GOING ALL THE WAY BACK TO 2004.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.046
AND ONE OF THE REALLY

16:20.046 --> 16:21.414
INTERESTING THINGS IS THAT THIS

16:21.414 --> 16:23.382
NUMBER HAS HELD STEADY, EVEN AS

16:23.382 --> 16:25.117
THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE HATE GROUPS

16:25.117 --> 16:26.085
IN THE UNITED STATES HAS

16:26.085 --> 16:27.119
DECREASED, ACCORDING TO THE

16:27.119 --> 16:29.088
SOUTHERN POVERTY LAW CENTER.

16:29.088 --> 16:29.989
AND ONE THING THAT A LOT OF

16:29.989 --> 16:31.624
PEOPLE THINKS IS HAPPENING IS.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.861
TOINTS TO LONE WOLF ACTORS, LIKE

16:34.861 --> 16:36.028
POTENTIALLY THE SITUATION IN

16:36.028 --> 16:37.129
CHARLESTON.

16:37.129 --> 16:38.397
AND THAT'S A CONCERNING

16:38.397 --> 16:39.498
DEVELOPMENT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

16:39.498 --> 16:40.199
OFFICIALS.

16:40.199 --> 16:41.133
>> Sreenivasan: SO ARE THE

16:41.133 --> 16:42.468
TARGETS STILL THE SAME PEOPLE,

16:42.468 --> 16:44.437
WHETHER THEY'RE FROM HATE GROUPS

16:44.437 --> 16:45.805
OR LONE WOLFS?

16:45.805 --> 16:47.573
>> YES.

16:47.573 --> 16:48.941
SO, YOU KNOW, THE NUMBERS AND

16:48.941 --> 16:50.009
THE RATES SEEM TO BE PRETTY

16:50.009 --> 16:50.843
STEADY.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.245
AMONG RACIAL GROUPS, AFRICAN

16:52.245 --> 16:53.579
AMERICANS EXPERIENCE THE MOST

16:53.579 --> 16:54.447
HATE CRIME.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.448
THEY'RE THE ONES MOST LIKELY TO

16:55.448 --> 16:57.116
BE TARGETED.

16:57.116 --> 16:58.217
THEY'RE BASICALLY-- THEIR

16:58.217 --> 16:59.785
CHANCES OF BEING TARGET FORWARD

16:59.785 --> 17:01.454
A HATE ATTACK ARE ROUGHLY DOUBLE

17:01.454 --> 17:02.755
ANY OTHER GROUP AND IT'S MORE

17:02.755 --> 17:04.123
THAN 10 TIMES THAT FOR WHITE

17:04.123 --> 17:05.258
PEOPLE.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.592
SO AMONG RACIAL GROUPS, BLACKS

17:06.592 --> 17:07.493
ARE DEFINITELY THE MOST

17:07.493 --> 17:08.461
TARGETED.

17:08.461 --> 17:09.629
YOU ALSO SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF

17:09.629 --> 17:11.297
ATTACKS BASED ON GENDER TOWARDS

17:11.297 --> 17:12.865
GAY MEN AND ALSO A FAIR AMOUNT

17:12.865 --> 17:14.800
OF ATTACKS BASED ON RELIGION

17:14.800 --> 17:17.169
TOWARDS JEWISH PEOPLE PRIMARILY.

17:17.169 --> 17:18.104
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHAT ABOUT

17:18.104 --> 17:20.539
THE VERACITY OF THE NUMBERS?

17:20.539 --> 17:21.774
IS THERE A POSSIBILITY FOR

17:21.774 --> 17:22.975
UNDERCOUNTING?

17:22.975 --> 17:23.976
YOU SAID THERE ARE MULTIPLE

17:23.976 --> 17:25.611
AGENCIES THAT TRACK THIS.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.113
>> ABSOLUTELY.

17:27.113 --> 17:28.681
SO THE F.B.I.'S NUMBERS, THEY

17:28.681 --> 17:30.616
PROVIDE THE BEST BREAKDOWNS OF

17:30.616 --> 17:31.817
INDIVIDUAL RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS

17:31.817 --> 17:32.818
GROUPS.

17:32.818 --> 17:33.786
BUT IN TERMS OF THE ACTUAL

17:33.786 --> 17:35.054
NUMBERS THAT THEY TRACK,

17:35.054 --> 17:36.088
EVERYONE AGREES THAT THOSE ARE

17:36.088 --> 17:37.823
PRETTY MUCH A VERY SERIOUS

17:37.823 --> 17:39.258
UNDERCOUNT BECAUSE THE F.B.I.

17:39.258 --> 17:41.560
ONLY TRACKS CRIMES THAT ARE

17:41.560 --> 17:43.162
SPECIFICALLY CATEGORIZED AS A

17:43.162 --> 17:45.298
HATE CRIME BY THEM.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.999
AND SO THAT MEANS THAT THEY HAVE

17:46.999 --> 17:48.434
TO HAVE SPECIFIC CONCRETE

17:48.434 --> 17:50.536
EVIDENCE OF A RACIAL BIAS.

17:50.536 --> 17:51.871
NOW, THE INTERESTING THING IF

17:51.871 --> 17:52.838
YOU LOOK AT THE BUREAU OF

17:52.838 --> 17:54.774
JUSTICE STATISTICS NUMBERS, THEY

17:54.774 --> 17:56.943
SHOW ABOUT FIVE TIMES MORE

17:56.943 --> 17:58.611
RACIALLY BIASED ATTACKS THAN THE

17:58.611 --> 18:00.012
F.B.I. DOES.

18:00.012 --> 18:01.414
AND THE WAY THEY DO THAT IS THEY

18:01.414 --> 18:02.581
JUST GO OUT AND THEY INTERVIEW

18:02.581 --> 18:04.183
VICTIMS OF ALL CRIMES AND THEY

18:04.183 --> 18:05.551
ASK THE VICTIMS, "DO YOU FEEL

18:05.551 --> 18:07.053
YOU WERE TARGETED BASED ON YOUR

18:07.053 --> 18:08.621
RACE OR YOUR RELIGION?"

18:08.621 --> 18:11.624
BASICALLY THE F.B.I. NUMBERS

18:11.624 --> 18:13.793
SHOW ABOUT 6,000 HATE CRIMES PER

18:13.793 --> 18:16.395
YEAR, WHILE THE BUREAU OF

18:16.395 --> 18:18.364
JUSTICE STATISTICS NUMBERS SHOW

18:18.364 --> 18:20.199
CLOSE TO 300,000 HATE CRIMES A

18:20.199 --> 18:21.968
YEAR WHICH IS JUST A HUGE ORDER

18:21.968 --> 18:23.703
OF MAGNITUDE DIFFERENCE, AND

18:23.703 --> 18:24.737
THAT DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE

18:24.737 --> 18:26.072
THEY'RE INTERVIEWING PEOPLE,

18:26.072 --> 18:27.273
THEY ARE ASKING THEM, "DO YOU

18:27.273 --> 18:28.574
FEEL LIKE YOU WERE TARGETED

18:28.574 --> 18:29.976
BECAUSE OF YOUR RACE OR YOUR

18:29.976 --> 18:31.410
IDENTITY OR WHO YOU ARE?"

18:31.410 --> 18:32.445
>> Sreenivasan: AND THEN WHAT

18:32.445 --> 18:33.379
ABOUT ALL OF THE DIFFERENT

18:33.379 --> 18:34.180
JURISDICTIONS?

18:34.180 --> 18:36.716
ARE THEY ALL REQUIRED TO REPORT

18:36.716 --> 18:38.484
EVERY CRIME POTENTIALLY A HATE

18:38.484 --> 18:39.752
CRIME OR NOT, TO EITHER THE

18:39.752 --> 18:43.089
F.B.I. OR THE OTHER BUREAU?

18:43.089 --> 18:44.023
>> YEAH, SO THAT'S BEEN A BIG

18:44.023 --> 18:45.224
PROBLEM WITH THE F.B.I.'S

18:45.224 --> 18:46.492
NUMBERS AND YOU SEE THIS IN A

18:46.492 --> 18:47.226
LOT OF THINGS.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.260
YOU SEE THIS WITH

18:48.260 --> 18:49.161
POLICE-INVOLVED SHOOTINGS.

18:49.161 --> 18:49.895
YOU SEE THIS IN ALL SORTS OF

18:49.895 --> 18:50.696
AREAS.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.498
THE F.B.I. NUMBERS -- BASICALLY,

18:52.498 --> 18:53.966
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS REPORT THEM

18:53.966 --> 18:56.602
VOLUNTARILY SO THEY'RE NOT

18:56.602 --> 18:58.771
MANDATE TO DO SO BY ANY MEANS,

18:58.771 --> 19:00.406
AND THAT CAN BE A REAL ISSUE.

19:00.406 --> 19:01.707
SO SOME STATES DO A MUCH BETTER

19:01.707 --> 19:04.076
JOB OF THIS THAN OTHER ONES DO.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.244
SO THAT'S WHY IF YOU'RE LOOKING

19:05.244 --> 19:06.812
TO GET A REALLY GOOD COUNT OF

19:06.812 --> 19:08.414
THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE OF THESE

19:08.414 --> 19:10.816
INCIDENTS AROUND THE U.S., IT'S

19:10.816 --> 19:12.251
GOOD TO RELY ON THE BUREAU OF

19:12.251 --> 19:14.320
JUSTICE STATISTICS, AND THEY--

19:14.320 --> 19:16.055
THEIR SAMPLE, IT'S A NATIONAL

19:16.055 --> 19:18.157
PROBABILITY SAMPLE OF CRIMINAL--

19:18.157 --> 19:20.926
OF CRIME VICTIMS, AND SO THEY

19:20.926 --> 19:22.595
PAINT A MORE ACCURATE PICTURE OF

19:22.595 --> 19:24.697
THE OVERALL MAGNITUDE TODAY.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.831
THE TRADEOFF THERE IS THEY DON'T

19:25.831 --> 19:26.999
HAVE QUITE AS DETAILED

19:26.999 --> 19:28.367
BREAKDOWNS OF WHO THE VICTIMS

19:28.367 --> 19:30.636
ARE OR OF WHAT THE MOTIVATIONS

19:30.636 --> 19:32.071
ARE AS THE F.B.I. DOES.

19:32.071 --> 19:32.805
>> Sreenivasan: CHRISTOPHER

19:48.187 --> 19:49.355
KILLED THIS WEEK IN THE

19:49.355 --> 19:50.523
CHARLESTON SHOOTINGS, SPOKE

19:50.523 --> 19:52.158
ABOUT WHY BLACK PARTICIPATION IN

19:52.158 --> 19:54.026
ELECTIONS MATTERS.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.928
>> WE BIND TO THIS WHOLE IDEA

19:55.928 --> 19:57.563
OTHER PEOPLE HAVE PERPETUATED

19:57.563 --> 19:59.965
THAT OUR VOTE DOESN'T COUNT.

19:59.965 --> 20:03.469
WE DON'T HAVE THAT CHOICE.

20:03.469 --> 20:06.472
WE DON'T HAVE THAT-- YOU KNOW,

20:06.472 --> 20:07.840
WE DON'T HAVE THAT PRIVILEGE TO

20:07.840 --> 20:09.475
SAY, "OUR VOTE DOESN'T COUNT"

20:09.475 --> 20:10.276
BECAUSE HISTORY TELLS US

20:10.276 --> 20:11.143
DIFFERENTLY.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.044
>> Sreenivasan: VISIT

VERDICT IN A POLICE SHOOTING

20:28.227 --> 20:29.628
FORMER POLICE CHIEF OF

ARGUMENT OVER HIS DAUGHTER'S

20:35.501 --> 20:36.702

20:36.702 --> 20:38.104
BAILEY HAD COME TO THE TOWN HALL

20:38.104 --> 20:39.605
TO SPEAK WITH THE POLICE CHIEF.

20:39.605 --> 20:40.840
THE CHIEF TRIED TO SERVE HIM

20:40.840 --> 20:42.108
WITH AN ARREST WARRANT FOR

20:42.108 --> 20:43.342
OBSTRUCTION, AND ENDED UP

21:21.714 --> 21:23.482
THE LAW GOES INTO EFFECT JANUARY

21:23.482 --> 21:24.950
FIRST.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.519
AN IOWA SUPREME COURT DECISION

21:26.519 --> 21:27.920
WILL ALLOW DOCTORS TO DISPENSE

21:27.920 --> 21:29.755
ABORTION-INDUCING PILLS USING

21:29.755 --> 21:31.190

21:35.828 --> 21:36.996
PATIENTS WHO LIVE IN DISTANT,

21:36.996 --> 21:38.464
RURAL AREAS.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.199
IN 2013, THE IOWA BOARD OF

21:40.199 --> 21:41.467
MEDICINE STARTED REQUIRING

21:41.467 --> 21:43.502
DOCTORS TO PERFORM EXAMINATIONS

21:43.502 --> 21:44.770
IN PERSON.

21:44.770 --> 21:46.238
BUT YESTERDAY, THE STATE SUPREME

21:46.238 --> 21:47.540
COURT STRUCK DOWN THAT RULE,

21:47.540 --> 21:49.275
SAYING IT PLACES AN UNDUE BURDEN

21:49.275 --> 21:50.543
ON A WOMAN'S CONSTITUTIONAL

SO FAR.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.692
IN SOUTH KOREA, 25 PEOPLE HAVE

22:06.692 --> 22:08.861
DIED OF MERS SINCE MAY 20.

22:08.861 --> 22:09.828
BUT TODAY, SOUTH KOREAN

22:39.625 --> 22:41.260
OF TUSKS AND TRINKETS AND

22:41.260 --> 22:42.728

22:42.728 --> 22:43.796
OF THE MANY THOUSANDS OF

22:43.796 --> 22:44.930
ELEPHANTS THAT HAVE BEEN

22:44.930 --> 22:46.332
SLAUGHTERED AND CONTINUE TO BE

22:46.332 --> 22:48.133
SLAUGHTERED TO SUPPORT THE

22:48.133 --> 22:50.502
GLOBAL TRADE IN IVORY.

22:50.502 --> 22:51.437
>> Sreenivasan: ELEPHANT

22:51.437 --> 22:52.838
POACHING FOR IVORY IS SOARING

22:52.838 --> 22:54.139
ACCORDING TO CONSERVATION

22:54.139 --> 22:55.874
GROUPS; A POUND OF IVORY CAN

22:55.874 --> 22:57.676
FETCH $1,500 ON THE BLACK

22:57.676 --> 22:58.711
MARKET.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.813
AND AFRICAN ELEPHANTS ARE LISTED

23:00.813 --> 23:02.681
AS THREATENED UNDER THE

23:02.681 --> 23:04.683
ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT.

23:04.683 --> 23:05.985
BUT THE SEIZED IVORY WAS NOT

23:05.985 --> 23:07.486
THERE JUST TO BE LOOKED AT, IT

23:07.486 --> 23:09.321
WAS THERE TO BE CRUSHED.

23:09.321 --> 23:11.790
ONE BY ONE THE PIECES WERE

23:11.790 --> 23:13.759
PLACED ON A CONVEYER BELT WHERE

23:13.759 --> 23:15.027
THEY WERE DROPPED INTO AN

23:15.027 --> 23:16.895
INDUSTRIAL ROCK CRUSHER.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.530
THE DECORATIVE IVORY WAS TURNED

23:18.530 --> 23:20.232
INTO A FINE POWDER.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.867
THE IDEA IS TO SHOW THERE WILL

23:21.867 --> 23:23.836
BE NO TOLERANCE FOR THE ILLEGAL

23:23.836 --> 23:25.871
IVORY TRADE AND DEMONSTRATE TO

23:25.871 --> 23:28.007
POACHERS AND COLLECTORS THAT

23:28.007 --> 23:29.575
LIVING ELEPHANTS ARE MORE

23:29.575 --> 23:31.977
VALUABLE THAN IVORY.

23:31.977 --> 23:33.746
YESTERDAY WAS THE SIXTH IVORY

23:33.746 --> 23:35.581
CRUSH IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

23:35.581 --> 23:36.882

23:36.882 --> 23:38.183
FOLLOWED THE U.S.'s LEAD,

23:38.183 --> 23:39.685
INCLUDING CHINA, WHICH IS THE

23:39.685 --> 23:41.720
LARGEST MARKET FOR IVORY IN THE

23:41.720 --> 23:42.821
WORLD.

23:42.821 --> 23:43.956
CHINESE OFFICIALS DESTROYED

23:43.956 --> 23:45.491
NEARLY 1,500 POUNDS OF IVORY IN

23:51.664 --> 23:52.898
AWARENESS THROUGH PUBLICITY

23:52.898 --> 23:54.900
EVENTS LIKE THIS CRUSH WILL HELP

23:54.900 --> 23:56.368
CHANGE BEHAVIOR.

23:56.368 --> 23:57.436

23:57.436 --> 23:58.704
CONSERVATION BIOLOGY.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.039
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM OF

24:00.039 --> 24:01.373
CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.242
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE

24:03.242 --> 24:04.410
CAN SOLVE.

24:04.410 --> 24:05.511
DON'T BUY IVORY.

24:05.511 --> 24:06.345
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO STOP THE

24:06.345 --> 24:07.913
ELEPHANTS FROM BEING KILLED.

24:07.913 --> 24:08.714
>> Sreenivasan: AND IN CASE YOU

24:08.714 --> 24:10.082
