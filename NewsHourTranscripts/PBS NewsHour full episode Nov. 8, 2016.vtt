JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.607 --> 00:08.375 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Gwen Ifill will
be off the
air this week while she
addresses health issues.

00:11.378 --> 00:14.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We look forward to her return as
soon as possible.

00:14.648 --> 00:18.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Americans decide.

00:18.385 --> 00:23.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters head to the polls to
choose between
the first woman president and a
businessman

00:23.056 --> 00:24.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
running for his first elected
office.

00:24.958 --> 00:29.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The balance of
power is
also on the line, with control
of the U.S.

00:29.296 --> 00:32.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate in play and many other
key races at
stake.

00:32.332 --> 00:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stay with us all night for the
latest results.

00:34.735 --> 00:40.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, Mark Shields, David
Brooks, Amy Walter
and many others help analyze
what it all means.

00:40.073 --> 00:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's election
night on the
"PBS NewsHour."

00:47.648 --> 00:50.484 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:50.517 --> 01:00.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been a long
day of voting
all across this country, and the
vast majority

01:00.394 --> 01:02.296 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the polls are still open.

01:02.329 --> 01:07.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At issue, whether Hillary
Clinton or Donald
Trump will become the 45th
president of the

01:07.467 --> 01:08.769 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

01:08.802 --> 01:12.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage this election
night.

01:12.172 --> 01:18.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: New York state,
where both
presidential nominees began
their campaigns,

01:18.045 --> 01:23.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and now, after 500-plus days of
campaigning,
it's where they're ending.

01:23.383 --> 01:28.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrat Hillary Clinton cast a
ballot today
at her home base, Chappaqua,
awash in supporters'

01:28.455 --> 01:33.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cheers both inside and outside
the polling
place.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CROWD: Hillary! Hillary!

01:35.395 --> 01:39.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
It's the most humbling feeling,
Dan, because

01:39.333 --> 01:42.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know how much responsibility
goes with this.

01:42.502 --> 01:48.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so many people are counting
on the outcome
of this election, what it means
for our country.

01:48.675 --> 01:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will do the very best I
can, if I'm
fortunate enough to win today.

01:53.313 --> 01:57.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Chappaqua is
just north of
New York City, and that's where
Republican

01:57.284 --> 01:58.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump cast his vote.

01:59.019 --> 02:00.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: So, who did you vote
for?

02:00.253 --> 02:03.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Tough decision.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:04.958 --> 02:08.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That after
kicking off his
day, as he has so many times in
this campaign,

02:08.862 --> 02:10.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a call-in to FOX News.

02:10.430 --> 02:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's been a
beautiful process.

02:12.399 --> 02:14.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The people of this country are
incredible.

02:14.167 --> 02:17.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I went -- last night, I ended up
with my final
speech.

02:17.204 --> 02:21.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We started with it -- well, you
guys covered
it -- but started at 12:45 in
the evening,

02:21.608 --> 02:23.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we had probably 21,000
people.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can you imagine that?

02:25.712 --> 02:29.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That final
speech, in the
wee hours of this morning, was
in Grand Rapids,

02:29.483 --> 02:30.450 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Michigan.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We have to win.

02:32.319 --> 02:36.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: His campaign's
closing salvo
in a weeklong push to crack
Clinton's blue

02:36.256 --> 02:38.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
firewall.

02:38.125 --> 02:42.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, too, was campaigning
into the early
morning in another key state,
North Carolina.

02:42.796 --> 02:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An Associated Press analysis
said, across
the country, at least 46 million
votes were

02:47.601 --> 02:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already in before today, a
record for early
voting.

02:51.705 --> 02:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, many millions were lined
up across
the country to weigh in on the
candidates,

02:56.610 --> 02:58.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and this long campaign.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Clearly, the candidates
were not well-liked,
so I will be glad when it's
over.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I think it's going to
take a minute
for all of us to come together.

03:03.383 --> 03:07.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we also need to take a
moment to,
like, just breathe.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're a democracy.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need to -- this is how
it's supposed
to be done.

03:10.891 --> 03:13.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There were
voting concerns
in some places today.

03:13.994 --> 03:17.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Voting machines in three
Pennsylvania counties
experienced malfunctions.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But elections staff there said
no ballots
were miscounted.

03:20.467 --> 03:26.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a fourth Pennsylvania county,
Lebanon County,
officials said calibration
problems sometimes

03:26.573 --> 03:31.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meant a vote for the GOP ticket
lit up as
a vote for Democrats.

03:31.178 --> 03:34.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say a software expert was
able to fix
each problem.

03:34.481 --> 03:36.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The day was also about
symbolism.

03:36.750 --> 03:41.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Rochester, New York, dozens
put "I Voted"
stickers on the grave of
suffragist Susan

03:41.154 --> 03:46.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
B. Anthony on the day the first
woman nominee
for president of a major party
was on the

03:46.593 --> 03:48.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ballot.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unknown is exactly what time
tonight this
race for the White House might
end.

03:52.165 --> 03:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also at stake tonight, of
course, possible
changes in power at the other
end of Pennsylvania

03:57.037 --> 03:58.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Avenue, the Capitol.

03:58.872 --> 04:03.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for now, New York is the
center of the
political world, with the two
presidential

04:03.643 --> 04:08.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
hopefuls set to end this
campaign just 25
blocks apart.

04:08.348 --> 04:10.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:10.450 --> 04:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will be
turning to New
York City throughout the night,
where both

04:13.820 --> 04:16.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton and Trump have their
election night
headquarters.

04:16.923 --> 04:21.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Yang is with Clinton
supporters at the
Javits Convention Center.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John, this is the last day.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's nothing left that they
can do.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What have you heard today?

04:28.668 --> 04:31.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Well, they're
watching and waiting.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're very hopeful.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're optimistic about their
field operations.

04:35.308 --> 04:38.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They think that's what's going
to make the
difference in a lot of places
where the race

04:38.678 --> 04:40.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has been very close.

04:40.580 --> 04:43.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, here at the Javits
Center, the
doors not yet open to the
public, still putting

04:43.884 --> 04:45.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the final touches on.

04:45.652 --> 04:49.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I asked the campaign why
they were here
at the Javits Center, they
pointed up.

04:49.556 --> 04:55.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This has a literal glass
ceiling, a glass
ceiling they're hoping to
symbolically burst

04:55.295 --> 04:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through tonight with the first
woman to be
elected president.

04:58.965 --> 05:04.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More symbolism here, the stage
that they're
working on is in the shape of
the United States.

05:04.037 --> 05:09.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lectern where Hillary
Clinton will speak
is pretty much over Oklahoma, it
looks to

05:09.809 --> 05:11.578 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

05:11.611 --> 05:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The campaign tells me that she
has prepared
remarks either way, win or lose,
and she will

05:16.650 --> 05:19.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be speaking on a map of the
United States.

05:19.619 --> 05:21.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the Lower 48.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where's Hawaii and Alaska?

05:23.323 --> 05:25.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Over there on the side -- Judy.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Yang, thank
you.

05:27.928 --> 05:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to be coming back to
you throughout
the night.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.799 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Both Hari and I will be doing
that.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now let's move to Trump
headquarters.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Jeffrey Brown is there at
the Hilton Hotel
in Midtown.

05:38.872 --> 05:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Jeff, tell us what it's like
at this moment.

05:41.107 --> 05:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Judy, I can
tell you,
we have no glass ceiling here.

05:45.745 --> 05:49.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We actually have a rather low
ceiling and
a rather small venue.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a decidedly small venue,
perhaps the
smallest one I have ever seen
for an event

05:53.019 --> 05:55.322 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We're only about a
mile-and-a-half away from
where John was.

05:58.124 --> 06:01.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, John and I might meet at the
end of this
long night, probably about
Eighth Avenue.

06:01.995 --> 06:02.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's to my west.

06:02.996 --> 06:05.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A few blocks to my east is Trump
Tower.

06:05.632 --> 06:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, that's where
Donald Trump
is, we're told, spending the
evening there,

06:11.271 --> 06:15.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were told perhaps coming by
10:00, or at
least no earlier than 10:00.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, at this point, who knows
how long this
night will go on.

06:18.912 --> 06:23.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we were able to talk to some
of the people
from the campaign earlier today,
and, as John

06:23.149 --> 06:27.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heard from the Clinton campaign,
the Trump
campaign was feeling pretty good
about what

06:27.220 --> 06:29.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was happening and what they were
seeing at
the polls.

06:29.389 --> 06:34.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Jeff, are
they saying -- are
any of the folks there sounding
optimistic?

06:34.527 --> 06:36.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are they sounding worried?

06:36.863 --> 06:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you picking up any vibes?

06:38.365 --> 06:39.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I know it's early in the
evening.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, it's too
early to really
know here.

06:43.470 --> 06:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I tell you what is --
it's funny here
right now.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, as I said, this is a
small place.

06:48.808 --> 06:53.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm surrounded by hundreds and
hundreds of
my new best friends who are
journalists right

06:53.179 --> 06:54.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
now, Judy.

06:54.981 --> 07:00.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so -- and you can see the
journalists
well -- a much bigger number of
journalists

07:00.787 --> 07:02.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than people in the hall.

07:02.522 --> 07:05.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And outside, of course, talking
to people
in the Trump campaign, they were
talking to

07:05.191 --> 07:09.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporters earlier in the day,
and, as I said,
they were watching, they were
hopeful.

07:09.162 --> 07:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were watching the returns
in some of
the key states.

07:12.399 --> 07:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump himself was on
Twitter about
an hour ago, pretty active.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He sent out three or four
tweets.

07:17.771 --> 07:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he was talking specifically:
Go, Florida.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is still ours to win.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Get out there and vote.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, he's still pushing people.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, I have been
looking at
some of his tweets this
afternoon.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown, we will be
talking to you throughout
this night from New York.

07:32.686 --> 07:33.653 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks, Judy.

07:36.323 --> 07:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We get some
perspective now
from supporters of both
candidates.

07:48.601 --> 07:52.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we start with the minority
leader in the
U.S. House of Representatives,
California

07:52.739 --> 07:54.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Democrat Nancy Pelosi.

07:54.741 --> 07:58.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was the first and only woman
to serve
as speaker of the House.

07:58.345 --> 08:03.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at this moment, she is the
highest-ranking
female politician in American
history.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Madam Leader, I think
you're probably
hoping that that is not going to
last much

08:06.953 --> 08:08.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
longer after tonight.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

08:09.122 --> 08:10.857 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

08:10.890 --> 08:11.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
I'm counting the minutes to
relinquish that

08:11.358 --> 08:13.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
title.

08:13.159 --> 08:17.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have worn my white and purple,
colors of
the Suffragettes, in honor of
the fact that

08:17.530 --> 08:23.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we have our first woman
president, soon to
be, Hillary Clinton, elected
president of

08:23.103 --> 08:24.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But the vote is sacred.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Until the people speak, we don't
celebrate.

08:27.474 --> 08:30.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what are you
expecting
tonight?

08:30.410 --> 08:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You obviously are hoping for
Democrats to
do well everywhere, but what are
you hearing?

08:35.281 --> 08:37.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What kind of judgment --
information are you
getting that you trust?

08:37.951 --> 08:39.619 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: Well, tonight, I
believe that
the Democrats will come out in a
stronger

08:42.655 --> 08:44.290 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will, of course, retain the
White House,
with the election of Hillary
Clinton.

08:47.394 --> 08:50.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I believe we will gain the
United States Senate.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will be close, but we will
gain the United
States Senate.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will pick up many seats
in the House
of Representatives.

08:56.202 --> 08:59.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why are you so
confident about
the White House?

08:59.105 --> 09:00.306 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: Because I'm
confident in the
American people.

09:02.509 --> 09:07.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe that Hillary Clinton
is one of the
best prepared people in our
history to enter

09:07.580 --> 09:13.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Oval Office, with her
vision, her knowledge,
her experience, her strategic
thinking, her

09:13.553 --> 09:15.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
connection to the American
people.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think she has made that
case.

09:17.891 --> 09:20.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, as you know, the vote is
sacred.

09:20.126 --> 09:24.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's almost a prayerful time for
us, as we
wait for the people to speak and
the returns

09:24.931 --> 09:26.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to come in.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I'm confident.

09:28.001 --> 09:31.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm also confident because, in
our efforts
to win seats for the White House
and to win

09:31.404 --> 09:36.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Senate, governorships, et
cetera, we have
really had a massive
mobilization.

09:36.309 --> 09:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We own the ground, and we will
pull out that
vote.

09:39.012 --> 09:41.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, most of the
attention,
as you know, has been on the
Senate.

09:41.648 --> 09:43.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are six or seven seats
there very, very,
very close.

09:43.483 --> 09:44.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

09:44.484 --> 09:46.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: That's right.

09:46.352 --> 09:49.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Less attention on
the House,
your body, because it's been
pretty much expected

09:49.222 --> 09:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the Democrats are not going
to make the
30-seat pickup that you would
need to take

09:53.660 --> 09:54.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the majority.

09:54.661 --> 09:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was optimism a few weeks
ago.

09:55.829 --> 09:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then along came FBI Director
Comey's announcement.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you realistically think
right now
about the House?

10:01.067 --> 10:02.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: Well, let's see.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I always to people it's like the
Olympics.

10:04.838 --> 10:10.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Everything within a
half-a-minute or a half-an-inch
is gold, silver, bronze or
nothing.

10:10.109 --> 10:12.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And our races are very close.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think that we will not
lose any members.

10:14.881 --> 10:19.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we will pick up many
open seats, and
we will unseat many Republicans.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there will be some
surprises.

10:21.554 --> 10:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you point out Director
Comey's comment.

10:25.492 --> 10:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With his letter that he sent
out, he became
the leading Republican political
operative

10:31.030 --> 10:32.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the country.

10:32.866 --> 10:39.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has had a tremendous impact
on the lead
that Hillary Clinton had, which
was important

10:39.105 --> 10:41.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the House, Senate, and other
races down-ballot.

10:41.441 --> 10:47.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're talking,
Madam Leader,
about an election that has
divided the country.

10:47.780 --> 10:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has been -- it seems to me
that's the overwhelming
feeling coming out of this
election at the

10:53.253 --> 10:54.220 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
end of it.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that how you see it?

10:55.622 --> 10:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think the country is
further divided
by what's happened?

10:58.391 --> 11:00.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:00.126 --> 11:03.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: I think that
people have great
anger over what happened in 2008
in terms

11:03.763 --> 11:05.365 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the economy.

11:05.398 --> 11:07.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that has given them anxiety
about the
future.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that has to be respected.

11:09.836 --> 11:14.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some of that has manifested
itself in
a vote for Donald Trump.

11:14.941 --> 11:20.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I do think that our
democracy is so great,
we can withstand even a
candidacy of Donald

11:20.813 --> 11:22.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

11:22.615 --> 11:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we emerge from this, it
has to be
respecting the position of those
who supported

11:29.188 --> 11:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, addressing the anger and
anxiety that
they have, and, again, bringing
the country

11:35.862 --> 11:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together, which was always the
purpose of
our founders, a more perfect
union.

11:39.966 --> 11:44.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that brings
me what's
going on in so-called blue
states, especially

11:44.070 --> 11:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Upper Midwest, states like
Michigan, even
Minnesota, Wisconsin, where
Donald Trump does

11:48.942 --> 11:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seem to be doing better than
President Obama
did a few years ago.

11:52.145 --> 11:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of people are asking, are
Democrats
really being responsive to
blue-collar working-class

11:59.185 --> 12:03.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals who used to think of
the Democratic
Party as their party, but are
now looking

12:03.690 --> 12:04.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in another direction?

12:04.691 --> 12:05.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:05.692 --> 12:07.226 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: Well, I would say
this.

12:07.260 --> 12:11.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Obama and the
congressional Democrats
have certainly been responsive.

12:11.097 --> 12:16.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we do in terms of
people in the area
that you mentioned, we had the
bailout of

12:16.803 --> 12:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the auto industry, creating so
many jobs in
the industry and for those who
supply the

12:22.909 --> 12:24.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
industry.

12:24.143 --> 12:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And yet we didn't advertise it
enough.

12:26.179 --> 12:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, yes, we were there
in terms of
middle-class economics and an
economy that

12:31.184 --> 12:37.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
works for everyone,
strengthening paychecks,
increasing consumer confidence,
people consuming,

12:37.323 --> 12:43.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
injecting demand into the
economy, creating
jobs vs. trickle-down economics,
tax breaks

12:43.196 --> 12:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the wealthiest people.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we didn't message it
properly.

12:46.799 --> 12:52.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, how could it be that
Michigan, Indiana,
all of those states that have
benefited from

12:52.939 --> 12:57.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the auto bailout, from
middle-class economics,
have decided to vote Republican?

12:57.977 --> 13:02.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some other reasons as
well, some
that are sociological, in
addition to economics.

13:02.715 --> 13:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just finally, you
don't believe
that Democrats have some work to
do in order

13:07.220 --> 13:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to, not just messaging, but in
order to come
up with programs, with ideas
that can capture

13:13.159 --> 13:15.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the imagination and the support
of these people?

13:15.895 --> 13:17.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: Well, President
Obama came up
with tremendous ideas, but he
was blocked

13:19.198 --> 13:20.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the Republicans.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we can all do better.

13:21.668 --> 13:23.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can all do better.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're an entrepreneurial
society.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had entrepreneurs who started
our country.

13:28.841 --> 13:33.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they want us to think in
fresh, new, different
ways all of the time.

13:33.112 --> 13:39.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact is, is that people
in some of
these regions are voting against
their own

13:39.052 --> 13:40.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economic interests.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to work together.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have concerns about trade.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So do we.

13:46.559 --> 13:50.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want a trade that is not
trickle-down trade,
but trade that recognizes we're
in a global

13:50.163 --> 13:51.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
economy.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have to work together on
all of those
things.

13:53.800 --> 13:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I stand by what I said, is
the Democrats
have been there for working
people in our

13:58.938 --> 14:00.139 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

14:00.173 --> 14:03.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's who we are, trickle-down
vs. middle-class
economics.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the major difference
between the parties.

14:05.945 --> 14:13.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If we didn't have this
foolishness going on
with some of the -- that went on
in the presidential

14:13.119 --> 14:15.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign, we could have had a
better discussion
of that.

14:15.722 --> 14:22.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, this is almost a
religious experience,
Election Day, and all the voting
that has

14:22.195 --> 14:25.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gone leading up to it.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lincoln said, public sentiment
is everything.

14:28.101 --> 14:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to listen to the people
and come together
as we prioritize our agenda and
go forward.

14:34.507 --> 14:39.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just finally,
Madam Leader,
how does the next president
bring the two

14:39.946 --> 14:42.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sides together, the two parties
together after
this election?

14:42.648 --> 14:43.916 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:43.950 --> 14:45.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: Well, I think we
will see some
of that tonight.

14:45.818 --> 14:50.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Hillary Clinton's
statement tonight
about being the president of all
of the people,

14:50.957 --> 14:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again, we have our differences
since the beginning
of our country.

14:53.993 --> 14:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a legitimate difference.

14:55.495 --> 15:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the role of government,
et cetera,
federal, state, local?

15:00.166 --> 15:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, also, we have respect for
other people's
points of view.

15:05.505 --> 15:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that has to
really come across
in what Hillary Clinton says
tonight.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She needs no advice from anyone.

15:12.211 --> 15:18.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, she's an experienced
public figure.

15:18.384 --> 15:23.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there has to be no doubt
that this isn't
about Democrats or Republicans.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's minor.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's about America.

15:26.025 --> 15:30.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about the vows of our --
honoring the
vows of our founders, respecting
the sacrifices

15:30.830 --> 15:39.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our men and women in uniform,
and honoring
the aspirations of our children
and their

15:39.071 --> 15:40.039 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

15:40.072 --> 15:41.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, elections are about the
future.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whoever is going to be
president tonight
-- and I think it will be
Hillary -- has to

15:45.611 --> 15:50.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
understand that it's a
responsibility well
beyond party and all about
America's future.

15:50.883 --> 15:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The minority
leader of the
U.S. House of Representatives,
who, as we

15:54.654 --> 15:57.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, is the highest-ranking
woman in the
American government right now.

15:57.857 --> 15:58.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

15:58.858 --> 15:59.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: For the moment.

15:59.859 --> 16:00.960 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
For the moment.

16:00.993 --> 16:01.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you very
much for joining
us.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.029 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:03.062 --> 16:09.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI: My pleasure.

16:09.502 --> 16:14.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Judy.

16:14.340 --> 16:22.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as you just
heard, we
just heard from the Democratic
leader of the

16:22.481 --> 16:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House of Representatives.

16:24.383 --> 16:28.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do hope to be joined any
minute now by
the Republican National
Committee's Communications

16:28.354 --> 16:29.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Director, Sean Spicer.

16:29.889 --> 16:30.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's running late.

16:30.890 --> 16:31.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We hear there's traffic.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We hope to get him here very
shortly.

16:33.693 --> 16:37.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for now, our election night
coverage
continues with a team that's
going to be joining

16:37.797 --> 16:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us at this table all night long.

16:40.533 --> 16:47.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They are New York Times
columnist David Brooks,
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report, Andra

16:47.206 --> 16:52.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gillespie of Emory University,
Republican
strategist Stuart Stevens,
Democratic strategist

16:52.979 --> 16:57.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cornell Belcher, and right here
sitting next
to me, Mark Shields, syndicated
columnist,

16:57.683 --> 17:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and joining us from New York,
Jeff Greenfield,
who has been reporting for the
"NewsHour Weekend"

17:02.922 --> 17:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
throughout this campaign.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, thank you to all of you for
being here.

17:07.293 --> 17:09.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to turn to you, David
Brooks.

17:09.161 --> 17:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You just heard the Democratic
leader of the
House of Representatives talk
about, frankly,

17:14.066 --> 17:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the problems Democrats have in
states that
used to be all blue.

17:18.471 --> 17:20.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it struck me that she didn't
claim they
were going to take over the
House, a bit of

17:22.909 --> 17:27.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
realism there from Nancy Pelosi,
I think,
but optimism -- and maybe
well-earned optimism.

17:27.146 --> 17:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is still a party -- a problem
for the party
that working-class voters, white
working-class

17:32.451 --> 17:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters are more and more heavily
Republican.

17:34.253 --> 17:38.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the exciting things that
happened,
whether you like it or not, this
year was

17:38.190 --> 17:42.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the white working class
took over a party,
and they took over a party that
had formerly

17:42.328 --> 17:45.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been a corporate party of the
rich and the
elites.

17:45.765 --> 17:49.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's sort of an amazing
thing that happens
in American -- rarely in
American history.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have a problem
with your
microphone, David Brooks.

17:52.004 --> 17:55.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to fix that and
come right back
to you in a minute.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

17:56.709 --> 17:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter?

17:57.843 --> 18:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Hi,
Judy.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hello.

18:01.480 --> 18:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And I think this may
play out
in the House tonight.

18:05.318 --> 18:09.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we're watching these results
come in, if
the results play out as the poll
numbers have

18:09.655 --> 18:14.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggested, where the Democrats
are going to
pick up seats will be in places
that were

18:14.660 --> 18:22.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
formerly Republican, inner-city
-- or inner
suburbs that were very
Republican for much

18:22.468 --> 18:29.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of our history now trending more
Democratic,
as white college-educated voters
move into

18:29.241 --> 18:31.043 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Democratic column.

18:31.077 --> 18:35.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As working-class whites have
moved out, white
educated voters have moved into
the Democratic

18:35.381 --> 18:37.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
column.

18:37.083 --> 18:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at the same time, in places
like the
Iron Range in Minnesota, that
upper rural

18:40.186 --> 18:46.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
part of Minnesota, you could see
Republicans
winning there, a district that
Democrats have

18:46.559 --> 18:48.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
held for many, many, many, many
years.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's really like a tale of
two congressional
districts.

18:51.397 --> 18:52.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

18:52.732 --> 18:54.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to swap out the
suburbs for the
more rural areas.

18:54.600 --> 18:59.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been happening over the
last 10 years,
but sort of at an accelerated
pace, I think,

18:59.905 --> 19:01.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this election cycle.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stuart
Stevens, are Nancy
Pelosi's expectations
reasonable?

19:04.110 --> 19:07.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART STEVENS, Former Romney
Campaign Senior
Adviser: I think probably she is
going to

19:07.646 --> 19:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
probably call it pretty close to
what's going
to happen.

19:10.049 --> 19:14.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the big test, I think,
tonight for
the Trump campaign -- and it's
going to affect

19:14.487 --> 19:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these down-ballot races -- is
what happens
with white college-educated
voters?

19:18.391 --> 19:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has been a strong center of
support for
Republicans.

19:24.063 --> 19:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No Republican has lost this in
modern history.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Even Goldwater won
college-educated Republicans.

19:29.135 --> 19:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if Donald Trump, who has
been losing them
in polls, doesn't carry them
tonight, I think

19:34.807 --> 19:39.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it's going to have very
interesting consequences
up and down the ballot in some
of these races.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
what are you
looking at tonight?

19:40.780 --> 19:43.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I'm looking
at the fact
that we're going to make
mystery.

19:43.883 --> 19:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Either we will elect the first
person in the
history of the country who has
never held

19:47.553 --> 19:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a public office or served in the
military
of any kind in Donald Trump, or
we will elect

19:52.725 --> 19:54.393 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the first woman.

19:54.427 --> 19:58.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And only for the second time
since World War
II, we have got a possibility to
electing

19:58.531 --> 20:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a party to the third term in the
White House.

20:00.499 --> 20:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened with George H.W.
Bush in 1988,
and hasn't happened other than
that.

20:06.105 --> 20:09.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Democrats have a real
problem culturally.

20:09.141 --> 20:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they have become a
cultural party,
and I think a little elite and
somewhat condescending

20:15.114 --> 20:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
toward white blue-collar working
Americans.

20:19.585 --> 20:24.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that the Republicans
had a great
opening there.

20:24.356 --> 20:29.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats are obviously far more
comfortable
with coastal types than they are
with people

20:29.061 --> 20:30.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the heartland.

20:30.696 --> 20:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cornell Belcher,
I saw you
smile broadly when Mark said
that.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNELL BELCHER, Former Obama
Campaign Pollster:
Well, it's interesting that
Democrats are

20:35.868 --> 20:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now back-to-back majorities in
national elections,
and somehow the problem is
Democrats have

20:41.340 --> 20:43.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a cultural problem with
working-class whites.

20:43.442 --> 20:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Democrats do have a
problem with working-class
whites.

20:46.045 --> 20:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, if you look into the
future, I think
the larger problem is the
problem that Republicans

20:50.749 --> 20:53.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have with the ascending
electorate, right?

20:53.486 --> 20:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a point of diminishing
returns at some
point with working-class whites.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do Democrats need to do better
with working-class
whites?

20:58.958 --> 21:00.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Absolutely, they do.

21:00.893 --> 21:05.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, without a question, when we
see her re-cobble
together that ascending
electorate that makes

21:05.598 --> 21:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up a majority in this country
now, I think
it's going to be hard-pressed to
say that

21:09.869 --> 21:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right now Democrats are the ones
with the
problem.

21:12.204 --> 21:15.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Could I just
dissent just briefly
from Cornell?

21:15.174 --> 21:18.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Got to set the evening, he did,
early.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:19.078 --> 21:20.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That is this.

21:20.846 --> 21:26.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democrats, in spite of
assembling this
national coalition and this
majority, are

21:26.252 --> 21:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
noncompetitive in the House of
Representatives.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're frankly noncompetitive.

21:30.489 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're noncompetitive in
districts that
are basically blue-collar,
white, more conservative

21:36.295 --> 21:38.097 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
culturally.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNELL BELCHER: But, Mark, what
about -- doesn't
that have a lot to do, quite
frankly, with

21:40.966 --> 21:41.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gerrymandering?

21:42.001 --> 21:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have gerrymandered these
districts where...

21:43.235 --> 21:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: They weren't
gerrymandered in
2010, Cornell.

21:45.037 --> 21:46.438 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's all.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CORNELL BELCHER: Well, no, they
were gerrymandered
just before 2010.

21:47.373 --> 21:48.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: No, they weren't.

21:48.374 --> 21:49.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, they weren't.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CORNELL BELCHER: Yes, they were.

21:50.843 --> 21:51.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It was the 2010
census that
led to the redistricting,

21:51.911 --> 21:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CORNELL BELCHER: Well, they're
even worse
now.

21:54.813 --> 21:58.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Once upon a time in this
country, you did
have 30 or 40 congressional
districts that

21:58.217 --> 22:01.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were -- when I was working at
the DCCC, you
really did have a lot more
congressional districts

22:01.287 --> 22:03.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that were highly contested.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That number is shrinking a lot
now.

22:05.124 --> 22:09.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it has to do with people
like me who are
helping to draw these maps
precisely in a

22:09.628 --> 22:10.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way to keep incumbents in
office.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: OK.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Andra
Gillespie, you wanted
to chime in there?

22:14.300 --> 22:16.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDRA GILLESPIE, Emory
University: So, if
I will jump in here, what I
would say is,

22:17.002 --> 22:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's not just gerrymandering.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We also have to consider the
ways that we
have ideologically sorted
ourselves into partisan

22:22.875 --> 22:25.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
camps in ways that we hadn't
before.

22:25.110 --> 22:28.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A generation ago, you had
liberal Republicans
and conservative Democrats.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those don't exist anymore.

22:30.783 --> 22:33.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, people understand enough
about parties
to know which issues and which
bundles fall

22:33.986 --> 22:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into which party, and they have
fallen into
those camps.

22:36.422 --> 22:40.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the question for tomorrow
is, can people
reach beyond the aisles and
actually talk

22:40.226 --> 22:41.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to people who disagree with
them?

22:41.493 --> 22:42.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
you're nodding.

22:42.962 --> 22:44.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

22:44.063 --> 22:46.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, and we're self-sorting now
more than
ever.

22:46.065 --> 22:52.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You talk to demographers, they
will tell you
that we're moving ourselves into
areas that

22:52.104 --> 22:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relate to our own, where we're
most comfortable
in sociocultural ways.

22:57.476 --> 23:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you look, for example, at
the question
-- Pew has asked this question.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think it's fantastic.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you want to live in a place
that is a close-in
area, where you can walk
everywhere, but you

23:04.817 --> 23:08.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a smaller house, or you get
a bigger
house and a bigger yard, but you
have to drive

23:08.220 --> 23:09.188 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everywhere?

23:09.221 --> 23:10.356 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Guess what?

23:10.389 --> 23:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Seventy-five percent of liberals
want the
close-in suburb.

23:12.024 --> 23:14.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Seventy-five percent of
conservatives want
the place where you have to
drive.

23:14.393 --> 23:20.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, literally, people are
putting themselves
into different communities and
separating

23:20.099 --> 23:21.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
themselves.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeff
Greenfield, I want
to invite you into this
conversation.

23:23.068 --> 23:26.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are the old boundaries still
relevant today?

23:26.238 --> 23:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFF GREENFIELD: Less and less.

23:28.807 --> 23:34.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just striking to me that
the Democratic
Party has been the party of the
working man

23:34.246 --> 23:37.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and later working woman since
the days of
Andrew Jackson.

23:37.750 --> 23:43.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as late as 1992, when
whites were a far
bigger proportion of the
electorate, Bill

23:43.489 --> 23:48.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton effectively split the
white vote with
his Republican opponents both in
'92 and '96.

23:48.861 --> 23:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things that I
think has happened
is that the focus on
mobilization, get your

23:54.800 --> 24:00.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vote out, has, I think, had a
big cost, which
is that the candidates, even
though they will

24:00.806 --> 24:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use the rhetoric, the pieties,
but, in substantive
ways, do not speak to the
broader country,

24:06.912 --> 24:10.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because it has become harder and
harder to
speak to the broader country.

24:10.582 --> 24:17.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, whatever happens
tonight, this
campaign has been a loss to the
civic nature

24:17.323 --> 24:21.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what a campaign's supposed to
be like,
because the strategy of both
campaigns has

24:21.427 --> 24:24.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been get your folks out, and the
heck with
the other folks.

24:24.496 --> 24:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks, if
your microphone
is fixed, I want to ask you to
come into this

24:28.267 --> 24:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversation about whether we
are making what
was already a bad situation
worse.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I was wondering
why Mark was
meddling with my microphone.

24:35.240 --> 24:37.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

24:37.042 --> 24:40.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: No, I think one of
the things,
there has been the polarization,
but there's

24:40.079 --> 24:41.947 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
also the heat.

24:41.980 --> 24:45.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tonight is often -- is a lot
about the
heat with which this campaign
has been conducted.

24:45.718 --> 24:50.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And what makes tonight
significant is, A,
the size of the margin and the
nature of the

24:50.089 --> 24:55.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concession speech and whether
we're a country
-- we're certainly a divided
country.

24:55.327 --> 24:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This election has been like a
flash flood
that wipes away all the soil and
reveals the

24:59.698 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chasms that have been dividing
us and exacerbates
them.

25:03.936 --> 25:09.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But whether we're even one
country after tonight
-- if Democrats win, how Trump
reacts will

25:09.274 --> 25:10.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be super important.

25:10.576 --> 25:12.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If Trump wins, Democrats will be
stunned.

25:12.578 --> 25:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And a lot of people will be
stunned.

25:14.613 --> 25:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how Clinton reacts at that
moment will
be superduper important.

25:17.883 --> 25:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes, exactly.

25:19.818 --> 25:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Andra, I want you to speak about
that, because
there's been -- I have been
hearing conversation

25:24.423 --> 25:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for days now about, what's the
reaction going
to be like?

25:28.594 --> 25:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, the results are important,
but are people
even going to be able to deal
with the results,

25:33.499 --> 25:35.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
whatever side you're on?

25:35.367 --> 25:36.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: There have been
some surveys
in the past couple of weeks
where people have

25:36.969 --> 25:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been asked that question.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they said that they're not
going to be
happy about this.

25:40.639 --> 25:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think we can expect
that half the
country is going to wake up
upset tomorrow.

25:44.910 --> 25:50.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's why it's really
important for whoever
loses to accept defeat
graciously, and also

25:50.215 --> 25:56.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the winner to accept winning
graciously,
and also send out a conciliatory
balm to the

25:56.655 --> 25:57.756 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other side.

25:57.790 --> 25:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not going to be enough,
sadly.

25:59.858 --> 26:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that it's going to
be pretty contentious
going after that.

26:02.728 --> 26:07.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think tonight is the night
where both
candidates can change the tone
enough that

26:07.733 --> 26:10.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they can actually get us
through, you know,
at least the next couple of
months, so that

26:10.869 --> 26:12.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we can set up a new government.

26:12.671 --> 26:15.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stuart
Stevens, what incentive
does Donald Trump have or
Hillary Clinton

26:15.040 --> 26:16.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have to change the tone today?

26:16.809 --> 26:20.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART STEVENS: Listen, I think
one of the
key elements of democracy is,
somebody has

26:20.579 --> 26:22.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be willing to lose.

26:22.848 --> 26:27.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's been extraordinary, I
think, about
Donald Trump's comments is
challenging that

26:27.352 --> 26:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before we even have results.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one thing if there is a
razor-thin margin,
like 2000, where you have one
person winning

26:32.925 --> 26:35.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Electoral College ultimately
and one person
winning the popular vote.

26:35.327 --> 26:36.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
OK, that took 31 days.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was a nightmare for the
country.

26:38.464 --> 26:42.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to prejudge this and talking
about a rigged
system, I think, is very
corrosive to the

26:42.568 --> 26:44.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whole process.

26:44.403 --> 26:48.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our process is out there amongst
these states
with thousands and thousands of
local officials,

26:48.907 --> 26:51.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many of them Republicans, and
they're really
good and decent people.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't mean mistakes don't
happen.

26:53.445 --> 26:58.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We are going to have 140
million, 150 million
people voting tonight.

26:58.650 --> 27:00.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are going to be mistakes.

27:00.586 --> 27:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But the system isn't rigged.

27:03.322 --> 27:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that you need -- to
put that out
is something.

27:06.492 --> 27:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to try to heal as soon
as possible.

27:09.962 --> 27:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cornell Belcher,
whose responsibility
is it to try to do this healing?

27:13.732 --> 27:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CORNELL BELCHER: Leadership
matters.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this shouldn't be a partisan
thing.

27:17.402 --> 27:21.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, John McCain, after losing,
he called
Barack Obama "my president,"
right?

27:21.840 --> 27:24.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a tradition in this
country right now.

27:24.676 --> 27:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I fear what's happening
right now is that
we're losing sight of that
tradition in so

27:29.915 --> 27:31.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much of the anger of our
politics.

27:31.850 --> 27:38.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is important, whether you're
a Democrat
or you're a Republican, that you
embrace our

27:38.457 --> 27:40.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system, because it is not
rigged.

27:40.259 --> 27:44.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the moment our people start
thinking -- and
I'm concerned about in the
polling numbers

27:44.096 --> 27:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I'm see as well with so
many more people
actually thinking the system is
rigged.

27:47.566 --> 27:51.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's how we lose our
democracy, when people
don't believe in the system
anymore and they

27:51.670 --> 27:54.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't accept the outcome of our
politics.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What Donald Trump -- because I
think Donald
Trump is going to lose.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Donald Trump does tonight,
I think, is
going to be very, very important
not just

28:00.579 --> 28:04.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for him and his brand, but for
our country.

28:04.449 --> 28:06.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: but think about
where we were.

28:06.385 --> 28:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even in 2000, that was a very
contentious
election.

28:08.487 --> 28:12.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We always remember the aftermath
of the election,
but going into that election,
George W. Bush,

28:12.958 --> 28:16.228 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
his overall
favorable/unfavorable rating was
plus-23.

28:16.261 --> 28:20.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the highest that we had
seen since we'd
been looking back for the last
20 years.

28:20.566 --> 28:23.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, he was very viewed
positively.

28:23.835 --> 28:28.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we're going into an election
where both
candidates obviously viewed
negatively, Hillary

28:28.607 --> 28:34.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clinton somewhere around
minus-10 or 15, Donald
Trump even lower than that,
maybe at 20, minus-20

28:34.313 --> 28:36.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or minus-30.

28:36.114 --> 28:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's no residual goodwill
there, that
at least George W. Bush had
something to go

28:41.720 --> 28:43.055 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

28:43.088 --> 28:44.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neither one of these candidates
have any of
that to start with.

28:44.923 --> 28:50.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART STEVENS: I think this is
why parties
are so important at this moment,
because parties

28:50.162 --> 28:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to step forward and do what
the candidates
sometimes find difficult to do.

28:54.199 --> 28:55.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

28:57.169 --> 29:00.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to have many
opportunities tonight
to come back to all of you.

29:00.105 --> 29:01.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

29:01.106 --> 29:02.207 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, save those
thoughts.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're getting off -- we're
getting off
tonight?

29:04.610 --> 29:06.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

29:06.478 --> 29:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got -- I'm joined now, I
think, by
RNC -- I am joined by Sean
Spicer, the Republican

29:11.383 --> 29:14.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
National Committee
communications director.

29:14.052 --> 29:15.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're joining us from Trump
headquarters
tonight in Manhattan.

29:17.255 --> 29:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to ask you, has the RNC
done everything
that it can to put its candidate
in the best

29:22.160 --> 29:23.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
position possible?

29:23.161 --> 29:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have you left everything out on
the field?

29:25.097 --> 29:27.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, Communications
Director, Republican
National Committee: Everything
is on the field

29:27.199 --> 29:29.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tonight, Hari.

29:29.034 --> 29:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think there is a speck
of dirt left
on the field, but not just for
the candidate,

29:32.638 --> 29:36.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but for the Senate, for our
House members,
for our governors, for
down-ballot, all the

29:36.441 --> 29:38.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
way down to dogcatcher.

29:38.176 --> 29:42.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we feel unbelievably
proud of the
ground game and the data
operation that we

29:42.748 --> 29:44.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have run.

29:44.583 --> 29:48.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just to put it in perspective,
in 2012, we
had 876 staff fanned out across
the battleground

29:48.620 --> 29:49.588 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This time, it's 6,012.

29:51.189 --> 29:54.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We made 11.5 door knocks in '12.

29:54.159 --> 29:58.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We exceeded 20 million this day,
this cycle
today.

29:58.463 --> 30:03.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's a huge feat
for the RNC
and for all the volunteers and
state parties

30:03.035 --> 30:04.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that have been part of that.

30:04.870 --> 30:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You made a
strategic decision
after the last cycle to go after
the ground

30:07.305 --> 30:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
game more so than television ad
spending.

30:09.174 --> 30:13.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a lot of Trump supporters
said, you know
what, you had spent so much more
money supporting

30:13.145 --> 30:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates in the past than this
cycle.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just in the last week or so, you
came in with
about $3 million or $4 million
worth of ads

30:18.917 --> 30:20.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a last-minute blitz.

30:20.519 --> 30:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Could you have done more?

30:21.620 --> 30:23.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SEAN SPICER: Oh, no.

30:23.455 --> 30:28.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, first of all, that was
part of the coordinated
expenditure that the candidate
gets.

30:28.727 --> 30:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's $24 million that the
candidate
can coordinate with the RNC.

30:32.197 --> 30:33.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was part of that.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That wasn't an independent
expenditure, which
is what you were referring to in
the past.

30:36.601 --> 30:37.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you're right.

30:37.703 --> 30:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We put all of our money into the
ground and
to data.

30:40.005 --> 30:46.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spent over $175 million in
data over the
last four years in advance of
this election.

30:46.144 --> 30:52.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, like I said, the numbers
don't lie; 876
staff were on the ground last
cycle, 6,012

30:52.451 --> 30:53.418 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this time.

30:53.452 --> 30:54.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it's not just the number.

30:54.453 --> 30:56.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's the length.

30:56.421 --> 30:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had them out there in
some cases two,
three years to make
relationships in communities,

31:00.025 --> 31:02.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
put voter contacts,
registration.

31:02.094 --> 31:03.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I think it shows.

31:03.228 --> 31:05.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look at our absentee and early
vote numbers.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have cut that deficit huge.

31:07.466 --> 31:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that is what is
going to propel
us to victory tonight.

31:09.434 --> 31:13.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One of things
that you also
came out of the postmortem after
the Romney

31:13.405 --> 31:17.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loss last time was figuring out
a way to go
out and reach Latino voters.

31:17.476 --> 31:21.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as we're hearing in the
past couple of
days, Latino voters might be a
significant

31:21.346 --> 31:25.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
factor in this election, if the
early voting
results are to be believed, if
that tracks

31:25.317 --> 31:26.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out for tonight.

31:27.018 --> 31:29.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you concerned that your
candidate might
have set you a couple of steps
back?

31:29.054 --> 31:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, if you look
at what the
exit polls are showing so far,
right now,

31:33.458 --> 31:37.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's on track with Romney, and
we're up a
few points with African-American
voters.

31:37.295 --> 31:42.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that bottom line is,
it looks
like we may have -- we probably
have improved

31:42.667 --> 31:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with minority voters vis-a-vis
the 2012 election.

31:45.971 --> 31:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Considering
that the Latino
voting population is going to be
important

31:49.407 --> 31:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the long run for Democrats
and Republicans
as they become a larger
proportion of this

31:53.111 --> 31:54.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country?

31:54.112 --> 31:55.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Oh, absolutely.

31:55.947 --> 32:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, look, I don't think
that doing good
enough is OK.

32:00.485 --> 32:02.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we have got to do much
better.

32:02.287 --> 32:07.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got to get our Latino
and Hispanic
vote into the high 30s, low 40s,
like George

32:07.893 --> 32:08.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
W. Bush did.

32:08.894 --> 32:10.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're absolutely right.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The demographic shift that is
coming in this
country, we have got to be ahead
of the curve.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think the Republican Party
is a natural
home for Hispanics.

32:17.803 --> 32:21.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that we have got to
do a better
job of going our to those
communities, working

32:21.640 --> 32:23.108 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in them.

32:23.141 --> 32:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have made huge strides since
2012 putting
staff in those communities.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have got room to continue
to improve.

32:28.180 --> 32:30.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I agree that
there's room
to improve.

32:30.415 --> 32:34.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just saying, how difficult
is it for you
when the top of the ticket
speaks in a way

32:34.219 --> 32:36.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that really turns them off?

32:36.188 --> 32:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Well, again, I
think look at
the exit polls right now.

32:40.625 --> 32:44.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, we're on par or better
than we were
in 2012.

32:44.062 --> 32:46.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the numbers will speak for
themselves
after tonight.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are your
expectations
tonight?

32:48.567 --> 32:51.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have got access to
information that we
certainly don't.

32:51.436 --> 32:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, looking at the first and
second and third
and fourth waves of results that
you might

32:55.006 --> 32:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have access to, what are you
expecting?

32:56.908 --> 33:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: I think North
Carolina, we feel
really good about.

33:01.112 --> 33:03.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We feel very good about
Michigan.

33:03.114 --> 33:07.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Colorado is a state
that's shown tremendous
advance in the last couple
weeks.

33:07.485 --> 33:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a lot of these
states that Obama
won twice, not only won twice,
but I mentioned

33:12.791 --> 33:13.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Michigan.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a state that hasn't gone
Republican
since 1988.

33:15.894 --> 33:18.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We feel that we are going to do
very well
in these.

33:18.363 --> 33:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, look, the paths to 270 has
continued
to increase over the last couple
weeks as

33:23.702 --> 33:25.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the map has expanded.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Sean Spicer from
the Republican National
Committee, joining

33:27.873 --> 33:31.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us from Trump headquarters in
New York tonight,
thanks so much.

33:31.343 --> 33:36.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: Thanks, Hari.

33:36.915 --> 33:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Every election
year, it seems
there are reports of long lines,
malfunctioning

33:46.992 --> 33:50.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voting machines, and sporadic
chaos at some
of the polls.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And today is no different.

33:52.697 --> 33:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for months, we have heard
accusations,
as we have just been discussing
here, by the

33:55.634 --> 34:00.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign that the election
is rigged
and could possibly be stolen.

34:00.305 --> 34:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We head up now to William
Brangham.

34:02.207 --> 34:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's in our newsroom with what
we have been
seeing so far today -- William.

34:05.677 --> 34:07.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Hi, Judy.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks very much.

34:09.214 --> 34:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, we're trying to sort out
all -- amongst
all the reports we have been
getting today,

34:13.418 --> 34:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what of these are real and what
of them are
not?

34:15.320 --> 34:18.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to help us sort of through
that, I'm joined
now by Jessica Huseman.

34:18.356 --> 34:22.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a reporter at ProPublica,
and she's
part of a really interesting
large consortium

34:22.594 --> 34:25.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of election monitors known as
Electionland.

34:25.597 --> 34:26.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jessica, welcome.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's dive right into this.

34:28.733 --> 34:33.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, the Trump campaign filed
a lawsuit
alleging that there were some
problems going

34:33.104 --> 34:34.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on in Nevada.

34:34.339 --> 34:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Can you bring us up to date?

34:35.340 --> 34:36.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What was their complaint?

34:36.341 --> 34:37.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And what's happened with that?

34:37.475 --> 34:39.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JESSICA HUSEMAN, ProPublica:
Sure.

34:39.511 --> 34:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what they were asking the
judge was essentially
separate out some votes at a
couple of polling

34:43.281 --> 34:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
locations that were kept open
late.

34:46.351 --> 34:50.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were also asking for
the names of
the poll workers in those
locations, so that

34:50.388 --> 34:52.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they could investigate
themselves.

34:52.390 --> 34:57.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge turned down both of
those requests,
one, because the state of Nevada
already does

34:57.195 --> 34:58.163 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

34:58.196 --> 34:59.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They already keep the votes
separate.

34:59.998 --> 35:03.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was no need for the judge
to rule that
they must do something that they
already do.

35:03.401 --> 35:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then also she was concerned
that the voter
-- that the poll workers that he
wanted access

35:07.605 --> 35:12.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to would be intimidated or
otherwise harassed
online if she were to make their
names public.

35:12.978 --> 35:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she declined to do that,
and also said
that there was no proof that the
secretary

35:16.815 --> 35:20.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of state of Nevada wouldn't do a
thorough
investigation herself.

35:20.185 --> 35:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Trump campaign really
just didn't
show enough reason for her to do
these things

35:25.757 --> 35:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that it was asking them to do.

35:27.625 --> 35:30.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, I
understand these were
largely Latino voters that the
Trump campaign

35:30.128 --> 35:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was concerned had been allowed
some special
access to vote...

35:32.998 --> 35:34.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSICA HUSEMAN: Sure.

35:34.866 --> 35:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: ... and that
this seems
to fit into this pattern that
the Trump campaign

35:36.668 --> 35:42.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been making all along, that
somehow the
polls are going to be wiggled so
that certain

35:42.273 --> 35:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voters, maybe minority voters,
might get special
access.

35:45.343 --> 35:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know the Trump campaign
has also asked
some of its own supporters to go
out and watch

35:50.348 --> 35:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and monitor what's going on at
the polls.

35:52.183 --> 35:56.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Have you been seeing any reports
of that kind
of activity that would be
problematic today?

35:56.554 --> 36:00.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSICA HUSEMAN: You know, we
have seen one-off
reports of those kind of all
over the country,

36:00.825 --> 36:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but they have been in the vast
minority of
instances.

36:03.795 --> 36:09.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we're not seeing at
this moment is
an organized campaign to
intimidate voters,

36:09.367 --> 36:11.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like some feared we might see
today.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We haven't seen any indication
of that.

36:13.304 --> 36:17.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we have seen is one or two
people at
polling places across the
country, but a very

36:18.009 --> 36:23.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
small number of them
intimidating voters,
screaming at voters, having
intimidating or

36:23.248 --> 36:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inappropriate signs, but no real
indication
that anything organized has
transpired.

36:28.319 --> 36:31.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We have also
been seeing
reports that there were problems
with some

36:32.023 --> 36:34.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
voting machines in Pennsylvania.

36:34.325 --> 36:35.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you tell us what you heard
about that?

36:35.560 --> 36:36.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSICA HUSEMAN: Right.

36:36.761 --> 36:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we actually just published
an article
about this.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so you can go to
Election.land and read
it.

36:41.599 --> 36:46.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the -- what we're seeing is
that there
was a viral video that happened
where a voter

36:47.005 --> 36:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tried to press Trump, and it
wasn't working.

36:49.741 --> 36:54.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it -- and so he blamed it
on a rigged
voting machine, but it was
actually user error.

36:54.345 --> 36:58.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were able to see this by
looking up
the instructions for the voting
machine.

36:58.316 --> 37:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Similarly, in
Durham County,
North Carolina, which obvious is
a very crucial

37:03.321 --> 37:08.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
swing state, there have been
long lines, problems
with registration, absent -- not
enough ballots

37:08.359 --> 37:10.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for people.

37:10.261 --> 37:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's been going on there?

37:12.063 --> 37:14.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand there's been also
calls to keep
the polls open later there
tonight, so that

37:14.666 --> 37:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some voters who might have been
pushed aside
might get a chance to vote after
all.

37:18.636 --> 37:19.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's going on there?

37:19.637 --> 37:20.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSICA HUSEMAN: Sure.

37:20.638 --> 37:21.573 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

37:21.606 --> 37:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, we're seeing long lines
there.

37:23.274 --> 37:25.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are fewer voting locations
this year
than there have been in
elections past.

37:25.176 --> 37:29.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so -- and given that this is
a high-turnout
election, we were expecting long
lines in

37:29.247 --> 37:30.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these states.

37:30.949 --> 37:34.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were expecting long lines in
other states
that reduced their polling
locations.

37:34.619 --> 37:38.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we're seeing in North
Carolina what
we expected to see all along.

37:38.556 --> 37:45.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's not clear how those
requests for
the polls will -- it's not clear
how the requests

37:45.130 --> 37:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will transpire for the polls to
stay open
later.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are certainly those
requests being
made.

37:50.835 --> 37:54.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is
obviously the first
presidential election we have
had since the

37:54.272 --> 37:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supreme Court chipped away at
some significant
parts of the Voting Rights Act.

37:58.543 --> 38:03.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the concerns there
was that minority
voters might be disenfranchised
with what

38:03.114 --> 38:05.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happens after that Supreme Court
ruling.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More broadly, have you seen any
reports of
those types of things going on?

38:08.953 --> 38:10.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JESSICA HUSEMAN: Right.

38:10.755 --> 38:13.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you know, just like in
North Carolina,
what we're seeing in those
places is that

38:13.124 --> 38:17.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is a limited number of
poling locations
this year compared to what there
was in 2012.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we are seeing longer
lines there.

38:19.664 --> 38:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as previous studies have
shown, those
longer lines tend to
disproportionately affect

38:24.035 --> 38:25.803 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
minority voters.

38:25.837 --> 38:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we use Texas as an
example, for instance,
they changed their voter I.D.
laws.

38:30.942 --> 38:35.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while that was taken to
federal court
and struck down, it only
happened in July.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's really close to the
start of an
election.

38:37.515 --> 38:41.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what we're seeing there is a
ton of confusion
around what I.D. you actually
have to bring

38:41.719 --> 38:46.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the polls, both on the part
of poll workers
and on voters themselves.

38:46.391 --> 38:50.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, confusion just really
doesn't create clean
elections.

38:50.228 --> 38:54.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so even when these issues
have been litigated
in court, they have been
litigated so late,

38:54.766 --> 38:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they don't have to be
pre-approved
anymore, that we're still seeing
confusion,

38:59.170 --> 39:02.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're still seeing unexpectedly
long lines,
and we're still seeing these
problems that

39:02.407 --> 39:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
face voters that really just
shouldn't.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Jessica Huseman
of ProPublica, thank you so
much.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to send it back down
to Hari and
Judy in the studio.

39:09.113 --> 39:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JESSICA HUSEMAN: Thank you.

39:10.215 --> 39:12.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you,
William.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know we're going to be
checking back
with them, the folks at
ProPublica, throughout

39:14.719 --> 39:16.554 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the night.

39:16.588 --> 39:19.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, though, we want to
step back and
get some historical perspective
on this Election

39:19.924 --> 39:21.092 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And joining us is "NewsHour"
regular Michael
Beschloss.

39:23.261 --> 39:24.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's so good to have you back
with us again,
Michael.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
Thank you so much, Judy.

39:26.731 --> 39:29.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there is so
much to think
about on this Election Day,
after what the

39:29.734 --> 39:31.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
country has been through.

39:31.102 --> 39:33.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there any election, Michael,
you can compare
this to?

39:33.871 --> 39:34.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: No.

39:34.872 --> 39:36.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:36.741 --> 39:39.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: And I spend
my whole life
looking for parallels, and
usually I can find

39:39.777 --> 39:41.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least a contrived one.

39:41.546 --> 39:46.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you cannot think of a
campaign that's
been this personal and this
negative.

39:46.651 --> 39:49.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And debates -- these have been
the nastiest
debates.

39:49.821 --> 39:53.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the difference is, you know,
oftentimes,
people will say, well, didn't
John Adams and

39:53.791 --> 39:56.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thomas Jefferson dis each other?

39:56.461 --> 39:59.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, they did, but they usually
didn't do
it personally, and they sure
didn't do it

39:59.831 --> 40:01.065 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on TV.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
divisiveness
of the country?

40:02.934 --> 40:08.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That seems to have translated
directly from
the campaigns on to how
vitriolic people are

40:08.439 --> 40:09.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
against the other candidate?

40:09.440 --> 40:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Has that happened before?

40:10.675 --> 40:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Oh, I think
-- not to this
disagree.

40:12.710 --> 40:18.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we were living in a
perfect world,
if this were the election in
American history

40:18.650 --> 40:24.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where there were the biggest
policy differences,
you might expect this, 1860,
when we were

40:24.088 --> 40:30.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about on the verge of the Civil
War over slavery,
or 1940, when we were fighting
over whether

40:30.128 --> 40:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we should get involved in a war
against Adolf
Hitler.

40:33.631 --> 40:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are huge issue differences
this year,
but nothing like that.

40:37.635 --> 40:40.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I have been dying
to ask you
this question for a long time.

40:40.905 --> 40:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would the founding fathers
think about
the idea either of electing a
woman as president

40:47.211 --> 40:52.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or electing someone to office
who had no experience
in elective politics?

40:52.050 --> 40:56.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Well, the
lack of experience,
actually, they would find a
little bit more

40:56.988 --> 41:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understandable, because they
wanted people
who were not lifetime
politicians.

41:01.926 --> 41:05.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They wanted Cincinnatus to go
back to his
plow.

41:05.930 --> 41:09.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They wouldn't have imagined the
idea of a
woman as president.

41:09.400 --> 41:13.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, if they had thought
a little
harder, they would have had to
think what

41:13.204 --> 41:19.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the freedoms and the values and
the goals
of the Constitution that they
wrote were likely

41:19.844 --> 41:25.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- it might take two centuries,
as it did,
but were likely to lead to a
female president

41:25.550 --> 41:26.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at some point.

41:26.718 --> 41:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
historic
nature of that?

41:28.386 --> 41:30.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is closer than
anybody ever
has been to the office as a
woman.

41:30.755 --> 41:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, she ran unsuccessfully
in another
term, but how historic is it?

41:36.427 --> 41:39.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: The miracle
is that it
took this long.

41:39.097 --> 41:45.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 19th Amendment, which denied
states the
ability to deny women the vote,
that was 1920.

41:45.903 --> 41:48.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that was 96 years ago.

41:48.940 --> 41:53.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you go back, as I have,
to the debates
of 1920, they were saying, just
give women

41:53.745 --> 41:58.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the vote, there will be a lot of
female office
holders, there will probably be
a woman president

41:58.349 --> 41:59.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with a couple decades.

42:00.017 --> 42:00.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Didn't happen.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have to ask why it took so
long.

42:02.820 --> 42:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we're not
anywhere close
to parity even in terms of
representation

42:05.790 --> 42:06.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Congress today.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Absolutely,
absolutely.

42:08.626 --> 42:11.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Michael, as
you think about
-- again, about the division in
the country

42:11.596 --> 42:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and about the need to heal this
country, what
does the historian in you -- how
do you see

42:16.601 --> 42:18.369 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

42:18.403 --> 42:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you look at something, oh,
yes, we have
been through tough times before,
we will get

42:20.204 --> 42:26.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through this, or do you look at
this as really
a moment that's unlike any other
in terms

42:26.878 --> 42:28.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of how divided we are?

42:28.679 --> 42:32.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Well, I think
the happy
thing is that the ugliness is
more personal

42:32.350 --> 42:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and more based on the kind of
campaign we
have been through than because
we're dealing

42:36.421 --> 42:39.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with an issue like Hitler or the
Civil War.

42:39.157 --> 42:43.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If you have got a
president-elect coming in
and saying, one of my first
responsibilities,

42:43.461 --> 42:48.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if not the supreme one, will be
to heal and
unite this nation, that can do a
lot.

42:48.366 --> 42:50.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's happened in history.

42:50.168 --> 42:53.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, keeping out
immigrants,
changing trade policy doesn't
rise to the

42:53.905 --> 42:56.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
level of a dispute over slavery?

42:56.541 --> 43:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: It is deep
and it is rancorous,
but it's not to that level.

43:00.845 --> 43:03.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael
Beschloss, it's great
to have you with us.

43:03.381 --> 43:04.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will be talking to you
through the
evening.

43:04.682 --> 43:05.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Thank you.

43:05.650 --> 43:06.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Looking forward.

43:06.651 --> 43:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thank you,
Michael.

43:08.486 --> 43:11.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This campaign season has been
very long, a
year-and-a-half since Trump and
Clinton first

43:11.956 --> 43:13.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
announced their candidacies.

43:13.224 --> 43:16.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, as it comes to a close,
we take a
look back.

43:16.394 --> 43:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
It is wonderful to be here with
all of you.

43:22.066 --> 43:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see the top 25 hedge fund
managers making
more than all of America's
kindergarten teachers

43:31.175 --> 43:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
combined and often paying a
lower tax rate.

43:36.247 --> 43:41.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is why I am running for
president of
the United States.

43:41.252 --> 43:43.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

43:43.654 --> 43:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
When Mexico sends its people,
they're not

43:50.194 --> 43:52.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sending their best.

43:52.129 --> 43:53.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're bringing drugs.

43:53.831 --> 43:54.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're bringing crime.

43:54.832 --> 43:55.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're rapists.

43:55.833 --> 43:58.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And some, I assume, are good
people.

43:59.003 --> 44:06.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am officially running for
president of the
United States.

44:06.377 --> 44:11.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we are going to make our
country great
again.

44:11.382 --> 44:13.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think Jeb is a nice person.

44:13.651 --> 44:14.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's very low-energy.

44:14.719 --> 44:16.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not used to that kind of a
person.

44:16.621 --> 44:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAKE TAPPER, Moderator: Last
week in "Rolling
Stone" magazine, Donald Trump
said the following

44:19.490 --> 44:21.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about you -- quote -- "Look at
that face.

44:21.959 --> 44:23.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would anyone vote for that?

44:23.394 --> 44:25.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you imagine that, the face
of our next
president?"

44:25.263 --> 44:27.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CARLY FIORINA (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I think women all over this
country heard

44:27.398 --> 44:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very clearly what Mr. Trump
said.

44:29.300 --> 44:35.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I should
have used
two accounts, one for personal,
one for work-related

44:35.273 --> 44:36.774 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
e-mails.

44:36.807 --> 44:37.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That was a mistake.

44:37.808 --> 44:38.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm sorry about that.

44:38.776 --> 44:39.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I take responsibility.

44:39.777 --> 44:41.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

44:41.612 --> 44:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), President
Candidate: The
American people are sick and
tired of hearing

44:42.914 --> 44:43.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about your damn e-mails.

44:43.981 --> 44:44.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

44:44.982 --> 44:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Thank
you.

44:45.983 --> 44:46.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Me, too.

44:46.984 --> 44:47.952 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Me, too.

44:47.985 --> 44:49.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I took responsibility.

44:49.854 --> 44:55.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as part of that, before I
left office,
I launched reforms to better
protect our people

44:55.826 --> 45:01.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the field and help reduce the
chance of
another tragedy happening in the
future.

45:01.766 --> 45:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Donald J. Trump is
calling for
a total and complete shutdown of
Muslims entering

45:07.972 --> 45:09.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

45:09.173 --> 45:12.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The World Trade Center came down
during the
reign of...

45:13.010 --> 45:13.978 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

45:14.011 --> 45:15.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: He kept us safe?

45:15.413 --> 45:16.380 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's not safe.

GOV.

45:17.748 --> 45:19.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS CHRISTIE (R), New Jersey:
So, we must
ask this question.

45:19.517 --> 45:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, as an awful
judge of the
character of a dictator and
butcher in the

45:23.721 --> 45:25.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Middle East, is she guilty or
not guilty?

45:25.823 --> 45:26.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AUDIENCE: Guilty!

45:26.891 --> 45:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock
her up!

45:31.629 --> 45:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: My pledge reads,
I'm with you,
the American people.

45:39.604 --> 45:40.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I am your voice.

tonight, in
all of our cities and in all of
our towns,

45:48.579 --> 45:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I make this promise: We will
make America
strong again.

DONALD TRUMP: And we will make
America great
again.

46:10.635 --> 46:17.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Now
America is once
again at a moment of reckoning.

46:17.074 --> 46:21.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Powerful forces are threatening
to pull us
apart.

46:21.879 --> 46:26.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bonds of trust and respect are
fraying.

46:26.517 --> 46:32.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just as with our founders,
there are no
guarantees.

46:32.256 --> 46:35.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It truly is up to us.

46:35.359 --> 46:40.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Imagine, imagine him in the Oval
Office facing
a real crisis.

46:40.931 --> 46:48.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A man you can bait with a tweet
is not a man
we can trust with nuclear
weapons.

with humility,
determination, and boundless
confidence in

46:57.114 --> 47:01.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America's promise that I accept
your nomination

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: You
know, to just
be grossly generalistic, you
could put half

47:12.697 --> 47:17.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Trump's supporters into what
I call the
basket of deplorables, the
racist, sexist,

47:17.268 --> 47:22.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
homophobic, xenophobic,
Islamophobic, you
name it.

LESTER HOLT, Moderator: Let's
let her respond.

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well, as
soon as he
travels to 112 countries and
negotiates a

47:35.686 --> 47:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
peace deal, a cease-fire, a
release of dissidents,
an opening of new opportunities
in nations

47:44.128 --> 47:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the world, or even spends
11 hours
testifying in front of a
congressional committee,

47:49.967 --> 47:52.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he can talk to me about stamina.

47:52.036 --> 47:56.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or maybe he doesn't want the
American people,
all of you watching tonight, to
know that

47:56.907 --> 48:02.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's paid nothing in federal
taxes, because
the only years that anybody's
ever seen were

48:02.913 --> 48:07.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a couple of years when he had to
turn them
over to state authorities when
he was trying

48:07.151 --> 48:11.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get a casino license, and
they showed he
didn't pay any federal income
tax.

48:11.856 --> 48:12.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, if he has paid...

48:12.857 --> 48:14.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: That makes me
smart.

48:14.692 --> 48:17.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will tell you, you look at
the inner
cities -- and I just left
Detroit, and I just

48:18.028 --> 48:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
left Philadelphia, and I just --
you know,
you've seen me.

48:20.164 --> 48:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have been all over the place.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You decided to stay home, and
that's OK.

48:25.469 --> 48:27.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I will tell you, I have been
all over.

48:27.772 --> 48:32.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have met some of the
greatest people
I will ever meet within these
communities.

48:32.076 --> 48:36.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are very, very upset
with what their
politicians have told them and
what their

48:36.847 --> 48:37.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
politicians have done.

48:37.882 --> 48:39.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LESTER HOLT: Mr. Trump, I...

48:39.784 --> 48:43.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I think
-- I think
-- I think Donald just
criticized me for preparing

48:43.888 --> 48:45.089 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for this debate.

48:45.122 --> 48:48.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And, yes, I did.

48:48.225 --> 48:49.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you know what else I
prepared for?

48:49.794 --> 48:51.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I prepared to be president.

48:51.595 --> 48:52.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think that's a good thing.

48:52.830 --> 48:54.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And when you're a
star, they
let you do it.

48:54.965 --> 48:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can do anything.

48:56.100 --> 48:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILLY BUSH, "Access Hollywood":
Whatever you
want.

48:57.101 --> 48:57.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Grab them by the
(WORD DELETED).

48:57.968 --> 48:58.936 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can do anything.

48:58.969 --> 49:00.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:00.738 --> 49:03.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE: Moderator: I want
to ask you
here on the stage tonight, do
you make the

49:03.274 --> 49:08.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
same commitment that you will
absolutely -- sir,
that you will absolutely accept
the result

49:08.179 --> 49:09.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this election?

49:09.180 --> 49:10.681 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will look at it
at the time.

49:10.714 --> 49:12.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not looking at anything now.

49:12.116 --> 49:13.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will look at it at the time.

49:13.918 --> 49:16.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I have seen -- what I have
seen is so
bad.

49:16.487 --> 49:23.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, the media is so
dishonest and
so corrupt, and the pile-on is
so amazing.

49:23.227 --> 49:26.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times actually
wrote an article
about it, but they don't even
care.

49:26.997 --> 49:27.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's so dishonest.

49:27.998 --> 49:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they've poisoned the mind of
the voters.

49:30.100 --> 49:35.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She should never have been
allowed to run
for the presidency, based on
what she did

49:35.072 --> 49:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with e-mails and so many other
things.

49:37.074 --> 49:40.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS WALLACE: But, sir, there
is a tradition
in this country -- in fact, one
of the prides

49:40.611 --> 49:45.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this country is the peaceful
transition
of power and that, no matter how
hard-fought

49:45.516 --> 49:51.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a campaign is, that, at the end
of the campaign,
that the loser concedes to the
winner.

49:51.689 --> 49:55.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Not saying that you're
necessarily going to
be the loser or the winner, but
that the loser

49:55.392 --> 49:59.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concedes to the winner, and that
the country
comes together, in part for the
good of the

50:00.030 --> 50:01.432 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

50:01.465 --> 50:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you saying you're not
prepared now to
commit to that principle?

50:03.133 --> 50:05.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: What I'm saying is
that I will
tell you at the time.

50:05.536 --> 50:06.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will keep you in suspense.

50:06.670 --> 50:08.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

50:08.505 --> 50:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
Chris, let me
respond to that, because that's
horrifying.

50:10.274 --> 50:16.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, every time Donald
thinks things
are not going in his direction,
he claims

50:16.347 --> 50:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatever it is, is rigged
against him.

50:18.582 --> 50:25.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am sure they will reach
the same conclusion
they did when they looked at my
e-mails for

50:25.122 --> 50:26.156 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the last year.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is no case here.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

50:29.526 --> 50:34.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Although
my name and
my opponent's name may be on the
ballot, every

50:34.632 --> 50:38.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issue you care about is on that
ballot.

50:38.836 --> 50:45.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If we don't win,
this will be
the single greatest waste of
time, energy,

50:45.209 --> 50:51.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and money in my life.

50:51.916 --> 51:02.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

51:46.603 --> 51:52.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Citigroup targeted minority
customers
for risky loans that led to mass
foreclosures.

51:52.343 --> 51:56.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city says it should be

damaged property

51:56.981 --> 51:57.948 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
