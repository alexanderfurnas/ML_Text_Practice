00:07.140 --> 00:17.584
JUDY WOODRUFF: A weekend of
work for world powers and Iran.
Disputes over arms embargoes

00:17.584 --> 00:21.588
and economic sanctions relief
prolong nuclear negotiations.

00:21.588 --> 00:25.392
Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:25.392 --> 00:29.730
Also ahead: It's Friday. David
Brooks and E.J. Dionne are here
to analyze the week's

00:29.730 --> 00:31.932
news.

00:31.932 --> 00:37.304
Plus, Serena Williams enters the
Wimbledon finals on the verge of
making history,one

00:37.304 --> 00:42.009
match away from her
second Grand Slam.

00:42.009 --> 00:52.920
And a harrowing look at the rise
and fall of British soul singer
Amy Winehouse. A

00:52.920 --> 00:56.623
documentary sheds light on the
star's talent, fame and the
addiction that cut her life
short.

01:02.162 --> 01:05.732
you how brilliant she was, and
for you to kind of fall in love
her. When you fall

01:05.732 --> 01:10.837
in love with her, then you feel
very different when you see the
archive footage of the paparazzi

01:10.837 --> 01:13.240
and her being hounded.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.175
JUDY WOODRUFF: Those are some
of the stories we're covering on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:17.611 --> 01:21.248
JUDY WOODRUFF: The head of the
federal government's personnel
office resigned today in the
wake

01:21.248 --> 01:25.552
of a massive data
breach at the agency.

01:25.552 --> 01:30.290
Katherine Archuleta stepped down
after disclosures more than 21
million current, former and
prospective

01:30.290 --> 01:34.261
federal employees were affected.

01:34.261 --> 01:38.098
White House spokesman Josh
Earnest said today the president
believes new leadership is badly

01:38.098 --> 01:40.133
need.

01:40.133 --> 01:43.804
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: Director Archuleta
did offer her resignation

01:43.804 --> 01:49.609
today. She did so of her own
volition. She recognizes, as
the White House does, that

01:49.609 --> 01:53.513
the urgent challenges currently
facing the Office of Personnel
Management require a manager

01:53.513 --> 01:57.217
with a specialized set of
skills and experiences.

01:57.217 --> 02:00.854
JUDY WOODRUFF: In her statement
today, Archuleta said she wants
to let the personnel office

02:00.854 --> 02:05.292
-- quote -- "move beyond
the current challenges."

02:05.292 --> 02:10.263
Federal Reserve Chair Janet
Yellen signaled today the U.S.
Central Bank is ready to raise

02:10.263 --> 02:14.835
interest rates this year. But
in a speech, she also said that
could change because the

02:14.835 --> 02:18.305
economic outlook is -- quote
-- "highly uncertain."

02:18.305 --> 02:23.877
Meanwhile, hopes for a Greek
bailout deal buoyed Wall Street.
The Dow Jones industrial

02:23.877 --> 02:31.685
average gained more than 210
points to close at 17760. The
Nasdaq rose 75 points and

02:31.685 --> 02:36.957
the S&P added 25. For the week,
the Dow gained a fraction of 1
percent. The Nasdaq

02:36.957 --> 02:40.727
and the S&P fell a fraction.

02:40.727 --> 02:45.999
It turns out that the suspect in
the church shootings in
Charleston, South Carolina,
should

02:45.999 --> 02:53.040
have been legally barred from
buying his .45-caliber handgun.
The FBI said today that a
background

02:53.040 --> 02:59.813
check failed to spot Dylann
Roof's arrest for drug
possession weeks earlier. FBI
Director

02:59.813 --> 03:05.952
James Comey said he blames
incomplete and inaccurate
paperwork.

03:05.952 --> 03:11.391
The Charleston shootings led
directly to removing the
Confederate Battle Flag from
South Carolina's

03:11.391 --> 03:18.398
state capitol grounds today. An
estimated 10,000 people cheered
and chanted as an honor

03:18.398 --> 03:21.535
guard of state troopers lowered
the banner. Longtime civil
rights activists were jubilant.

03:26.473 --> 03:31.411
for the first time in my life,
the state has said that we're
all one and all lives matter

03:31.411 --> 03:36.516
and, if it offends us, we will
take it down. And for all these
years, the state wouldn't

03:36.516 --> 03:40.253
do it. But it was done
today. It's an awesome day.

03:40.253 --> 03:44.157
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Confederate
banner had been on the state
capitol grounds for more

03:44.157 --> 03:49.429
than 50 years. After being
taken down today, it was moved
to a nearby museum.

03:49.429 --> 03:55.769
The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is upping the
warnings on some popular
anti-inflammatory

03:55.769 --> 04:01.708
drugs. The agency says the
change affects non-aspirin
painkillers like ibuprofen and

04:01.708 --> 04:07.047
naproxen sold over the counter
and by prescription. New labels
will add to existing warnings

04:07.047 --> 04:12.052
about increased risk of
heart attack and stroke.

04:12.052 --> 04:18.592
The U.S. House of
Representatives voted
overwhelmingly today to speed
new treatments to market. The

04:18.592 --> 04:23.763
bill is meant to expedite
approval of drugs and medical
devices by the Food and Drug
Administration.

04:23.763 --> 04:30.871
It also boosts funding for
biomedical research by nearly $9
billion. Consumer groups warned

04:30.871 --> 04:34.808
that the bill will weaken
safeguards against potentially
dangerous products. The Senate

04:34.808 --> 04:38.778
has yet to take up the issue.

04:38.778 --> 04:45.785
In Yemen, fighting raged on,
even as a U.N.-brokered
humanitarian truce was supposed
to take effect.

04:45.785 --> 04:51.024
Saudi-led airstrikes blasted
Shiite rebel targets in Sanaa,
the Yemeni capital city.

04:51.024 --> 04:54.294
The rebels, in turn,
shelled the city of Aden.

04:54.294 --> 04:58.765
A U.N. spokesman said both sides
had agreed to stop fighting.

04:58.765 --> 05:03.570
AHMAD FAWZI, United Nations
Spokesman: If this humanitarian
pause is respected, during

05:03.570 --> 05:09.643
any humanitarian pause, the
humanitarian agencies and their
partners aim to reach people in

05:09.643 --> 05:12.045
need with essential supplies,
and that includes everything,
medicine, vaccination, food,
water,

05:12.045 --> 05:13.780
fuel.

05:13.780 --> 05:18.185
JUDY WOODRUFF: The truce is
supposed to last for a week, and
aims to get aid to some

05:18.185 --> 05:21.388
21 million people.

05:21.388 --> 05:26.860
The U.N. Refugee Agency sounded
the alarm today over a flood of
refugees into Greece,

05:26.860 --> 05:32.866
even as that country faces
bankruptcy. More than 77,000
migrants have landed on Greek

05:32.866 --> 05:38.538
islands this year, an average of
1,000 per day. The U.N.
appealed to the European Union

05:38.538 --> 05:41.741
to step in before the
situation gets worse.

05:41.741 --> 05:44.945
WILLIAM SPINDLER, International
Organization for Migration: We
have seen huge expressions

05:44.945 --> 05:54.354
of solidarity from the Greek
people, the Greek public,
organizing distributions of
food,

05:54.354 --> 06:01.094
water, milk for the babies and
so on, which is particularly
moving, given the economic

06:01.094 --> 06:04.731
situation in Greece. But Greece
urgently needs help, and we
expect Europe to step forward.

06:09.636 --> 06:13.506
war in Syria.

06:13.506 --> 06:18.378
New York City turned out today
to celebrate the U.S. women's
soccer team and their World

06:18.378 --> 06:24.484
Cup victory. Throngs lined
streets in Lower Manhattan for a
ticker tape parade. It was

06:24.484 --> 06:30.724
a first for a women's sport
team, and fans held signs and
chanted "USA." The Americans

06:30.724 --> 06:36.730
beat Japan last weekend for a
record Third World Cup
championship.

06:36.730 --> 06:42.969
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
an Iran nuclear deal delayed;
Greece's latest offer to win

06:42.969 --> 06:49.843
a European bailout; violence,
crime and incarceration rates
for undocumented immigrants in
the U.S.;

06:49.843 --> 06:55.915
David Brooks and E.J. Dionne on
the week's news; Serena Williams
eyes her second grand

06:55.915 --> 07:10.830
slam; and a new look at a
British rock star whose fame and
addiction spelled her demise.

07:10.830 --> 07:15.869
The world's major powers will
continue to negotiate with Iran
throughout the weekend,

07:15.869 --> 07:19.939
aiming to clinch an agreement
that would curb that country's
nuclear program. A number

07:19.939 --> 07:23.576
of self-imposed deadlines
have come and gone.

07:23.576 --> 07:28.248
For an update on where things
stand, we turn to Michael Gordon
of The New York Times,who

07:28.248 --> 07:31.384
has been covering the talks in
Vienna. I spoke with him a
short while ago.

07:31.384 --> 07:34.621
Michael, welcome.

07:34.621 --> 07:39.159
It's late Friday night there,
another delay. Where do things
stand?

07:39.159 --> 07:40.627
MICHAEL GORDON, Diplomatic
Correspondent, The New York
Times: Well, I do have the

07:40.627 --> 07:44.064
sense that they're beginning to
close in on the final accord.
This is going to be the

07:44.064 --> 07:49.469
third weekend that we're here in
Vienna, and I'm positive that
Secretary of State John

07:49.469 --> 07:55.041
Kerry has never been in one
place as long as he's been here
as the secretary of state.

07:55.041 --> 07:57.711
But there is a sense of
progress, and we're waiting to
see if this thing comes together

07:57.711 --> 07:59.913
in the next day or two.

07:59.913 --> 08:04.250
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it clear what
they have made progress on and
where the hangups are

08:04.250 --> 08:05.919
still?

08:05.919 --> 08:10.523
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, I think
they have made a lot of progress
in defining the nuclear

08:10.523 --> 08:13.426
provisions of the accord.

08:13.426 --> 08:18.598
Certainly, we already know that
they have decided on the number
of centrifuges Iran

08:18.598 --> 08:22.535
will be allowed to have. I
think they have made progress on
what research and development

08:22.535 --> 08:26.506
will be allowed on new types of
centrifuges. I think there have
been some very delicate

08:26.506 --> 08:31.311
issues to work out on -- in
terms of sanctions and the
timing of sanctions relief.

08:31.311 --> 08:35.215
And there was a new one that
cropped up this week. Actually,
it was an old one that
reemerged,

08:35.215 --> 08:38.418
and that's whether to lift the
arms embargo on Iran. And
that's been a very contentious

08:38.418 --> 08:40.420
issue this past week.

08:40.420 --> 08:44.991
JUDY WOODRUFF: So why is that
coming up at the last minute?

08:44.991 --> 08:48.795
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, it's
something that Americans really
thought they had resolved

08:48.795 --> 08:56.836
or at least finessed in Lausanne
in April, and previous Security
Council resolutions

08:56.836 --> 09:01.007
at the United Nations banned the
import or export of conventional
arms and missile technology

09:01.007 --> 09:03.843
to Iran.

09:03.843 --> 09:08.782
And the Iranians had wanted this
off, but that's really a
nonstarter in the American

09:08.782 --> 09:14.254
political system. I mean, the
idea that you're going to give
Iran billions of dollars

09:14.254 --> 09:21.060
in sanctions relief, so that
they can go buy conventional
arms that increases their
military

09:21.060 --> 09:25.365
power in the region is just not
going to fly in the American
Congress or even among President

09:25.365 --> 09:29.936
Obama's Democratic
allies in the Congress.

09:29.936 --> 09:33.907
And the Americans thought they
had that resolved, but it came
back this week. And the
Iranians

09:33.907 --> 09:36.810
had some support really from the
Russians and the Chinese, both
of whom want to sell

09:36.810 --> 09:38.445
them arms.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.614
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
see that getting resolved?

09:41.614 --> 09:46.986
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, I really
don't think this is one that the
United States can -- will

09:46.986 --> 09:52.992
give in on, and I think probably
the best resolution would be if
both sides come to

09:52.992 --> 09:55.995
the conclusion that there is a
lot more at stake in this
agreement.

09:55.995 --> 09:59.098
This is probably the most
important arms agreement

09:59.098 --> 10:04.070
in several decades, with all
sorts of ramifications for
U.S.-Iranian relation, for the
region.

10:04.070 --> 10:07.774
And I think, in the end, both
sides are going to come to the
conclusion that that's

10:07.774 --> 10:13.813
too important to risk for the
lifting of the arms embargo. I
don't think it will be lifted.

10:13.813 --> 10:18.251
I think it will remain a
feature of a U.N. resolution and
I think the Iranians the
Russians

10:18.251 --> 10:23.122
just won't like it and maybe
they will sort of agree to
disagree. That would be my best

10:23.122 --> 10:25.925
guess as to how this comes out.

10:25.925 --> 10:30.630
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Michael, you
mentioned some disagreement or
difference of opinion

10:30.630 --> 10:38.338
among the U.S. and its
negotiating partners. Is that a
serious? Is that turning out

10:38.338 --> 10:44.444
to be something serious or what?
How do you see the group sitting
across the table

10:44.444 --> 10:46.913
from Iran holding together?

10:46.913 --> 10:51.017
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, the
United States, and particularly
Secretary Kerry, have really

10:51.017 --> 10:56.222
been in the lead for the last
six months, if not longer, and
the other five countries

10:56.222 --> 11:01.160
involved in the talks with Iran
show up at critical junctures.

11:01.160 --> 11:05.665
And the United States has often
said that the Russians have been
very cooperative in

11:05.665 --> 11:10.003
these talks, that this has been
one area of U.S.-Russian
relations where things have gone

11:10.003 --> 11:16.276
well, unlike Ukraine or
Syria or arms control.

11:16.276 --> 11:20.246
But I think the Russians have
been a bit difficult over this
past week because of their
interest

11:20.246 --> 11:25.752
in getting the arms embargo
lifted for their own, really,
financial reasons. But I think,

11:25.752 --> 11:29.822
in the end, if Iran can live
with the agreement, the Russians
and Chinese will go along, and

11:29.822 --> 11:33.092
I don't really see it
as a show-stopper.

11:33.092 --> 11:37.997
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Gordon
with The New York Times spending
one more weekend in Vienna,

11:37.997 --> 11:39.999
we thank you.

11:39.999 --> 11:46.806
MICHAEL GORDON: Thank you.

11:46.806 --> 11:53.446
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: the drama
in Greece heading toward a
climax at a Sunday summit

11:53.446 --> 11:56.449
of European leaders.

11:56.449 --> 12:02.121
The Greek prime minister has now
offered concessions to
creditors, ranging from a higher
sales

12:02.121 --> 12:06.759
tax, the so-called VAT -- VAT --
to pension changes. The goal?
A new bailout worth

12:06.759 --> 12:10.129
nearly $60 billion.

12:10.129 --> 12:13.399
Jonathan Rugman of Independent
Television News reports.

12:13.399 --> 12:17.503
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Climbing the
steps of Greece's Parliament
today, the members of a
government

12:17.503 --> 12:23.242
forced into a last -minute climb
down. Days ago, they were
railing against Greece's
creditors.

12:23.242 --> 12:28.147
Today, they were talking up the
chances of a new deal with them
this weekend.

12:28.147 --> 12:32.719
OLGA GEROVASILI, Greek
Parliament Member (through
translator): I am certain we
will reach

12:32.719 --> 12:35.989
an agreement. There was never
any doubt. The battle was
lengthy and long and will

12:35.989 --> 12:39.492
reach its conclusion by taking
the steps you already know
about.

12:39.492 --> 12:44.764
JONATHAN RUGMAN: And greeted
like a conquering hero, Alexis
Tsipras, the prime minister,

12:44.764 --> 12:49.602
who is now pushing through
Parliament the kind of austerity
61 percent of Greek voters

12:49.602 --> 12:55.742
rejected last weekend, because
money or lack of it talks.

12:55.742 --> 13:01.080
These banks could be bankrupt by
Monday, and so the government,
it seems, has blinked.

13:01.080 --> 13:07.820
Greece's proposals are on time
and to the kind of budget a wary
Eurozone might accept,

13:07.820 --> 13:14.093
giving into more austerity, with
a standard VAT rate at 23
percent beginning in October,

13:14.093 --> 13:20.800
reducing the 30 percent VAT tax
break applied to tourism-rich
Greek islands, corporation

13:20.800 --> 13:26.339
tax rising from 26 percent to 28
percent, as Greece's creditors
demanded, and raising

13:26.339 --> 13:31.811
the standard retirement age to
67 over the next seven years.

13:31.811 --> 13:38.685
But what is Mr. Tsipras hoping
to win in return? Well, 53.5
billion euros in loans over
three

13:38.685 --> 13:45.591
years and, crucially,
restructuring the repayment of
Greece's vast debt, though the
13 billion

13:45.591 --> 13:50.697
euros in tax rises and spending
cuts is at least four billion
euros more than the package

13:50.697 --> 13:54.400
Greeks on Sunday voted against.

13:54.400 --> 14:00.239
A new and lasting deal with
Greece will depend on the Greeks
actually doing what they say

14:00.239 --> 14:06.145
they will and not buckling under
the weight of more austerity.
And Germany will need

14:06.145 --> 14:11.551
to agree on some form of debt
relief which doesn't leave
German taxpayers feeling
shortchanged.

14:11.551 --> 14:16.889
But whatever the outcome of
this weekend's talks, Greece is
heading for years of economic

14:16.889 --> 14:23.062
hardship and the debate over its
Eurozone membership is very
unlikely to stop.

14:23.062 --> 14:29.168
No wonder there are protests in
Athens tonight by some of those
who said no and meant it,

14:29.168 --> 14:32.772
though the French, who helped
draw up this plan, are perhaps
prematurely hailing it as

14:32.772 --> 14:34.941
a breakthrough.

14:34.941 --> 14:39.078
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through translator):
Since the program they are

14:39.078 --> 14:43.750
presenting is serious and
credible, and because they won't
submit it to the Parliament,
that

14:43.750 --> 14:49.288
shows strength, commitment and
indeed courage. So, the
discussions now need to start,
resume,

14:49.288 --> 14:52.258
with the will to conclude.

14:52.258 --> 14:57.497
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Tonight,
Greece's Parliament is set to
back its government, and
Eurozone

14:57.497 --> 15:03.503
finance ministers may do the
same tomorrow. And if they do,
Greece's banks could be

15:03.503 --> 15:09.642
refinanced and reopen on Monday,
though today's climb-down could
leave the pensioners feeling

15:09.642 --> 15:15.214
worse off than before.

15:15.214 --> 15:25.558
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
immigration. The complex issue
has remained frozen in

15:25.558 --> 15:29.662
Washington for years, but is
quickly heating up outside the
capital.

15:29.662 --> 15:33.099
Our William Brangham
unravels the debate.

15:33.099 --> 15:37.136
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The firestorm
started when in his announcement
that he was running

15:37.136 --> 15:40.840
for president, Donald Trump
turned to the topic of
immigration.

15:40.840 --> 15:44.277
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: When Mexico sends
its people, they're not

15:44.277 --> 15:50.016
sending their best. They're not
sending you. They're not
sending you. They're

15:50.016 --> 15:55.188
sending people that have lots of
problems. And they're bringing
those problems with

15:55.188 --> 16:00.593
us. They're bringing drugs.
They're bringing crime. They're
rapists. And some, I assume,

16:00.593 --> 16:03.162
are good people.

16:03.162 --> 16:07.433
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the weeks
following, major businesses
connected to Trump backed

16:07.433 --> 16:13.072
away from partnerships and
projects with him. They
included NBC, Univision, Macy's,
ESPN,

16:13.072 --> 16:15.141
and the Professional
Golf Association.

16:15.141 --> 16:20.713
For his part, Trump stood by his
comments. But then a tragedy in
San Francisco added

16:20.713 --> 16:26.319
fuel to the fire; 32-year-old
Kathryn Steinle was shot and
killed at the end of last month.

16:26.319 --> 16:30.122
Undocumented immigrant Juan
Lopez-Sanchez confessed to a
reporter that he shot her,

16:30.122 --> 16:33.226
but said it was an accident.

16:33.226 --> 16:37.196
All this has just inflamed the
debate about immigration in the
U.S., whether immigrants

16:37.196 --> 16:41.334
are a positive force in the
country or whether they should
be feared. There are currently

16:41.334 --> 16:44.470
more than 41 million immigrants
in America. Over 11 million are
estimated to be here

16:44.470 --> 16:47.840
illegally.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.444
To help us understand what we
know about the nation's
immigrants, legal and illegal,
I'm

16:51.444 --> 16:54.580
joined by three people who
have studied the research.

16:54.580 --> 16:59.619
Marielena Hincapie is the
executive director of the
National Immigration Law Center,
an

16:59.619 --> 17:04.190
immigration rights group. Marc
Rosenblum is from the
nonpartisan Migration Policy
Institute.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.792
And Jessica Vaughan is with the
Center for Immigration Studies,
which advocates for tougher

17:06.792 --> 17:08.361
border security.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.962
Welcome to all three of you.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.764
MARC ROSENBLUM, Migration
Policy Institute: Thank you.

17:11.764 --> 17:15.735
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Marc
Rosenblum, why don't I start
with you first?

17:15.735 --> 17:19.438
Donald Trump is saying that
immigrants come to the country
and they commit a
disproportionate

17:19.438 --> 17:23.309
amount of crime. You have
looked at this data quite a bit.
Is he right?

17:23.309 --> 17:26.679
MARC ROSENBLUM: You know, it's
a very persistent stereotype,
but there's a lot of research

17:26.679 --> 17:31.017
on it, looking at prison
populations and looking at city
crime rates.

17:31.017 --> 17:37.290
And what it shows is that
immigrants are
disproportionately unlikely to
be in prison. The prison

17:37.290 --> 17:40.860
doesn't have a lot of immigrants
in it. And when you look at
crime rates and correlate

17:40.860 --> 17:43.429
them with immigration
populations, immigrants are --
cities with lots of immigrants
don't

17:43.429 --> 17:45.598
have lots of crime.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.668
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Sarah (sic)
Vaughan, I know you have looked
at this data as well.

17:48.668 --> 17:51.237
What do you make
of this analysis?

17:51.237 --> 17:53.472
JESSICA VAUGHAN, Center for
Immigration Studies: Well, no,
we have looked at it very
deeply.

18:02.548 --> 18:07.320
or less likely to commit crimes
than anyone else in the
population. The studies that

18:07.320 --> 18:13.192
claim to find that immigrants
are somehow more law-abiding
than Americans are based

18:13.192 --> 18:19.365
on very flawed data, because
that doesn't identify correctly
necessarily what someone's

18:19.365 --> 18:22.468
immigration status is.

18:22.468 --> 18:27.840
What we do know is that there
are certain types of crime that
are very closely associated

18:27.840 --> 18:34.380
with illegal immigration, drug
crimes, gang crimes, smuggling,
trafficking, identity theft,

18:34.380 --> 18:43.022
so that the areas of the country
that have those kinds of
problems need to have some

18:43.022 --> 18:46.325
mechanism for work a good --
they have a legitimate public
safety reason for working with
immigration

18:46.325 --> 18:49.195
enforcement.

18:49.195 --> 18:55.835
But I don't think that's really
the most relevant policy
question for lawmakers here.
And

18:55.835 --> 19:00.673
that is, we know that some
illegal immigrants are here
committing crime, so what do we
do

19:00.673 --> 19:06.345
with those illegal immigrants
who are committing crimes? How
do we handle that?

19:06.345 --> 19:13.019
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Marielena
Hincapie, why does this
perception persist? I mean,
Donald

19:13.019 --> 19:14.854
Trump is not the only one that
has raised concerns about
immigrants and crime.

19:14.854 --> 19:18.057
Why do you think we keep
talking about this?

19:18.057 --> 19:19.658
MARIELENA HINCAPIE, Executive
Director, National Immigration
Law Center: That's a great
question.

19:19.658 --> 19:22.928
And I think what we have to
remember is what's at issue here
is really that this is about

19:24.730 --> 19:30.803
a human tragedy. We are talking
about Kate has been murdered in
San Francisco, and this

19:30.803 --> 19:36.776
is not about immigration, but
the perception, the narrative
out there really has its basis

19:36.776 --> 19:43.949
in the scapegoating, the race,
which, often -- for example, the
Willie Hortons of the

19:43.949 --> 19:49.255
world that fuel those myths of
whether it's a black man or a
brown man, like this particular

19:49.255 --> 19:50.823
defendant.

19:50.823 --> 19:58.130
And that's often at the root of
this. And it really is about
society's implicit bias

19:58.130 --> 20:03.869
and the fact that politicians
like Donald Trump are exploiting
this particular tragedy

20:03.869 --> 20:08.674
in San Francisco to move
an anti-immigrant agenda.

20:08.674 --> 20:10.910
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Marc
Rosenblum, what do you make of
that? Is that true? Is this

20:10.910 --> 20:15.314
primarily, in your mind,
driven by racial animus?

20:15.314 --> 20:18.184
MARC ROSENBLUM: It's a
persistent stereotype that goes
back a hundred years that
immigrants

20:18.184 --> 20:20.753
commit crimes.

20:20.753 --> 20:26.425
But I would agree with Marielena
that you certainly see
politicians and political
entrepreneurs

20:26.425 --> 20:31.730
sort of exploiting this to
connect these incidents to
immigration more broadly.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.834
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jessica
Vaughan, what do you think about
that? Do you think this

20:34.834 --> 20:36.368
is racism?

20:36.368 --> 20:40.539
JESSICA VAUGHAN:
No, of course, not.

20:40.539 --> 20:45.644
I mean, obviously, it's not true
that immigrants don't commit
crimes. Of course they do.

20:45.644 --> 20:51.851
And, again, the issue is how do
we handle that fraction of the
immigrant population

20:51.851 --> 20:58.557
that has been committing crimes
and has been contributing to
crime rates in our communities?

20:58.557 --> 21:04.330
The logical answer is, they
should be removed. Crime is not
a job Americans won't do. There

21:04.330 --> 21:10.503
is no reason to allow people who
are here in defiance of our laws
to stay here if they

21:10.503 --> 21:17.143
are contributing to crime in our
communities, and, again, it does
exist. It needs to be

21:17.143 --> 21:23.249
acknowledged, and law
enforcement agencies need to be
cooperating to make sure that
they

21:23.249 --> 21:28.420
are finding those criminal
aliens who are preying on people
in the communities and deporting

21:28.420 --> 21:32.091
them as expeditiously
as possible.

21:32.091 --> 21:37.596
And the problem is, is that
there are certain areas, like
San Francisco, where political

21:37.596 --> 21:43.802
leaders have imposed policies on
law enforcement officers to
block immigration enforcement.

21:43.802 --> 21:49.542
And the people they end up
protecting in those cases are
actually the criminals, because

21:49.542 --> 21:54.780
they're allowed to stay in the
community and continue preying
on people there.

21:54.780 --> 22:01.387
So, again, there is no -- if we
can't agree on removing illegal
immigrants who have committed

22:01.387 --> 22:04.723
crimes, then who can we deport?

22:04.723 --> 22:09.061
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Marielena
Hincapie, let's talk a little
bit about federal policy.

22:09.061 --> 22:14.967
As you know, in 2005, the
federal government stepped up
its enforcement, and instead of

22:14.967 --> 22:18.637
just -- when they caught people
who were coming across the
border, instead of just sending

22:18.637 --> 22:23.842
them home, they started putting
them into the judicial system.
And I wonder what's

22:23.842 --> 22:27.079
your take on how that policy has
played out? How has the federal
government's role contributed

22:27.079 --> 22:29.381
to this?

22:29.381 --> 22:33.152
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Yes, I
think Jessica is right. The
fact is that the administration

22:33.152 --> 22:36.755
-- and both the Bush
administration and most recently
the Obama administration have
been

22:36.755 --> 22:40.492
enforcing laws, they have
prioritized people who have
committed crimes.

22:40.492 --> 22:44.964
But, again, that's not what is
at issue here. Why -- San
Francisco, for example, is not

22:44.964 --> 22:51.036
an isolated case. There are
over 300 local and city and
counties across the countries

22:51.036 --> 22:56.442
where law enforcement leaders
themselves have decided that
they needed to change the
policies

22:56.442 --> 23:02.081
to restore trust between the
communities and the police, so
that there was -- individuals

23:02.081 --> 23:06.652
would serve as witnesses and
would report crimes, whether
they were committed by another

23:06.652 --> 23:11.690
immigrant or by a U.S. citizen,
so, again, the fact that we're
suddenly taking this particular

23:11.690 --> 23:16.061
individual case in San Francisco
and jumping to try to make
changes in the federal law,

23:16.061 --> 23:18.864
when, in fact, the federal
law already exists.

23:18.864 --> 23:22.968
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I would like
to something of all three of
you. All three of you care

23:22.968 --> 23:25.704
deeply about immigration. You
spend a lot of time thinking
about it, writing about it,

23:25.704 --> 23:28.407
talking about it.

23:28.407 --> 23:32.144
Does something like what
happened with Donald Trump, when
he comes out -- and regardless

23:32.144 --> 23:37.016
of what you think of what he
said, does this help us have
this debate, or is this toxic

23:37.016 --> 23:38.951
to the debate?

23:38.951 --> 23:43.756
MARC ROSENBLUM: I mean, I think
one of the most interesting
things about the Donald Trump

23:43.756 --> 23:49.328
comments is how it highlights
the divide within the Republican
Party, and how, you know,
Republicans

23:49.328 --> 23:54.933
are struggling to respond
positively or negatively to him.

23:54.933 --> 23:59.772
And, ultimately, that's really
going to drive the policy-making
agenda, is sort of how that

23:59.772 --> 24:05.611
party sorts out its conflict
over immigration. So, in that
sense -- it's been a little

24:05.611 --> 24:10.015
bit productive in that sense,
but, you know, it does distract
from real -- you know, to

24:10.015 --> 24:12.851
focus so much on immigrants and
crime does distract from the
issues that do dominate

24:12.851 --> 24:15.321
immigration policy.

24:15.321 --> 24:17.489
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Jessica
Vaughan, what is your take on
that? Do you think this

24:17.489 --> 24:21.427
is helping the debate, helping
the conversation move forward?

24:21.427 --> 24:28.634
JESSICA VAUGHAN: Well, the
advocates in our country for
giving amnesty to illegal

24:28.634 --> 24:32.871
aliens and for expanding
immigration would like people to
believe that everyone who is

24:32.871 --> 24:38.744
coming over here is harmless
and here for good reasons.

24:38.744 --> 24:44.750
And what Donald Trump did point
out is that, you know, that not
all immigrants are here

24:44.750 --> 24:49.021
for those reasons, that some of
them are committing crimes, and
we need to have policies in
place

24:49.021 --> 24:56.261
that ensure that they are being
removed as quickly as possible,
and that local jurisdictions

24:56.261 --> 25:02.735
are not allowed to obstruct
immigration enforcement for
political reasons, which leads
inevitably

25:02.735 --> 25:09.441
to people who should be removed
getting released back on to the
streets.

25:09.441 --> 25:16.548
And this is something that
Congress needs to address to
crack down on sanctuary
jurisdictions

25:16.548 --> 25:18.784
and make it clear that they're
expected to comply with
immigration law and that they

25:18.784 --> 25:20.352
may be penalized if they don't.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.287
(CROSSTALK)

25:22.287 --> 25:25.157
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Marielena Hincapie, can I get a
last take on -- you about this?

25:28.060 --> 25:31.797
Yes, Donald Trump, the reason
there is such a reaction to
Donald Trump's comments is
because,

25:31.797 --> 25:36.902
in 2015, in the United States,
we are no longer going to accept
that level of intolerance

25:36.902 --> 25:39.104
in our nation, especially from
someone who is trying to become
president of the United

25:39.104 --> 25:40.839
States.

25:40.839 --> 25:46.111
So I do think that, as Marc
said, it helps the debate, only
from the perspective that

25:46.111 --> 25:51.383
it helps us to see which
politicians really believe in a
vision in our country that is

25:51.383 --> 25:57.790
inclusive and which ones have an
intolerant and racist
perspective that basically
labels

25:57.790 --> 26:00.759
all of us immigrants
as criminals.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.695
And that is definitely not a
fact. And the studies show
that, in fact, the majority of

26:03.695 --> 26:06.031
immigrants are not
committing crimes.

26:06.031 --> 26:08.700
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
thank you all very much for
joining us tonight.

26:08.700 --> 26:12.371
MARIELENA HINCAPIE: Thank you.

26:12.371 --> 26:16.308
MARC ROSENBLUM: Thanks.

26:16.308 --> 26:23.515
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Brooks and Dionne.
That's New York Times columnist

26:23.515 --> 26:26.885
David Brooks and Washington Post
columnist E.J. Dionne. Mark
Shields is away.

26:26.885 --> 26:27.853
Welcome to you both.

26:27.853 --> 26:30.122
E.J. DIONNE: Good
to be with you.

26:30.122 --> 26:34.526
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's pick
up this conversation about
immigration. We have just heard
this

26:34.526 --> 26:39.398
rational -- David, this rational
discussion about immigration.

26:39.398 --> 26:42.634
But what Donald Trump
has been saying and

26:42.634 --> 26:49.308
doubling down on has really
started a firestorm. What does
that do to the national -- our

26:49.308 --> 26:52.811
nation's ability to get its
hands around this issue?

26:52.811 --> 26:56.014
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it might be
-- what Trump said is the
dictionary definition of

26:56.014 --> 26:57.983
xenophobia, nativism.

26:57.983 --> 27:03.055
He had a factually inaccurate
statement that generalized about
a whole group of people,

27:03.055 --> 27:06.959
inaccurately, in a slurring
manner. We have got a parking
lot right out here at the
"NewsHour"

27:06.959 --> 27:09.728
where we brought a bunch of
immigrants. And when you pull
up, they're not trying to rape

27:09.728 --> 27:14.066
you. They're not trying to sell
drugs. They're trying to paint
your backyard -- or back porch.

27:14.066 --> 27:18.704
And that's statistically what
the immigrant population is.
They're here to work. And

27:18.704 --> 27:22.941
it's what most people's common
experience of immigrants,
undocumented or not. And

27:22.941 --> 27:27.279
so that's the reality. As Marc
said, the useful thing about
what's happened is that

27:27.279 --> 27:31.517
we have seen this fissure in the
Republican Party, where Jeb Bush
came out very strongly

27:31.517 --> 27:35.888
against Trump, saying he takes
it personally, Rubio again very
strongly.

27:35.888 --> 27:41.660
It has brought them out. It has
brought their ire out, a little
passion in rebutting Trump.

27:41.660 --> 27:46.265
Ted Cruz, a little more
disgraceful, more or less saying
he raises good issues and things

27:46.265 --> 27:50.369
like that. So we have begun to
see a split. The party now has
to confront this. And

27:50.369 --> 27:54.273
I think most of the leading
candidates have, to my mind,
come out on the right side.

27:54.273 --> 27:56.241
JUDY WOODRUFF: So it's been
helpful in understanding where
the Republicans stand on this
issue,

27:56.241 --> 27:57.976
E.J.?

27:57.976 --> 28:02.414
E.J. DIONNE: Well, I think if
you ask most Republicans,
Republican consultants, they

28:02.414 --> 28:07.252
would love to say to Donald
Trump, you're fired, and have
him walk away, because this

28:07.252 --> 28:10.155
has been terrible for the
Republican Party's image.

28:10.155 --> 28:15.394
I mean, David is right about
Bush and Rubio to some degree
pushing back, but they were

28:15.394 --> 28:20.999
very slow to push back. And a
lot of Republicans have been
very cautious in dealing with
Trump.

28:20.999 --> 28:23.769
And I think Latino voters, but
immigrant voters of all kinds
are going to remember

28:23.769 --> 28:27.072
that caution.

28:27.072 --> 28:31.877
And I think what Trump did this
summer is going to last.
Usually, it's 16 months until

28:31.877 --> 28:36.148
the election, a lot of things
will happen, but the nature of
his words, using the word

28:36.148 --> 28:38.617
rapists, are so
powerful, that I...

28:38.617 --> 28:38.984
(CROSSTALK)

28:38.984 --> 28:40.652
JUDY WOODRUFF: And murder.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.955
E.J. DIONNE: And murder -- that
I don't think there is any
political eraser that's

28:42.955 --> 28:45.157
going to get rid of
them completely.

28:45.157 --> 28:47.926
This is the last thing
Republicans needed right now.

28:47.926 --> 28:50.562
DAVID BROOKS: I should say, he
was only a Republican since last
week. He's in a

28:50.562 --> 28:53.031
sui generis position of
being a political freak.

28:53.031 --> 28:54.733
E.J. DIONNE: No, I think
it is going to be...

28:54.733 --> 28:55.734
(CROSSTALK)

28:55.734 --> 28:56.635
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean Trump.
You're talking about Trump.

28:56.635 --> 28:58.236
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

28:58.236 --> 29:04.009
E.J. DIONNE: If Trump ever gets
serious, I think the attacks on
him for where he was

29:04.009 --> 29:08.847
on any number of issues,
including now he thinks Hillary
Clinton is the worst secretary

29:08.847 --> 29:11.984
of state in history -- he used
to say he loved Hillary Clinton,
thought she would be a much

29:11.984 --> 29:15.020
stronger candidate
than President Obama.

29:15.020 --> 29:17.356
Now, that's a sin in the
Republican Party, to have said
something nice about Hillary

29:17.356 --> 29:18.991
Clinton.

29:18.991 --> 29:22.761
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David, you
don't think the delay, the fact
that it took some of the

29:22.761 --> 29:24.963
other candidates some time to
come forward with their
statement, makes a difference?

29:36.642 --> 29:39.211
on immigration, where John
McCain was on immigration, where
a lot of -- where Bob Dole --
where

29:39.211 --> 29:43.415
a lot of previous
nominees have been.

29:43.415 --> 29:49.054
And the party has wandered into
an anti-immigration or an
anti-immigration reform
direction as

29:49.054 --> 29:54.159
a result of the rise of the talk
radio part of the party. But
that part of the party

29:54.159 --> 29:58.997
is waning, frankly, and I think
it will be very possible for Jeb
Bush or Rubio, whoever

29:58.997 --> 30:03.502
the nominee is, to be where
McCain was and to be where
George W. Bush was.

30:03.502 --> 30:06.371
Those are not ancient history of
the Republican Party. The party
will rediscover that moment.

30:10.842 --> 30:12.477
Republicans?

30:12.477 --> 30:17.416
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it's hard
to give him credit for doing a
favor, but the people who

30:17.416 --> 30:21.286
did the favor were Bush and
Rubio and the party members who
did the right thing.

30:21.286 --> 30:24.556
E.J. DIONNE: I think, if they
come out strong, he will have
done them a perverse kind of

30:24.556 --> 30:26.324
favor.

30:26.324 --> 30:31.596
And I think the reason this is
so harmful to Republicans is not
just Latinos. Mitt

30:31.596 --> 30:37.002
Romney was beaten by Barack
Obama among Asian-Americans
voted by 3-1 in the last
election. Asian-Americans

30:37.002 --> 30:41.406
voted 55 percent for the
first President Bush.

30:41.406 --> 30:46.611
And a lot of that reaction among
Asian-Americans is to this
xenophobia and a sense of
prejudice.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.013
They have got to beat that back
if they are going to have a
chance...

30:48.013 --> 30:49.548
(CROSSTALK)

30:49.548 --> 30:52.184
DAVID BROOKS: It should be
said, in the last midterms, they
did reasonably well among

30:52.184 --> 30:55.387
Asian-Americans. So they're
working that and they're
conscious of it.

30:55.387 --> 30:58.724
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you don't
see the -- you see the
Republican Party coming through
this,

30:58.724 --> 31:01.159
that this is not going to have a
lasting -- do lasting damage?

31:01.159 --> 31:03.795
DAVID BROOKS: I have this naive
assumption that people are not
complete idiots.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.497
(LAUGHTER)

31:05.497 --> 31:10.068
DAVID BROOKS: It just want to
-- just in terms of the issue, I
think the merits are

31:10.068 --> 31:13.572
on the side of the sort of
comprehensive immigration reform
George W. Bush championed.

31:13.572 --> 31:17.709
But just in terms of political
survival, if you just say
they're venal and they just want

31:17.709 --> 31:20.345
to win elections, it's not --
this is not rocket science here.

31:20.345 --> 31:25.383
E.J. DIONNE: But I think the
catch is that a very substantial
part of the Republican

31:25.383 --> 31:29.054
coalition and an even a larger
part of the Tea Party coalition
is very anti-immigrant

31:29.054 --> 31:32.190
or very anti-immigration reform.

31:32.190 --> 31:37.496
So, I don't think it's as easy
as you're saying for Republicans
to do this, even if it is

31:37.496 --> 31:40.265
-- and I agree with you on this
-- in their long-term interest.

31:40.265 --> 31:45.537
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, a related
issue, and that is the flag, the
Confederate Flag.

31:45.537 --> 31:51.109
It came down today in South
Carolina. There was a big
celebration. But, meanwhile,
yesterday,

31:51.109 --> 31:55.380
David, at the Capitol, there was
this sudden partisan flare-up
over the flag. Why does

31:55.380 --> 31:59.518
this issue keep
coming up right now?

31:59.518 --> 32:03.989
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I guess, in
my view, the reason the flag
should come down is just

32:03.989 --> 32:06.625
a matter of civic politeness. I
have said this before on this
program. If a large

32:06.625 --> 32:10.829
percentage of your fellow
citizens disapprove of
something, fine, just be
civically polite

32:10.829 --> 32:15.267
and accept their offense and
say, no, I'm going to respect
you.

32:15.267 --> 32:19.938
In both these issues, there is a
large culture war element. What
Donald Trump was exploiting

32:19.938 --> 32:25.110
was the fact that people like us
and people like my newspaper
would come down hard on

32:25.110 --> 32:28.814
him for saying those things
about immigrants. The same with
the Confederate Flag. If

32:28.814 --> 32:32.083
you can get the East Coast and
West Coast establishment and the
mainstream media against

32:32.083 --> 32:36.021
you, you win points
in certain circles.

32:36.021 --> 32:39.491
And so you want to pick those
fights. And so the Confederate
Flag has become one of

32:39.491 --> 32:43.728
those thumb-in-the-eye issues
that people use in order to pick
a culture war fight.

32:43.728 --> 32:48.633
And it helps you in the Sarah
Palin wings. And so I think
it's almost become abstracted.

32:48.633 --> 32:53.939
It's part of the media game
that some people play to get
attention, to pick fights and

32:53.939 --> 32:56.374
to win supports against those
who don't like the mainstream
institutions.

32:56.374 --> 32:58.510
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it continue
to be a political issue?

32:58.510 --> 33:02.614
E.J. DIONNE: I think
it's slowly going away.

33:02.614 --> 33:07.485
The problem with it is, this
isn't simply a culture war
issue. People have legitimate

33:07.485 --> 33:10.655
disagreements about abortion,
for example, and we're probably
going to be arguing about

33:10.655 --> 33:14.960
that for a long time. The
Confederate Flag really does
stand for a regime that endorsed

33:14.960 --> 33:17.329
slavery.

33:17.329 --> 33:24.569
The Confederate Flag didn't go
back up in the South until the
1950s and early one 1960s,

33:24.569 --> 33:28.740
very consciously as a symbol of
white supremacy and opposition
to the civil rights.
African-Americans

33:28.740 --> 33:31.843
know that.

33:31.843 --> 33:35.513
And so this isn't just about
cultural politics. This is
about racial politics that we
have

33:35.513 --> 33:41.620
been fighting in our country
from the very, very beginning.
I think that what you saw

33:41.620 --> 33:47.559
in South Carolina was a
wonderful human reaction, even
on the parts of people who had
been for

33:47.559 --> 33:53.064
the flag before, saying not only
was the death of nine people a
horror, but the spirit of

33:53.064 --> 33:58.403
forgiveness from their families
really moved an entire state,
and that's a big deal.

33:58.403 --> 34:03.174
But before we pat ourselves on
the back too much, we should
remember it took nine deaths

34:03.174 --> 34:06.544
of good people to bring that
flag down. That's not very
heartening.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.913
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. But,
still, it's a good day.

34:07.913 --> 34:10.081
E.J. DIONNE: I agree with that.

34:10.081 --> 34:13.385
DAVID BROOKS: While we're upset
about the little kerfuffle in
Washington, bringing the

34:13.385 --> 34:17.389
flag down in South Carolina was
a symbol -- it's bizarre to say
-- but there was a symbol of

34:17.389 --> 34:20.492
hostility to the civil
rights movement.

34:20.492 --> 34:26.431
And so that era of hostility to
the civil rights movement, even
in 2015, it is over

34:26.431 --> 34:28.934
with the bringing down of the
flag. We will have all these
other issues to talk about.

34:28.934 --> 34:31.937
But it's still a remarkable day
that it come down to widespread
cheers. And so it's

34:31.937 --> 34:32.337
a day...

34:32.337 --> 34:34.039
(CROSSTALK)

34:34.039 --> 34:35.607
E.J. DIONNE: No, I don't want
to take away from the good day.
I really agree with you

34:35.607 --> 34:37.676
on that.

34:37.676 --> 34:42.580
But we should -- the Southern
strategy as part of the
Republican strategy going back

34:42.580 --> 34:47.285
to when the civil rights bill
passed, and Lyndon Johnson said
we, meaning Democrats,

34:47.285 --> 34:51.356
have lost the South for a
generation, I mean, it's all
connected to that.

34:51.356 --> 34:55.327
So, yes, I celebrate. But,
again, it still bothers, it
sobers me that it took what it

34:55.327 --> 34:57.896
took to get this done.

34:57.896 --> 35:00.031
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask
you about one other thing, and
that is the Democratic
presidential

35:00.031 --> 35:03.401
contest.

35:03.401 --> 35:06.604
I interviewed Jimmy Carter,
former President Jimmy Carter,
on this program last night.

35:06.604 --> 35:11.509
And among other things, he
complimented, David, Bernie
Sanders. He said he's been

35:11.509 --> 35:17.482
bolder than Hillary Clinton when
it comes to income inequality
and other liberal issues.

35:17.482 --> 35:21.486
How do you see that? We have
been talking about this for
several weeks now, about how

35:21.486 --> 35:26.558
Sanders is drawing bigger
crowds. How do you see this
dynamic playing out, Bernie
Sanders

35:26.558 --> 35:30.195
playing to the left of the party
and what it's doing to the
Clinton campaign?

35:30.195 --> 35:34.299
DAVID BROOKS: Well, it is and
always has been a university
crowd left in this country,

35:34.299 --> 35:39.504
a progressive element at our
many fine universities. And
he's playing to that element.

35:39.504 --> 35:43.641
But that element is not big.
It's not even big within the
Democratic Party. He doesn't

35:43.641 --> 35:48.413
get the working class. He
doesn't get the suburban voter.
He doesn't, by and large,

35:48.413 --> 35:50.915
get African-American and Latino
voters. So there is a huge
ceiling on what he can do.

35:56.821 --> 36:02.761
overwhelming favorite, no matter
how big of crowds he can get in
university towns. Second,

36:02.761 --> 36:06.464
she has to be aware that she
lives in a country where people
are quite suspicious of
government,

36:06.464 --> 36:10.835
more suspicious of government
than they are business.

36:10.835 --> 36:15.907
And, in my view, on substantive
grounds aside, just political
grounds, if she goes over and

36:15.907 --> 36:20.178
seems like a very conventional
big government liberal, it is
going to be much easier for

36:20.178 --> 36:23.181
any Republican to run against
her, because this is not a
country that is sanguine about

36:23.181 --> 36:25.116
government power.

36:25.116 --> 36:26.051
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you're
saying that is maybe where she's
headed. Is that what you

36:26.051 --> 36:27.685
see?

36:27.685 --> 36:32.357
E.J. DIONNE: Well, first of
all, Bernie, I have been saying,
is like "Mr. Smith Goes

36:32.357 --> 36:34.926
to Washington," except he's a
socialist from Vermont with a
Brooklyn accent.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.594
(LAUGHTER)

36:36.594 --> 36:40.165
E.J. DIONNE: But there is a
kind of authenticity. The guy
gets up there and you know he's

36:40.165 --> 36:43.001
saying exactly what he thinks.
He's always said these things.
I think that appeals

36:43.001 --> 36:45.336
to lots of people.

36:45.336 --> 36:50.308
And one area I would disagree
with David on is that I think he
will get working-class

36:50.308 --> 36:54.946
votes. There's a lot of -- and
he has gotten working-class in
Vermont and he will get a

36:54.946 --> 36:58.783
lot of union locals, even as
national locals -- endorse
Hillary Clinton.

36:58.783 --> 37:01.386
I think there is a
ceiling. I agree with

37:01.386 --> 37:06.124
that. I don't think he is going
to win the nomination, but he
could -- it's not inconceivable

37:06.124 --> 37:11.763
to me that he could win both in
Iowa and New Hampshire. Hillary
Clinton got only less

37:11.763 --> 37:14.599
than a third of the vote in
Iowa the last time she ran.

37:14.599 --> 37:19.337
And he's very close to New
Hampshire. So, I think those
races could be tight. I think,

37:19.337 --> 37:22.841
as it goes forward, I think
Clinton will still win the
nomination. And on the
government

37:22.841 --> 37:24.142
point...

37:24.142 --> 37:25.710
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even if she were
to lose in Iowa and New
Hampshire?

37:25.710 --> 37:28.546
E.J. DIONNE: Yes. I think she
would still win the nomination.

37:28.546 --> 37:33.351
And it's unlikely she will lose
both. I'm just saying that is a
possibility we shouldn't

37:33.351 --> 37:36.488
write off. In terms of the
government thing, she is going
to give a speech on Monday that

37:36.488 --> 37:40.758
is a very progressive speech
about what government can do for
people.

37:40.758 --> 37:44.829
I think the public's view is
ambivalent. And Stan Greenberg
has it right. The voters

37:44.829 --> 37:47.465
would like the government to do
a lot of stuff. They don't
trust it very much. She has

37:47.465 --> 37:48.633
got to solve that riddle.

37:48.633 --> 37:51.302
JUDY WOODRUFF: Quick last word.

37:51.302 --> 37:54.639
DAVID BROOKS: If she -- she's
going to have an early childhood
piece in that piece Monday.

37:54.639 --> 37:58.810
If she sticks to that, fine.
That's getting people into the
marketplace, so they can have

37:58.810 --> 38:01.746
an opportunity to compete. If
she begins to seem to be
meddling in the marketplace

38:01.746 --> 38:07.152
and capitalism, I do think
people will recoil.

38:07.152 --> 38:08.720
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will all be
listening. We have been
listening to you both.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.387
David Brooks, E.J.
Dionne, thank you.

38:09.387 --> 38:15.293
E.J. DIONNE: Thank you so much.

38:15.293 --> 38:26.271
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to
Wimbledon, where Serena Williams
reigns on.

38:26.271 --> 38:31.809
Tomorrow morning, the tennis
great will attempt another
Serena Slam, holding all four
Grand

38:31.809 --> 38:36.481
Slam titles at once. She won
the U.S. Open last year, and has
since won the Australian

38:36.481 --> 38:41.319
and French opens. She pulled
off the same feat 12 years ago.

38:41.319 --> 38:47.325
At 33 years old, Serena is
seeded number one and she faces
21-year-old Garbine Muguruza

38:47.325 --> 38:50.128
from Spain in the finals.

38:50.128 --> 38:54.532
We are going to look at this
latest run and the remarkable
career of this woman with Tom

38:54.532 --> 38:57.735
Perrotta. He's a sports
correspondent for The Wall
Street Journal and he's
editor-at-large

38:57.735 --> 38:59.637
for "Tennis" magazine.

38:59.637 --> 39:02.006
Tom Perrotta, welcome.

39:02.006 --> 39:07.645
You wrote, I think it was back
in November, about how Serena
Williams then, you said,

39:07.645 --> 39:11.749
had the right to be acclaimed
the best of all time. That was
eight months ago. So

39:11.749 --> 39:14.552
now it's even more so, right?

39:14.552 --> 39:18.923
TOM PERROTTA, The Wall Street
Journal: It is even more so.
It's pretty amazing what

39:18.923 --> 39:23.228
she's doing, especially at this
age. She's won seven Grand Slam
titles in her 30s. It's

39:23.228 --> 39:23.995
really unprecedented.

39:23.995 --> 39:27.031
JUDY WOODRUFF: How
do you explain it?

39:27.031 --> 39:33.304
TOM PERROTTA: It's amazing,
like her resurgence.

39:33.304 --> 39:39.711
She's really improved her
fitness and her speed and her
game a lot in the last few
years.

39:39.711 --> 39:43.881
She hired a new coach and has
really taken off. The thing
that's the really most amazing

39:43.881 --> 39:47.619
about her is the drive that she
has at this age. I think most
players, when they get

39:47.619 --> 39:49.721
into their 30s, a lot of
times, they burn out.

39:49.721 --> 39:53.858
And a I think a lot expected her
Serena Williams to burn out much
earlier than this, because

39:53.858 --> 39:57.862
she won when she was so young.
It's been against the narrative
that everyone really

39:57.862 --> 40:00.832
expected that she's been
this good for this long.

40:00.832 --> 40:03.968
JUDY WOODRUFF: What's different
about her game today than 12
years ago, when she pulled

40:03.968 --> 40:09.040
off this remarkable feat
of all four at one time?

40:09.040 --> 40:15.179
TOM PERROTTA: Much better at
defense, much steadier, better
rallies, really morning reliable

40:15.179 --> 40:17.649
and confident in rallies.

40:17.649 --> 40:21.653
And all the other stuff is still
there, the killer instinct and
all that. The biggest

40:21.653 --> 40:24.656
thing that separates her from
everybody else and always has
for her whole career is her

40:24.656 --> 40:28.860
serve. Her serve is better than
anybody else on the tour by far.
She can ace people

40:28.860 --> 40:32.764
seemingly whenever she needs it.
It's an amazing weapon, really
probably the best serve

40:32.764 --> 40:35.333
that the women's
game has ever seen.

40:35.333 --> 40:39.804
JUDY WOODRUFF: What does she
face tomorrow in this young
21-year-old opponent?

40:39.804 --> 40:46.411
TOM PERROTTA: On paper,
it's a big mismatch.

40:46.411 --> 40:51.182
This is her first Grand Slam
final and she's only won one
tournament in her life, but
she's

40:51.182 --> 40:54.919
a very good player and she
played fearlessly at Wimbledon
so far. She's 6-feet tall.

40:54.919 --> 40:59.023
She hits very hard. She moves
well. She has a very good serve
herself. And she really

40:59.023 --> 41:01.459
has nothing to lose out there.

41:01.459 --> 41:05.563
And she sounds confident. And
she was an admirer of Serena
Williams when she was a

41:05.563 --> 41:09.734
kid too, and pretty similar
games. And she also beat her
once at the French Open a few

41:09.734 --> 41:13.638
years ago, actually gave Serena
her worst ever loss in a Grand
Slam. She knows that

41:13.638 --> 41:17.942
she can do it. This is a much
different setting, a much bigger
stage, but she has

41:17.942 --> 41:20.478
the game to do it. It's a
matter of whether she will get
nervous or not.

41:20.478 --> 41:23.881
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, as you
said, she's beaten her before.

41:23.881 --> 41:28.419
How significant in tennis
history would it be if Serena
Williams were to pull this off

41:28.419 --> 41:34.826
tomorrow and win, again, four
Grand Slams at one time in one
year?

41:34.826 --> 41:37.228
TOM PERROTTA: It would be the
second time she's done it, which
is really remarkable.

41:39.897 --> 41:41.899
TOM PERROTTA: If she went on to
win the U.S. Open, she would be
the first person since

41:41.899 --> 41:47.038
Steffi Graf in 1988 to win
all four in one year.

41:47.038 --> 41:50.975
And she is only two Grand Slam
titles between Graf right now
for most in the Open era.
Serena

41:50.975 --> 41:57.782
has 20. Graf has 22. And
Serena already has the longest
span in that period since

41:57.782 --> 42:02.954
1968. Between her first Grand
Slam title and her latest one,
it's almost 16 years.

42:02.954 --> 42:04.856
And if she wins Wimbledon, it
will be the longest in the
history of the sport. It's

42:04.856 --> 42:06.224
really remarkable.

42:06.224 --> 42:09.894
Nobody has been this good
for this long in tennis.

42:09.894 --> 42:13.564
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, just
quickly, we don't want to
completely ignore the men.
Roger

42:13.564 --> 42:19.237
Federer had a remarkable
performance today. He's the
same age as Serena Williams, 33.

42:19.237 --> 42:22.707
How do you explain that?

42:22.707 --> 42:29.046
TOM PERROTTA: Federer is --
yes, he's the player that time
forgot. It's pretty amazing.

42:29.046 --> 42:32.683
Andy Roddick is here as a
commentator for the BBC. And
some of us were talking to

42:32.683 --> 42:36.020
him after the match. And
Roddick is a year younger than
Federer. And he's already
retired.

42:36.020 --> 42:39.190
He was out practicing at
Wimbledon today and he rolled
his ankle and hurt his foot.

42:39.190 --> 42:42.527
He was playing with
a junior player.

42:42.527 --> 42:46.030
And Federer never seems to get
hurt. He's incredibly light on
his feet. His technique

42:46.030 --> 42:50.735
is beautiful. That has really
helped him a lot, also a great
serve, and continues to

42:50.735 --> 42:53.471
have a lot of fun out there.
And he will be playing Novak
Djokovic, who is the number

42:53.471 --> 42:56.974
one player in the world. They
played in the final last year.
Djokovic won in five

42:56.974 --> 43:00.611
sets. It was a very, very good
match. And they have had a
great rivalry. Federer leads

43:00.611 --> 43:03.648
20-19. It's very close.

43:03.648 --> 43:10.021
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tom Perrotta
with The Wall Street Journal, we
thank you.

43:10.021 --> 43:20.865
Next: A new documentary takes
an intimate look at the life and
death of Amy Winehouse.

43:24.202 --> 43:31.642
JEFFREY BROWN: July 23, 2011,
Amy Winehouse, the British mega
pop star, was found dead

43:31.642 --> 43:40.751
from alcohol poisoning in her
London home. She was 27 years
old. Four years earlier,

43:40.751 --> 43:45.823
she'd released her
multi-platinum album, "Back to
Black," including the hit song
"Rehab."

43:45.823 --> 43:56.801
Her music was one window into
her life. It told of addictions
to drugs and alcohol and

43:56.801 --> 44:02.406
troubled relationships, much of
which played out in public in
front of cameras, lots of

44:02.406 --> 44:24.128
them. But now the new
documentary "Amy" use cameras in
another way, home movies,
behind-the-scenes

44:24.128 --> 44:28.432
videos, phone footage and more,
to build what director Asif
Kapadia told me is a more
complete

44:28.432 --> 44:31.135
portrait of the artist.

44:31.135 --> 44:35.273
ASIF KAPADIA, Director, "Amy":
And my aim was to try to
humanize her, as much as
possible.

44:35.273 --> 44:39.510
She didn't have a very good rep,
particularly here in the U.S.
People knew her songs,

44:39.510 --> 44:42.713
but the word that comes up the
most in interviews is train
wreck, which is not a nice way
to

44:42.713 --> 44:45.716
sum up a young girl.

44:45.716 --> 44:49.620
So, really, my aim overall for
the film was to humanize her, to
show you how brilliant

44:49.620 --> 44:53.958
she was, and for you to kind of
fall in love her. When you fall
in love with her, then

44:53.958 --> 44:59.363
you feel very different when you
see the archive footage of the
paparazzi and her being hounded.

45:04.435 --> 45:07.638
said they feel a bit angry by
the end, because then you
realize there was kind of a very

45:07.638 --> 45:09.373
special soul there.

45:09.373 --> 45:12.310
MAN: How big do you think
you are going to be?

45:12.310 --> 45:16.681
AMY WINEHOUSE, Musician: I
don't. I don't, because my
music is not on that scale. My

45:16.681 --> 45:24.188
music is not on that scale.
Sometimes, I wish it was. But I
don't think I'm going

45:24.188 --> 45:31.028
to be at all fine with -- I
don't think I could handle it.
I would probably go mad.

45:31.028 --> 45:34.765
Do you know what I
mean? I would go mad.

45:34.765 --> 45:38.769
JEFFREY BROWN: Kapadia gained
access to footage from
Winehouse's family, friends and

45:38.769 --> 45:44.241
record company and made what he
calls a mosaic. We rarely see
the faces of those talking.

45:44.241 --> 45:48.079
What we do see in every
possible light is Amy herself.

45:48.079 --> 45:51.315
AMY WINEHOUSE: I wouldn't write
unless it was directly personal
to me, just because

45:51.315 --> 45:54.619
I wouldn't be able to
tell the story right.

45:54.619 --> 45:59.757
ASIF KAPADIA: I find her face
and her eyes so expressive. But
you just see the way

45:59.757 --> 46:03.928
they change gradually over time,
her hair, her body shape, all of
that.

46:03.928 --> 46:08.799
For me, this is more cinematic.
This is a more of a theatrical
experience, where you

46:08.799 --> 46:14.839
just spend two hours with the
lead person, the lead character
who is in front of you,

46:14.839 --> 46:18.409
and not so much worrying about
who's talking, because they're
giving you an opinion. And

46:18.409 --> 46:20.511
you're -- really, the audience
has to piece together everything
that is going on and form

46:20.511 --> 46:23.047
their own opinion.

46:23.047 --> 46:29.286
JEFFREY BROWN: Winehouse grew
up in North London listening to
jazz singers, and then

46:29.286 --> 46:52.009
created her own sound and
phenomenon through a powerful
voice, raw lyrics, and sheer
force

46:52.009 --> 46:56.013
of a personality that is
sometimes frightened, sometimes
funny and often ferocious.

46:56.013 --> 46:57.615
(SINGING)

46:57.615 --> 47:06.424
AMY WINEHOUSE: Oh, it's a bit
upsetting at the end, isn't it?

47:06.424 --> 47:13.030
ASIF KAPADIA: She's just a
natural artist. She picks up a
guitar, goes up on the stage,

47:13.030 --> 47:16.000
sings and blows you away.

47:16.000 --> 47:21.205
So, really, the biggest
revelation for me was to
understand her personality, to
understand

47:21.205 --> 47:25.676
that these songs were personal,
and they're like pages from her
diary. And there's problems

47:25.676 --> 47:28.713
with addiction and the
relationships and the choices
that she made and people around
her

47:28.713 --> 47:30.781
made.

47:30.781 --> 47:33.918
Then you follow it through and
you realize, actually, enough of
the issues are already

47:33.918 --> 47:37.922
there, but they're just about
under control. When you become
mega-famous and suddenly

47:37.922 --> 47:41.892
the paparazzi are after you, it
all got a bit out of control.
Suddenly, she had become

47:41.892 --> 47:43.394
a global star. And it was
something that she was a bit
fearful of right from a young

47:43.394 --> 47:45.262
age.

47:45.262 --> 47:50.935
JEFFREY BROWN: But if the
intimacy of the camera draws us
in, the vulture-like pursuit

47:50.935 --> 47:55.306
and glare of constant cameras,
including those of the
paparazzi, repel us.

47:55.306 --> 47:58.242
MAN: Amy Winehouse
is back in rehab.

47:58.242 --> 48:01.212
JEFFREY BROWN: As we watch
Winehouse's life unravel.

48:01.212 --> 48:05.549
ASIF KAPADIA: The idea is to
kind of make that feel as
visceral as possible, for us,

48:05.549 --> 48:07.651
the audience, to be
in the middle of it.

48:07.651 --> 48:12.156
I mean, literally, we are one of
the camerapeople in the middle
of it hounding Amy. There's

48:12.156 --> 48:17.061
a recurring theme too in the
film on a kind of aesthetic
side, which is that we, the
audience,

48:17.061 --> 48:19.196
become the person
holding the camera.

48:19.196 --> 48:23.300
It starts off kind of innocent.
She's always performing in a way
for the camera. Later

48:23.300 --> 48:27.404
on, it becomes more and more
aggressive and more and more
painful. And I guess we, the

48:27.404 --> 48:30.407
audience, were the people
watching these videos. We're
clicking on those YouTube videos
of

48:30.407 --> 48:35.179
her giving bad performances,
where somebody is buying those
tabloid newspapers. The

48:35.179 --> 48:38.249
feeling was, the intention was
to make the audience slightly
complicit, to make us wonder

48:38.249 --> 48:42.119
about how much did we play
a part in her downturn.

48:42.119 --> 48:47.224
JEFFREY BROWN: Also called into
question, the role of some of
those closest to Winehouse.

48:47.224 --> 48:52.062
Her family, after working with
the filmmaker, disassociated
itself from the movie, saying

48:52.062 --> 48:56.333
it was -- quote -- "both
misleading and contained some
basic untruths."

48:56.333 --> 48:59.136
Asif Kapadia says this:

48:59.136 --> 49:03.207
ASIF KAPADIA: The aim was never
to point a finger in a
particular direction or
apportion

49:03.207 --> 49:07.878
blame, but the whole thing
became very muddy and cloudy and
messy.

49:07.878 --> 49:11.649
Most of the people who have seen
the film who were on the inner
circle, who were there,

49:11.649 --> 49:15.452
even if they don't come out of
it well, have all said the film
is honest. And, most
importantly,

49:15.452 --> 49:17.521
the person who comes out of it
best is Amy. And I guess that
is what I was hoping to

49:17.521 --> 49:19.690
achieve.

49:19.690 --> 49:26.363
AMY WINEHOUSE: I'm not a girl
trying to be a star. I'm just a
girl that sings.

49:26.363 --> 49:30.234
JEFFREY BROWN: The documentary
"Amy" opens today in theaters
across the nation.

49:30.234 --> 49:34.972
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Jeffrey Brown.

49:34.972 --> 49:46.550
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
to our "NewsHour" Shares of the
day, something that caught our

49:46.550 --> 49:50.154
eye which might be of
interest to you, too.

49:50.154 --> 49:55.392
Tonight, an inside look at the
workshop of artist Koki Ruiz,
who this week put the finishing

49:55.392 --> 50:00.531
touches on a massive edible
altar that Pope Francis will use
this weekend, when he celebrates

50:00.531 --> 50:06.003
mass before thousands
in Paraguay.

50:06.003 --> 50:16.180
KOKI RUIZ, Artist (through
translator): We are making the
altar to reflect the history

50:16.180 --> 50:24.154
of our Mestizo culture, the
baroque of the Jesuit missions,
but with the fruits of the

50:24.154 --> 50:26.523
earth.

50:26.523 --> 50:29.693
Thinking about the indigenous
(INAUDIBLE) culture that speaks
of the seeds of mother

50:29.693 --> 50:35.699
earth, like all the indigenous
from America before Columbus'
rival, thinking that earth

50:35.699 --> 50:40.537
is mother earth, which feeds all
of her children equally. The
earth is bred for all of her

50:40.537 --> 50:48.412
children. There are over 30,000
ears of corn that make up the
altar, 200,000 coconuts

50:48.412 --> 50:51.181
or more, that have written
messages which bear the names of
people and their wishes.

50:57.688 --> 51:01.558
many young people who are seeing
how creativity makes wonderful
things.

51:01.558 --> 51:05.062
JOSE DEL RIO, Visitor (through
translator): Being an altar
that will be seen all over

51:05.062 --> 51:08.799
the world, it's a pride and
joy for all of Paraguay.

51:08.799 --> 51:14.405
OTILIA LOPEZ, Visitor (through
translator): This is unique in
Paraguay and in the whole

51:14.405 --> 51:18.242
world. What can I say? It
gives you goose bumps.

51:18.242 --> 51:24.348
JUDY WOODRUFF: The pope's mass
will begin at 10:00 a.m. local
time Sunday morning.

51:24.348 --> 51:28.352
An editor's note before we go:
Last night, in my interview with
former President Jimmy

51:28.352 --> 51:33.357
Carter, I mistakenly said that
Senator Bernie Sanders wants to
cut taxes on the wealthy.

51:33.357 --> 51:39.063
I meant to say raise taxes on
the wealthy. I regret
misspeaking.

51:39.063 --> 51:43.000
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs from our PBS
colleagues.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.069
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week," which airs
later this evening.

51:45.069 --> 51:47.338
Here's a preview.

51:47.338 --> 51:52.276
GWEN IFILL: We take you behind
the scenes tonight to the big
federal personnel data

51:52.276 --> 51:57.281
breach, to the late-night drama
that moved the Confederate Flag
debate from South Carolina

51:57.281 --> 52:02.586
to the halls of the Congress, to
the 2016 campaign, where
candidates are raising money

52:02.586 --> 52:07.458
hand over fist, while coping
with the Trump factor, and to
the negotiating table in Vienna,

52:07.458 --> 52:12.329
where the U.S. and Iran are
moving cautiously toward and
away from a nuclear deal.

52:12.329 --> 52:16.033
So much to talk about tonight
on "Washington Week" -- Judy.

52:16.033 --> 52:21.071
JUDY WOODRUFF: On "PBS NewsHour
Weekend" Saturday: from Northern
Somalia, the story

52:21.071 --> 52:25.876
of one town's fight to prevent
its youth from fleeing to
Europe.

52:25.876 --> 52:28.379
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:28.379 --> 52:29.546
Have a great weekend.
Thank you, and good night.
