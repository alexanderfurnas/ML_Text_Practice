WEBVTT

00:05.472 --> 00:06.473
GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.473 --> 00:07.307
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.307 --> 00:08.408
GWEN IFILL: Welcome back.

00:08.408 --> 00:10.911
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's
great to be back.

00:10.911 --> 00:15.349
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: an historic visit. Pope
Francis arrives in the

00:15.349 --> 00:17.784
U.S. to a presidential welcome.

00:17.784 --> 00:20.053
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also
ahead this Tuesday:

00:20.053 --> 00:21.455
MICHAEL HORN, CEO, Volkswagen
America: And in my German words,
we have totally screwed

00:21.455 --> 00:23.490
up.

00:23.490 --> 00:28.095
JUDY WOODRUFF: Volkswagen admits
it rigged at least 11 million
cars to pass emission

00:28.095 --> 00:30.063
tests.

00:30.063 --> 00:34.868
GWEN IFILL: And women in combat
-- ahead of a major decision by
the military, the Navy

00:34.868 --> 00:39.940
secretary on why he disagrees
with some Marines about opening
up the ranks.

00:39.940 --> 00:44.411
RAY MABUS, U.S. Secretary of the
Navy: Set high standards. Make
sure those standards

00:44.411 --> 00:48.315
have something to do with the
job. And then whoever meets
those standards, gender is not

00:48.315 --> 00:50.717
-- is not crucial.

00:50.717 --> 00:53.153
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:53.153 --> 00:59.293
(BREAK)

00:59.293 --> 01:13.340
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pope Francis is
now in Washington, after
arriving today to pomp, ceremony
and

01:13.340 --> 01:19.346
cheering, chanting crowds. The
start of his six-day stay
followed four days in Cuba.

01:19.346 --> 01:22.849
William Brangham reports
on the day's events.

01:22.849 --> 01:29.856
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The pope began
his first-ever visit to the
United States late this
afternoon,

01:29.856 --> 01:34.328
flying into a military facility
just outside Washington.

01:34.328 --> 01:37.397
President Obama, Vice President
Biden and their families greeted
Pope Francis on the

01:37.397 --> 01:40.600
tarmac while hundreds
more awaited.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.703
Presidential adviser
Valerie Jarrett:

01:42.703 --> 01:44.771
VALERIE JARRETT, Senior
Presidential Adviser: Everyone
who is coming is excited about
the

01:44.771 --> 01:48.742
opportunity to be in his
presence. And so I think that
this visit means a great deal

01:48.742 --> 01:51.278
to America.

01:51.278 --> 01:55.449
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Security was
tight across the nation's
capital, with barriers erected

01:55.449 --> 02:00.621
at the White House for the
pontiff's official welcome and
meeting with the president
tomorrow.

02:00.621 --> 02:04.458
Workers at the National Shrine
of the Immaculate Conception
also made final preparations.
The

02:04.458 --> 02:07.427
pope celebrates mass there
tomorrow afternoon.

02:07.427 --> 02:09.129
JACQUELYN HAYES, National Shrine
of the Immaculate Conception:
Everybody is just collectively

02:09.129 --> 02:13.166
feeling the excitement of having
the pope here. And all the many
long days and long

02:13.166 --> 02:17.938
hours of work are really coming
together to bring just a
wonderful event to fruition.

02:17.938 --> 02:22.442
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Francis will
address Congress on Thursday,
before going on to New York and

02:22.442 --> 02:26.747
then Philadelphia. The U.S. leg
of his tour began after he
wrapped up a four-day visit

02:26.747 --> 02:29.483
to Cuba.

02:29.483 --> 02:33.453
LANIA LINARE, (through
translator): We're very proud
that he chose our province to
come

02:33.453 --> 02:37.190
bless us, to give us all
his joy here in Santiago.

02:37.190 --> 02:41.361
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The pope used
his final mass on this communist
island to urge Cubans

02:41.361 --> 02:44.231
to rediscover their
Catholic heritage.

02:44.231 --> 02:50.037
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through translator): Our
revolution comes about through

02:50.037 --> 02:54.875
tenderness, through the joy
which always becomes closeness
and compassion, which is not
pity.

02:54.875 --> 03:00.480
It is to suffer in order to be
free. And it leads us to get
involved, to serve others.

03:00.480 --> 03:05.852
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And he met
with families at the Cathedral
of Santiago and offered a

03:05.852 --> 03:13.493
goodbye from its balcony to the
crowds massed outside. The pope
avoided directly addressing

03:13.493 --> 03:17.464
political issues in Cuba. But in
the U.S., many anticipate he
will address immigration

03:17.464 --> 03:20.333
reform, climate change
and other issues.

03:20.333 --> 03:24.638
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham in Washington,
D.C.

03:24.638 --> 03:29.709
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the flight
from Cuba to Washington, the
pontiff dismissed claims that

03:29.709 --> 03:34.681
he is a political liberal. He
told reporters -- quote -- "That
would be a mistake of
interpretation."

03:34.681 --> 03:38.652
And he added that he follows the
social doctrine of the church.

03:38.652 --> 03:43.723
GWEN IFILL: Chinese President Xi
Jinping has also arrived in the
U.S., ahead of his meetings

03:43.723 --> 03:49.696
with President Obama this week.
Xi's Air China plane touched
down in Seattle this morning,

03:49.696 --> 03:55.569
and he was greeted by state and
local officials. He will attend
a forum with tech leaders
tomorrow.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.839
Before his arrival, Xi told The
Wall Street Journal that China
will go ahead with economic

03:58.839 --> 04:03.610
reforms, despite
sluggish growth.

04:03.610 --> 04:07.714
There's no break yet in the
abortion fight that's tied up
the U.S. Congress and could

04:07.714 --> 04:13.787
force a government shutdown.
Senate Democrats blocked a bill
today to ban late-term
abortions.

04:13.787 --> 04:18.291
Now Republicans say they will
seek to fund the government into
December, but strip money

04:18.291 --> 04:22.762
from Planned Parenthood.
Democrats say they will block
that too.

04:22.762 --> 04:28.668
JUDY WOODRUFF: European interior
ministers pushed through a
crisis plan today to relocate

04:28.668 --> 04:34.708
120,000 migrants and refugees.
As they did, throngs of people
continued pouring across

04:34.708 --> 04:41.214
Croatia, Hungary and Austria
by rail, road and on foot.

04:41.214 --> 04:45.051
Jonathan Miller of Independent
Television News followed their
journey today.

04:45.051 --> 04:50.423
JONATHAN MILLER: We drove from
Croatia into Hungary by remote
border crossing early this

04:50.423 --> 04:54.561
morning, and you would have
thought they were preparing for
war.

04:54.561 --> 04:59.499
Overnight, Hungary's Parliament
had passed a law deploying
troops to handle what its

04:59.499 --> 05:07.040
prime minister has cast as a
Muslim invasion. The Humvees
arrived, the border now
bristling

05:07.040 --> 05:12.546
with military hardware and
soldiers. This country's
population rights-wing leader,
Viktor

05:12.546 --> 05:16.249
Orban, had pledged a crackdown
to end the influx and to defend
what he called Christian

05:16.249 --> 05:18.985
culture.

05:18.985 --> 05:23.957
But he's being forced by
Croatia, which in less than a
week has dumped 30,000 asylum

05:23.957 --> 05:28.195
seekers on his doorstep, to
facilitate their transit to the
richer E.U. member states
further

05:28.195 --> 05:35.001
north.

05:35.001 --> 05:39.372
At a Hungarian station called
Hedashalom (ph) this afternoon,
way up in the northwestern

05:39.372 --> 05:45.879
Austrian border, 1,300 people
disgorged from a train that had
come from the Croatian frontier.

05:45.879 --> 05:54.087
From the station, they're
shepherded toward Austria.

05:54.087 --> 05:59.092
As rather friendlier Austrian
soldiers received the new
arrival, reports from Brussels
that

05:59.092 --> 06:01.728
the bickering between E.U.
member states on where to put
people who have arrived in
recent

06:01.728 --> 06:05.732
weeks had reached a fever pitch.

06:05.732 --> 06:10.437
For all the exasperation in
Brussels, for all the political
feuding, the barbed comments

06:10.437 --> 06:17.410
and the bad blood, even if they
do decide on how and where to
resettle 120,000 people,

06:17.410 --> 06:21.815
it won't make the blindest bit
of difference on not only the
exodus from the Middle East,

06:21.815 --> 06:26.953
but on where these people end
up. They're pouring into Europe
at such a rate that, in

06:26.953 --> 06:32.993
20 days' time, there will
be another 120,000 people.

06:32.993 --> 06:41.568
An Austrian soldier, a
second-generation immigrant
himself, offered reassurance and
instructions

06:41.568 --> 06:47.440
in Arabic. As they stood
waiting, European interior
ministers finally voted for
their

06:47.440 --> 06:53.713
plan for mandatory quotas to
farm out the 120,000 refugees.
Four former Soviet bloc

06:53.713 --> 06:58.151
E.U. member states dissented,
but were overruled.

06:58.151 --> 07:03.523
The U.N. Refugee Agency has
already branded the plan
irrelevant to the worst
humanitarian

07:03.523 --> 07:09.296
crisis in decades. The aim was
to allow E.U. leaders to present
a united front at their

07:09.296 --> 07:13.667
emergency summit tomorrow.
Instead, deep rifts have been
exposed, as the human surge
continues

07:13.667 --> 07:15.869
to build.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.606
JUDY WOODRUFF: The four nations
opposing the resettlement plan
are the Czech Republic,

07:19.606 --> 07:22.876
Hungary, Romania and Slovakia.

07:22.876 --> 07:27.747
GWEN IFILL: The exiled president
of Yemen has returned to his
country for the first

07:27.747 --> 07:33.653
time since Shiite rebels forced
him to flee. President Abd-Rabbu
Mansour Hadi spent the

07:33.653 --> 07:38.391
last six months in Saudi Arabia.
He arrived back in the port city
of Aden today, after

07:38.391 --> 07:42.262
his forces recaptured
it with Saudi support.

07:42.262 --> 07:47.967
JUDY WOODRUFF: Separate attacks
in Afghanistan left 15
government troops dead today. In
one,

07:47.967 --> 07:53.606
an Afghan soldier let militants
into a checkpoint to shoot his
fellow soldiers.

07:53.606 --> 07:58.945
Meanwhile, the U.S. commander in
Afghanistan, General John
Campbell, said the sexual abuse

07:58.945 --> 08:03.717
of young boys by Afghan forces
will not be ignored. He denied
that U.S. troops have been

08:03.717 --> 08:07.020
told to look the other way.

08:07.020 --> 08:11.991
GWEN IFILL: The former U.S.
commander in Iraq and
Afghanistan apologized to
Congress today.

08:11.991 --> 08:17.430
Retired Army General David
Petraeus is serving two years
probation for giving classified

08:17.430 --> 08:21.935
information to his former
biographer and mistress. His
testimony at a Senate hearing
was his

08:21.935 --> 08:25.839
first since he resigned
as CIA director in 2012.

08:25.839 --> 08:30.310
DAVID PETRAEUS, Former CIA
Director: I made a serious
mistake, one that brought
discredit

08:30.310 --> 08:37.083
on me and pain closest -- to
those closest to me. It was a
violation of the trust placed

08:37.083 --> 08:41.921
in me and a breach of the values
to which I have been committed
throughout my life.

08:41.921 --> 08:45.392
There's nothing I can
do to undo what I did.

08:45.392 --> 08:50.196
GWEN IFILL: The focus of the
hearing was U.S. strategy
against Islamic State forces.
Petraeus

08:50.196 --> 08:53.967
called for beefing up
efforts in Iraq and Syria.

08:53.967 --> 08:58.671
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
there's word the Obama
administration is shifting more
attention

08:58.671 --> 09:04.878
to Syria, and may arm a wider
array of rebels. A Washington
Post report says the change is

09:04.878 --> 09:09.416
a recognition that efforts in
Iraq have stalled, whereas
Kurdish forces are gaining
ground

09:09.416 --> 09:12.218
against ISIS in Syria.

09:12.218 --> 09:16.990
GWEN IFILL: In Saudi Arabia,
more than two million Muslims
observed the opening rites

09:16.990 --> 09:23.496
today in the annual hajj
pilgrimage to Mecca. Vast crowds
of worshipers circled the Kaaba,

09:23.496 --> 09:27.500
a cube-shaped structure in the
city's Grand Mosque. The main
ceremonies come tomorrow

09:27.500 --> 09:30.603
in a valley outside Mecca.

09:30.603 --> 09:35.375
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, Democratic presidential
candidate Hillary Clinton said

09:35.375 --> 09:40.413
she will oppose building the
Keystone pipeline across the
nation's midsection. She'd
previously

09:40.413 --> 09:44.150
declined to state a
position publicly.

09:44.150 --> 09:49.122
Appearing in Des Moines, Iowa,
Clinton also called for capping
prescription drug costs

09:49.122 --> 09:52.425
and cutting tax breaks
for drug advertising.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.863
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: Too
often, so-called new drugs are
really

09:56.863 --> 10:03.670
old drugs that have just been
tweaked a little bit. But then
they're marketed as breakthrough

10:03.670 --> 10:09.375
drugs, and they're sold for high
prices. Drug companies should
have to explain why their

10:09.375 --> 10:14.247
new drugs are different and
better than treatments on the
market.

10:14.247 --> 10:19.686
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
Republican presidential
candidate Jeb Bush was also in
Iowa. He promised

10:19.686 --> 10:24.624
he will place a freeze on new
federal government regulations
if he's elected.

10:24.624 --> 10:29.062
GWEN IFILL: If you are like most
Americans, you are going to have
at least one mistaken,

10:29.062 --> 10:34.367
or delayed, medical diagnosis
some time during your life. The
prestigious Institute of
Medicine

10:34.367 --> 10:40.106
reported that finding today. It
said the causes range from poor
communication to misread lab

10:40.106 --> 10:44.110
tests. And it called for urgent
changes to address the problem.

10:44.110 --> 10:49.716
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street had a
down day, driven by falling oil
and copper prices. The

10:49.716 --> 10:56.155
Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly 180 points to close
at 16330. The Nasdaq fell

10:56.155 --> 11:00.994
more than 70 points. And
the S&P 500 slipped 24.

11:00.994 --> 11:06.866
GWEN IFILL: And the Interior
Department announced it will not
list the greater sage grouse as

11:06.866 --> 11:13.039
an endangered species. Instead,
it wants to conserve 67 million
acres of habitat. The

11:13.039 --> 11:18.211
unusual bird, usually found in
the West, has seen its numbers
dwindle from millions to

11:18.211 --> 11:25.385
just a few hundred thousand. Its
fate has been a longstanding
issue across 11 states.

11:25.385 --> 11:31.124
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Volkswagen admits to rigging 11
million cars; the painful

11:31.124 --> 11:36.563
legacy of sexual abuse in the
Catholic Church; the Navy
secretary on women in combat;
and

11:36.563 --> 11:44.203
why girls struggle to get
an education in India.

11:44.203 --> 11:56.683
JUDY WOODRUFF: The scandal, and
the fallout, over Volkswagen's
cheating of emissions standards

11:56.683 --> 12:03.823
grew today. Just last week, the
EPA alleged there was deceitful
software in half-a-million

12:03.823 --> 12:07.627
cars. Today, Volkswagen raised
that number significantly and
tried to restore customer

12:07.627 --> 12:11.230
trust.

12:11.230 --> 12:17.303
Volkswagen revealed that as many
as 11 million diesel-powered
cars worldwide could be affected

12:17.303 --> 12:23.276
by software that was designed to
cheat on emissions tests. Most
of those cars are thought

12:23.276 --> 12:29.916
to be in Europe, the automaker's
primary market. The revelation
caused Volkswagen stock to

12:29.916 --> 12:37.557
plummet for a second day. The
company lost almost 19 percent
of its stock value, or $17

12:37.557 --> 12:44.364
billion, Monday. The price
plunged another 20 percent
during trading in Frankfurt
today.

12:44.364 --> 12:49.736
The CEO of Volkswagen America,
Michael Horn, gave a frank
apology last night at an event

12:49.736 --> 12:51.537
in Brooklyn.

12:51.537 --> 12:53.873
MICHAEL HORN, CEO, Volkswagen
America: So, let's be clear
about this. Our company was

12:53.873 --> 12:57.010
dishonest. We have
totally screwed up.

12:57.010 --> 13:02.215
JUDY WOODRUFF: A year-long
investigation by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency
uncovered

13:02.215 --> 13:09.889
the software. It switches on a
car's emissions controls when a
smog test is taking place.

13:09.889 --> 13:15.228
But the controls turn off again
when the test is over, leaving
cars emitting up to 40 times

13:15.228 --> 13:19.065
the legal pollution limits.

13:19.065 --> 13:27.306
The software is installed in
Volkswagen Jettas, Beetles,
Golfs and Passats and Audi A3s
sold

13:27.306 --> 13:33.312
in the U.S. since 2008. The
Justice Department has
reportedly opened a criminal
investigation

13:33.312 --> 13:37.984
of the automaker. Investigations
are also being launched in
France, Germany and South

13:37.984 --> 13:41.054
Korea.

13:41.054 --> 13:46.292
For more, we turn to John Stoll.
He is Detroit bureau and global
automotive editor for The

13:46.292 --> 13:49.495
Wall Street Journal. He has been
following developments in this
story closely.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.532
John Stoll, welcome.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.268
You have been covering this
story closely. And you have
covered other auto industry
problems.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.003
Where does this one rank?

13:57.003 --> 13:59.906
JOHN STOLL, Global Auto Editor,
The Wall Street Journal: It's up
there.

13:59.906 --> 14:04.277
I mean, this is one, because of
the volume of vehicles we're
talking about and the sort

14:04.277 --> 14:09.482
of transatlantic implications --
11 million is not a small number
when you talk about

14:09.482 --> 14:14.087
the U.S. car park. About 85
million vehicles are sold a
year. So, yes, that's spread
over

14:14.087 --> 14:18.825
several years of production, but
that's a large sum of cars. And
Volkswagen right now

14:18.825 --> 14:23.830
is the biggest automaker in the
world, as of the first half of
2015, huge aspiration,

14:23.830 --> 14:26.799
and obviously, in Germany,
they're a big employer.

14:26.799 --> 14:31.504
JUDY WOODRUFF: Explain exactly
what Volkswagen did to these
cars to make them game this
emissions

14:31.504 --> 14:32.071
test.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.907
JOHN STOLL: Right.

14:34.907 --> 14:39.245
From what we understand -- and a
lot of this was explained in the
story that you had -- is

14:39.245 --> 14:49.255
the software is known as sort of
a masking device. It works when
the compliance testing

14:49.255 --> 14:54.694
is undergone, when that's
ongoing. The emissions
information says what the test
need it to

14:54.694 --> 14:58.564
say, so that it passes
regulatory tests.

14:58.564 --> 15:03.936
And then in real-world
condition, it emits far more of
the harmful emissions such as

15:03.936 --> 15:09.208
NOx into the air than is legally
allowed. And so it's pretty
sophisticated software

15:09.208 --> 15:15.281
that can detect when it's being
tested. And, you know, I'm sure
there's going to be forensics

15:15.281 --> 15:19.652
of who exactly designed the
software and authorized it and
whether or not this is more
widespread.

15:19.652 --> 15:23.422
But, at the moment, the EPA has
been pretty explicit on how this
thing works.

15:23.422 --> 15:29.395
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you raise
the question. This was something
that was deliberately done

15:29.395 --> 15:34.901
by someone. I mean, who had to
know? How high up the company is
it thought that this went?

15:34.901 --> 15:41.174
JOHN STOLL: You know, I have
talked to a lot of people about
that. It's hard to believe

15:41.174 --> 15:44.710
that -- well, I would say that
in order to pull this off, the
circle could be relatively

15:44.710 --> 15:47.146
tight.

15:47.146 --> 15:51.384
You know, the pressure is high
when it comes to meeting
engineering standards. Diesel is

15:51.384 --> 15:56.355
a very important part of
Volkswagen's play, not only in
Europe, but in the United
States.

15:56.355 --> 15:58.891
And they needed to get these
cars back on the market about
six or seven years ago in

15:58.891 --> 16:01.627
order to keep its
momentum going.

16:01.627 --> 16:05.464
In order to meet that objective,
one could imagine that the
circle would remain pretty

16:05.464 --> 16:10.136
tight and need-to-know basis. I
have talked with executives who
were at the company at

16:10.136 --> 16:14.207
the time who have since left,
said they knew nothing about
this and would imagine that

16:14.207 --> 16:17.476
this originated in Germany, but
that's speculation at this
point.

16:17.476 --> 16:21.013
The interesting thing -- and
this is probably the silver
lining and the bright light at

16:21.013 --> 16:26.219
the end of the tunnel -- is
Volkswagen is committing to full
transparency. And we learned

16:26.219 --> 16:31.724
last year in the GM ignition
crisis what that really could
mean, is a full, hundreds and

16:31.724 --> 16:38.431
hundreds pages of
self-revelation, usually done by
an outside law firm or
investigator,

16:38.431 --> 16:41.133
that will probably be answer
more of these questions, who
knew what when, who authorized

16:41.133 --> 16:45.404
it and why. But that could be
several weeks, if not months in
coming.

16:45.404 --> 16:49.308
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we're
talking about potentially
significant amount of damage to
the environment.

16:49.308 --> 16:53.813
We said, what, 40 times the
pollution level is what these
cars were emitting.

16:53.813 --> 16:57.717
JOHN STOLL: As much as
that. That's right.

16:57.717 --> 17:02.655
And this is a very harmful
substance. And these are very
harmful emissions. There's

17:02.655 --> 17:08.394
no doubt. And I think
particularly the people who buy
Volkswagen diesels -- and this
is

17:08.394 --> 17:12.365
generalizations -- but they are
not only looking for a fuel
economy bump, they're not only

17:12.365 --> 17:18.604
looking for a way to save fuel
consumption and money. They are
buying into the promise

17:18.604 --> 17:22.208
that they are reducing
emissions, that these are safer
for the environment, that the
promise

17:22.208 --> 17:28.514
of -- quote, unquote -- "clean
diesel emissions" is actually
what they advertise it to be.

17:28.514 --> 17:33.252
And that's what makes this so
egregious, at least on the
surface. A lot of people are

17:33.252 --> 17:39.091
saying, hey, this ranks up there
with some of the most egregious
corporate scandals in

17:39.091 --> 17:44.230
recent history because of the
length of time that the
deception went on. And they went

17:44.230 --> 17:48.100
up very far in terms of
regulators of saying they didn't
know it was going on. They
didn't

17:48.100 --> 17:52.505
know why there was a disparity
between real-world emissions and
testing.

17:52.505 --> 17:56.542
And then only about a month ago,
within the last month, they have
come clean on this issue.

17:56.542 --> 17:59.445
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Stoll, any
evidence? What are people saying
about whether this could

17:59.445 --> 18:04.083
have extended to other
diesel manufacturers?

18:04.083 --> 18:11.457
JOHN STOLL: Thus far, we haven't
heard from everyone in the
diesel market. But thus far,

18:11.457 --> 18:14.827
a lot of automakers have come
out and said they have done
their forensics. They have

18:14.827 --> 18:17.897
asked the questions of the
people internally, the engineers
that they need to, and they're

18:17.897 --> 18:22.935
pretty confident that they are
not employing the same software.

18:22.935 --> 18:27.740
I will give you a quick for
instance. I called General
Motors today. They have a lot of
diesels

18:27.740 --> 18:32.144
on the market in Europe. And
they wanted to popularize a
smaller car diesel in the United

18:32.144 --> 18:35.281
States. They say they have
already looked into this and
they are 100 percent confident

18:35.281 --> 18:39.618
that what they have displayed to
regulators is the truth is
actually the truth.

18:39.618 --> 18:43.255
So, I think we will see more of
this roll on, but you better
believe that there's a

18:43.255 --> 18:48.461
lot of automakers, regulators
and outside researchers looking
into that exact question.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.930
And I think this isn't the last
of that story that we have
heard, but maybe the worst case

18:50.930 --> 18:52.798
of it.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.868
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it sounds
like there's certainly more to
be reported on here.

18:55.868 --> 19:01.741
John Stoll with The Wall
Street Journal, thank you.

19:01.741 --> 19:17.356
GWEN IFILL: It's not yet clear
what issues Pope Francis will
directly address during

19:17.356 --> 19:23.529
his visit here, but one problem
casts a long shadow for the
church: sexual abuse scandals.

19:23.529 --> 19:28.401
This pope has pressured top
church officials to end abuse
involving priests. Just this

19:28.401 --> 19:31.370
year, the bishops of Saint
Paul-Minneapolis and Kansas city
have resigned in the wake

19:31.370 --> 19:34.507
of new revelations.

19:34.507 --> 19:38.844
As part of our special coverage
of the pope's visit this week,
special correspondent Chris

19:38.844 --> 19:46.619
Bury reports on how sex abuse by
clergy still haunts American
Catholics.

19:46.619 --> 19:56.529
CHRIS BURY: For the Archdiocese
of Saint Paul and Minneapolis,
with more than 800,000
Catholics,

19:56.529 --> 20:01.333
the sex abuse scandal still
resonates in a raw and immediate
way.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.603
JENNIFER HASELBERGER, Former
Church Attorney: I think, by
anyone's definition of a crisis,

20:04.603 --> 20:08.441
we're in it. And there doesn't
seem to be any way out.

20:08.441 --> 20:13.846
CHRIS BURY: For nearly five
years, Jennifer Haselberger
served as the cannon lawyer, an

20:13.846 --> 20:20.252
expert in church law, for the
archdiocese, but, in 2013, she
resigned in protest after,

20:20.252 --> 20:25.624
she says, top church officials
ignored her cautions about a
priest's behavior.

20:25.624 --> 20:30.729
Haselberger then tipped off
authorities and reporters to a
sex abuse scandal.

20:30.729 --> 20:35.134
JENNIFER HASELBERGER: I was
personally devastated when I
learned of the abuse that had
taken

20:35.134 --> 20:40.940
place on my watch. And if I had
been able to do anything about
that, then I would have

20:40.940 --> 20:45.277
done everything I could, but
there's so much opposition to
doing anything that would keep

20:45.277 --> 20:49.548
people safe, that I couldn't
be part of it any longer.

20:49.548 --> 20:54.787
CHRIS BURY: In June, her former
boss, Archbishop John Nienstedt,
and another bishop abruptly

20:54.787 --> 20:59.692
resigned, less than two weeks
after the Ramsey County
prosecutor dropped this
bombshell.

20:59.692 --> 21:04.897
JOHN CHOI, Ramsey County
Prosecutor: And what justice
requires is that we file
criminal

21:04.897 --> 21:11.470
charges against the Archdiocese
of Saint Paul and Minneapolis
for its role in failing to

21:11.470 --> 21:14.273
protect children.

21:14.273 --> 21:18.511
CHRIS BURY: What startled many
Catholics here is that the abuse
took place not decades ago,

21:18.511 --> 21:22.748
but within the last five years.

21:22.748 --> 21:29.755
Former Priest Curtis Wehmeyer
plead guilty to molesting three
boys between 2010 and 2012,

21:29.755 --> 21:35.728
two of them in this camping
trailer in the parking lot of
his church. He's now serving

21:35.728 --> 21:41.000
a five-year sentence in this
Minnesota prison and faces more
prison time in Wisconsin for

21:41.000 --> 21:45.738
abuses there. Wehmeyer had been
promoted to pastor of Blessed
Sacrament Church in Saint

21:45.738 --> 21:49.241
Paul, despite warnings
about him at the time.

21:49.241 --> 21:55.981
JENNIFER HASELBERGER: He had
been caught cruising in places
where people go for anonymous
sex.

21:55.981 --> 22:01.687
He had propositioned some very
young men. And all of this was
clearly documented.

22:01.687 --> 22:06.792
CHRIS BURY: Did this archdiocese
willfully ignore signs of a
pedophile priest?

22:06.792 --> 22:08.427
BISHOP ANDREW COZZENS,
Archdiocese of Saint Paul and
Minneapolis: I don't think that
any

22:08.427 --> 22:12.865
person willfully ignored --
willfully ignored signs of a
pedophile priest, even if we can

22:12.865 --> 22:16.402
say that perhaps
mistakes were made.

22:16.402 --> 22:21.106
CHRIS BURY: Bishop Andrew
Cozzens is among the officials
newly appointed to cope with

22:21.106 --> 22:25.811
the crisis and carry out
reforms. A former top state law
enforcement official, Tim
O'Malley,

22:25.811 --> 22:28.447
was hired to oversee compliance.

22:28.447 --> 22:31.150
TIM O'MALLEY, Archdiocese of
Saint Paul and Minneapolis: It's
not enough to do what's

22:31.150 --> 22:35.321
right. You have got to follow
through on that. That didn't
happen as well as it should
have.

22:35.321 --> 22:41.627
CHRIS BURY: But now they say a
review board of 10 laypeople and
two priests will evaluate

22:41.627 --> 22:45.831
every allegation of improper
behavior and hand any cases
involving children to law
enforcement.

22:45.831 --> 22:48.701
So you turned this over
to police right away?

22:48.701 --> 22:52.738
TIM O'MALLEY: Absolutely, yes, I
mean -- and I mean, right away,
that day.

22:52.738 --> 22:57.276
CHRIS BURY: That didn't happen
in the case of Jim Keenan. He
filed a lawsuit against

22:57.276 --> 23:01.614
a former Minnesota priest who
admitted abusing him when he was
13.

23:01.614 --> 23:06.418
JIM KEENAN, Victim of Priest
Abuse: Had the truth church
followed the societal rules of

23:06.418 --> 23:09.255
turning criminals over to the
police, I would have never met
him, nor would most of his

23:09.255 --> 23:11.190
victims.

23:11.190 --> 23:16.528
CHRIS BURY: Keenan was an altar
boy when parish Priest Thomas
Adamson, a good friend of his

23:16.528 --> 23:19.732
family's, molested him
over a year's time.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.802
JIM KEENAN: He was a
professional pedophile. He knew
how to groom the young people
that

23:23.802 --> 23:27.806
he wanted to molest,
and he was good at it.

23:27.806 --> 23:29.808
MAN: And did you
abuse those kids?

23:29.808 --> 23:32.211
THOMAS ADAMSON, Former
Catholic Priest: Yes.

23:32.211 --> 23:35.814
CHRIS BURY: Adamson was removed
from the priesthood and this
church, but wasn't punished for
what

23:35.814 --> 23:38.617
he did to Jim Keenan.

23:38.617 --> 23:41.353
JIM KEENAN: We went all the way
to the Minnesota Supreme Court,
and we lost on a technicality

23:41.353 --> 23:43.455
of statute of limitations.

23:43.455 --> 23:47.559
CHRIS BURY: In a videotaped
deposition for other civil case,
Adamson admitted sexual

23:47.559 --> 23:50.029
acts with at least 10 boys.

23:50.029 --> 23:51.797
MAN: Mr. Adamson, have you
ever spent a day in jail?

23:51.797 --> 23:52.831
THOMAS ADAMSON: No.

23:52.831 --> 23:54.066
MAN: Don't you think
you should have?

23:54.066 --> 23:54.900
THOMAS ADAMSON: No.

23:54.900 --> 23:57.202
CHRIS BURY: What
was your reaction?

23:57.202 --> 24:03.742
JIM KEENAN: I almost threw my
one-liter bottle of soda through
the TV set. To hear and look

24:03.742 --> 24:10.749
at his face, and there was a
smugness to it: No, I shouldn't
have gone to prison. It's

24:10.749 --> 24:12.951
not criminal. It's a sin.

24:12.951 --> 24:17.623
CHRIS BURY: The first alarm
bells for American church
officials sounded 30 years ago
just

24:17.623 --> 24:22.227
80 miles from the Twin Cities at
Saint John's Abbey, one of the
country's oldest Catholic

24:22.227 --> 24:24.697
institutions.

24:24.697 --> 24:29.902
In June 1985, bishops from all
over the country gathered here
at Saint John's Abbey. They

24:29.902 --> 24:35.841
were given a 92-page report
warning of trouble ahead. It
cautioned that sexual
molestation

24:35.841 --> 24:40.979
of children by priests and
clerics could -- quote -- "pose
extremely serious financial
consequences

24:40.979 --> 24:44.750
and significant injury
to the church."

24:44.750 --> 24:51.857
That report turned out to be
uncannily prophetic. Seventeen
years later, the scandal
exploded

24:51.857 --> 24:56.862
after The Boston Globe exposed
the cover-up of sexual abuse by
parish priests.

24:56.862 --> 25:00.232
ACTOR: When you have poor kids
from a poor family and when a
priest pays attention to

25:00.232 --> 25:04.670
you, it's a big deal. How
do you say no to God?

25:04.670 --> 25:08.607
CHRIS BURY: The story is
depicted in the new movie
"Spotlight" starring Michael
Keaton.

25:08.607 --> 25:13.545
ACTOR: This is not just Boston.
This is the whole country. It's
the whole world.

25:13.545 --> 25:18.450
CHRIS BURY: As similar cases
erupted across the country, the
consequences have been enormous,

25:18.450 --> 25:21.687
just as the bishops were warned.

25:21.687 --> 25:26.992
The Saint Paul and Minneapolis
Archdiocese, facing more than
400 claims alleging sexual

25:26.992 --> 25:32.898
abuse of minors and adults, is
now selling off millions of
dollars worth of property

25:32.898 --> 25:39.071
after filing for bankruptcy
earlier this year. In all, 12
American dioceses and two
religious

25:39.071 --> 25:44.643
orders have sought bankruptcy
protection since the scandal
first broke in 2002.

25:44.643 --> 25:49.715
For Pope Francis, the lingering
impact of those cases and others
worldwide has led him

25:49.715 --> 25:54.753
to establish a new tribunal for
any bishop accused of failing to
protect children.

25:54.753 --> 25:59.758
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through translator):
This is my anguish and pain,

25:59.758 --> 26:04.830
the fact that some priests and
bishops violated the innocence
of minors.

26:04.830 --> 26:09.968
MAN: Almighty God, have mercy on
us. Forgive us all of our sins
and bring us to life
everlasting.

26:09.968 --> 26:15.207
CHRIS BURY: And in the pope's
first major American
appointment, he chose Bishop
Blase

26:15.207 --> 26:21.213
Cupich to head the huge Chicago
Archdiocese. Cupich is an
outspoken critic of church
leaders,

26:21.213 --> 26:26.251
who he says have failed
to put children first.

26:26.251 --> 26:31.790
In Chicago, Cupich says, the
archdiocese has set the gold
standard for preventing sex
abuse

26:31.790 --> 26:37.963
after enduring painful scandals
of its own. Now safeguards
include background checks and

26:37.963 --> 26:41.867
fingerprinting for all employees
and sex abuse training for
priests, clerics, volunteers,

26:41.867 --> 26:43.635
teachers, students,
and children.

26:43.635 --> 26:50.242
ARCHBISHOP BLASE CUPICH,
Archdiocese of Chicago: We make
sure that people who work for us
who

26:50.242 --> 26:58.283
are working with children are
never with a child alone, that
they always have more than

26:58.283 --> 27:06.391
one adult, that there are
certain good touches and bad
touches that are taught, so that
they

27:06.391 --> 27:13.165
recognize how a child might feel
uncomfortable, that they also
are alerted to any improper

27:13.165 --> 27:16.301
activity that would be
immediately reported.

27:16.301 --> 27:21.139
CHRIS BURY: In downtown Chicago,
the diocese has built a public
garden in the name of healing

27:21.139 --> 27:25.444
for victims of sex abuse by
clergy. At the entrance, a
profound apology is inscribed

27:25.444 --> 27:29.248
on this plaque.

27:29.248 --> 27:34.086
Now even a survivor of childhood
sex abuse tells us he's
comfortable putting his children

27:34.086 --> 27:38.891
in Catholic schools here. As a
teenager, Michael Hoffman was
molested by his parish priest,

27:38.891 --> 27:41.126
who was eventually
sent to prison.

27:41.126 --> 27:46.498
MICHAEL HOFFMAN, Victim of
Priest Abuse: I know the safe
environment initiatives that

27:46.498 --> 27:52.538
my kids had to go through, and I
know that each and every
volunteer, myself included,

27:52.538 --> 27:59.611
we had to go through the
Protecting God's Children class.
I am sure of the protection

27:59.611 --> 28:03.115
of my children and all of
the children in our parish.

28:03.115 --> 28:07.920
CHRIS BURY: But in the Twin
Cities, where the scars are so
fresh, the canon lawyer who

28:07.920 --> 28:13.158
blew the whistle notes that the
archdiocese is contesting the
criminal case against it.

28:13.158 --> 28:17.996
JENNIFER HASELBERGER: If that
case goes the trial, it's going
to be incredibly ugly. The

28:17.996 --> 28:21.300
Catholics and the non-Catholics
of this archdiocese are going to
have to hear things about their

28:21.300 --> 28:25.137
church that I don't know they're
prepared to hear. And there
aren't a lot of people

28:25.137 --> 28:29.541
that are going to come out of it
with their reputations intact.

28:29.541 --> 28:35.948
Other critics contend that even
with new reforms, the Vatican
has yet to punish a single
bishop

28:35.948 --> 28:42.554
for enabling the abuse of
children. So 40 years after
American bishops were first
warned

28:42.554 --> 28:48.427
here in Minnesota of an
impending scandal, Catholics are
still coping with the bitter

28:48.427 --> 28:56.902
consequences. I'm Chris bury for
"PBS NewsHour" in Saint Paul,
Minnesota.

28:56.902 --> 29:03.609
JUDY WOODRUFF: Follow all our
coverage of the pope's visit.
Plus, our guest columnists'

29:03.609 --> 29:10.148
reflections on faith
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

29:10.148 --> 29:22.394
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

29:22.394 --> 29:28.166
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
checking in on the global
challenge to educate all
children.

29:28.166 --> 29:32.671
But, first, the battle brewing
at the Pentagon over the future
of women in America's armed

29:32.671 --> 29:35.574
forces.

29:35.574 --> 29:39.878
Early next year, Defense
Secretary Ashton Carter is
expected to announce whether
previously

29:39.878 --> 29:44.750
closed positions to women in the
military will open. The Army,
Air Force and Navy are

29:44.750 --> 29:48.754
expected to allow women to
serve in all combat roles.

29:48.754 --> 29:52.524
But Marine Corps Commandant
General Joseph Dunford, soon to
be chairman of the Joint

29:52.524 --> 29:56.962
Chiefs of Staff, has asked that
the Marines be excluded from the
new rule.

29:56.962 --> 30:00.599
Joining me now to explain why he
disagrees with that assessment
is Navy Secretary Ray

30:00.599 --> 30:03.802
Mabus, who is also the civilian
head of the Marine Corps.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.204
Welcome. And thank you for
joining us, Secretary Mabus.

30:06.204 --> 30:08.407
RAY MABUS, U.S. Secretary of
the Navy: Gwen, thank you.

30:08.407 --> 30:13.045
GWEN IFILL: There is a report
that has come out that shows
that women in integrated combat

30:13.045 --> 30:17.783
units were slower, there were
more injuries, they were less
accurate at firing weapons.

30:17.783 --> 30:21.086
What is your take
on that report?

30:21.086 --> 30:28.460
RAY MABUS: Well, first, the
commandant and I share the
overall goal of making sure we

30:28.460 --> 30:33.432
maximize the combat
effectiveness of the United
States Marines. That's the first
principle.

30:33.432 --> 30:42.274
Second, this study, that Marine
study, and had Marines doing
very valuable work, and

30:42.274 --> 30:50.515
it came out with some great
findings, the main one of which
was that, before then, there

30:50.515 --> 30:56.321
had been no standards set
for being in the infantry.

30:56.321 --> 31:03.995
So, this study set those high
standards. Before then, it was
assumed that if men went through

31:03.995 --> 31:14.072
boot camp, they could become
Marine infantry. Turned out that
the specific jobs in the
infantry,

31:14.072 --> 31:18.577
which the study went through,
deconstructed all the jobs,
here's what you need to do to

31:18.577 --> 31:23.248
be a success in this,
to do the job.

31:23.248 --> 31:33.625
But then the Marines took
averages from the study. It
wasn't the individuals. They set

31:33.625 --> 31:39.564
the high standards. But then
they looked across averages. And
the Marines have never been

31:39.564 --> 31:44.202
about average. The Marines
are about exceptionalism.

31:44.202 --> 31:52.778
And what my view is, set high
standards. Make sure those
standards have something to do

31:52.778 --> 32:01.353
with the job. And then whoever
meets those standards, gender is
not crucial. If you can

32:01.353 --> 32:04.189
meet the standards, you
should be able to serve.

32:04.189 --> 32:07.025
GWEN IFILL: Should those
standards include other ways in
which these studies show that

32:07.025 --> 32:11.463
women excel, for instance, lower
incidence of mental health
problems?

32:11.463 --> 32:18.470
RAY MABUS: Well, I think that
the standards themselves, in
terms of what you have to do,

32:18.470 --> 32:23.575
because if you're a Marine in
combat, in infantry combat, you
want to know that the Marine on

32:23.575 --> 32:28.413
either side of you has met
the same high standards.

32:28.413 --> 32:35.420
And that's what this study has
brought forth, that here are now
the standards to be a Marine

32:35.420 --> 32:42.427
in Marine infantry. But once you
do that, the notion of somehow
saying, even if you

32:42.427 --> 32:49.568
meet the standards, you can't
serve because of your gender,
that doesn't follow to me.

32:49.568 --> 32:52.971
GWEN IFILL: General Dunford
aside, you know there has been
some pretty vigorous pushback

32:52.971 --> 32:57.742
from Marines about whether
this is a good idea or not.

32:57.742 --> 33:03.415
Do you -- is this a legitimate
concern on the parts of these
Marines, or is this a -- speak

33:03.415 --> 33:05.984
to the culture of the
Marine Corps itself?

33:05.984 --> 33:12.557
RAY MABUS: Well, I think the
Marines -- and I have talked to
thousands of Marines out

33:12.557 --> 33:18.630
around the world in my now more
than six years in this job.

33:18.630 --> 33:24.436
The Marines that I have talked
to, the one concern they have is
that standards not be

33:24.436 --> 33:33.712
lowered, is that they know, if
they go into combat, that people
have met these high standards.

33:33.712 --> 33:41.286
Now, before this, there were
surprising number of men who
couldn't do the infantry job
just

33:41.286 --> 33:44.389
because they had come
through boot camp.

33:44.389 --> 33:52.330
And so now those Marines are
going to have the certainty that
the Marines on either side

33:52.330 --> 33:55.934
of them have met those
standards. And that shouldn't
depend on gender.

33:55.934 --> 34:01.840
GWEN IFILL: But what do you say
to those in the Corps who say
this will prove to be a

34:01.840 --> 34:07.412
challenge to the alchemy, the
chemistry of the Corps, also
unit cohesion?

34:07.412 --> 34:11.750
RAY MABUS: Well, number one,
that's not one of the arguments
that the Marines have made

34:11.750 --> 34:16.421
in terms of whether an
exemption should be given.

34:16.421 --> 34:24.129
But, number two, I have seen the
Marines enough. Once they're
given a task, they move out.

34:24.129 --> 34:30.402
They execute. They do it better
than anybody. And there were
similar concerns, Gwen, at

34:30.402 --> 34:38.443
the repeal of don't ask, don't
tell. There was all sorts of
concerns out, as people talked

34:38.443 --> 34:45.083
about it, that if you allowed
gay service members in, that it
would harm the unit cohesion.

34:45.083 --> 34:52.424
And there were similar concerns,
you know, in the late '40s, when
the Marines integrated.

34:52.424 --> 35:01.366
And each time, the Marines have
shown that, once a decision was
made, once the decision

35:01.366 --> 35:07.472
was made to make sure that,
whether it was
African-Americans, whether it
was gay service

35:07.472 --> 35:13.712
members or now women, whatever
decision Secretary Carter
finally makes, integrated into
their

35:13.712 --> 35:18.216
force, that they're really
good at making it right.

35:18.216 --> 35:20.852
GWEN IFILL: One more concern
that has been expressed, which
is that this is an example

35:20.852 --> 35:24.322
of politically correct
social engineering.

35:24.322 --> 35:30.929
RAY MABUS: Well, the thing that
I want to point out is, these
are Marine standards.

35:30.929 --> 35:34.632
These are standards that
the Marines set up.

35:34.632 --> 35:41.106
And if somebody can meet Marine
standards, they should be able
to be a Marine.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.207
GWEN IFILL: No
matter the gender.

35:42.207 --> 35:44.743
RAY MABUS: No matter the gender.

35:44.743 --> 35:48.680
And I think that's almost the
opposite of political
correctness. That's setting a
very

35:48.680 --> 35:53.251
high standard, but saying,
we have set the standard.

35:53.251 --> 35:57.822
GWEN IFILL: How unusual is it
for this kind of disagreement to
be aired so publicly?

35:57.822 --> 36:06.331
RAY MABUS: Well, the one thing I
want to make certain that is
understood, General Dunford

36:06.331 --> 36:12.037
and I have a tremendous respect
for each other. We have a
tremendous working relationship.

36:12.037 --> 36:20.512
I admire and respect him just
without -- without cease.

36:20.512 --> 36:25.750
And he's going to be a great
chairman. And the president and
the secretary of defense

36:25.750 --> 36:34.192
are very fortunate that they
will have him to give them
advice. We give each other our

36:34.192 --> 36:38.063
very candid opinions.

36:38.063 --> 36:46.371
And, sometimes -- sometimes,
they diverge, but the underlying
notion that we want to

36:46.371 --> 36:51.609
maintain and maximize the
effectiveness and the combat
effective of the United States

36:51.609 --> 36:54.345
Marine Corps, we're
absolutely together on.

36:54.345 --> 36:58.283
GWEN IFILL: And, as you
mentioned, the final decision
rests with the defense
secretary,

36:58.283 --> 37:00.418
Ashton Carter, between now and
January 1. Is that correct?

37:00.418 --> 37:02.320
RAY MABUS: That's correct.

37:02.320 --> 37:11.162
The services put their
recommendations in by October 1.
And, you know, the Navy, I will

37:11.162 --> 37:14.899
point out that the SEALS are not
asking for an exception here.

37:14.899 --> 37:18.369
GWEN IFILL: So, if there can be
women Navy SEALs, there can be
women Marines, you're

37:18.369 --> 37:20.905
saying, in combat roles.

37:20.905 --> 37:26.578
RAY MABUS: Again, set the
standards. Do not deviate. And
then whoever meets those
standards,

37:26.578 --> 37:28.179
they ought to get
to perform the job.

37:28.179 --> 37:33.218
GWEN IFILL: Secretary of the
Navy Ray Mabus, thank you.

37:33.218 --> 37:40.892
RAY MABUS: Appreciate it, Gwen.

37:40.892 --> 37:48.766
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fifteen years
ago, the United Nations set a
goal: By this year, every child

37:48.766 --> 37:54.205
in every nation should be able
to obtain free basic education.

37:54.205 --> 37:58.843
While the number of children out
of school has been cut almost in
half, there are still

37:58.843 --> 38:04.149
57 million worldwide who have
never set foot in a classroom.
Hundreds of millions more

38:04.149 --> 38:07.152
have dropped out.

38:07.152 --> 38:12.257
PBS has been reporting on the
global education crisis by
following six children from
different

38:12.257 --> 38:19.531
countries over 12 years, part of
WNET's documentary series "Time
for School."

38:19.531 --> 38:25.803
Tonight, we travel to India,
where nearly 100 percent of
children start primary school.

38:25.803 --> 38:30.175
But especially for girls in
rural areas, staying in school
remains a challenge, and
literacy

38:30.175 --> 38:35.680
rates have not improved.

38:35.680 --> 38:48.293
NARRATOR: Neeraj Gujar is 9
years old and lives with her
tightly knit family of herders

38:48.293 --> 38:54.799
in a small village in Rajasthan,
a desert region in the northwest
of India. It's a deeply

38:54.799 --> 39:02.440
traditional community, where
women rarely have the chance to
go to school.

39:02.440 --> 39:05.843
NEERAJ GUJAR, India (through
translator): My name is Neeraj.
I'm about 9 or 10, and

39:05.843 --> 39:16.154
I have been studying for the
past year, math, multiplication,
addition. So I'm learning.

39:16.154 --> 39:23.661
QUESTION (through translator):
Did you ever go to school?

39:23.661 --> 39:31.035
WOMAN (through translator): What
would I go to school for? What's
so great about being

39:31.035 --> 39:38.476
educated? Even if you study,
these educated people have
nothing to do. Anyway, the
everyday

39:38.476 --> 39:41.145
chores will take over.

39:41.145 --> 39:50.121
NEERAJ GUJAR (through
translator): I work during the
day. I do so much. I have to
sweep.

39:50.121 --> 39:59.030
I have to bring water. I have to
make dung cakes. I have to graze
the cows.

39:59.030 --> 40:09.874
NARRATOR: Like many girls here,
Neeraj can only go to school if
she does so at night.

40:09.874 --> 40:16.447
In Rajasthan, 56 percent of the
female population is illiterate.
Schools like hers started in

40:16.447 --> 40:21.819
India to educate the country's
legions of girls, who must work
all day.

40:21.819 --> 40:26.324
The goal was that students would
eventually transfer into
mainstream day schools.

40:26.324 --> 40:32.330
SHYOJI RAM, Teacher (through
translator): This is our Earth.
It's round. This map is

40:32.330 --> 40:42.840
flat, but, otherwise, our Earth
is round. If I keep four this
side and four this side,

40:42.840 --> 40:48.379
it will equal eight.

40:48.379 --> 40:58.022
This education's going to help
them. An illiterate person
doesn't know these things. These
girls

40:58.022 --> 41:04.595
are more confident about
expressing themselves. And
they're beginning to express
themselves.

41:04.595 --> 41:15.406
NEERAJ GUJAR (through
translator): By the time I come
back, everyone's asleep. When

41:15.406 --> 41:23.981
I grow up, I want to go to a big
school to study. By then, I will
know more. And then

41:23.981 --> 41:33.925
maybe I can become a teacher.

41:33.925 --> 41:39.564
Four plus four,
eight. Six plus six.

41:39.564 --> 41:46.871
(through translator): It's been
a long time since I last
studied.

41:46.871 --> 41:53.544
NARRATOR: Over the years,
droughts have forced Neeraj to
leave school for months at a
time

41:53.544 --> 41:59.617
to graze the cattle far from
home. Meanwhile, many of her
friends had advanced to the day

41:59.617 --> 42:04.956
school, and, without enough
students, the night school
closed.

42:04.956 --> 42:15.400
NEERAJ GUJAR (through
translator): I liked everything
about night school. Everyone
would

42:15.400 --> 42:22.673
study and talk. All the friends
would sit together. I really
miss that a lot.

42:22.673 --> 42:28.913
NARRATOR: After Neeraj's school
was closed, her teacher tried to
help her transition into

42:28.913 --> 42:36.254
the government-run day school.
But for all her effort, Neeraj
had only qualified for

42:36.254 --> 42:40.091
second grade, so she was placed
in a class with much younger
children.

42:40.091 --> 42:43.327
NEERAJ GUJAR (through
translator): When I was made to
sit with the younger children

42:43.327 --> 42:50.001
they'd tease me, saying,
"Oh, she's so big."

42:50.001 --> 42:58.643
Sitting with the little ones, I
felt embarrassed. That's why I
dropped out.

42:58.643 --> 43:07.351
WOMAN (through translator): See?
We let her study until first and
second grade. She has

43:07.351 --> 43:14.025
to learn how to cook now. What I
want is that she makes a good
match and really enjoys life.

43:14.025 --> 43:18.996
What else? That's
what parents want.

43:18.996 --> 43:23.267
KANARAM GUJAR, Father of Neeraj
(through translator): We will
look for an educated boy. Happy,
she

43:23.267 --> 43:27.004
will be.

43:27.004 --> 43:41.452
NEERAJ GUJAR (through
translator): I met him on our
wedding day. Honestly, I'm
telling

43:41.452 --> 43:44.188
you the truth.

43:44.188 --> 43:51.629
MAN (through translator): I
first saw her by the well in
Tilonia.

43:51.629 --> 43:59.937
A boy marries whom his parents
want him to. He has no choice in
the matter. They will

43:59.937 --> 44:07.144
make sure that she's beautiful
and knows how to do all the
housework. I'm a farmer, so

44:07.144 --> 44:13.885
an uneducated wife is a
suitable match for me.

44:13.885 --> 44:22.093
NARRATOR: Neeraj is now 21 years
old, and has been married for a
year. Her husband,

44:22.093 --> 44:29.267
Jagdish (ph), supports them
delivering milk with his new
truck. As is traditional, Neeraj

44:29.267 --> 44:32.770
lives with her in-laws, but,
today, she is traveling home to
give birth to her first

44:32.770 --> 44:35.206
child.

44:35.206 --> 44:42.713
NEERAJ GUJAR (through
translator): My hearts gets
happier as I get closer to my
village.

44:42.713 --> 45:04.302
My daughter's name is Anita
(ph). She will grow up to be a
smart woman. I would like

45:04.302 --> 45:14.979
her to be a doctor in a big
hospital. But who knows what
will happen? I'm a mother now.

45:14.979 --> 45:21.218
No more playing around for me.
We must focus on the girl's
education.

45:21.218 --> 45:28.693
MAN (through translator): My
wife and I talk when we have
time. We have to work and we

45:28.693 --> 45:37.835
have to educate our daughter.
We didn't have education.

45:37.835 --> 45:45.009
NARRATOR: In India today,
enrollment in primary schools is
nearly universal compared to 84

45:45.009 --> 45:50.214
percent 15 years ago. But school
quality, absenteeism, and
dropout rates still remain

45:50.214 --> 45:54.518
a problem in rural areas.

45:54.518 --> 45:58.990
Nonetheless, the chances for
Neeraj's daughter, Anita, are
much better than they were for

45:58.990 --> 46:01.425
her mother.

46:01.425 --> 46:07.365
NEERAJ GUJAR (through
translator): Now I'm filled with
regret. I wish I had continued

46:07.365 --> 46:17.475
my studies. I could've held my
own with educated folks. Now I
can only do the farming and the

46:17.475 --> 46:23.781
housework.

46:23.781 --> 46:30.354
Education not only helps the
individual, but the entire
family as well.

46:30.354 --> 46:34.492
Gershwin

46:34.492 --> 46:48.606
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight, on
this the last day of summer, we
put away our white shoes,

46:48.606 --> 46:53.277
straw bags and sunglasses
to say goodbye.

46:53.277 --> 46:57.782
Jeffrey Brown caught up with
composer and musician Rob
Kapilow recently at the
Signature

46:57.782 --> 47:03.788
Theatre in Arlington, Virginia,
to deconstruct the iconic
Gershwin song "Summertime."

47:03.788 --> 47:07.792
JEFFREY BROWN: Summertime, and
the living is easy, except we
know it isn't somehow,

47:07.792 --> 47:09.860
right?

47:09.860 --> 47:13.330
ROB KAPILOW, Composer: One of
the things that's great is Aaron
Copland, when he talked about

47:13.330 --> 47:16.567
Martha Graham, who did the
choreography for "Appalachian
Spring," he said about her that

47:16.567 --> 47:20.438
she is seemingly, but
only seemingly, simple.

47:20.438 --> 47:24.308
And the same thing's true with
Gershwin. It is seemingly, but
only seemingly, simple.

47:24.308 --> 47:27.311
This is supposed to be just a
simple lullaby, but, in fact,
there's craft everywhere. Take

47:27.311 --> 47:29.380
even the beginning
of this piece.

47:29.380 --> 47:32.783
I mean, everybody knows this
piece as just starting with just
one bar of introduction,

47:32.783 --> 47:50.735
because normally we just sing it
as a song. And the voice already
comes in, and you barely

47:50.735 --> 47:51.802
even notice that there
was an introduction.

47:51.802 --> 47:53.504
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

47:53.504 --> 47:57.575
ROB KAPILOW: But, in the opera,
there's eight fantastic measures
before this that transition

47:57.575 --> 48:02.246
us into the world of Catfish Row
in a fantastic way, and one note
makes all the difference.

48:02.246 --> 48:03.447
JEFFREY BROWN: Musically,
but one note is the key?

48:03.447 --> 48:05.950
ROB KAPILOW: One
note is the key.

48:05.950 --> 48:11.922
I mean, you hear this little
figure that starts and ends on
the same note. You hear it one

48:11.922 --> 48:28.839
more time down low. Everyone
expects this. He changes only
the last note. That one note

48:28.839 --> 48:32.910
brings us into the world of
Catfish Row. It's amazing, the
power of a single note.

48:32.910 --> 48:35.479
JEFFREY BROWN: The music
changes, the landscape changes,
and the mood changes.

48:35.479 --> 48:37.515
ROB KAPILOW: One of the central
requirements for any great
Broadway composer is the ability

48:37.515 --> 48:39.016
to create atmosphere
in an instant.

48:39.016 --> 48:39.950
(MUSIC)

48:39.950 --> 48:41.552
ROB KAPILOW: Becomes...

48:41.552 --> 48:42.620
(MUSIC)

48:42.620 --> 48:45.222
ROB KAPILOW: We're
in Catfish Row.

48:45.222 --> 48:48.859
JEFFREY BROWN: And then the song
begins and becomes a lullaby,
yes.

48:48.859 --> 48:53.030
ROB KAPILOW: It's just a
lullaby. But it is a lullaby in
a place.

48:53.030 --> 48:56.734
And the way he establishes that
place is so beautiful and
economical. We have got Catfish

48:56.734 --> 48:59.069
Row. Then she's supposed to be
rocking her baby back and forth.

48:59.069 --> 49:00.504
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

49:00.504 --> 49:05.376
ROB KAPILOW: So he does it with
two notes, rock left, rock
right, and add bells in the

49:05.376 --> 49:12.216
middle, left, right, right. Now
we put chords around it. Those
two notes become part of

49:12.216 --> 49:16.353
rocking chords.

49:16.353 --> 49:27.331
JEFFREY BROWN: Of course, this
is the -- this is what the song
is about too, right? Summertime,

49:27.331 --> 49:30.301
the living is easy. But we're
watching people for whom it's
not easy.

49:30.301 --> 49:31.702
ROB KAPILOW: The living
is anything but easy.

49:31.702 --> 49:33.170
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

49:33.170 --> 49:36.540
ROB KAPILOW: But in Gershwin's
imagination, somehow, it wasn't
easy, but it was filled

49:36.540 --> 49:39.410
with all the things that
make community great.

49:39.410 --> 49:42.079
Now, he could easily have
written a short note on time,
and there would have been no

49:42.079 --> 49:44.181
summertime. It could
have sounded like this.

49:44.181 --> 49:46.417
(singing): Summertime,
and the living is easy.

49:46.417 --> 49:48.485
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

49:48.485 --> 49:52.690
ROB KAPILOW: But watch that one
long note on time totally takes
you into the world of

49:52.690 --> 49:59.129
it, summertime. That
one long note...

49:59.129 --> 50:01.298
JEFFREY BROWN: Slows
everything down.

50:01.298 --> 50:00.931
ROB KAPILOW: Slows everything
down. And then here.

50:00.931 --> 50:01.799
(CROSSTALK)

50:01.799 --> 50:02.800
JEFFREY BROWN: That's the
languor you were talking about.

50:02.800 --> 50:03.968
ROB KAPILOW: That's the
languor in one note.

50:03.968 --> 50:05.135
Then he could have done:

50:05.135 --> 50:07.605
(singing): And the
living is easy.

50:07.605 --> 50:08.839
But it's:

50:08.839 --> 50:12.009
(singing): Easy.

50:12.009 --> 50:16.380
The lengthening of those few
notes totally makes Catfish Row
come alive for us.

50:16.380 --> 50:18.682
JEFFREY BROWN: It's the trick of
the composer, right? I mean, not
trick in a pejorative sense,

50:18.682 --> 50:20.284
but...

50:20.284 --> 50:23.220
ROB KAPILOW: It's artless art.
It's art that hides it's art. It
just sounds like a simple

50:23.220 --> 50:26.423
lullaby, but there's
so much art going on.

50:26.423 --> 50:37.334
In fact, everywhere you look,
take what comes next. Then he
has fish are jumping. Well,

50:37.334 --> 50:41.805
how do you make fish jump? That
one little short note, and the
fish are jumping right

50:41.805 --> 50:47.444
in front of your eyes. And then
even the accompaniment, he could
have just written this. But
listen

50:47.444 --> 51:09.767
to these wonderful slithery
chords in between. Only Gershwin
would have done that.

51:09.767 --> 51:16.407
It's also amazing how much he
took from those black spirituals
he heard down in South Carolina.

51:16.407 --> 51:31.288
JEFFREY BROWN: In fact, this is
a Northerner, it's a Jewish
composer looking at the South,

51:31.288 --> 51:33.424
at a black community
in South Carolina.

51:33.424 --> 51:37.294
ROB KAPILOW: Yes. It's, in fact,
two white guys speaking for the
black community.

51:37.294 --> 51:40.864
And, in fact, there was an
enormous amount of controversy
when this piece came out about

51:40.864 --> 51:45.769
it. In fact, Virgil Thompson,
the music critic of The Times,
said in a very provocative way,

51:45.769 --> 51:50.541
who is George Gershwin to be
speaking for this community that
could speak for themselves?

51:50.541 --> 51:53.677
And I think there's certainly a
valid point there. But I think
what's wonderful about

51:53.677 --> 51:57.848
it is, he sort of took the world
that he went and saw there and
translated it to the best

51:57.848 --> 51:59.116
of his abilities into
his own language.

51:59.116 --> 52:17.768
JEFFREY BROWN: He

52:17.768 --> 52:19.136
used some of the
music from there...

52:19.136 --> 52:20.804
(CROSSTALK)

52:20.804 --> 52:23.674
ROB KAPILOW: Well, actually, he
was very specific about saying
he didn't want the use anyone

52:23.674 --> 52:33.417
else's spirituals. He
wanted to invent his own.

52:33.417 --> 52:37.354
Even the street vendor cries
that he used, he wanted to write
his own. So, he was very

52:37.354 --> 52:41.158
particular saying that even
though he was influenced by it,
he wanted nothing in there

52:41.158 --> 52:43.694
to actually be a quotation. So,
even when he uses blues notes
like:

52:43.694 --> 52:45.796
(MUSIC)

52:45.796 --> 52:49.066
ROB KAPILOW: Believe me, that
chord is not a chord that you
ever heard in the blues down

52:49.066 --> 52:50.034
there.

52:50.034 --> 52:50.434
JEFFREY BROWN: That's his
version of the blues, yes.

52:50.434 --> 52:52.770
ROB KAPILOW: That's his version.

52:52.770 --> 52:56.306
And I think that's what a great
artist does. He takes what's out
there in front of him,

52:56.306 --> 52:58.409
but he translates it ultimately
into his own language. And
that's the difference between

52:58.409 --> 53:04.148
influence and imitation.

53:04.148 --> 53:20.664
I think of Gershwin, there was
this belief that he could create
an imaginary world that

53:20.664 --> 53:25.669
would be authentic to his
imagination, if not to the
reality of Charleston, South
Carolina.

53:25.669 --> 53:27.471
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
"Summertime," a great song to
get us through the winter,
right?

53:27.471 --> 53:28.105
ROB KAPILOW: Absolutely.

53:28.105 --> 53:28.972
JEFFREY BROWN: Rob Kapilow.

53:28.972 --> 53:30.774
ROB KAPILOW: Thanks so
much for having me.

53:30.774 --> 53:32.609
JEFFREY BROWN: Thanks so much.

53:32.609 --> 53:36.313
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another way
to think about "Summertime."

53:36.313 --> 53:41.485
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Viola Davis made a historic
win at the Emmy Awards,

53:41.485 --> 53:46.490
when she became the first
African-American woman to win
best actress in a drama. But

53:46.490 --> 53:50.961
data suggests that Hollywood
could do far more to improve
diversity on the screen. You

53:50.961 --> 53:54.698
can learn about the
findings on the Rundown.

53:54.698 --> 54:01.705
Plus, regular "NewsHour"
columnist Wendy Thomas Russell
offers a cheat sheet to Yom
Kippur,

54:01.705 --> 54:06.944
the Jewish day of atonement. All
that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour

54:06.944 --> 54:12.483
GWEN IFILL: Tune in tonight on
"Charlie Rose." Ian Bremmer of
Eurasia Group talks to Charlie

54:12.483 --> 54:17.621
about America's changing
relationships with China, Russia
and the Vatican.

54:17.621 --> 54:19.423
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Gwen Ifill.

54:19.423 --> 54:21.859
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:21.859 --> 54:25.662
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow evening. For all
of us at the "PBS NewsHour,"

54:25.662 --> 54:25.896
thank you, and good night.
