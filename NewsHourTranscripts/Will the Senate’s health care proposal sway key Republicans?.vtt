HARI SREENIVASAN: We are now
on the eve of seeing a Senate
proposal for health care,

00:04.666 --> 00:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
including replacing the
Affordable Care Act.

00:07.400 --> 00:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republican leaders plan
to release their bill
tomorrow, after working
on it behind closed

00:11.100 --> 00:13.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doors for weeks.

00:13.133 --> 00:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Late today, The Washington Post
reported a draft bill largely
mirrors the House's version,

00:19.800 --> 00:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but with some notable changes.

00:21.766 --> 00:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will end Medicaid expansion
more gradually, but cut it
deeply in the long term.

00:25.366 --> 00:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It also removes language
that restricts federally
subsidized health plans
from covering abortions.

00:31.233 --> 00:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins joins me now.

00:33.300 --> 00:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, considering the process
here, tomorrow's going to be
an unveiling of this draft, not

00:38.966 --> 00:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just to the public, but even
to a lot of Republicans.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

00:41.533 --> 00:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most Republican senators have
not seen the language yet, Hari.

00:44.066 --> 00:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They tell me that they will see
it tomorrow around 9:30 a.m.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern time.

00:48.733 --> 00:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's when Republican
senators will gather
for this exact reason.

00:50.833 --> 00:51.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
When will we see it?

00:51.833 --> 00:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
When will the public see it?

00:53.400 --> 00:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republicans tell me that is
at the same time, 9:30 a.m.

00:57.233 --> 00:58.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Eastern, online.

00:58.500 --> 01:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Not clear exactly where yet.

01:00.600 --> 01:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari, even as we wait for
the exact bill, today, we're
hearing from some key senators

01:04.800 --> 01:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they have alarm bells
ringing in their heads.

01:07.766 --> 01:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, Republicans can only
lose two Republican senators
and still have this bill pass.

01:12.233 --> 01:17.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Well, today, Rand Paul
told me he sees what he
hears as Obamacare-lite.

01:18.866 --> 01:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And another senator, Ron
Johnson of Wisconsin,
told me he's concerned.

01:21.133 --> 01:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He asked for more time
to review this bill.

01:23.200 --> 01:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said a vote next week,
as is planned, is too soon.

01:27.133 --> 01:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he's not getting more
time and he's not sure he
can get to yes without it.

01:30.633 --> 01:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Speaking of
health care, today was also
an important day, a deadline

01:33.966 --> 01:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for insurance companies to
figure out whether they were
going to participate in some of

01:37.533 --> 01:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the exchanges or not.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is
critical for what kind
of options people will
have on the individual

01:41.933 --> 01:44.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
markets.

01:44.033 --> 01:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so far, today, Hari, we
have learned some news from some
insurers pulling out of markets,

01:47.433 --> 01:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in fact, Anthem and
Blue Cross/Blue Shield
pulling out of markets
in Wisconsin and Indiana.

01:54.433 --> 01:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's really a mixed story,
Hari, because we're also seeing
new insurers enter in places

01:59.933 --> 02:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like Tennessee, which will
have three more options for
insurance than it did last year.

02:03.133 --> 02:05.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And also I spoke to a
company called Medica.

02:05.266 --> 02:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They plan on offering
insurance throughout Iowa.

02:08.300 --> 02:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That will be new for
them this year, adding
another option for Iowans.

02:11.300 --> 02:13.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But here's comes the
catch, Hari, in a way.

02:13.933 --> 02:17.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medica says, to do that,
they're planning to increase
premiums by 43 percent.

02:17.733 --> 02:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we will get more news
here, but it's a really mixed
picture, all of these insurers

02:22.300 --> 02:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying there's
instability in the market.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Lisa Desjardins joining us
from Capitol Hill, many thanks.
