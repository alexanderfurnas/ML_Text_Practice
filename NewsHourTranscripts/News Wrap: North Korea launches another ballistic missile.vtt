In the day's other news:
North Korea launched its
second intercontinental
ballistic missile

00:07.600 --> 00:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that flew higher and
farther than its first
attempts earlier this month.

00:10.500 --> 00:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This missile stayed aloft for
45 minutes, before landing
in the Sea of Japan, near the

00:16.633 --> 00:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Western Japanese
island of Hokkaido.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHINZO ABE, Japanese Prime
Minister (through translator):
This launch clearly shows that

00:21.633 --> 00:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the threat to our security
is real and severe.

00:24.733 --> 00:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As long as North Korea
continues these provocations,
the U.S., South Korea,
China and Russia and

00:31.700 --> 00:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the whole international
community must closely
cooperate and apply
additional pressure.

00:34.866 --> 00:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Pentagon
confirms that the U.S. and
South Korea together staged a

00:39.700 --> 00:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
joint-live fire military
exercise in response.

00:44.000 --> 00:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The North Korean missile was
launched at a high angle.

00:47.466 --> 00:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some U.S. analysts say that
the flight path, flattened out,
means that it could reach the

00:53.100 --> 00:55.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. mainland.

00:55.266 --> 00:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Washington has slapped
more economic sanctions
on Iran, for launching
a rocket that can carry

01:00.333 --> 01:02.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
satellites.

01:02.066 --> 01:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tehran said yesterday
it successfully fired
the rocket into space.

01:05.233 --> 01:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. says the same
technology could be used in
missiles that carry warheads.

01:12.266 --> 01:15.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The new sanctions target
six Iranian companies
that are deemed central
to Iran's ballistic

01:16.133 --> 01:17.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
missile program.

01:17.966 --> 01:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The prime minister of
Pakistan is out of a job.

01:21.566 --> 01:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nawaz Sharif stepped down today,
after the country's highest
court ordered him removed

01:26.200 --> 01:27.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from office.

armed police and paramilitary
rangers ringed Pakistan's

01:38.133 --> 01:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Supreme Court as, in courtroom
number one, a five-judge
panel met to decide the fate

01:45.033 --> 01:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, accused of accumulating
wealth disproportionate to his

01:50.200 --> 01:52.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
income.

01:52.866 --> 01:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Elected three times
to the highest office,
but yet to complete a
five-year term, Sharif

01:59.833 --> 02:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been toppled in a coup,
jailed, exiled, and once
before ousted for corruption.

02:05.500 --> 02:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would history be repeated?

02:12.433 --> 02:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Opposition glee signaled what
was a unanimous guilty verdict,
the prime minister deemed

02:17.500 --> 02:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
untruthful and dishonest,
ordered to stand down and barred
from holding office, as judges

02:23.466 --> 02:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ordered a criminal investigation
which could put him in jail.

02:27.433 --> 02:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: The team of the prime
minister has committed
a heinous crime by way
of fraud and forgery

02:38.066 --> 02:40.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the documents.

02:40.166 --> 02:44.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN MILLER: The documents
relate to posh flats in this
block on Park Lane in London.

02:46.033 --> 02:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Leaked from a legal firm
in Panama, the Panama
papers revealed that
two of Sharif's sons

02:52.400 --> 02:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his daughter concealed
family ownership of
these through a string
of offshore companies.

02:57.400 --> 03:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nawaz Sharif was questioned in
person by civilian and military
investigators just last month.

03:04.300 --> 03:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he emerged, he said there
was no stain of corruption
on either him or his family,

03:11.200 --> 03:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
no embezzlement, no
misappropriation of
government funds.

03:15.200 --> 03:20.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, he's gone,
amid calls for the U.K.
authorities to seize the
properties in question.

03:23.166 --> 03:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sharif must now nominate an
interim successor to lead the
country until elections in 10

03:28.766 --> 03:30.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
months' time.

03:30.833 --> 03:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will likely remain a
potent force, now, though,
from behind the scenes.

03:36.566 --> 03:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That report
from Jonathan Miller of
Independent Television News.

03:41.866 --> 03:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israeli-Palestinian tensions
eased today at a flash point
around a Jerusalem mosque, one

03:46.733 --> 03:48.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day after Israel removed
new security devices.

03:48.966 --> 03:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, elsewhere, a Palestinian
teenager was killed in clashes
with Israeli troops at the

03:54.833 --> 03:56.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Gaza border.

03:56.866 --> 04:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

with a knife.

04:04.233 --> 04:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

birthday.

disease that damaged his
brain and hindered his ability

04:15.533 --> 04:17.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to breathe.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His parents had wanted to try
an experimental treatment here
in the U.S., but a British

04:22.766 --> 04:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court ruled that it wouldn't
help, and it blocked the move.

04:25.500 --> 04:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, the
U.S. House today approved $3.9
billion in emergency spending

04:32.633 --> 04:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for veterans' medical care.

04:34.633 --> 04:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is for a program allowing
vets to seek private care
at government expense.

04:41.100 --> 04:44.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The effort began after
a scandal over long wait
times at VA hospitals.

04:45.433 --> 04:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

today about how police ought
to treat criminal suspects.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened during his
speech in Suffolk County,
New York, on Long Island
about illegal immigration

04:58.433 --> 05:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and violent crime.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At one point, he criticized the
police practice of shielding a
suspect's head as they're taken

05:06.000 --> 05:08.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

05:10.066 --> 05:12.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:12.166 --> 05:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Like, when you
guys put someone in a car and
you're protecting their head,

05:15.466 --> 05:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, the way you put
your hand over -- like,
don't hit your head and
they have just killed

05:21.333 --> 05:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
somebody, don't hit your head.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I said, you can take
the hand away, OK?

05:24.733 --> 05:29.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump also
pledged again to -- quote --
"destroy" the violent street

05:29.500 --> 05:31.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gang MS-13.

05:31.433 --> 05:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Attorney General Jeff
Sessions was in El Salvador,
where the gang controls

05:35.966 --> 05:37.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
entire towns.

05:37.966 --> 05:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said that he hopes his
efforts will help mend relations
with the president, who's been

05:42.000 --> 05:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
verbally attacking him for days.

And on Wall Street,
disappointing earnings
from Amazon and other
big firms kept stocks

06:10.500 --> 06:12.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in check.
