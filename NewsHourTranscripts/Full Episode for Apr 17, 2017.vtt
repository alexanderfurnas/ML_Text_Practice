JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.271 --> 00:06.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.272 --> 00:08.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.074 --> 00:10.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
The era of strategic patience is
over.

00:10.510 --> 00:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Vice President
Pence's warning
to North Korea, after its
failure to launch

00:15.715 --> 00:21.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a test missile over the weekend
raises questions
about what the Trump
administration is prepared

00:21.054 --> 00:22.789 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

00:22.822 --> 00:28.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: In Turkey, a narrow
referendum victory
expands the role of Turkey's
president.

00:28.895 --> 00:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does this power play mean
for a deeply
divided country and its allies?

00:34.701 --> 00:40.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also tonight: One man in India
aims to break
through a taboo by making
hygiene products

00:40.807 --> 00:42.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
affordable.

00:42.609 --> 00:45.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: This is the
model for
how Muruganantham would like to
see his product

00:46.012 --> 00:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
distributed, thousands of small
factories
run by groups of women producing
these sanitary

00:51.918 --> 00:55.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pads at very low cost and
selling them directly
to women.

00:55.155 --> 01:00.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And ahead of a
closely watched
special election tomorrow in
Georgia, our

01:00.627 --> 01:03.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Politics Monday team maps out
the week.

01:03.830 --> 01:10.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour"

01:10.737 --> 01:13.540 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:13.573 --> 01:23.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
long-simmering standoff
between the United States and
North Korea

01:23.116 --> 01:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is heating up again, with new
warnings from
both President Trump and Vice
President Pence.

01:29.122 --> 01:32.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret
Warner, begins our coverage.

01:32.725 --> 01:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The warnings
started at the
demilitarized zone dividing the
Koreas, where

01:38.832 --> 01:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Pence vowed action to
achieve a nuclear-free
Korean Peninsula.

01:43.169 --> 01:51.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Later, in Seoul, he said that,
if productive
talks didn't start and do the
job, President

01:51.077 --> 01:54.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama has demonstrated he won't
shrink from
military action.

01:54.247 --> 01:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
The world witnessed the strength
and resolve

01:57.117 --> 02:02.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our new president in actions
taken in Syria
and Afghanistan.

02:02.989 --> 02:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea would do well not to
test his
resolve or the strength of the
armed forces

02:08.761 --> 02:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United States in this
region.

02:10.697 --> 02:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Pence also
declared again
that the U.S. and its allies
will act, unless

02:16.436 --> 02:20.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
China its influence to rein in
North Korea.

02:20.406 --> 02:24.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, President Trump
took a moment
out from the White House Easter
egg roll to

02:24.777 --> 02:26.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
send his own briefing warning.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Any message for North
Korea?

02:28.581 --> 02:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Got to behave.

02:31.317 --> 02:36.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But at the
United Nations,
the deputy ambassador from North
Korea, officially

02:36.289 --> 02:39.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea,
or DPRK, was defiant.

02:39.792 --> 02:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /KIM IN RYONG, Deputy
North Korean
Ambassador to the United
Nations: The DPRK

02:42.762 --> 02:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is ready to react to any mode of
war desired
by the Americans.

02:49.235 --> 02:53.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The dueling
rhetoric came
after North Korea's ballistic
missile launch

02:53.640 --> 02:59.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Sunday, which U.S. officials
say blew up
within seconds.

02:59.546 --> 03:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A day earlier, Pyongyang had
paraded containers
large enough to hold new
long-range ballistic

03:06.186 --> 03:07.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
missiles through the capital.

03:07.954 --> 03:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There had been expectations the
North would
also carry out its sixth nuclear
test, but

03:14.127 --> 03:15.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no test occurred.

03:15.929 --> 03:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, though, the vice foreign
minister told
the BBC that his government will
be testing

03:20.333 --> 03:26.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missiles weekly, and he warned
of a preemptive
nuclear strike by the North if
the U.S. takes

03:26.606 --> 03:28.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
military action.

03:28.608 --> 03:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Opinions among South Koreans
seem sharply
divided.

03:32.145 --> 03:36.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): As
Trump became
president, the policies seem
likely to become

03:37.016 --> 03:40.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more oppressive, and it worries
me that war
might actually break out.

03:40.687 --> 03:45.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): In
fact, I believe
we have to strongly respond to
North Korea's

03:45.592 --> 03:47.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
provocation.

03:47.393 --> 03:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Pence today
echoed other
top officials in saying the
Obama era policy

03:51.497 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of strategic patience with the
North is over.

03:54.667 --> 04:00.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will look for more regional
support as
he travels on to Japan,
Indonesia and Australia.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

04:03.876 --> 04:08.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Wall
Street rallied broadly after the
weekend passed

04:08.982 --> 04:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without military conflict over
North Korea.

04:11.551 --> 04:17.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 183
points to close near 20637.

04:17.824 --> 04:22.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 51, and the S&amp;P
500 added
20.

04:22.929 --> 04:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, South Korea's
recently ousted
President Park Geun-hye was
indicted on charges

04:28.735 --> 04:31.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of bribery, extortion and abuse
of power.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She could get life in prison, if
she's convicted.

04:35.174 --> 04:37.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Park was arrested after being
removed from
office.

04:37.877 --> 04:43.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's alleged that she and a
longtime confidant
solicited bribes from businesses
while she

04:43.616 --> 04:45.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was president.

04:45.652 --> 04:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of Palestinians in
Israeli prisons
launched a hunger strike today,
in the largest

04:51.291 --> 04:53.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
such action in five years.

04:53.493 --> 04:58.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To show their solidarity,
thousands staged
marches in the West Bank and
Gaza.

04:58.464 --> 05:04.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They condemned conditions in the
jails and
the Israeli policy of detention
without trial.

05:04.337 --> 05:08.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): When
prisoners go
on hunger strike, they feel the
freedom.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a way to resist.

05:10.943 --> 05:15.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can win the battle with our
empty stomachs,
and it is a message to the
international community

05:15.214 --> 05:18.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the free people in the world
that Palestinians
seek freedom.

05:18.818 --> 05:24.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Israeli officials
say the strike
is politically motivated, and
that it denied

05:24.957 --> 05:27.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- it also denies that inmates
are being mistreated.

05:27.894 --> 05:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Sri Lanka, search teams have
now recovered
at least 29 bodies from a
massive garbage

05:34.500 --> 05:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slide that buried dozens of
homes Friday night.

05:38.137 --> 05:44.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, soldiers kept looking in
the huge dump
near Colombo, joined by
relatives of dozens

05:44.277 --> 05:46.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of people still missing.

05:46.145 --> 05:50.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Crews worked with heavy
equipment to clear
the mud and trash.

05:50.950 --> 05:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newly minted Supreme Court
Justice Neil Gorsuch
heard his first set of arguments
today with

05:55.521 --> 05:57.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fellow justices.

05:57.290 --> 06:01.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was an employment
discrimination case,
and it was only 11 minutes into
the hearing

06:01.961 --> 06:03.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when he asked his first
question.

06:03.896 --> 06:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At one point, Gorsuch said he
was sorry for
taking up so much time.

06:09.335 --> 06:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Britain's Prince Harry now says
that he suffered
from repressed grief and
depression for almost

06:15.441 --> 06:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
20 years after the death of his
mother, Princess
Diana.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Harry was 12 when she died.

06:21.447 --> 06:23.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's now 32.

06:23.249 --> 06:27.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He tells The Daily Telegraph
that he came
close to what he called a
complete breakdown

06:27.353 --> 06:29.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more than once.

06:29.055 --> 06:34.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says he's now in counseling,
talking openly
about his feelings and doing
better.

06:34.293 --> 06:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And president and Mrs. Trump
hosted their
first Easter egg roll at the
White House today.

06:38.998 --> 06:43.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first couple welcomed the
crowd from the
Truman Balcony for the annual
event that goes

06:43.636 --> 06:45.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back nearly 140 years.

06:45.705 --> 06:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, the president greeted
visitors while
the first lady read to children.

06:50.376 --> 06:53.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
More than 21,000 people
attended.

06:53.179 --> 06:56.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's actually down from 35,000
last year.

06:57.016 --> 07:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's next
for U.S. policy toward North
Korea after the

07:01.587 --> 07:07.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
failure of another missile
launch; Turkey's
president wins expanded powers
in a controversial

07:07.126 --> 07:17.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
power play; making essential
products in India
more affordable; and much more.

07:17.170 --> 07:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
power play; making essential
products in India
more affordable; and much more.

07:24.310 --> 07:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return to our top story,
North Korea, its
missile and nuclear programs,
and the tougher

07:29.982 --> 07:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
line being drawn with the regime
by the Trump
administration.

07:33.085 --> 07:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke a short time ago with
William Perry,
who served as defense secretary
under President

07:38.424 --> 07:39.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bill Clinton.

07:39.959 --> 07:44.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After Mr. Perry left that post,
he led a diplomatic
effort on North Korea.

07:44.197 --> 07:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I started by asking how he
interprets the
Trump administration position
that the time

07:49.202 --> 07:51.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for strategic patience is over.

07:51.637 --> 07:54.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /WILLIAM PERRY, Former
U.S. Defense
Secretary: I think it means that
they're prepared

07:54.407 --> 07:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take more drastic action and
they're certainly
implying that military action
could be a part

07:59.345 --> 08:01.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that.

08:01.147 --> 08:04.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do you think
that that's
an approach that is likely to
bring about

08:04.484 --> 08:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a response from the North Korean
regime that
the U.S. wants?

08:07.787 --> 08:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY: Well, I think
that this is
an unusually dangerous time,
because of both

08:12.892 --> 08:18.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what North Korea is saying and
doing and what
the administration is thinking
of doing.

08:18.998 --> 08:25.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My own view is that a military
action, while
might be appropriate at some
time, is not

08:25.571 --> 08:27.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yet appropriate.

08:27.306 --> 08:30.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is still time for
diplomacy
and there's time for effective
diplomacy,

08:30.476 --> 08:32.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it must be coercive
diplomacy.

08:32.879 --> 08:37.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The earlier diplomacy for the
last two administrations
has been quite ineffective.

08:37.416 --> 08:42.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, paradoxically, precisely
because of the
dangers, I think we have the
opportunity to

08:42.655 --> 08:46.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
conduct some effective
diplomacy, although
this is going to be coercive
diplomacy.

08:46.592 --> 08:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what do you
mean by coercive
diplomacy?

08:49.762 --> 08:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY: Diplomacy which
threatens actions
which are going to hurt North
Korea.

08:56.068 --> 09:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have in the -- past two
administrations
had sanctions as our element and
course of

09:01.240 --> 09:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diplomacy, but they were very
ineffective
and very weak.

09:05.278 --> 09:12.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, because of the present
situation, we're
in a position to provide really
powerful disincentives,

09:12.184 --> 09:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very powerful efforts, much more
so than the
sanctions.

09:15.588 --> 09:22.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two changes are that China,
which in the
past has not shown much concern
over the North

09:22.094 --> 09:25.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Korean nuclear weapon, they're
now being greatly
concerned, seeing that this
could threaten

09:25.631 --> 09:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their very core interests.

09:27.433 --> 09:32.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, I think China
would be willing
at this stage to take very
powerful actions

09:32.505 --> 09:36.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their economy, like holding
back food and
holding back fuel.

09:36.742 --> 09:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, the threat of
military
action against North Korea in
the past has

09:42.281 --> 09:47.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not really been a credible one,
but I think
it may have become credible in
the last few

09:47.386 --> 09:49.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
months.

09:49.288 --> 09:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And why do you
think the Chinese
would be ready to be tougher
right now than

09:51.757 --> 09:53.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they have been before?

09:53.559 --> 09:56.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY: They see their
core interests
being very heavily threatened
right now.

09:56.896 --> 10:02.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Certainly, a war on the Korean
Peninsula would
be very detrimental to their
core interests.

10:02.068 --> 10:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the possibility of either
South Korea
or Japan going nuclear are
really quite detrimental

10:07.540 --> 10:08.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to their core interests.

10:08.975 --> 10:12.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, having that in mind, I think
they're willing
to take serious action.

10:12.979 --> 10:15.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do not see that China can
solve this problem
alone.

10:15.381 --> 10:17.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I do not suggest that.

10:17.183 --> 10:23.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But China and the United States
working together
could put together a very
powerful set of

10:23.155 --> 10:29.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
disincentives that can effect a
coercive diplomacy
that has good chance, I think,
of being effective.

10:29.128 --> 10:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And when you say
the U.S. suggests
it's prepared to take military
action, isn't

10:35.534 --> 10:43.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there a very real risk, though,
that the North
could go after, successfully hit
South Korea

10:43.843 --> 10:45.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
because it's so close?

10:45.444 --> 10:49.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY: I think there is
a very great
risk in taking military action.

10:49.382 --> 10:52.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I do not recommend that at
this time.

10:52.218 --> 10:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My point, though, is that North
Korea has
to believe there is a
possibility now, a very

10:57.590 --> 11:03.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
real possibility of military
action, and that
has to affect their calculus on
how seriously

11:03.329 --> 11:05.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they will negotiate.

11:05.097 --> 11:09.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm not recommending military
action, but
I think that the threat of
military action

11:09.702 --> 11:11.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has become credible to North
Korea now.

11:12.004 --> 11:15.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, therefore, they may
be much more
willing to negotiate seriously.

11:15.341 --> 11:21.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you see the
leadership
in the North, Kim Jong-un, the
people around

11:21.781 --> 11:26.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him, as being rational, thinking
rationally
about this?

11:26.252 --> 11:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY: I think that the
regime in
North Korea today is not crazy.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's evil and it's reckless, but
it's not
crazy.

11:35.928 --> 11:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their primary goal, which
assuredly has been
effective for many decades now,
is to preserve

11:41.000 --> 11:42.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their regime and power.

11:42.868 --> 11:48.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what they're trying to
do, and that's
their calculus and it's a
rational calculus.

11:48.774 --> 11:50.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need to respond to that.

11:50.609 --> 11:54.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we do not -- if we think
they're crazy,
then we would have to be worried
about making

11:54.547 --> 11:58.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a preemptive nuclear strike
against South
Korea, say.

11:58.818 --> 12:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not crazy, because they
know that,
if they do that, that their
country will face

12:03.255 --> 12:06.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
devastation and their leadership
will be swept
out of power.

12:06.726 --> 12:11.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what do you
think the chances
are, Bill Perry, of there being
an accident

12:11.497 --> 12:16.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of some sort of that could lead
to military
action, a misinterpretation?

12:16.135 --> 12:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY: The reason I do
not favor military
action now is because, once a
military action

12:23.375 --> 12:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starts, it will get out -- it
will escalate,
and is all too easy to get out
of control.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It could escalate on to a total
general war.

12:30.950 --> 12:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a war which North Korea
would, in fact,
lose, but as they were losing
it, and as they

12:36.155 --> 12:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw their regime being swept
away and their
country being devastated, they
might then

12:39.859 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use nuclear weapons, one last
dangerous, but
one last sort of an Armageddon,
before they

12:46.365 --> 12:48.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were swept out of power.

12:48.134 --> 12:51.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the danger of nuclear war
here is not
that North Korea would
deliberately start

12:51.670 --> 12:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one and provoke like a surprise
attack on
South Korea.

12:55.875 --> 13:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The danger is that we would
blunder in a nuclear
war by a military conflict, a
conventional

13:01.447 --> 13:04.784 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
military conflict and a
conventional war escalating
into that.

13:04.817 --> 13:08.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, how
worried should
the American people be about
this?

13:08.187 --> 13:12.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM PERRY: I am very
alarmed.

13:12.124 --> 13:18.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm alarmed because, if we move
into a military
action, even a minor military
action, the

13:18.063 --> 13:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
danger of escalation, I think,
is very great.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is not Syria we're
attacking.

13:21.934 --> 13:28.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is country that undoubtedly
would respond
with a military response to
South Korea.

13:28.374 --> 13:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, as I said, that action
could very
well escalate into a general war
and even

13:33.045 --> 13:34.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a nuclear war.

13:34.046 --> 13:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I'm concerned for that
reason.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I think this is an
opportunity.

13:38.484 --> 13:42.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is an opportunity to
conduct coercive
diplomacy that can be effective.

13:42.888 --> 13:47.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question only is, will
we see that
opportunity and seize it?

13:47.326 --> 13:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BLITZER: Former Secretary of
Defense William
Perry, we thank you.

13:52.097 --> 13:59.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM PERRY: Thank you, Judy.

13:59.438 --> 14:06.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a
controversial referendum
yesterday, the people of Turkey
voted by a

14:06.145 --> 14:12.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thin margin for the biggest
overhaul of Turkey's
politics since the founding of
the modern

14:12.251 --> 14:14.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
republic.

14:14.220 --> 14:18.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among the most significant
changes, a transition
from a parliamentary to a
presidential system

14:18.490 --> 14:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that could lead to a major
consolidation of
power by the nation's leader.

14:23.062 --> 14:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our Jeffrey Brown has that.

14:25.464 --> 14:32.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Flag-waving
supporters greeted
Turkish President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan in

14:32.538 --> 14:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ankara today, after he won
sweeping new powers
in Sunday's referendum.

14:36.575 --> 14:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): We have put up a
fight against

14:39.912 --> 14:41.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the powerful nations of the
world.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The crusader mentality attacked
us abroad.

14:44.817 --> 14:47.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Inside, their lackeys attacked
us.

14:47.286 --> 14:48.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We didn't succumb.

14:48.287 --> 14:50.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
As a nation, we stood strong.

14:50.289 --> 14:54.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But amid the
celebration, questions
about the vote's validity.

14:54.793 --> 14:59.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey's main opposition party
decried a decision
by the national elections board
to accept

14:59.965 --> 15:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ballots without an official
stamp.

15:02.201 --> 15:05.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BULENT TEZCAN, Turkish
Politician (through
translator): The only decision
that will end

15:05.804 --> 15:09.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the debate about the legitimacy
of the vote
and ease the people's legal
concerns is the

15:09.909 --> 15:12.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
annulment of this referendum by
the high

15:12.044 --> 15:16.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: International
observers pointed
to the intimidation of Erdogan's
opponents.

15:16.048 --> 15:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Our team observed the
misuse of administrative
resources and the obstruction of
efforts by

15:22.221 --> 15:26.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
parties and civil society
organizations supporting
the no campaign.

15:26.992 --> 15:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The referendum
passed with
just 51 percent of the vote.

15:31.163 --> 15:36.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It authorizes constitutional
changes allowing
the president to directly name
government

15:36.435 --> 15:41.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ministers and other senior
officials, appoint
half the members of the
country's highest

15:41.206 --> 15:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
judicial body, and declare
states of emergency
and issue decrees.

15:46.512 --> 15:51.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The outcome could also cement
Erdogan's hold
on power for more than a decade.

15:51.550 --> 15:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Throughout Turkey, reactions
were mixed.

15:53.986 --> 15:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
obvious that
a large part of the society
doesn't accept

15:59.858 --> 16:01.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this referendum.

16:01.593 --> 16:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): I
don't know what
the new system will bring, but I
am happy

16:04.897 --> 16:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the person I support has
become an
executive president.

16:08.133 --> 16:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Erdogan says the
changes will
bring stability, in a country
battling the

16:12.504 --> 16:16.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic State group and Kurdish
rebels.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Opponents say he will be able to
rule unchecked.

16:18.410 --> 16:22.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They also fear he will
reinstitute capital
punishment.

16:22.548 --> 16:27.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's already carried out a
wide-ranging crackdown
since surviving a coup attempt
last summer.

16:27.820 --> 16:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The growing repression has
strained relations
with the European Union, a body
Turkey is

16:32.791 --> 16:34.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trying to join.

16:34.460 --> 16:38.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany's foreign minister
warned today the
referendum could make matters
worse.

16:38.564 --> 16:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIGMAR GABRIEL, German Foreign
Minister (through
translator): We will only be
able to help

16:41.333 --> 16:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey if the country stays on a
democratic
path.

16:44.203 --> 16:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, the reintroduction
of death
penalty would be the end of the
negotiations

16:48.540 --> 16:50.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to enter the European Union.

16:50.476 --> 16:55.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In Washington
today, the White
House said it awaits a final
report by international

16:55.547 --> 16:57.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
observers.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for more on this referendum
and what it
means, I'm joined by Steven Cook
of the Council

17:00.819 --> 17:02.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Foreign Relations.

17:02.621 --> 17:06.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His forthcoming book is "False

17:06.925 --> 17:08.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
East."

17:08.727 --> 17:11.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Kadir Ustun, the executive
director of
the Foundation for Political,
Economic and

relations.

17:17.302 --> 17:18.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

17:18.504 --> 17:21.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Steven Cook, you wrote a
scathing response
to the vote.

17:21.440 --> 17:24.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's provocatively entitled,
"Rest in Peace,
Turkey."

17:24.543 --> 17:28.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you see this as a kind of
existential threat
to Turkish democracy?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN COOK, Douglas Dillon
Fellow, Council
on Foreign Relations: Well, it
is certainly

17:29.815 --> 17:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the end of the modern Turkish
state that was
founded in the early 1920s.

17:35.087 --> 17:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're moving on to something
else with President
Erdogan's accumulation of power.

17:39.958 --> 17:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That may be something new, but
also has echoes
in Turkey's past.

17:44.530 --> 17:50.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, President Erdogan
has set things
up so that he has so much power,
he rules

17:50.135 --> 17:51.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
almost like an Ottoman sultan.

17:52.004 --> 17:57.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you see
in this, that
kind of power for President
Erdogan?

17:57.042 --> 17:58.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KADIR USTUN, Executive Director,
Foundation
for Political, Economic and
Social Research:

17:58.477 --> 18:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, this was a historic
referendum.

18:00.879 --> 18:07.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time in modern
Turkish history,
the Turkish public, the
civilians are deciding

18:07.853 --> 18:08.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the form of government.

18:08.854 --> 18:09.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As a positive.

18:09.855 --> 18:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So you see it as a positive step
potentially?

18:11.957 --> 18:13.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KADIR USTUN: Sure, yes.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because this was
needed?

18:14.927 --> 18:20.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KADIR USTUN: This was needed
because you had
two elected heads of government
with overlaps

18:20.632 --> 18:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and conflicts in their powers
and responsibilities
over each other.

18:26.205 --> 18:27.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, what about
that?

18:28.006 --> 18:30.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's the argument that
President Erdogan
and his supporters have made,
that this was

18:30.576 --> 18:34.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
necessary for the democracy to
actually go
forward.

18:34.046 --> 18:38.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: It's actually kind
of a funny
argument, because this was never
a problem

18:38.450 --> 18:44.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until a few years ago, actually
2011, when
President Erdogan, then Prime
Minister Erdogan,

18:44.089 --> 18:46.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
declared that Turkey needed a
new constitution.

18:46.391 --> 18:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Turkish prime minister had
been the head
of the government.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The locus of power had been with
the prime
minister.

18:51.997 --> 18:57.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president had a number of
important powers,
but was supposed to be above
politics and

18:57.102 --> 18:58.904 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a statesman.

18:58.937 --> 19:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once it was clear that Prime
Minister Erdogan
was going to move up to become
the president

19:02.307 --> 19:07.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the republic, then this issue
became more
and more urgent for him and for
the ruling

19:07.479 --> 19:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Justice and Development Party.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you
both about the
size of the victory, because it
was actually

19:11.283 --> 19:16.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smaller than expected and I
think than Erdogan
and his supporters thought.

19:16.555 --> 19:17.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does that tell you?

19:17.789 --> 19:21.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KADIR USTUN: An average of 52 to
53 percent
was expected.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it's in that range.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this was about the
referendum.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was about the system
change.

19:27.566 --> 19:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you ask about people's
votes, about their
parties, you will get similar
numbers to the

19:34.907 --> 19:36.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last election.

19:36.708 --> 19:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you see that people didn't
really vote
along their party affiliations,
but more on

19:42.214 --> 19:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this particular change, whether
we should
go to a presidential system and
whether what

19:47.286 --> 19:51.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Erdogan is proposing is the way
to go.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they voted yes.

19:52.724 --> 19:57.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What do you see
in the lower
vote than expected?

19:57.396 --> 20:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: Well, it was an
extraordinarily
controversial move to
fundamentally alter

20:02.334 --> 20:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Turkey's political system.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is about half the
country that is
opposed to it.

20:07.639 --> 20:13.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is consistent with the
AKP era, the
Justice and Development Party
era, where President

20:13.745 --> 20:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan rules half of the
country that supports
him and seeks to intimidate the
other half

20:19.685 --> 20:21.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

20:21.453 --> 20:26.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are allegations of
electoral -- questionable
electoral practices, I should
say.

20:26.858 --> 20:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the opposition is calling
for an investigation
into it.

20:30.495 --> 20:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's unlikely that anything is
going to change,
but it does suggest a deepening
of the polarization

20:35.500 --> 20:37.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Turkish society.

20:37.302 --> 20:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, does it
suggest -- do
you see going forward that he
will have to

20:40.973 --> 20:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now reach out to opponents to be
more accommodating
or less so?

20:45.644 --> 20:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KADIR USTUN: Look, he has tried
many times
at parliamentary commission to
draft a whole

20:50.616 --> 20:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new civilian constitution,
failed because
of political realities.

20:56.088 --> 21:02.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was the product of a
deal between
the opposition nationalist
party, MHP, and

21:02.527 --> 21:10.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the A.K. party, and I don't see
this as changing
the system wholesale in a
desirable way.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But what I'm
asking is, what
do you see changing the stance
of President

21:14.339 --> 21:15.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Erdogan?

21:15.340 --> 21:16.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does he reach out to opponents?

21:16.875 --> 21:20.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is he more accommodating to all
Turks, or
tougher?

21:20.846 --> 21:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KADIR USTUN: When you look at
the Turkish
political landscape, you see
identity policies,

21:26.318 --> 21:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these parties, Kurdish party,
nationalist
party, and CHP, are consolidated
, just as

21:33.625 --> 21:35.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
A.K.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Party's votes are more or less
consolidated.

21:38.497 --> 21:43.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have that kind of situation
in the Turkish
political landscape.

21:43.735 --> 21:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that won't change all that
much.

21:46.638 --> 21:51.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're going to see in 2019,
when you have
the presidential and the general
elections

21:51.610 --> 21:57.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
held on the same day, if there
will be significant
changes.

21:57.182 --> 22:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't expect those votes
to change all
that much in the next election.

22:02.554 --> 22:07.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what about
the Turkish
relationship with the West,
especially the

22:07.059 --> 22:08.026 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
U.S.?

22:08.060 --> 22:09.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What should the response be from
the U.S.?

22:09.961 --> 22:13.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN COOK: Well, there's a
difference between
what should the response be and
what the reality

22:13.231 --> 22:15.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is likely to be.

22:15.067 --> 22:19.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that the Obama
administration over
the course of eight years was
too quiet about

22:20.005 --> 22:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the excesses of Prime Minister
and then President
Erdogan and the deepening
authoritarianism

22:24.876 --> 22:26.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Turkey.

22:26.845 --> 22:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It strikes me that President
Trump will accommodate
himself to this outcome, because
his priorities

22:31.717 --> 22:33.752 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lie with fighting the Islamic
State.

22:33.785 --> 22:37.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, the United
States looks to
Turkey as an ally in that fight.

22:37.823 --> 22:40.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, briefly,
what do you think
the U.S. response should be and
Europe?

22:41.026 --> 22:46.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KADIR USTUN: In relations with
the U.S. particularly
-- that's what I'm focused on --
there are

22:46.365 --> 22:54.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
significant strategic
differences, especially
with the U.S. support for the
YPG in Northern

22:54.706 --> 23:00.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria, the groups that are
fighting ISIS,
and that -- they are linked to
PKK.

23:00.078 --> 23:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a significant problem
in U.S.-Turkey
relations and on several other
relations.

23:06.051 --> 23:09.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think both sides will need
Trump administration.

23:09.788 --> 23:12.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turks see Trump administration
as a new opportunity.

23:12.657 --> 23:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they will need to talk more
on this.

23:15.293 --> 23:16.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there have been talks.

23:16.762 --> 23:19.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we see the lessening of
those tensions.

23:19.765 --> 23:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the coming years, I do expect
that to move
to a better place.

23:25.437 --> 23:32.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But in terms of this
authoritarianism argument,
I find it overly simplistic and
sort of easy

23:32.944 --> 23:35.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explanation, oh, Turkey is
authoritarian.

23:35.313 --> 23:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That doesn't answer the question
about why
50 percent are voting for this
party and Erdogan.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, we
will leave it
there and we will watch going
forward.

23:45.290 --> 23:51.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kadir Ustun and Steven Cook,
thank you both
very much.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN COOK: Thank you.

23:54.332 --> 23:57.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KADIR USTUN: Thank you.

23:57.402 --> 24:03.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us,
coming up on
the "NewsHour": a murder posted
online, a

24:03.608 --> 24:11.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killer still at large; and a
world in disarray,
a selection from the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

24:11.883 --> 24:16.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But first: an unlikely
innovation from an
unusual innovator.

24:16.354 --> 24:21.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro has
the story of one man who has
made it his mission

24:21.660 --> 24:25.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to bring affordable hygiene
products to women
in India.

24:25.764 --> 24:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its part of our series Agents
for Change.

24:28.433 --> 24:34.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Arunachalam
Muruganantham
says he was a born tinkerer,
obsessed with

24:34.072 --> 24:38.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
figuring out how things worked,
from toys
to bicycles.

24:38.076 --> 24:42.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He grew up in poverty after his
father died
young, dropped out of school and
became a

24:42.581 --> 24:44.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
welder, a lower-middle-class
occupation in
India.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM,
Inventor: To support
my mother, I stop my schooling.

24:47.953 --> 24:52.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But his
natural curiosity
apparently knew no bounds.

24:52.057 --> 24:59.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Years later, it took him into a
strictly taboo
area in India's tradition-bound
society: menstrual

24:59.164 --> 25:00.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hygiene.

25:00.699 --> 25:03.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: We
are able to
break the taboo, and using it.

25:03.702 --> 25:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He's become
known as India's
pad man.

25:07.606 --> 25:13.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your goal is to have every woman
in this country
use sanitary pads, if they need
it?

25:13.812 --> 25:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: Yes,
it's a movement.

25:15.580 --> 25:19.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A movement
begun by a
man who knew almost nothing
about the female

25:19.618 --> 25:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
body until after he was married.

25:22.020 --> 25:25.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You didn't even know what
menstruation at
all.

25:25.123 --> 25:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You had no idea what it was.

25:27.058 --> 25:28.793 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that correct?

25:28.827 --> 25:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: Yes,
I don't know
when it is happening, how it is
happening,

25:30.762 --> 25:32.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even why it is happening.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

25:34.099 --> 25:36.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: And, he
says, his wife,
Shanthi, wasn't particularly
interested in

25:37.002 --> 25:38.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
discussing it.

25:38.136 --> 25:40.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: It's
the biggest
taboo.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wife never talks to husband.

25:41.573 --> 25:43.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Daughter never talks to mother.

25:43.108 --> 25:47.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That comes
at a high cost
in public health.

25:47.112 --> 25:51.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some experts say millions of
girls across
the developing world miss school
during their

25:52.017 --> 25:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
periods and remain susceptible
to infection
throughout adulthood.

25:58.690 --> 26:03.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sanitary pads are widely
advertised in India,
but surveys suggest only about
one in 10 women

26:03.995 --> 26:05.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actually uses them.

26:05.564 --> 26:08.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
At first, Muruganantham
suggested them to
his wife.

26:08.099 --> 26:11.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: I
asked simply,
there is some products in the
market.

26:11.770 --> 26:13.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why you're not using that?

26:13.805 --> 26:18.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She instantly told, I also know
about that,
but we have to cut our family
milk budget.

26:18.877 --> 26:19.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Milk budget?

26:19.978 --> 26:20.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: Yes.

26:20.979 --> 26:23.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then I find it's a matter of
affordability.

26:23.348 --> 26:28.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He could
afford one package
of sanitary pads and gave it to
Shanthi as

26:28.286 --> 26:32.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a gift, partly to find out how
they were made
and why they had to be so
expensive.

26:32.991 --> 26:35.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: The
white substance
inside is a cotton.

26:35.860 --> 26:39.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The raw material cost of the
cotton is a few
pennies.

26:39.564 --> 26:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I bought the product for
dollars.

26:42.167 --> 26:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, even being illiterate, I
thought, why
not try to make an affordable
pad for my wife?

26:48.039 --> 26:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Over the
next few years,
he tried, using local cotton, to
replicate

26:52.344 --> 26:54.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the commercial pads.

26:54.079 --> 26:59.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His wife suffered through early
prototypes
that didn't work and went back
to using a

26:59.084 --> 27:00.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rag.

27:00.952 --> 27:04.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muruganantham then coaxed some
female medical
students to try his subsequent
models, figuring

27:04.823 --> 27:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the future doctors would be less
shy.

27:07.826 --> 27:13.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he even began wearing a pad
himself, creating
an artificial uterus and rubber
bladder, coaxing

27:13.999 --> 27:18.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a local butcher to provide the
raw material,
and testing it out while he rode
a bicycle.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: I
filled goat blood,
animal blood in it.

27:21.740 --> 27:22.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I tied on my hip.

27:23.008 --> 27:25.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a tube connection to
the napkin and
the bladder.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Shanthi had
had enough.

27:27.579 --> 27:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANTHI MURUGANANTHAM, Wife of
Arunachalam
Muruganantham (through
translator): Everyone

27:30.148 --> 27:32.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the village was saying he'd
gone off his
head.

27:32.450 --> 27:33.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was truly afraid.

27:33.885 --> 27:36.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People said he had become like a
vampire,
that he was doing crazy things.

27:36.488 --> 27:40.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: She
asked me to,
"I want to go my parents' home
for a few days."

27:40.325 --> 27:41.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She never came back.

27:41.459 --> 27:43.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And third month, I got a divorce
notice from
my wife.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She filed
for divorce?

27:45.864 --> 27:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: Yes.

27:46.865 --> 27:48.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I got a divorce notice.

27:48.333 --> 27:51.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: His mother,
who lived
in the home, also left him.

27:51.536 --> 27:53.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But his curiosity didn't leave
him.

27:53.772 --> 27:59.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He called an American supplier
posing as an
industrialist in his hometown of
Coimbatore

27:59.144 --> 28:01.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looking to branch out into
feminine hygiene
products.

28:01.880 --> 28:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: Then
I claim myself,
I'm a mill owner in Coimbatore.

28:06.251 --> 28:08.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Please send some samples.

28:08.053 --> 28:11.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The samples
arrived and,
one day, when he wasn't home,
his dog tore

28:11.756 --> 28:12.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into them.

28:12.924 --> 28:14.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: She
took the courier
cover.

28:14.392 --> 28:15.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She scratches it.

28:15.794 --> 28:18.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oh, my God, I saw the secret:
the fiber.

28:18.763 --> 28:20.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can see the fiber.

28:20.331 --> 28:24.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: So, the dog
opened this
for you?

28:24.135 --> 28:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM:
Opened it.

28:25.136 --> 28:27.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She scratches it with the anger.

28:27.238 --> 28:31.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It was
cellulose, he discovered,
that, when scratched vigorously,
becomes sponge-like

28:31.910 --> 28:33.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and highly absorbent.

28:33.778 --> 28:38.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took two years to perfect a
machine to
fluff up the cellulose, he said,
a modified

28:38.616 --> 28:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
food blender in which the blades
have to be
angled just so.

28:42.253 --> 28:45.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: It
got a prestigious
award from Indian Institute of
Technology

28:45.156 --> 28:47.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as the best innovation.

28:47.158 --> 28:51.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It's simple,
easily replicated,
and can be modified to work
without electricity,

28:51.663 --> 28:53.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he says.

28:53.198 --> 28:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The pads can be made and sold
for a fraction
of the commercial varieties.

28:58.336 --> 29:03.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the model for how
Muruganantham would
like to see his product
distributed, thousands

29:03.341 --> 29:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of small factories run by groups
of women
producing these sanitary pads at
very low

29:08.480 --> 29:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cost and selling them directly
to women.

29:11.516 --> 29:15.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women are far more comfortable
buying the
pads from women directly, rather
than from

29:15.787 --> 29:17.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a store, Muruganantham says.

29:17.789 --> 29:21.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Feminine hygiene is not
discussed in open
company.

29:21.159 --> 29:26.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our own questions elicited
nervous laughter
from the very women making them,
even as they

29:26.264 --> 29:27.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
praised their product.

29:27.866 --> 29:30.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANTI UDAYKUMAR, Factory Worker
(through
translator): There's definitely
benefit.

29:30.301 --> 29:33.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Before, we were using only
cloth, and it was
very difficult.

29:33.805 --> 29:35.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now girls don't have that
difficulty.

29:35.373 --> 29:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was much easier for them than
it was for
us.

29:38.243 --> 29:42.747 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Muruganantham is determined
to change this.

29:42.781 --> 29:47.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: I
want to make
this as a low-cost sanitary pad
movement across

29:47.552 --> 29:49.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the globe.

29:49.420 --> 29:52.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Helped by
awards and his
own advocacy, more than 4,000
small factories

29:52.924 --> 29:58.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have started making his sanitary
pads across
India, each with its own local
branding and

29:58.463 --> 29:59.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
language.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: Malar
is meaning
of flower.

30:01.266 --> 30:04.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He gets no
royalties from
any of this.

30:04.936 --> 30:09.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His workshop does sell the
machines, enough
to earn him a modest living.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But nothing is patented.

30:11.142 --> 30:15.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants others to copy or even
improve the
machines and methods.

30:15.113 --> 30:17.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: The
world has a
shortage of solution providers.

30:17.982 --> 30:21.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Everybody want to be in the
"Forbes" list.

30:21.085 --> 30:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Everybody
want to be in
the "Forbes" list.

30:23.621 --> 30:24.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM:
"Forbes" list.

30:24.622 --> 30:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody want to be a solution
provider.

30:26.357 --> 30:30.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In the end,
Shanthi decided
her husband was a solution
provider.

30:30.895 --> 30:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She returned after a five-year
separation,
somewhat sheepishly, she admits.

30:35.166 --> 30:39.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHANTHI MURUGANANTHAM (through
translator):
They had his interview on TV
that he had discovered

30:39.537 --> 30:40.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sanitary napkins.

30:40.538 --> 30:42.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I called him, and then I came
back.

30:42.841 --> 30:43.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was angry.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I told him I didn't want to get
in his way.

30:45.643 --> 30:49.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's why I stepped aside.

30:49.781 --> 30:51.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now we are happy.

30:51.850 --> 30:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Happy for
what her husband's
work may mean for young girls
like their 8-year-old

30:57.288 --> 30:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
daughter, Phrithisri (ph).

30:59.224 --> 31:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARUNACHALAM MURUGANANTHAM: The
strongest creature
created by God in this world,
not the tiger,

31:05.363 --> 31:10.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not the elephant, not the lion
-- the women.

31:10.068 --> 31:16.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: If any man
doubts this,
he says, see how long you can
endure a sanitary

31:16.174 --> 31:17.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pad in your daily routine.

31:18.009 --> 31:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in Coimbatore, India.

31:22.347 --> 31:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at University

31:28.353 --> 31:35.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of St. Thomas in Minnesota.

31:35.460 --> 31:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A cold-blooded murder posted on
Facebook on
Sunday set off shock and strong
reactions

31:46.738 --> 31:52.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
across social media and beyond
today, as the
manhunt for the killer
intensified.

31:52.277 --> 31:55.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

31:55.713 --> 32:00.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The 57-second video
shows a man
identified as Steve Stephens
driving the streets

32:00.218 --> 32:02.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Cleveland while talking on
the phone.

32:02.687 --> 32:08.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He then steps from the car and
confronts Robert
Godwin Sr., a 74-year-old
retired foundry

32:08.993 --> 32:14.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worker, a father of nine and a
grandfather
of 14, and shoots Godwin dead.

32:14.866 --> 32:19.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The online killing reportedly
remained on
the site for nearly three hours
before Facebook

32:19.737 --> 32:21.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
removed it.

32:21.539 --> 32:26.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement late today, the
company said
that the video has "no place on
Facebook and

32:26.110 --> 32:30.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goes against our policies and
everything we
stand for."

32:30.315 --> 32:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company said it's reviewing
how it operates
'to be sure people can report
videos that

32:35.453 --> 32:38.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violate our standards as quickly
as possible."

32:39.023 --> 32:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This episode raises fresh
questions about
the role and responsibility of
social media

32:44.128 --> 32:46.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sites like Facebook.

32:46.197 --> 32:51.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the latest statement, I
spoke with
Emily Dreyfuss, a senior staff
writer at "Wired"

32:51.102 --> 32:52.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
magazine.

32:52.170 --> 32:55.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I began by asking her what
Facebook could
do.

32:55.039 --> 32:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY DREYFUSS, "Wired": First
of all, you
know, it is true that Facebook
is working

32:59.777 --> 33:03.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very hard to keep videos like
this off of
its site.

33:03.348 --> 33:07.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's easy in a moment like this
to say, you
know, this is absurd that it was
on Facebook

33:07.752 --> 33:09.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for even three hours.

33:09.420 --> 33:14.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact is that a large
apparatus of
content moderation and work went
into the

33:14.892 --> 33:17.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
effort to be able to even get
the video down
after three hours.

33:17.762 --> 33:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in order for it to be
removed, that means
that people on Facebook had to
flag it as

33:22.233 --> 33:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inappropriate, and then that
flag had to be
sent to people that Facebook
employs all over

33:26.871 --> 33:29.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world to get rid of content
like this.

33:30.008 --> 33:30.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they took it down.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, sometimes, this can take up
to 48 hours.

33:33.378 --> 33:37.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, three hours here is not even
long in the
scheme of things.

33:37.915 --> 33:40.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, Facebook could do more.

33:40.418 --> 33:43.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are working hard to
figure out what
they can do.

33:43.354 --> 33:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of those things would be to
use A.I. and
allow artificial intelligence to
help humans

33:49.494 --> 33:54.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are having to flag this sort
of terrible,
gruesome material so that we
don't see it.

33:54.499 --> 34:00.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the problems is that A.I.
is not really
necessarily ready and up to the
task of that

34:00.505 --> 34:06.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet, so Facebook is still trying
to figure
out how to make this work.

34:06.077 --> 34:07.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: I want to make sure I
understand.

34:07.879 --> 34:12.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They rely on Facebook users to
flag these
things, or do they have people
on their staff

34:12.817 --> 34:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
watching videos being uploaded?

34:14.585 --> 34:18.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY DREYFUSS: So, they don't
have people
on staff who are watching videos
as they're

34:18.156 --> 34:19.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
uploaded.

34:20.024 --> 34:22.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they have, they employ --
Facebook employs
hundreds of thousands of people
who they call

34:22.860 --> 34:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
content moderators, whose job is
to just watch
videos like this and, if they
see something

34:27.832 --> 34:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inappropriate, to take them
down.

34:29.567 --> 34:33.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, these people are not
watching them
before the video hits the Web
site.

34:33.504 --> 34:37.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're watching them after a
video has been
uploaded, and then after someone
like you

34:37.375 --> 34:42.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or me or anyone else on Facebook
has flagged
that video as potentially being
inappropriate.

34:42.346 --> 34:46.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that moment, that video will
then get sent
to this team of content
moderators who will

34:46.818 --> 34:48.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
look at it.

34:48.553 --> 34:52.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, Facebook doesn't have
a system
in place to look at the video
and to moderate

34:52.924 --> 34:57.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it and to decide what's on it
and whether
it's appropriate before it hits
the Web site.

34:57.161 --> 35:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that is something they
could decide to
do, but that would radically
change what Facebook

35:02.066 --> 35:03.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is as we know it.

35:03.201 --> 35:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Talk about that.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rapid change what Facebook is as
we know it.

35:06.137 --> 35:10.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They try to be -- they want to
be crowdsourcing
content.

35:10.741 --> 35:13.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to have raw, emotional
videos like
this.

35:13.744 --> 35:15.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMILY DREYFUSS: Yes.

35:15.446 --> 35:17.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But, at the same
time, they don't
want to cross the line, it seems
to me.

35:18.015 --> 35:21.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So how do they define what they
do and what
they are?

35:21.119 --> 35:25.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY DREYFUSS: Yes, so this is
an incredibly
difficult challenge, not just
for Facebook,

35:25.389 --> 35:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but for society at large, for us
to decide
what is and is not OK to be
shared on social

35:30.862 --> 35:32.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
media platforms.

35:32.663 --> 35:37.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Facebook has resisted calls
to say that
it is a media company, like PBS
or "Wired."

35:38.002 --> 35:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we, as journalists, have
guidelines for
how to deal with what kind of
content is appropriate

35:43.574 --> 35:45.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we would put on TV or in
our magazine.

35:45.476 --> 35:49.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Facebook, by refusing to call
itself a media
company, tries to take
responsibility away

35:49.814 --> 35:54.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from itself and say, look,
rather than being
a media company, we are actually
a mirror

35:54.519 --> 35:58.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on society, and we're going to
reflect society
at its best and at its worst.

35:58.356 --> 36:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, what we saw yesterday with
Steve Stephens'
video was clearly society at its
worst.

36:03.427 --> 36:05.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But this is a huge, huge
challenge.

36:05.763 --> 36:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what Facebook wants to do is
encourage
people to upload video.

36:09.033 --> 36:13.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it says it wants to
encourage people to
upload emotional, raw, intense
video, and

36:13.871 --> 36:15.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it is succeeding.

36:15.273 --> 36:17.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's part of its business
model.

36:17.074 --> 36:21.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if it goes too far and
allows videos like
this one to show up on people's
timelines,

36:21.746 --> 36:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it will also destroy itself,
because you and
I are not going to continue to
log into Facebook

36:26.017 --> 36:31.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if when we go on to see videos
or pictures
of our nieces and nephews, if we
accidentally

36:31.822 --> 36:35.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come upon a video of a gruesome,
horrific
homicide.

36:35.393 --> 36:41.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Facebook has an incentive to
not make
us not want to upload things,
which they may

36:41.732 --> 36:43.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do if they were to censor us.

36:43.668 --> 36:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can imagine the outcry of
people on Facebook
if you went to upload a video,
and it didn't

36:48.272 --> 36:52.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show up right away because
Facebook was waiting
to approve it.

36:52.343 --> 36:57.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People wouldn't like that
either, but nor
do we like having videos like
this in our

36:57.215 --> 36:58.482 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
timeline.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, it's a really tough
challenge for them
to walk that line.

37:00.451 --> 37:02.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And also -- we have
about a minute
left.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're also trying to bolster
their Facebook
Live feature.

37:04.522 --> 37:06.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMILY DREYFUSS: Yes.

37:06.224 --> 37:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Now, this was a video
that was
posted, although this man did
use Facebook

37:09.727 --> 37:11.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Live to talk about what he did.

37:11.629 --> 37:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's this going to do to their
efforts to
boost Facebook Live?

37:15.566 --> 37:17.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMILY DREYFUSS: Yes.

37:17.535 --> 37:22.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Facebook Live, what was, as
we were describing,
as a very difficult challenge
becomes almost

37:22.440 --> 37:24.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
impossible.

37:24.208 --> 37:29.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unless they were to put Facebook
Live on a
delay, and it would cease to be
live, there

37:29.180 --> 37:32.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is no way that they can avoid
things like
this from hitting the site.

37:32.516 --> 37:36.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's honestly a miracle that
homicides
and horrible, gruesome violence
have not been

37:37.021 --> 37:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
already used in that way.

37:38.856 --> 37:44.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's something that Facebook
has to know,
and it's deciding that it can
depend on its

37:44.161 --> 37:47.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
users to flag content soon
enough to take
it down.

37:47.565 --> 37:51.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it is definitely taking that
risk in order
to push this product that is
live.

37:51.936 --> 37:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Emily Dreyfuss on the
tough questions
that new technology is providing
us.

37:55.806 --> 37:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Emily Dreyfuss, thanks for
joining us.

37:58.643 --> 38:05.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMILY DREYFUSS: Thanks, John.

38:05.616 --> 38:15.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: why a
special congressional
election in Georgia is getting
national attention.

38:15.993 --> 38:21.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Protesters demand to see the
president's tax
returns, but do most Americans
care?

38:21.632 --> 38:25.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And does President Trump's
travel indicate
his priorities?

38:25.503 --> 38:30.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look at all this in Politics
Monday with
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report and

38:30.441 --> 38:32.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tamara Keith of NPR.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

38:34.612 --> 38:40.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Amy, we are looking at this
congressional
-- special congressional
election tomorrow.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats think they have a
chance.

38:42.620 --> 38:43.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: They
think they have a chance.

38:43.621 --> 38:44.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do they have a
chance?

38:44.789 --> 38:45.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: They absolutely do.

38:46.023 --> 38:47.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here's the thing about this
district.

38:47.892 --> 38:52.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked a little bit about it
last week,
but it's suburban Atlanta
district, very wealthy,

38:52.963 --> 38:54.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very well-educated.

38:54.298 --> 38:57.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a Republican district,
but this is
not Trump country.

38:57.034 --> 38:59.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a district that Mitt
Romney won by
20 points.

39:00.004 --> 39:04.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a district that the
Congress , Republican
Congressman Tom Price, who is
now the HHS

39:04.542 --> 39:08.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretary, easily carried, but
Trump only
won by less than two points.

39:08.679 --> 39:13.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the kind of district
that Democrats
think they can win when the
president -- this

39:13.484 --> 39:18.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
becomes a referendum on the
president and
his popularity much more so than
about the

39:18.389 --> 39:19.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Democrats.

39:19.657 --> 39:22.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're going to get a really
interesting
test of that.

39:22.660 --> 39:26.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also helping the Democrat in
this race are
the fact there are 11
Republicans, so that

39:26.297 --> 39:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
field is very fractured, and
they're also
fighting each other, and the
fact that the

39:32.370 --> 39:36.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrat is benefiting from
national excitement
about this race.

39:36.474 --> 39:41.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's raised a ton of money, and
enthusiasm
among the Democratic base, while
the Republican

39:41.879 --> 39:43.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
base not quite as enthusiastic.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, these are the
factors at
play here.

39:45.616 --> 39:48.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is different from the
Kansas race
that we watched last week.

39:49.019 --> 39:51.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: This
is, because it's closer.

39:52.022 --> 39:52.990 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not Kansas.

39:53.023 --> 39:54.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the suburbs of Atlanta.

39:54.792 --> 40:00.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Democratic candidate has
been able
to sort of consolidate
Democratic support.

40:00.765 --> 40:05.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Republicans are sort of
fighting each
other as much as they're
fighting him.

40:06.003 --> 40:09.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He -- this Democrat, Jon Ossoff,
is an interesting
candidate.

40:09.940 --> 40:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a young person, not really
any political
experience.

40:14.578 --> 40:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's running for Congress for
the first time.

40:17.114 --> 40:22.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He raised a loft money,
something like $8
million, but most of that came
from outside

40:22.920 --> 40:27.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the district; 95 percent of
it, according
to the Center for Responsive
Politics, came

40:27.558 --> 40:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from outside of the district, 80
percent of
it from outside of the state.

40:31.228 --> 40:34.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what this says is that this
is a proxy
war.

40:34.398 --> 40:39.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Democrats all over the
United States
looking at this as an
opportunity to send

40:39.637 --> 40:41.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a message.

40:41.405 --> 40:47.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This becomes about President
Trump and about
the message they can send, and
less about

40:47.478 --> 40:49.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of the local issues that
this could be
about.

40:49.880 --> 40:52.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you both
have covered
politics all over the country.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, Amy, I read something
today.

40:54.718 --> 40:58.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were saying that -- making
the point
that Democrats are spending a
lot of money

40:58.389 --> 41:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on television and online, on
ads, but they're
not putting enough into actually
turning out

41:05.529 --> 41:08.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the vote, the so-called
get-out-the-vote effort.

41:08.299 --> 41:10.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this a factor here?

41:10.067 --> 41:11.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are Democrats doing...

41:11.869 --> 41:14.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, although I am
-- you're sort
of seeing both things, the
Democrats, the

41:14.872 --> 41:18.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
committee that is responsible
for electing
congressional Democrats, putting
more people

41:18.576 --> 41:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now on the ground in districts,
saying, we
understand that we need to do
more to motivate

41:23.280 --> 41:24.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our base to get out.

41:24.682 --> 41:28.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to go literally touch
them, rather
than to just put ads.

41:28.319 --> 41:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact is, this Democrat
has -- as Tam
pointed out, he has over $8
million, maybe

41:33.991 --> 41:35.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
close to $10 million.

41:35.359 --> 41:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's getting spent everywhere in
this congressional
district.

41:38.562 --> 41:43.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think this is what we're
going to be
looking for, whether the
president's low approval

41:43.467 --> 41:49.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ratings and the lack of
enthusiasm from Republicans,
fired-up Democratic base, they
send a warning

41:49.473 --> 41:51.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
signal to Republicans.

41:51.308 --> 41:56.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If a Democrat wins here, I think
if you're
a Republican up in 2018, you
say, uh-oh.

41:56.413 --> 42:01.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it gives
heart to Democrats
if he wins, clearly.

42:01.418 --> 42:03.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, potentially,
if he wins.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, of course, this is just the
primary.

42:05.089 --> 42:06.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's sort of a jungle primary.

42:07.024 --> 42:10.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So if he gets more than 50
percent, he wins.

42:10.227 --> 42:13.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If he doesn't, there's another
race.

42:13.063 --> 42:17.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a general election which
will be a
more traditional race, where the
Democrat

42:17.535 --> 42:23.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can go after the Republican, and
the Republican
can go after the Democrat,
though the Republicans

42:23.207 --> 42:29.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been able to train their
fire pretty
much right at Jon Ossoff because
he has consolidated

42:29.280 --> 42:31.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the support.

42:31.148 --> 42:34.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, we're looking
at kind of
a rise of Democratic energy
across the country.

42:34.852 --> 42:38.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been talking about it
for the last
couple of months.

42:38.122 --> 42:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Amy, and one other way we
looked at this
weekend -- and we mentioned it a
minute ago

42:41.792 --> 42:46.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- were these rallies across the
country,
marches pointing out the
president -- Tax

42:46.564 --> 42:51.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Day is coming up tomorrow, but
President Trump
hasn't released his tax returns.

42:51.302 --> 42:55.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, though, is that
something
that gets people excited or
disturbed?

42:55.773 --> 42:57.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is this something that matters?

42:57.141 --> 42:58.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It certainly is
motivating to
the Democratic base.

42:58.809 --> 43:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for a lot of
voters, the issues
of transparency is very
important.

43:02.613 --> 43:05.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite the fact that the
president said nobody
cares about his taxes, I think a
lot of people

43:05.883 --> 43:07.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care that he didn't release his
taxes.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question issue is whether it
is the most
important issue to voters.

43:10.955 --> 43:14.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it was not the most
important issue when
they decided to support the
president.

43:14.792 --> 43:19.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the challenge for the
president right
now is actually getting
something accomplished.

43:19.163 --> 43:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is why you're seeing
Republican enthusiasm
wane.

43:22.366 --> 43:24.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's the sense of frustration.

43:24.168 --> 43:28.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talk to a lot of Republicans
who say, man,
we have the House, we have the
Senate, we

43:28.072 --> 43:29.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have the White House.

43:29.073 --> 43:30.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We still can't get things done.

43:30.908 --> 43:36.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the bigger challenge for
the president
will be if a tax reform bill
doesn't pass,

43:36.580 --> 43:38.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more so than whether he releases
his taxes.

43:38.916 --> 43:43.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, by the way,
the treasury
secretary, Tam, said today that
they do not

43:43.921 --> 43:49.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intend or don't anticipate
getting a tax reform
plan out there before the August
recess, which

43:49.693 --> 43:50.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is late in the summer.

43:51.028 --> 43:52.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: That's right.

43:52.830 --> 43:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And based on everything we have
seen leading
up to this point, it doesn't
look like they

43:56.834 --> 44:02.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have found sort of cohesion on
what they want
on the Republican side.

44:02.039 --> 44:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The House wants something
different than the
Senate.

44:04.875 --> 44:10.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the White House, I think,
has some internal
divisions even about what the
Trump administration

44:10.481 --> 44:11.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wants.

44:11.482 --> 44:14.151 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, tax reform is a really big
thing.

44:14.184 --> 44:19.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It hasn't happened since 1986,
and it took
them, I think, about six years
to get it.

44:19.623 --> 44:20.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, it took more than...

44:20.624 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:21.625 --> 44:22.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some of us
covered that.

44:22.626 --> 44:23.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was complicated and took
a long time.

44:23.627 --> 44:24.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, a very long
time.

44:24.928 --> 44:26.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

44:26.664 --> 44:31.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And there was some
level of
bipartisan horse-trading that is
not currently

44:31.802 --> 44:34.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happening between the president
and Congress.

44:34.238 --> 44:36.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if his own party doesn't
agree, that presents
a challenge.

44:36.974 --> 44:37.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

44:37.975 --> 44:39.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's #governingishard.

44:39.810 --> 44:42.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think that's what
Republicans are finding
out right now, is that, even
though they have

44:42.346 --> 44:47.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all the levers of power, they
have -- they
remain incredibly divided.

44:47.251 --> 44:51.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to me, the most interesting
number that
came out today was a Pew poll
that asked of

44:51.188 --> 44:55.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats and Republicans, do
you think your
party is mostly united or mostly
divided?

44:55.125 --> 44:58.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Overwhelming majority of
Republicans said,
I think our party is divided.

44:58.395 --> 45:01.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Overwhelming majority of
Democrats said, I
think we're united.

45:01.999 --> 45:03.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you're seeing these
divisions.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw it most recently with the
health care.

45:05.235 --> 45:06.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you're going to see it on
taxes, too.

45:06.837 --> 45:08.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK, less than a
minute.

45:08.605 --> 45:13.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Quickly to Tam on this, a story
today that
the president has done less
traveling both

45:13.077 --> 45:17.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the U.S. and abroad than both
of his predecessors,
Obama and George W. Bush.

45:17.848 --> 45:23.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does that say something that
should tell us
anything about whether he's
going to be successful

45:23.320 --> 45:24.555 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or not?

45:24.588 --> 45:25.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I don't know if
it's a predictor
of success.

45:26.023 --> 45:30.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What it does tell us is, those
predecessors,
they were campaigning.

45:30.427 --> 45:34.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were out pushing for policy
proposals.

45:34.498 --> 45:38.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama was out there
holding town
halls, trying to build support
for his stimulus

45:38.335 --> 45:42.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
package, and President Bush was
out there
trying to build support for No
Child Left

45:42.840 --> 45:45.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Behind and for his tax cut
proposal.

45:45.342 --> 45:49.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump had about a
17-day period
where he could have gone out to
push for the

45:49.780 --> 45:53.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care bill, but it was
very much in
flux and it wasn't even clear.

45:53.150 --> 45:56.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He held a couple of rallies and
didn't really
campaign for it.

45:56.420 --> 46:01.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he's not had the policies to
go out and
sell to the public.

46:01.391 --> 46:05.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that might be part, though
it's not clear,
of why he has spent less time.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

46:06.096 --> 46:07.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He likes to speak to his base.

46:07.464 --> 46:11.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He likes to preach to his choir,
rather than
convert new groups.

46:11.468 --> 46:16.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, his travel schedule is much
more like
comfort food than it is an
attempt to broaden

46:16.840 --> 46:18.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his base.

46:18.575 --> 46:22.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is going to be a much
bigger challenge
for the president going forward,
because,

46:22.379 --> 46:25.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we have seen, his approval
rating right
now right about 40 percent.

46:25.482 --> 46:28.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He can't survive just at 40
percent or get
big things done with that.

46:28.852 --> 46:31.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, I'm
getting my head
wrapped around comfort food
right now.

46:31.321 --> 46:32.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:32.322 --> 46:33.290 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Sounds good, doesn't
it?

46:33.323 --> 46:34.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:34.858 --> 46:37.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, thank
you both, Politics Monday.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

46:39.630 --> 46:43.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're welcome.

TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

46:47.738 --> 46:54.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now a former
American diplomat
takes a candid look at the state
of international

46:54.211 --> 46:55.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
affairs today.

46:55.579 --> 46:58.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the latest addition to the
"NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

46:58.415 --> 47:00.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Margaret Warner is back with
that.

47:00.250 --> 47:05.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: President Trump
has discovered
in his first 100 days that the
world is as

47:05.289 --> 47:11.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
messy and menacing to U.S.
interests as he
contended during the campaign,
and much more

47:11.161 --> 47:13.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult for Washington to
manage.

47:13.697 --> 47:17.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the product of forces
driving the
world apart for nearly three
decades since

47:17.968 --> 47:20.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the end of the Cold War.

47:20.070 --> 47:24.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the theme of a new book
by Richard
Haass, "A World in Disarray:
American Foreign

47:25.008 --> 47:28.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Policy and the Crisis of the Old
Order."

47:28.545 --> 47:33.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President of the Council on
Foreign Relations,
Haass served in senior foreign
policy positions

47:33.417 --> 47:35.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the administrations of both
Presidents
Bush.

47:35.619 --> 47:37.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, Richard Haass, welcome.

47:37.387 --> 47:37.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS, Author, "A World
in Disarray:
American Foreign Policy and the
Crisis of

47:38.021 --> 47:39.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Old Order": Thank you.

47:39.857 --> 47:42.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: So, as you and
I both recall,
at the end of the Cold War, we
in the West

47:42.159 --> 47:46.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had this surge of optimism; a
new era of international
cooperation was at hand.

47:46.997 --> 47:52.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, you write in your book,
we're seeing
a declining sense of order.

47:52.135 --> 47:53.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Was that inevitable?

47:53.136 --> 47:54.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Turns out not.

47:54.972 --> 47:56.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Very little about history is
inevitable.

47:56.807 --> 48:00.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In part, though, we reflect, at
the end of
the Cold War, you had two
centers of power

48:00.510 --> 48:02.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
controlling things.

48:02.246 --> 48:06.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we have any numbers of
players on the
field, lots of capacity in lots
of hands.

48:06.550 --> 48:11.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States, to some
extent, has arguably
made things worse, both by
things we have

48:11.121 --> 48:17.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
done, the 2003 Iraq War,
possibly going into
Libya, and things we haven't
done, not responding

48:17.060 --> 48:21.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Syria's chemical weapons use
four years
ago, not following up the Libya
invasion.

48:21.398 --> 48:26.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you have globalization,
the fact
that so much is traveling, the
quantity and

48:26.637 --> 48:30.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the speed across borders, and
the world simply
hasn't caught up.

48:30.207 --> 48:31.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If anything, the gap is getting
larger.

48:31.842 --> 48:34.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, all this makes for a world
in disarray.

48:34.177 --> 48:35.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In disarray.

48:36.013 --> 48:39.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You write at one point in the
book, I think
close to the end, that -- and,
as you just

48:39.483 --> 48:43.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, action has consequences,
but so does
inaction.

48:43.153 --> 48:44.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you counsel against drift.

48:45.022 --> 48:51.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, with that in mind, I mean,
what could
President Trump do that's new
about the conflict

48:51.361 --> 48:52.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria?

48:52.896 --> 48:55.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Well, I think he
has to avoid
both too much and too little.

48:55.499 --> 48:57.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To simply wash our hands of it,
we have seen,
would be a mistake.

48:57.935 --> 48:59.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We saw the refugee flows into
Europe.

48:59.536 --> 49:01.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got all sorts of
terrorists.

49:01.305 --> 49:05.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, we're not
going to transform
Syria into a democracy anytime
soon.

49:06.009 --> 49:09.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not going to be able to
get rid of the
government of Bashar al-Assad
anytime soon.

49:09.613 --> 49:12.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what I would do is focus on
going after
ISIS.

49:12.716 --> 49:14.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to liberate some
territory.

49:14.484 --> 49:19.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's make sure we can, with
others, make
sure any liberated territory
remains safe,

49:19.556 --> 49:21.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so people can go back there.

49:21.058 --> 49:24.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We don't want to have a
situation where we
win the battle and lose the war.

49:24.494 --> 49:28.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we want to slowly begin a
diplomatic process,
work with the U.N., and even
with Russia,

49:28.799 --> 49:33.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
however strained that
relationship is, to
begin the process of saying, how
do we move

49:33.503 --> 49:37.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syria towards a government that
it can live
in peace with its own people?

49:37.374 --> 49:41.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: At the nub of a
lot of the
crises that are confronting this
new president,

49:41.878 --> 49:47.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let's take Syria, Ukraine, North
Korea, it
seems to me, what you really
have are tensions

49:48.018 --> 49:57.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between ourselves and two newly
assertive
powers, old powers, Russia and
China.

49:57.094 --> 50:04.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we moving to a tripolar
world, in which
these three countries will all
have client

50:04.601 --> 50:06.536 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states?

50:06.570 --> 50:08.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Or is it even messier than that?

50:08.372 --> 50:11.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: On one level,
it's messier
than that, because globalization
is a problem.

50:11.108 --> 50:14.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have medium states, the
Irans, the North
Koreas.

50:14.077 --> 50:15.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have groups like ISIS.

50:15.746 --> 50:18.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm actually, though, not that
worried about
what you suggest, Margaret.

50:18.181 --> 50:23.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think Russia is a
one-dimensional power,
largely military force,
obviously cyber too.

50:23.253 --> 50:25.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do things in the Middle
East and in Europe.

50:25.389 --> 50:26.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we can also push back.

50:26.857 --> 50:28.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can strengthen NATO.

50:28.692 --> 50:32.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Mr. Putin is not going
to use large
amounts of military force if he
realizes it's

50:32.963 --> 50:36.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going to be costly and
potentially unpopular
back at home.

50:36.666 --> 50:39.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China's not a revolutionary
power in many
ways like, say, Russia.

50:39.903 --> 50:42.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China's integrated in the region
and in the
world economically.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't much like the North
Koreans.

50:44.674 --> 50:47.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the real question is
what they're
prepared to do about it.

50:47.177 --> 50:51.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I actually think that China
could something
of a partner of the United
States.

50:51.314 --> 50:53.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, by the way, we should hope
so.

50:53.250 --> 50:57.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very different 21st
century if the
United States and China can work
together.

50:57.354 --> 51:02.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But, I mean,
every past president,
at least the last two, have been
talking about

51:02.359 --> 51:04.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting China to do more on
North Korea.

51:04.528 --> 51:07.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What leverage does the new
president have
that the others didn't?

51:07.998 --> 51:11.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Well, China
doesn't want to
see the United States use
military force there,

51:11.968 --> 51:17.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and no other president until
Donald Trump
faced a very stark reality,
that, on his watch,

51:17.340 --> 51:20.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China -- North Korea is going to
be able to
put nuclear weapons on missiles
that can reach

51:20.944 --> 51:25.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States, and threaten
the lives
of millions of Americans.

51:25.082 --> 51:30.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This now -- this thing has
drifted since the
presidency, what, of Bill
Clinton.

51:30.353 --> 51:32.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a very different
situation.

51:32.222 --> 51:36.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an urgency now, and
China has to know
that simply allowing things to
drift is no

51:36.460 --> 51:38.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
longer a viable option.

51:38.228 --> 51:41.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I don't know, Margaret, is
how much of
the leverage they deny they have
that you

51:41.765 --> 51:44.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I know they really have are
they prepared
to use.

51:44.668 --> 51:49.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Another place
in this book,
you make the comment that,
really, at the

51:49.039 --> 51:55.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
turn of the 20th to 21st
centuries -- quote
-- "The great powers were not so
great anymore."

51:55.378 --> 51:57.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you think Americans realize
that?

51:57.914 --> 52:02.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think this is something
that -- kind
of a new world order, or just
sort of that

52:02.886 --> 52:04.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we have to get used to?

52:04.654 --> 52:08.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: I'm not sure we
realize it,
but it's real, and in part
because there's

52:08.758 --> 52:10.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so many things going on out
there that we
can't control.

52:10.927 --> 52:15.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, also, look at what we have
done in things
like Iraq and Afghanistan, those
massive interventions,

52:15.665 --> 52:18.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and even those two places, we
couldn't control.

52:18.335 --> 52:21.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, there ought to be a bit of
humility.

52:21.104 --> 52:24.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think you have also put
your finger
on a big, big issue, which is,
what is the

52:24.274 --> 52:26.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship the United States
and the world?

52:26.676 --> 52:27.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can't control things.

52:27.911 --> 52:30.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're still the single most
important country.

52:30.213 --> 52:35.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we do and don't do, what --
how we define
success in the world, more than
anything else,

52:35.385 --> 52:39.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will make a difference, because
we know the
world left to its own devices
doesn't sort

52:39.523 --> 52:41.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
itself out.

52:41.424 --> 52:45.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Do you think
the American
public, though, is ready to
continue shouldering

52:45.061 --> 52:46.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that responsibility?

52:46.496 --> 52:47.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: I'm concerned
that we're not.

52:47.998 --> 52:51.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there's a degree of
fatigue after
Iraq and after Afghanistan.

52:51.768 --> 52:55.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think there's some
misunderstanding about
how much it costs for us.

52:55.872 --> 52:59.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at the inaugural
speech, the president
talked about it.

52:59.342 --> 53:03.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we're spending on
defense is only
a fraction of what we spent
during the Cold

53:03.413 --> 53:04.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War.

53:04.414 --> 53:06.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can have our cake and eat it.

53:06.116 --> 53:08.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can have the guns we need, we
can have
the butter, we can have the
domestic policy

53:08.652 --> 53:10.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we need.

53:10.453 --> 53:13.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got to understand that
what we do
in the world is not only good
for the world;

53:13.557 --> 53:14.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it's good for us.

53:14.958 --> 53:17.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a form of philanthropy;
it's a form
of national security.

53:17.227 --> 53:19.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And that's a
case any president
has to make.

53:19.362 --> 53:20.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Has to make.

53:20.463 --> 53:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Richard Haass,
thank you
so much.

53:23.266 --> 53:31.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD HAASS: Thank you.

53:31.441 --> 53:40.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now, read an appreciation of a
Danish writer

53:40.283 --> 53:44.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whose poems celebrate the beauty
of farming
