WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We return
now to North Korea and
its recent missile launch.

00:04.033 --> 00:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the United States called
for a closed-door United Nations
Security Council meeting to

00:08.000 --> 00:10.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
address the threat.

00:10.000 --> 00:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what exactly are the Trump
administration's options,
and how might it respond?

00:13.333 --> 00:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For that, we turn to
Ambassador Christopher Hill.

00:16.566 --> 00:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the chief U.S. negotiator
with North Korea from 2005
until 2009, and served as

00:22.533 --> 00:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. ambassador to South Korea.

00:24.833 --> 00:27.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And by Mark Bowden.

00:27.166 --> 00:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a national correspondent
for "The Atlantic"
magazine, and he recently
wrote a comprehensive

00:30.233 --> 00:33.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cover story titled "Can
North Korea Be Stopped?"

00:33.866 --> 00:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

00:36.333 --> 00:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ambassador Hill, I would
like to start with you first.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Can you just give me
your initial reaction to
this most recent launch?

00:41.633 --> 00:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HILL, Former U.S.
Ambassador to Iraq: I think
it's a very serious matter.

00:44.566 --> 00:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's pretty clear they have made
progress on intercontinental
ballistic missiles.

00:51.566 --> 00:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From what I can understand,
if you sent it at a different
pitch, it could actually exceed

00:56.700 --> 00:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 5,000 miles that qualifies
it as an intercontinental
ballistic missile.

00:59.933 --> 01:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it's a pretty serious matter.

01:02.133 --> 01:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we also understand they made
progress on miniaturization,
so it's not farfetched

01:06.900 --> 01:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to assume that in the next two
or three years, they will have
a deliverable nuclear weapon

01:11.533 --> 01:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aimed at the United States.

01:13.666 --> 01:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the real question is, how is
the president going to explain
that to the American people?

01:18.500 --> 01:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, perhaps more immediately,
what is he going to do about it?

01:21.833 --> 01:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mark
Bowden, just as Ambassador
Hill is saying, President
Trump has said he

01:28.733 --> 01:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will not allow a nuclear-armed
missile to be able to be
developed in North Korea.

01:31.800 --> 01:35.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But this certainly
seems like a very large
step in that direction.

01:35.600 --> 01:38.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK BOWDEN, "The
Atlantic": It does.

01:38.066 --> 01:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in addition to shrinking
a nuclear weapon to go on top
of a missile like that, they

01:45.133 --> 01:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already have chemical and
biological weapons that are
capable of mass casualties.

01:50.433 --> 01:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this is a really
serious development.

01:53.033 --> 01:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's easy to say you're
going to stop them from doing
it, but it's not a very easy

01:57.933 --> 02:00.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thing to accomplish.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ambassador,
I wonder if you could give
me a sense of, what is your

02:02.633 --> 02:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understanding of what Kim
Jong-un actually wants
with this nuclear program?

02:09.066 --> 02:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HILL: Well, you
know, opinions differ on this.

02:11.333 --> 02:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are some who believe this
is a poor, beleaguered country
surrounded by larger hostile

02:18.400 --> 02:23.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states who want to do it harm,
and so why not allow the North
Koreans to defend themselves?

02:25.066 --> 02:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it's actually
a much more aggressive
purpose they have in mind.

02:27.900 --> 02:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what they're hoping is
that to hold American civilians
at risk, that is, to have

02:34.900 --> 02:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a deliverable nuclear weapon
that is deliverable to the U.S.
mainland, they can convince the

02:39.966 --> 02:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States not to exercise
their responsibilities in
the treaty with South Korea.

02:45.900 --> 02:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think being North Korean
is to believe that, somehow,
if they can get the U.S. out

02:49.200 --> 02:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the equation, they
could reunite the peninsula
on their own terms.

02:53.366 --> 02:58.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is -- seems farfetched,
but to be a North Korean is not
necessarily to believe in the

02:59.133 --> 03:01.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conventional wisdom.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are a lot of North
Koreans who feel there is a lot
of pro-North Korean sentiment

03:03.433 --> 03:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in South Korea, and if only
they could get the U.S. out
of the equation, they could do

03:07.400 --> 03:09.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

03:09.433 --> 03:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think it's is a very
serious moment and, frankly,
a very dangerous moment.

03:11.600 --> 03:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mark Bowden,
what do you make of that?

03:13.566 --> 03:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this really primarily a
development of an offensive
weapon for the potential keeping

03:19.966 --> 03:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. and others at bay
while it retakes South Korea?

03:24.333 --> 03:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK BOWDEN: I do think -- and
I agree with Ambassador Hill
that is the primary reason

03:31.333 --> 03:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for having this weapon, but it
also gives North Korea a lot
more leverage in that region

03:37.833 --> 03:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and certainly in dealing
with South Korea.

03:40.900 --> 03:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's conceivable, given the
overtures that the new South
Korean president has made to

03:47.866 --> 03:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reopen negotiations with North
Korea, that he could -- Kim
Jong-un could use the possession

03:53.433 --> 03:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a weapon like this to
pressure that those negotiations
take place without the United

03:57.333 --> 03:59.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

03:59.433 --> 04:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think his goal may well
be to get the United States
to withdraw from the Korean

04:03.600 --> 04:05.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Peninsula.

04:05.633 --> 04:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ambassador
Hill, help me understand this
a little bit more, though,

04:07.633 --> 04:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because we are always told
that, while this regime may be
a despotic regime, that they're

04:12.000 --> 04:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not out of their minds,
they're not irrational actors.

04:15.533 --> 04:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea that somehow
the U.S. would allow them
to invade South Korea
just seems unbelievably

04:22.033 --> 04:24.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
farfetched.

04:24.100 --> 04:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HILL: Well, I
mean, if you look at the kind
of weaponry, which tends to be

04:27.933 --> 04:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very offensive, tends
to be right up there
in the front, when you
look at, as Mark pointed

04:34.800 --> 04:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, their capacities in
chemical weapons and biological
weapons, if you look at the

04:39.033 --> 04:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that they have some
14,000 artillery tubes right
up there in the front pointing

04:46.500 --> 04:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right at the South Korean
civilian populations,
it looks to be a kind
of offensively minded

04:50.933 --> 04:53.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

04:53.033 --> 04:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, for a long time,
they have been dedicated to
the proposition that they have

04:56.000 --> 05:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to kind of decouple the U.S.
from the Korean Peninsula and
then a lot of things will fall

05:00.800 --> 05:02.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their way.

05:02.833 --> 05:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mark Bowden,
your piece in "The Atlantic"
laid out what you describe

05:06.033 --> 05:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the four main options for the
Trump administration to respond.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you imply obviously that
these are largely bad options.

05:13.566 --> 05:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you sort of explain
what suite of options that
the administration has?

05:17.266 --> 05:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK BOWDEN: Well, the obvious
one, people Always bring this
up whenever I'm interviewed

05:21.500 --> 05:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the subject, is that,
well, why don't we just attack
North Korea and take out their

05:25.900 --> 05:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
military and
eliminate the threat?

05:28.666 --> 05:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's certainly doable, but
the consequences of that would
be horrific, as the ambassador

05:35.333 --> 05:37.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just pointed out.

05:37.366 --> 05:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the conventional weapons
that North Korea has could level
Seoul, a city of 26 million

05:43.433 --> 05:45.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you add, you know,
chemical weapons and biological
weapons and potentially nuclear

05:48.100 --> 05:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weapons, you have possibly
one of the greatest
catastrophes in human history.

05:55.133 --> 05:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other possibility is to
sort of turn up the screws, a
series of small-scale military

06:00.200 --> 06:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks that would kind of ramp
up the pressure on North Korea,
something that could rapidly

06:06.333 --> 06:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
descend into an
all-out conflict.

06:08.700 --> 06:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another possibility is to target
Kim Jong-un himself and try
and eliminate him and replace

06:14.866 --> 06:16.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

06:16.900 --> 06:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the last bad option
is just to accept the fact that
we can't stop North Korea from

06:21.600 --> 06:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
building these weapons.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, deterrents
are -- you know, in
this case, it would just
be assured destruction

06:29.000 --> 06:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - we can hope might
prevent them from using them.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ambassador,
last question to you.

06:33.500 --> 06:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president seemed to imply
in his tweet that it's really
upon China to handle this

06:38.433 --> 06:40.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situation.

06:40.433 --> 06:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have had now three
administrations that have tried
to persuade China to act with

06:43.900 --> 06:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regards to North Korea.

06:45.633 --> 06:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why hasn't that happened yet?

06:47.133 --> 06:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HILL: Well, I
think the Chinese are split.

06:49.866 --> 06:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there's some Chinese
who feel that the demise of
North Korea would be perceived

06:54.300 --> 06:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their country -- that is,
in China -- as a victory for
America and a defeat for China.

07:01.266 --> 07:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they worry about the
perception of that within China,
that is, it's a domestic issue

07:05.033 --> 07:07.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
within China.

07:07.100 --> 07:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there are a lot of people
who want to go with reforms
much faster than Xi Jinping

07:11.166 --> 07:13.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
does.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if North Korea were to
go away, perhaps those people
would be in the ascendancy.

07:15.266 --> 07:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, a lot of party
types, security types in
China don't like to see
something that results

07:21.500 --> 07:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in something that looks
like a U.S. victory.

07:24.266 --> 07:28.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That said, I think those
three administrations
are absolutely correct.

07:28.733 --> 07:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need to work more with China.

07:30.700 --> 07:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the problem is President
Trump has more of an outsourcing
notion, that, somehow,

07:35.100 --> 07:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
OK, over to you, China,
you sort this out.

07:37.966 --> 07:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will support you, and, by
the way, we will stop calling
you a currency manipulator and

07:42.500 --> 07:44.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the other bad things
that you don't like.

07:44.533 --> 07:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, China is not going to
be able to do this alone.

07:47.433 --> 07:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would keep the door open
for negotiation, not that the
North Koreans have shown any

07:51.433 --> 07:53.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interest in negotiation.

07:53.500 --> 07:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But having done it for a number
of years, I think it was the
right way to keep our relations

07:57.533 --> 08:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Japan and South
Korea together, and having
taken a lot of criticism
from people who thought,

08:03.833 --> 08:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how can you think negotiation
is the right answer?

08:06.266 --> 08:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has to be a factor in it
if you're going to keep others
together with you on the issue.

08:13.333 --> 08:16.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All
right, Former Ambassador
Christopher Hill, Mark
Bowden of "The Atlantic"

08:16.566 --> 08:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
