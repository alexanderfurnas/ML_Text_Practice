02:22.009 --> 02:23.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS THIS SOMETHING ALREADY

TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDERS?

02:28.382 --> 02:29.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> EVERYTHING ICE IS SAYING

02:29.950 --> 02:31.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW IS THAT THIS WAS

02:31.251 --> 02:33.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABSOLUTELY A ROUTINE OPERATION

02:33.520 --> 02:35.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY HAD ACTUALLY STARTED

02:35.489 --> 02:36.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLANNING BEFORE PRESIDENT TRUMP

02:36.957 --> 02:38.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNED HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ON

02:38.458 --> 02:41.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANUARY 25 THAT REALLY WAS

02:41.028 --> 02:41.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESIGNED TO RAMP UP

02:41.895 --> 02:43.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTATIONS.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I CAN TELL YOU THE OBAMA

02:44.564 --> 02:45.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION DID TWO OR THREE

02:45.732 --> 02:46.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THESE A YEAR.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND THIS TIME LAST YEAR, THE

02:48.735 --> 02:51.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION LED A RAID

02:51.271 --> 02:53.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAINST WOMEN AND CHILDREN THAT

02:53.707 --> 02:54.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE COMING FROM CENTRAL

02:54.541 --> 02:55.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICA.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS A VERY CONTROVERSIAL

02:57.077 --> 02:58.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPERATION AT THE TIME.

02:58.245 --> 02:59.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT KIND OF SHOWS THAT THIS

02:59.813 --> 03:01.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS PART OF THEIR PRACTICE.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DO THIS TWO OR THREE TIMES

03:02.516 --> 03:03.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A YEAR.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ACCORDING TO ICE THIS IS

03:04.484 --> 03:06.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN WEEKS IN

03:06.386 --> 03:08.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PLANNING AND HAD NOTHING TO

03:08.155 --> 03:09.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO AND WAS NOT COMING FROM ANY

03:09.556 --> 03:10.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WIDER NET CAST BECAUSE OF WHAT

03:14.528 --> 03:15.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS INTERESTED

03:15.462 --> 03:17.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN?

03:17.097 --> 03:17.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN WE HEAR THAT FEAR, WHEN WE

03:19.533 --> 03:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEAR THAT PANIC FROM THE

03:20.467 --> 03:21.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY, THIS IS

03:21.635 --> 03:22.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF WHAT THEY WERE WAITING

03:22.803 --> 03:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR.

03:23.970 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, HE SET

03:28.942 --> 03:30.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE GOING TO TARGET FOR

03:30.177 --> 03:31.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTATION.

03:31.044 --> 03:32.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS WITH

CRIMINAL RECORDS, WITH GANG TIES

03:34.214 --> 03:35.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO POSE A THREAT TO

03:35.248 --> 03:36.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL SECURITY, AND THOSE WHO

03:36.983 --> 03:38.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD RECENTLY CROSSED THE BORDER.

03:38.852 --> 03:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP DID WHEN HE

03:40.153 --> 03:41.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNED HIS EXECUTIVE ORDER ON

03:41.288 --> 03:43.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANUARY 25 WAS VASTLY EXPAND

03:43.623 --> 03:44.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT POOL.

03:44.424 --> 03:46.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO NOW IT'S PEOPLE WITH ANY KIND

03:46.359 --> 03:47.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF CRIMINAL RECORD, PEOPLE WHO

03:47.928 --> 03:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH CRIMES

03:49.896 --> 03:51.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD BE DEEMED DEPORTABLE,

03:51.765 --> 03:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED PUBLIC

03:54.367 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELFARE FRAUD, PEOPLE WHO HAVE

03:57.037 --> 03:58.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE FALSE REPRESENTATIONS TO

03:58.338 --> 03:59.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GOVERNMENT-- IN OTHER WORDS,

03:59.506 --> 04:01.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SECURITY NUMBER TO GET A JOB.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WHEN YOU START ADDING ALL

04:04.945 --> 04:05.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT UP, I MEAN, I'VE SEEN

04:05.979 --> 04:07.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:07.981 --> 04:09.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILLION TO NINE MILLION

04:09.082 --> 04:10.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ARE

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

04:12.853 --> 04:13.920 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:14.654 --> 04:15.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING AFTER.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND IT'S

04:16.123 --> 04:17.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PRESIDENT

04:17.224 --> 04:20.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBAMA, WHO LEFT OFFICE WITH THE

04:20.627 --> 04:22.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TITLE "DEPORTER IN CHIEF," I

04:22.229 --> 04:23.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEAN THIS IS A FAIRLY WELL-OILED

04:23.763 --> 04:25.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTATION MACHINE THAT'S

04:25.132 --> 04:27.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY ON THE BOOKS.

04:27.334 --> 04:28.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARLY IN HIS ADMINISTRATION, HE

04:29.202 --> 04:30.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE THE POINT VERY CLEAR THAT

04:30.504 --> 04:31.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS GOING TO ENFORCE

04:31.738 --> 04:32.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRATION.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.407 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE TIME, HE WAS DOING THAT

04:34.407 --> 04:36.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SORT OF CONVINCE REPUBLICANS

04:36.243 --> 04:37.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN CONGRESS TO GO ALONG WITH

04:37.577 --> 04:39.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM ON AN IMMIGRATION REFORM

04:39.246 --> 04:40.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PACKAGE.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.715 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK FOR HIM IN

04:41.715 --> 04:42.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EITHER DIRECTION.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS BASHED BY REPUBLICANS AND

04:45.552 --> 04:46.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY... SAYING THAT HE DIDN'T DO

04:46.820 --> 04:47.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENOUGH ON IMMIGRATION

04:47.821 --> 04:48.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENFORCEMENT.

04:48.722 --> 04:49.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS BASHED BY IMMIGRATION

04:49.723 --> 04:51.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADVOCATES WHO SAID THAT HE WAS

04:51.057 --> 04:51.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING TOO MUCH.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS YOU MENTIONED, THEY

04:53.393 --> 04:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LABELED HIM THE "DEPORTER IN

04:54.327 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHIEF."

04:55.128 --> 04:56.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN REALITY WHAT HAPPENED WAS HE

04:56.763 --> 04:58.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID-- FOR A TIME HE WAS SETTING

04:58.398 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARLY RECORDS FOR THE NUMBER OF

04:59.533 --> 05:00.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO WERE DEPORTED FROM

05:00.567 --> 05:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY, AT ONE POINT

05:01.501 --> 05:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REACHING 400,000 PEOPLE.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN THE LAST FEW YEARS,

05:04.804 --> 05:06.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE NUMBERS REALLY PLUMMETED.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

05:08.208 --> 05:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO BRING THAT BACK UP.

05:10.610 --> 05:11.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS ALSO

05:11.545 --> 05:13.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THE BULK OF ENFORCEMENT

05:13.046 --> 05:13.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPENDING GOES.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I READ THAT BASICALLY WE SPEND

05:16.116 --> 05:18.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE ON DEPORTATIONS AND ICE

05:18.151 --> 05:20.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENFORCEMENT THAN ON THE F.B.I.,

05:20.053 --> 05:21.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE A.T.F., THE SECRET SERVICE

05:21.288 --> 05:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL COMBINED.

05:22.556 --> 05:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT DEALS WITH THE

05:23.356 --> 05:24.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE

05:24.925 --> 05:27.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEDICATE TO BORDER PATROL AND TO

05:27.694 --> 05:28.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:28.595 --> 05:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND, ONLY A SMALL

FRACTION OF PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR

05:31.665 --> 05:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:32.899 --> 05:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGENTS THAT WORK AT ICE-- AND

05:34.367 --> 05:36.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY ABOUT 7%-8% OF THEM ARE

05:36.036 --> 05:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COUNTRY.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT YEAH, IT'S AN INCREDIBLY

05:42.642 --> 05:44.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGE APPARATUS, BUT IT'S

05:44.077 --> 05:45.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP,

05:45.412 --> 05:47.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM CONGRESS,

05:47.147 --> 05:49.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN INCREASE DRAMATICALLY.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE CAN RETASK A LOT OF PEOPLE

05:51.551 --> 05:52.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO WORK FOR IMMIGRATION AND

05:52.719 --> 05:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT, HE CAN

05:54.020 --> 05:56.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFOCUS ALL THOSE FOLKS ON GOING

05:56.156 --> 05:57.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS.

05:59.025 --> 05:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO EVEN THOUGH THE APPARATUS

05:59.893 --> 06:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY IS LARGE, IT CAN

06:01.561 --> 06:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABSOLUTELY BE INCREASED

06:02.862 --> 06:04.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:45.912 --> 15:48.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IT'S INCREDIBLE INTENSIVE.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY OWN PERSONAL VIEW-- AND I

15:49.282 --> 15:51.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK OUR GOVERNOR, AS WELL-- IS

15:51.184 --> 15:52.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

15:52.718 --> 15:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFICIAL FOR US TO BE USING

15:54.987 --> 15:56.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE TAX DOLLARS, WHICH IS WHAT

15:56.989 --> 15:58.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

16:01.928 --> 16:03.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT NECESSARILY BENEFICIAL

16:03.329 --> 16:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR US TO BE LURING COMPANIES

16:05.565 --> 16:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

16:06.132 --> 16:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

16:08.234 --> 16:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROWING THE COMPANIES THAT ARE

16:27.553 --> 16:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CONNECTICUT COULD HAVE DONE MORE

16:45.938 --> 16:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO PREVENT G.E. FROM LEAVING?

16:48.074 --> 16:49.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

16:51.143 --> 16:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH THEY

ROAD TO MAKE A CHANGE.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THAT DECISION ACTUALLY

16:59.285 --> 17:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS MADE LONG BEFORE WE GOT INTO

17:02.321 --> 17:03.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:03.756 --> 17:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY THE TIME WE GOT A CHANCE TO

17:06.626 --> 17:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD ALREADY BEEN CAST.

WAS... THEY BOUGHT VOTES.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE WAS SEEN AS THE

REFUGEE CAMP THAT'S IN KENYA

20:12.645 --> 20:14.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAS AN ENORMOUS SOMALI

POPULATION.

20:15.347 --> 20:16.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WERE JUST THERE.

20:16.115 --> 20:16.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S

20:16.849 --> 20:17.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGEST, IF NOT THE LARGEST

20:17.883 --> 20:19.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFUGEE CAMP.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, IT'S HUGE, AND IT WAS

20:20.786 --> 20:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPOSED TO BE CLOSED BY THE

20:22.655 --> 20:24.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENYAN GOVERNMENT IN MAY AND A

20:24.256 --> 20:27.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURT HERE SAID THAT IT SHOULD

20:27.193 --> 20:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT BE CLOSED.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMALIS THERE HAD TWO REASONS TO

20:29.762 --> 20:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CELEBRATE, AND, IN FACT, THEY

20:30.996 --> 20:32.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENT OUT TO THE STREETS TO

20:32.731 --> 20:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CELEBRATE-- ONE, THAT THE CAMP

20:34.066 --> 20:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS NOT CLOSING; TWO, THAT

20:35.901 --> 20:37.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOHAMED FARMAJO HAD BEEN

20:37.336 --> 20:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTED.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MOHAMED FARMAJO WAS THE

20:40.673 --> 20:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAVORITE AND PEOPLE HAVE HOPE

20:44.043 --> 20:46.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE MIGHT BRING CHANGE TO

20:46.245 --> 20:46.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMALIA.

20:46.979 --> 20:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT THE

20:48.814 --> 20:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTIVE ORDER AND

20:50.249 --> 20:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPERCUSSIONS BACK AND FORTH

20:51.617 --> 20:52.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN SOMALIS WERE PERHAPS ON

20:52.985 --> 20:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR WAY TO THE UNITED STATES

20:54.353 --> 20:55.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN STOPPED AND THEN

20:55.287 --> 20:56.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTED AGAIN.

20:56.188 --> 20:56.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HAS THAT DONE TO THE

20:56.822 --> 20:58.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY?

20:58.657 --> 21:00.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHEN I WAS DOWN THERE, PEOPLE

21:00.493 --> 21:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FELT REALLY ABANDONED.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FELT ABANDONED BY THE

21:03.028 --> 21:03.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES.

21:03.729 --> 21:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FELT ABANDONED BY THE

21:04.864 --> 21:05.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KENYANS.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ABOUT 200 OF THE REFUGEES

21:08.868 --> 21:11.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAD BEEN FLOWN TO NAIROBI,

21:11.971 --> 21:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAITING FLIGHTS TO THE UNITED

21:13.339 --> 21:14.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY WERE CANCELED.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THE IMPORTANT THING

21:17.276 --> 21:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO REMEMBER IS THAT THESE ARE

21:18.944 --> 21:22.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFUGEES WHO HAVE BEEN THERE

21:22.348 --> 21:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINCE THE '90s AND HAVE BEEN

21:25.351 --> 21:26.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAITING FOR RESETTLEMENT TO THE

21:26.819 --> 21:29.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:29.021 --> 21:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO NINE YEARS.

21:30.723 --> 21:31.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THIS WAS REALLY

21:31.690 --> 21:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARTBREAKING FOR THEM.

21:33.292 --> 21:35.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEN THIS DECISION FROM THE

21:35.694 --> 21:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
9th CIRCUIT CAME DOWN, AND I

21:38.330 --> 21:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS JUST AT THE TRANSIT CENTER

21:40.099 --> 21:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE IN NAIROBI A COUPLE OF DAYS

21:42.434 --> 21:44.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TO THE CAMPS TO AWAIT FLIGHTS

21:52.611 --> 21:54.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
