WE DON'T CARE WHETHER THE
COMMANDERS ARE IN IT OR NOT.

45:36.874 --> 45:39.073
WE DON'T CARE WHETHER THE
COMMANDERS ARE IN IT OR NOT.
THE IMPORTANT ISSUE IS HOW CAN

45:39.075 --> 45:41.107
COMMANDERS ARE IN IT OR NOT.
THE IMPORTANT ISSUE IS HOW CAN
WE PROTECT VICTIMS AND GET MORE

45:41.110 --> 45:41.741
THE IMPORTANT ISSUE IS HOW CAN
WE PROTECT VICTIMS AND GET MORE
SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTIONS.

45:41.744 --> 45:44.510

SENATOR GILLIBRAND SAID WHEN SHE
TALKED TO THE NEWSHOUR THAT THIS

45:46.980 --> 45:48.547
SENATOR GILLIBRAND SAID WHEN SHE
TALKED TO THE NEWSHOUR THAT THIS
IS WHAT VICTIMS HAVE ASKED FOR,

45:48.549 --> 45:49.780
TALKED TO THE NEWSHOUR THAT THIS
IS WHAT VICTIMS HAVE ASKED FOR,
HER APPROAC, WHHICH IS TO TAKE

45:49.781 --> 45:51.149
IS WHAT VICTIMS HAVE ASKED FOR,

IT OUT OF THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.

45:51.151 --> 45:52.648
HER APPROAC, WHHICH IS TO TAKE

HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?

45:52.650 --> 45:54.083
IT OUT OF THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?
WHAT HAVE VICTIMS TOLD YOU?

45:54.086 --> 45:56.051
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?
WHAT HAVE VICTIMS TOLD YOU?
>> WELL, CERTAINLY VICTIMS HAVE

45:56.053 --> 45:57.520
WHAT HAVE VICTIMS TOLD YOU?
>> WELL, CERTAINLY VICTIMS HAVE
VARYING VIEWS ON THIS ISSUE AND

45:57.522 --> 45:59.554
>> WELL, CERTAINLY VICTIMS HAVE
VARYING VIEWS ON THIS ISSUE AND
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE

VARYING VIEWS ON THIS ISSUE AND
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE
THAT WE -- MAKE SURE VICTIMS ARE

46:01.758 --> 46:02.522
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE
THAT WE -- MAKE SURE VICTIMS ARE
PROTECTED.

46:02.525 --> 46:04.825
THAT WE -- MAKE SURE VICTIMS ARE
PROTECTED.
THAT'S WHY WE MADE RETALIATION

46:04.826 --> 46:07.293
PROTECTED.
THAT'S WHY WE MADE RETALIATION
UNDER A CRIME UNDER THE U.C.M.J.

46:07.295 --> 46:09.060
THAT'S WHY WE MADE RETALIATION
UNDER A CRIME UNDER THE U.C.M.J.
BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THE CHAIN

46:09.062 --> 46:10.529
UNDER A CRIME UNDER THE U.C.M.J.
BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THE CHAIN
OF COMMAND AND COMMANDERS TAKE

46:10.531 --> 46:11.795
BUT ALSO TO MAKE SURE THE CHAIN
OF COMMAND AND COMMANDERS TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY AND AREN'T LET

46:11.797 --> 46:13.664
OF COMMAND AND COMMANDERS TAKE
RESPONSIBILITY AND AREN'T LET
OFF THE HOOK FOR CREATING THE

RESPONSIBILITY AND AREN'T LET
OFF THE HOOK FOR CREATING THE
BEST SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR

OFF THE HOOK FOR CREATING THE
BEST SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR
VICTIMS.

46:15.699 --> 46:17.567
BEST SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR
VICTIMS.
AND THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT THIS

46:17.569 --> 46:18.067
VICTIMS.
AND THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT THIS
APPROACH.

46:18.069 --> 46:20.334
AND THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT THIS
APPROACH.
AND, IN FACT, WHAT WE FOUND IS

46:20.336 --> 46:21.802
APPROACH.
AND, IN FACT, WHAT WE FOUND IS
THAT IF YOU COMPARED THE AMOUNT

46:21.804 --> 46:23.170
AND, IN FACT, WHAT WE FOUND IS
THAT IF YOU COMPARED THE AMOUNT
OF PROSECUTIONS BROUGHT BY

46:23.173 --> 46:24.871
THAT IF YOU COMPARED THE AMOUNT
OF PROSECUTIONS BROUGHT BY
COMMANDERS, THEY'VE ACTUALLY

46:24.873 --> 46:26.205
OF PROSECUTIONS BROUGHT BY
COMMANDERS, THEY'VE ACTUALLY
BROUGHT MORE PROSECUTIONS THAN

BROUGHT MORE PROSECUTIONS THAN
IF YOU JUST LEFT IT WITH THE JAG

SO I'M WORRIED FOR VICTIMS THAT

46:30.711 --> 46:31.942
LAWYERS.
SO I'M WORRIED FOR VICTIMS THAT
LESS CASES WILL BE PROSECUTED IF

SO I'M WORRIED FOR VICTIMS THAT
LESS CASES WILL BE PROSECUTED IF
WE TAKE IT OUT OF THE CHAIN OF

SO TO ME AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR,
IF WE PROSECUTE LESS CASES THEN

46:37.115 --> 46:38.980
SO TO ME AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR,
IF WE PROSECUTE LESS CASES THEN
IT'S GOING TO PUT VICTIMS IN A

46:38.982 --> 46:43.885
IF WE PROSECUTE LESS CASES THEN
IT'S GOING TO PUT VICTIMS IN A
VERY DIFFICULT POSITION.

46:43.887 --> 46:46.120
IT'S GOING TO PUT VICTIMS IN A
VERY DIFFICULT POSITION.

WHAT IS IT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY

46:55.294 --> 46:58.094
SENATOR McCASKELL.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY
THAT MAKES YOUR APPROACH BETTER?

46:58.096 --> 46:59.429
WHAT IS IT ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY
THAT MAKES YOUR APPROACH BETTER?
IF ALL THESE YEARS THESE

IF ALL THESE YEARS THESE
PROBLEMS HAVE PERSISTED, WHAT
ABOUT YOUR APPROACH WOULD CHANGE

47:02.098 --> 47:03.098

ABOUT YOUR APPROACH WOULD CHANGE
THE ACCOUNTABILITY?

47:03.100 --> 47:05.300
ABOUT YOUR APPROACH WOULD CHANGE
THE ACCOUNTABILITY?

47:05.302 --> 47:06.767
THE ACCOUNTABILITY?
>> WELL, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
IMAGINE YOU'RE A VICTIM AND

47:06.769 --> 47:08.701
>> WELL, HERE'S THE PROBLEM.
IMAGINE YOU'RE A VICTIM AND
YOU'RE GOING BACK INTO YOUR UNIT

47:08.703 --> 47:11.070
IMAGINE YOU'RE A VICTIM AND
YOU'RE GOING BACK INTO YOUR UNIT
AND THERE ARE LAWYERS 200 MILES

IN WHICH ENVIRONMENT DO YOU

47:18.244 --> 47:19.343
CASE GOES FORWARD.
IN WHICH ENVIRONMENT DO YOU
THINK THE VICTIM HAS MORE

47:19.345 --> 47:20.677
IN WHICH ENVIRONMENT DO YOU
THINK THE VICTIM HAS MORE
PROTECTION FROM RETALIATION?

47:20.679 --> 47:23.079
THINK THE VICTIM HAS MORE
PROTECTION FROM RETALIATION?
I THINK IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS: SHE

47:23.081 --> 47:24.546
PROTECTION FROM RETALIATION?
I THINK IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS: SHE
GETS MORE PROTECTION FROM

47:24.548 --> 47:25.981
I THINK IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS: SHE
GETS MORE PROTECTION FROM
RETALIATION IF THE COMMANDER IS

47:25.983 --> 47:26.548
GETS MORE PROTECTION FROM
RETALIATION IF THE COMMANDER IS
SIGNED OFF.

47:26.550 --> 47:27.715
RETALIATION IF THE COMMANDER IS
SIGNED OFF.
AND THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE

THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING

THEY HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO BRING

PROSECUTIONS WHEN THE
PROSECUTORS HAVE RECOMMENDED IT.

47:37.190 --> 47:38.556
PROSECUTIONS WHEN THE

JUST THE OPPOSITE IS, IN FACT,

47:38.558 --> 47:41.358
PROSECUTORS HAVE RECOMMENDED IT.
JUST THE OPPOSITE IS, IN FACT,
TRUE, AS KELLY SAID, MANY TIMES

JUST THE OPPOSITE IS, IN FACT,

NOT A WINNER.

47:47.430 --> 47:48.897
ONE-LOSS RECORD SAY THIS CASE IS

INSISTED, NO, LET'S GET TO THE
BOTTOM OF IT.

47:51.467 --> 47:53.566
INSISTED, NO, LET'S GET TO THE

BOTTOM OF IT.
SO YES THE COMMANDERS NEED TO
KEEP OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF

47:55.803 --> 47:56.467
SO YES THE COMMANDERS NEED TO
KEEP OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF
OVERTURNING JURIES.

47:56.469 --> 47:57.902
KEEP OUT OF THE BUSINESS OF
OVERTURNING JURIES.
YES WE NEED TO CHANGE THE RULES

47:57.905 --> 48:00.805
OVERTURNING JURIES.
YES WE NEED TO CHANGE THE RULES
SO VICTIETORS, LEGAL HELP,

48:00.807 --> 48:02.406
YES WE NEED TO CHANGE THE RULES
SO VICTIETORS, LEGAL HELP,
THEY'RE IN CONTROL OF WHERE THEY

48:02.408 --> 48:03.706
SO VICTIETORS, LEGAL HELP,
THEY'RE IN CONTROL OF WHERE THEY
GO, WHETHER THEY COME BACK TO

WHETHER THE PERPETRATOR GETS
SHIPPED OUT AND ANOTHER
IMPORTANT REFORM, GWEN, IS THAT

48:10.914 --> 48:12.511
SHIPPED OUT AND ANOTHER
IMPORTANT REFORM, GWEN, IS THAT
WE'RE GOING TYKE-TO-TAKE OUT OF

48:12.514 --> 48:14.480
IMPORTANT REFORM, GWEN, IS THAT
WE'RE GOING TYKE-TO-TAKE OUT OF
THE EQUATION HOW GOOD A SOLDIER

48:14.482 --> 48:15.082
WE'RE GOING TYKE-TO-TAKE OUT OF
THE EQUATION HOW GOOD A SOLDIER
SOMEONE HAS BEEN.

48:15.083 --> 48:16.282
THE EQUATION HOW GOOD A SOLDIER
SOMEONE HAS BEEN.
THAT MIGHT BE RELEVANT TO

WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GUILTY OF
A CRIME.

48:19.319 --> 48:22.019
WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GUILTY OF
A CRIME.
SO WE HAVE REALLY DONE HISTORIC

48:22.021 --> 48:23.754
A CRIME.
SO WE HAVE REALLY DONE HISTORIC
REFORMS HERE AND THE COUNTRIES

48:23.756 --> 48:25.855
SO WE HAVE REALLY DONE HISTORIC
REFORMS HERE AND THE COUNTRIES
THAT HAVE CHANGED THEIR SYSTEMS,

48:25.857 --> 48:27.156

THAT HAVE CHANGED THEIR SYSTEMS,
THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN INCREASE

THAT HAVE CHANGED THEIR SYSTEMS,
THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN INCREASE
IN REPORTING.

48:29.193 --> 48:31.826
THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN INCREASE
IN REPORTING.
SO EVEN THAT PREMISE THAT

IN REPORTING.
SO EVEN THAT PREMISE THAT
THEY'RE BASING THIS ON THAT

48:32.595 --> 48:33.793

MADE AS A RESULT OF -- TO
PROTECT DEFENDANTS NOT TO
SUPPORT VICTIMS.

48:46.604 --> 48:48.404
PROTECT DEFENDANTS NOT TO
SUPPORT VICTIMS.
SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO

48:48.406 --> 48:49.971
SUPPORT VICTIMS.
SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE HAVE A

48:49.974 --> 48:51.372
SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE HAVE A
DIFFERENCE WITH OUR ALLIES, THAT

48:51.374 --> 48:53.173
UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE HAVE A
DIFFERENCE WITH OUR ALLIES, THAT
WAS ACTUALLY DONE BECAUSE

48:53.176 --> 48:54.842
DIFFERENCE WITH OUR ALLIES, THAT
WAS ACTUALLY DONE BECAUSE
DEFENDANTS WERE DRIVING THAT,

48:54.844 --> 48:56.310
WAS ACTUALLY DONE BECAUSE
DEFENDANTS WERE DRIVING THAT,
NOT FURTHER PROTECTION FOR

DEFENDANTS WERE DRIVING THAT,
NOT FURTHER PROTECTION FOR
VICTIMS AND WHAT WE'RE ABOUT IS

48:58.146 --> 48:59.779
NOT FURTHER PROTECTION FOR
