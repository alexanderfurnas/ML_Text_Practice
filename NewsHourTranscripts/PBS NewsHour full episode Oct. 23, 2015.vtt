WEBVTT

00:06.406 --> 00:08.508
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.508 --> 00:14.314
On the "NewsHour" tonight: A
potentially catastrophic
hurricane bears down on the
Pacific Coast

00:14.314 --> 00:21.054
of Mexico. Residents and
tourists flee, and the country
declares a state of emergency.

00:21.054 --> 00:25.959
Then: seeking a new way forward
in Syria. Secretary of State
Kerry meets with leaders

00:25.959 --> 00:30.097
from Russia and the Middle East.

00:30.097 --> 00:36.703
Old wind turbines come tumbling
down, part of an effort to save
California's golden eagles.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.439
SHAWN SMALLWOOD, Ecologist:
Those are the most dangerous
turbines in the Altamont Pass

00:39.439 --> 00:43.977
on record. There's one
120-kilowatt turbine down there,
now removed, but it's on record

00:43.977 --> 00:47.514
as having killed one eagle
per year for 10 years.

00:47.514 --> 00:51.885
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to analyze the week's

00:51.885 --> 00:53.287
news.

00:53.287 --> 00:58.892
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:58.892 --> 01:03.096
(BREAK)

01:03.096 --> 01:15.175
JUDY WOODRUFF: A storm for the
ages is blasting ashore on
Mexico's West Coast tonight.
Hurricane

01:15.175 --> 01:20.047
Patricia has the strongest
sustained winds ever recorded in
this part of the world, and

01:20.047 --> 01:25.419
it spent in the day in a
slow-motion assault on the
mainland.

01:25.419 --> 01:33.427
Sirens blared and lights flashed
as police and fire units combed
Puerto Vallarta this

01:33.427 --> 01:39.666
morning, urging people to flee
the popular Mexican Pacific
beach resort. The storm burst

01:39.666 --> 01:46.673
to life Tuesday, and, by last
night, it topped the scale, with
winds of 200 miles an hour,

01:46.673 --> 01:50.444
prompting dire descriptions
from Mexico's weather service.

01:50.444 --> 01:53.580
ROBERTO RAMIREZ, Director,
National Water Commission
(through translator): The
National

01:53.580 --> 01:57.117
Hurricane Center in Miami has
determined that this storm is
the strongest storm ever seen

01:57.117 --> 02:00.187
on the American continent.

02:00.187 --> 02:04.057
Additionally, some international
experts have already noted that
this hurricane is the most

02:04.057 --> 02:09.396
powerful hurricane that has ever
existed on the planet in all of
history.

02:09.396 --> 02:15.268
JUDY WOODRUFF: All told, a
hurricane warning stretched
along more than 300 miles of
Mexico's

02:15.268 --> 02:20.507
Pacific Coast. The storm's track
had its center heading between
the bustling port city of

02:20.507 --> 02:25.379
Manzanillo and Puerto
Vallarta tonight.

02:25.379 --> 02:31.385
Heavy rain started falling last
night, and today people hurried
to board up windows,

02:31.385 --> 02:36.790
as crews filled sandbags. The
region's airports closed, and
tourists rushed to check out and

02:36.790 --> 02:38.692
catch flights.

02:38.692 --> 02:43.397
WOMAN: I'm just worried,
because, if we don't get out of
here -- and we drove into town

02:43.397 --> 02:47.968
to get out, which is not the
direction we wanted to go. So,
if we don't make the flight,

02:47.968 --> 02:51.238
then we're -- we are
riding it out here.

02:51.238 --> 02:56.643
JUDY WOODRUFF: Forecasters said
the hurricane will start
weakening tomorrow, as it passes

02:56.643 --> 03:02.315
inland moving north toward
Texas. The remnants will add to
heavy rains already battering

03:02.315 --> 03:06.653
the Lone Star State from
another weather system.

03:06.653 --> 03:11.024
More than 2.5 inches fell at the
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport
yesterday, breaking a record

03:11.024 --> 03:11.992
set in 1908.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.194
MAN: There she goes.

03:14.194 --> 03:19.366
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the west,
flooding at a mobile home park
picked up trailers and

03:19.366 --> 03:22.302
carried them away.

03:22.302 --> 03:26.973
Today, the mayor of Houston
appealed to people to keep an
eye on what's coming.

03:26.973 --> 03:30.377
ANNISE PARKER (D), Mayor of
Houston, Texas: We really
encourage folks to, once the
rain

03:30.377 --> 03:34.714
starts, just stay home
and stay off the roads.

03:34.714 --> 03:41.721
JUDY WOODRUFF: Patricia is
already being compared with
Typhoon Haiyan that left more
than 7,300

03:41.721 --> 03:48.061
dead or missing in the
Philippines two years ago. And,
today, as waves pounded the
Mexican

03:48.061 --> 03:54.501
coast, one expert warned, "It's
looking like a very bad disaster
is shaping up."

03:54.501 --> 03:59.840
We get an on-the- ground
dispatch from a makeshift storm
shelter in Puerto Vallarta.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.778
David Alire Garcia is there for
Reuters. I spoke with him by
Skype late this afternoon

04:04.778 --> 04:07.581
as the hurricane moved
closer to landfall.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.450
David, thank you for
talking with us.

04:10.450 --> 04:14.821
First of all, tell us where you
are and what are the state of
preparations there?

04:14.821 --> 04:18.391
DAVID ALIRE GARCIA, Reuters:
Well, I'm in Puerto Vallarta.
I'm in the Univa Catholic

04:18.391 --> 04:21.928
university campus, which
is a makeshift shelter.

04:21.928 --> 04:25.966
Wasn't supposed to be a shelter,
but because of problems with
other nearby shelters,
particularly

04:25.966 --> 04:31.271
a big convention center and
risks of flooding, this was
opened up. And now there's about

04:31.271 --> 04:34.875
500 people here, a mix of
tourists, but also many locals
as well.

04:34.875 --> 04:39.579
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about the
state of preparations in that
area, Puerto Vallarta?

04:39.579 --> 04:42.983
DAVID ALIRE GARCIA: Well, the
local government, the state
government, the municipal
government

04:42.983 --> 04:47.854
opened up more than a dozen
shelters. There have been
problems with some, like I just

04:47.854 --> 04:50.457
mentioned a second ago, that
have been opened and then closed
because of worries that they're

04:50.457 --> 04:52.425
too close to rivers.

04:52.425 --> 04:57.531
The authorities are everywhere
here. They're trucking in
people. Just a little while ago,

04:57.531 --> 05:02.569
there were a handful of trucks
that arrived. I think this
shelter is about at its
capacity.

05:02.569 --> 05:06.573
But there are thousands of folks
who need shelter, and it's not
entirely clear that

05:06.573 --> 05:09.109
all of them are
going to get that.

05:09.109 --> 05:13.547
But it seems like the
authorities are -- you know, if
you listen to radio or TV,
there's

05:13.547 --> 05:17.484
all kinds of announcements that
people find shelter and find
someplace safe and get off

05:17.484 --> 05:19.586
the streets.

05:19.586 --> 05:24.658
JUDY WOODRUFF: It still appears,
though, that this storm has
formed very, very quickly,

05:24.658 --> 05:29.963
that it wasn't really until late
last night that people
understood the gravity of it.

05:29.963 --> 05:32.766
Do you think -- is it your sense
that people have evacuated who
needed to evacuate?

05:32.766 --> 05:36.703
DAVID ALIRE GARCIA: I think so.

05:36.703 --> 05:42.609
Just earlier, I was driving
around the tourist part of
Puerto Vallarta, and there are
-- you

05:42.609 --> 05:47.581
know, it's a ghost town. Windows
are boarded up. Windows are
taped up. There's sandbags

05:47.581 --> 05:51.551
at the hotels protecting
storefronts, bars, restaurants.
Of course, it's a big tourist

05:51.551 --> 05:54.054
hub here.

05:54.054 --> 05:58.758
So it seems like there is a lot
of preparation going on. Time
will tell if it really is
adequate

05:58.758 --> 06:01.595
for the storm that's
about to arrive.

06:01.595 --> 06:05.131
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as I speak
to you, it's just a little after
4:00 Eastern. It looks

06:05.131 --> 06:08.435
like the weather is still
pretty calm right now.

06:08.435 --> 06:12.739
DAVID ALIRE GARCIA: You know,
that's the crazy thing right now
is that there is barely a

06:12.739 --> 06:17.110
tiny drizzle, that there is
hardly any wind, if you can see
behind me. Right, actually,

06:17.110 --> 06:21.881
here, there's a lot of
folks taking refuge here.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.919
And the weather conditions at
the moment are not that bad,
but, of course, you know, things

06:25.919 --> 06:29.990
are projected to get a lot
worse, particularly the winds,
which could have caused a lot of

06:29.990 --> 06:36.062
damage and have caused damage.
There was a big hurricane here
over -- a few years back

06:36.062 --> 06:40.133
that many people still remember
that did cause lots of damage
because of flying debris.

06:40.133 --> 06:44.271
And so I think that's one of the
main worries, in addition to
flooding in the low-lying areas

06:44.271 --> 06:46.673
here in Puerto Vallarta, that
most people are concerned about.

06:46.673 --> 06:51.044
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we hope you
and everyone else is able to
stay safe.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.812
David Alire Garcia,
we thank you.

06:52.812 --> 06:55.815
DAVID ALIRE GARCIA: Thank you.

06:55.815 --> 07:02.322
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will turn to
how this storm got so big so
fast after the news summary.

07:02.322 --> 07:07.627
In other news, Two dozen states,
including West Virginia, Texas,
and Florida, went to

07:07.627 --> 07:13.600
federal court today to block
curbs on carbon dioxide
emissions. The U.S.
Environmental

07:13.600 --> 07:20.240
Protection Agency's Clean Power
Plan seeks to curb the power
plant emissions by 32 percent

07:20.240 --> 07:26.546
in 2030 from 2005 levels. The
states say the move is illegal
overreach and will devastate

07:26.546 --> 07:29.883
their economies.

07:29.883 --> 07:34.788
For the second time this week, a
candidate has dropped out of the
contest for the Democratic

07:34.788 --> 07:41.027
presidential nomination. Lincoln
Chafee, former Rhode Island
senator and governor, and
one-time

07:41.027 --> 07:45.799
Republican, had struggled to
raise money and make any
impression in the polls. Chafee
made

07:45.799 --> 07:49.903
his announcement today during a
speech to a Democratic women's
event in Washington.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.940
LINCOLN CHAFEE (D), Presidential
Candidate: I pledge all my
energy towards a big 2016

07:53.940 --> 07:57.911
victory for Democrats across the
country. But after much thought,
I have decided to

07:57.911 --> 08:02.582
end my campaign for the
president today. Thank you.

08:02.582 --> 08:05.585
JUDY WOODRUFF: Former Virginia
Senator Jim Webb dropped out of
the Democratic race a

08:05.585 --> 08:08.655
couple of days ago.

08:08.655 --> 08:13.760
On the Republican side, there
was word that Jeb Bush is
imposing across-the-board salary

08:13.760 --> 08:19.065
cuts for his staff, and is
downsizing his campaign
headquarters in Miami. News
accounts

08:19.065 --> 08:23.937
cited an internal memo on
this -- money-saving moves.

08:23.937 --> 08:30.543
Suicide bombers killed and
wounded scores of Muslims today
in Nigeria and Pakistan.

08:30.543 --> 08:36.649
At least 42 people died in
Nigeria in attacks on mosques in
two cities. More than a hundred

08:36.649 --> 08:42.589
others were wounded. Far to the
northeast in a city in Southern
Pakistan, a suicide

08:42.589 --> 08:48.061
bomber killed at least 18 people
in a Shiite religious
procession.

08:48.061 --> 08:54.434
The Balkan nations of Serbia and
Croatia have agreed to move more
refugees by train, and

08:54.434 --> 09:00.774
get them out of the rain and
cold. Last night, at least 5,000
people spent the night in
near-freezing

09:00.774 --> 09:05.145
weather near one border
crossing. The Croatian interior
minister called it -- quote --
"torture."

09:05.145 --> 09:07.580
Meanwhile,

09:07.580 --> 09:12.652
Greece reported a record 48,000
people crossed this week from
Turkey. Prime Minister Alexis

09:12.652 --> 09:16.022
Tsipras said it has to stop.

09:16.022 --> 09:21.227
ALEXIS TSIPRAS, Greek Prime
Minister (through translator):
Only if we are able to transfer

09:21.227 --> 09:25.899
the front line from the Greek
islands to the Turkish shores,
and start the process of
resettling

09:25.899 --> 09:31.037
refugees from the Turkish shores
towards Europe, and not from the
Greek islands to other European

09:31.037 --> 09:34.240
nations, can we then hope to
face and diminish these huge
refugee influxes that are
impossible

09:34.240 --> 09:36.476
to cope with today.

09:36.476 --> 09:42.081
JUDY WOODRUFF: The government of
Turkey, in turn, warned that a
new wave of refugees is

09:42.081 --> 09:48.621
coming, as thousands more
Syrians flee a military
offensive backed by Russian
airstrikes.

09:48.621 --> 09:53.193
Police in Sweden now say that a
masked man who attacked a school
with a sword and knife

09:53.193 --> 09:59.933
yesterday was motivated by race.
He killed two people and wounded
two in Trollhattan.

09:59.933 --> 10:05.839
It's a town with a large
immigrant population. All of the
victims were dark-skinned.
Today,

10:05.839 --> 10:09.542
mourners paid their respects at
a makeshift memorial, while the
local police chief reported

10:09.542 --> 10:11.678
on the investigation.

10:11.678 --> 10:16.850
NICLAS HALLGREN, Trollhattan
Police Chief: We have discovered
a letter in his apartment,

10:16.850 --> 10:25.024
and it has some notes in it that
tells us that he has planned the
act and he also -- he

10:25.024 --> 10:31.631
planned it out of a hate crime
perspective. And he's also told
us by that letter that

10:31.631 --> 10:36.236
he is going to -- he considers
that this will be his final act.

10:36.236 --> 10:42.342
JUDY WOODRUFF: The attack came
as it was announced that as many
as 190,000 asylum seekers may

10:42.342 --> 10:46.679
enter Sweden this year alone.
But, today, the government
agreed to restrict the country's

10:46.679 --> 10:50.950
liberal immigration policies.

10:50.950 --> 10:56.189
France has suffered its
deadliest auto accident in more
than 30 years; 43 people were
killed

10:56.189 --> 11:01.027
today in a collision between a
tour bus and a truck. It
happened on a narrow road near

11:01.027 --> 11:05.231
a town that's about 30
miles east of Bordeaux.

11:05.231 --> 11:09.202
Simon Israel of Independent
Television News filed this
report.

11:09.202 --> 11:15.241
SIMON ISRAEL: A group of
pensioners all from the same
village were on their way to
savor

11:15.241 --> 11:19.312
the delights of traditional
French cuisine. Their coach
collided head on with a lorry

11:19.312 --> 11:22.248
carrying wood.

11:22.248 --> 11:29.122
There was, in the words of a
fire chief, a gigantic blaze; 41
on the coach were killed,

11:29.122 --> 11:35.795
but eight survived because the
driver opened the doors barely
seconds before the crash.

11:35.795 --> 11:40.600
French television has broadcast
a reconstruction of one possible
version of events where the

11:40.600 --> 11:46.172
coach came around a blind
corner just before the crash.

11:46.172 --> 11:51.110
Traumatized families gathered in
the town of Puisseguin to wait
for news. Identification

11:51.110 --> 11:54.414
will clearly take some time.

11:54.414 --> 11:58.718
WOMAN (through translator): I'm
hoping, yes, but I don't know
anything. I don't know. I'm

11:58.718 --> 12:01.487
waiting.

12:01.487 --> 12:07.560
SIMON ISRAEL: The French prime
minister was among various
government officials to visit

12:07.560 --> 12:15.168
the scene today to express what
he described as the nation's
emotion for an appalling
catastrophe.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.705
Among the dead is also believed
to be the lorry driver and his
young son, who was by

12:18.705 --> 12:21.207
his side.

12:21.207 --> 12:25.545
JUDY WOODRUFF: A local lawmaker
said the wreck happened on a
dangerous curve. The president

12:25.545 --> 12:29.515
of France promised
an investigation.

12:29.515 --> 12:34.921
Back in this country, an
American soldier killed in a
hostage rescue in Iraq was
praised

12:34.921 --> 12:41.160
today as a hero who sacrificed
himself. Army Master Sergeant
Joshua Wheeler helped to free

12:41.160 --> 12:47.100
some 70 captives being held by
Islamic State forces. Defense
Secretary Ash Carter said

12:47.100 --> 12:51.604
that Wheeler sacrificed himself
by joining a firefight to aid
Kurdish soldiers that he

12:51.604 --> 12:54.941
was advising.

12:54.941 --> 13:00.513
Former IRS official Lois Lerner
will not face criminal charges
for allegedly targeting Tea

13:00.513 --> 13:05.385
Party groups. The Justice
Department ended a two-year
probe today, and said that it
found

13:05.385 --> 13:10.289
no evidence that anyone at the
IRS acted out of political
motives. Lerner once headed the

13:10.289 --> 13:15.194
unit that handles applications
for tax-exempt status.

13:15.194 --> 13:20.199
And on Wall Street today, a
rally in tech stocks helped push
the broader market higher.

13:20.199 --> 13:26.506
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 157 points to close at
17646. The Nasdaq rose

13:26.506 --> 13:32.779
nearly 112 points. And
the S&P 500 rose 22.

13:32.779 --> 13:37.517
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what's next for the strongest
hurricane on record in the

13:37.517 --> 13:43.856
Western Hemisphere; world
leaders seek a solution in
Syria; new wind turbines could
be a lifesaver

13:43.856 --> 13:59.005
for golden eagles,
and much more.

13:59.005 --> 14:03.676
Hurricane Patricia has been
described as potentially one of
the most dangerous storms to
ever hit

14:03.676 --> 14:08.314
the Western Hemisphere.
Meteorologists now say that
Patricia is bringing with it
winds

14:08.314 --> 14:13.619
of 190 miles an hour, down
just slightly from earlier.

14:13.619 --> 14:17.423
William Brangham has more on the
storm itself and what is fueling
it. He recorded this interview

14:17.423 --> 14:21.027
a short time ago, as the storm
was approaching Mexico.

14:21.027 --> 14:25.298
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Bob Henson is
a meteorologist for Weather
Underground, a Web-based weather

14:25.298 --> 14:29.102
service that also has a weekday
show on The Weather Channel.
Henson is also author of

14:29.102 --> 14:32.238
five books on weather
and climate change.

14:32.238 --> 14:37.443
So, Bob Henson, it seems like
meteorologists like yourself
have run out of terms to
describe

14:37.443 --> 14:41.581
the intensity of the storm.
Yesterday, it was a Category 1.
We wake up this morning,

14:41.581 --> 14:45.351
it's a Category 5. How did
this storm get so big so fast?

14:45.351 --> 14:48.321
BOB HENSON, Weather Underground:
It's a true outlier.

14:48.321 --> 14:53.092
You know, there's only a very,
very few hurricanes or typhoons
in world history that we know

14:53.092 --> 14:57.964
about that have intensified so
quickly. They have really only
been observing these systems

14:57.964 --> 15:01.300
in depth for the last several
decades, say, so we can't really
say how strong hurricanes

15:01.300 --> 15:04.437
were in 1900 or 1800.

15:04.437 --> 15:09.509
But, certainly in the modern era
of hurricane hunting and
satellites, for a storm to go

15:09.509 --> 15:16.249
to from a tropical storm to a
Cat 5 in, say, 24 hours,, 30
hours, those kinds of numbers

15:16.249 --> 15:19.385
only happen once in a very rare
while. So, this is up in the
ranks of maybe the top three

15:19.385 --> 15:22.455
or four most rapidly
strengthening storms.

15:22.455 --> 15:27.527
And, basically, it's because it
was over extremely warm water
that went to some depth, so the

15:27.527 --> 15:32.431
winds didn't stir up colder
water to weaken it. And upper
winds were very weak, which

15:32.431 --> 15:36.269
allowed it to intensify rapidly.
Really, just all the ingredients
came together in just

15:36.269 --> 15:39.338
the right way, which,
surprisingly, doesn't happen all
that often.

15:39.338 --> 15:44.310
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You mentioned
that calling this a Category 5,
which is the top of the

15:44.310 --> 15:48.981
Saffir-Simpson scale, is almost
an insufficient description of
this storm. Can you explain?

15:48.981 --> 15:51.751
BOB HENSON: Yes.

15:51.751 --> 15:56.255
The Saffir-Simpson scale was
developed several decades ago,
and it breaks hurricanes down

15:56.255 --> 16:01.260
into five bins, Category 1 all
the way up to Category 5. Now,
most of those bins are

16:01.260 --> 16:06.599
about
28-to-30-miles-per-hour-wide,
you might put it. Category 5
starts at 156 miles an

16:06.599 --> 16:10.670
hour, but it has no
ceiling. It's 156 and up.

16:10.670 --> 16:17.543
This storm had peak winds of
200, so it was 45 miles an hour
above the Category 5 threshold.

16:17.543 --> 16:23.649
You might say that, if we had a
Cat 6 and Cat 7, that it would
fall in the Cat 7 range,

16:23.649 --> 16:30.356
close to that. We don't parse
storms out when they get so
strong, in part because once you

16:30.356 --> 16:34.460
get to Cat 5, it pretty much
destroys everything except a
really well-constructed
building,

16:34.460 --> 16:38.231
so there is not as much
operational significance to it.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.833
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, at that
level of intensity, is that what
we're expecting that is going

16:40.833 --> 16:44.570
to just cause some incredible
damage on the coast of Mexico?

16:44.570 --> 16:48.841
BOB HENSON: Well, fortunately,
it has weakened a little bit as
it has approached land. It's

16:48.841 --> 16:52.478
still a very, very powerful
hurricane, still a Category 5,
as in the most recent
observations

16:52.478 --> 16:55.548
within the last couple of hours.

16:55.548 --> 17:00.586
Now, the storm surge is going to
be pretty significant over a
relatively small area.

17:00.586 --> 17:04.390
And that's another blessing with
this storm. It's not a gigantic
hurricane. But there will

17:04.390 --> 17:10.529
be an area of a few miles where
I would expect very, very severe
destruction. And, moreover,

17:10.529 --> 17:15.067
when it runs into very steep
mountains and hillsides just
inland, it is going to be
dumping

17:15.067 --> 17:19.839
gigantic amounts of rain, again,
over not a gigantic area, but
there could be tremendous

17:19.839 --> 17:23.442
amounts of rain along the way.
So, mudslides and floods are
also going to be a real issue.

17:23.442 --> 17:27.647
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And then my
understanding is that the storm
is likely to continue on

17:27.647 --> 17:30.983
breaking up somewhat, but then
heading into Southern Texas.
What are you forecasting for

17:30.983 --> 17:33.552
Texas to be looking at?

17:33.552 --> 17:37.189
BOB HENSON: Still pretty stout
winds. There will be some high
water along the Texas coast,

17:37.189 --> 17:41.460
but mainly a lot of rain. Could
be six to 12 inches of rain in
places like Houston.

17:41.460 --> 17:45.564
And there is an ongoing heavy
rain event over Texas already
because of a separate storm,

17:45.564 --> 17:50.369
so there's going to be some
very, very large local rainfall
amounts. And Texas is notorious

17:50.369 --> 17:55.374
for October systems that bring
in tropical moisture and
ex-hurricanes from the Pacific.

17:55.374 --> 17:56.842
So this is really something
to watch as well.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.311
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: OK.

17:58.311 --> 18:01.347
Bob Henson of Weather
Underground, thank you very
much.

18:01.347 --> 18:10.289
BOB HENSON: Thank you.

18:10.289 --> 18:17.430
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of
State John Kerry met in Vienna
today with his counterparts

18:17.430 --> 18:21.534
from Russia, Turkey and Saudi
Arabia in a renewed quest to
find a political settlement

18:21.534 --> 18:23.602
for the war in Syria.

18:23.602 --> 18:26.205
He spoke to reporters
afterwards.

18:26.205 --> 18:33.612
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Today, we came here aware
of all of the pitfalls,

18:33.612 --> 18:38.718
aware of all of the hurdles.
Every foreign minister here has
been wrestling with this

18:38.718 --> 18:46.092
issue for a period of time. But
we came here with a commitment
to try to find new ideas

18:46.092 --> 18:49.695
for how to break the impasse
and end the conflict.

18:49.695 --> 18:55.668
JUDY WOODRUFF: This came after
an agreement Monday between the
U.S. and Russian militaries

18:55.668 --> 19:01.374
on how to avoid accidental
midair collisions as both
countries bomb Syria. And also
that

19:01.374 --> 19:06.445
day, Syrian President Assad met
with President Putin in Moscow.
It was the first time Assad

19:06.445 --> 19:11.250
has left Syria since
the war began in 2011.

19:11.250 --> 19:15.087
For more on the state of play
between the U.S. and Russia over
Syria, we turn to "NewsHour"

19:15.087 --> 19:18.224
chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner,
who has been following all of
this.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.726
Margaret, thank you.

19:20.726 --> 19:26.132
So, we know that the U.S.,
Russia and these other countries
have been trying for two years,

19:26.132 --> 19:31.771
at least, to talk about, to find
a political settlement. No
results. Today any different?

19:31.771 --> 19:34.807
MARGARET WARNER: It's
very hard to tell, Judy.

19:34.807 --> 19:37.610
The one thing that indicates
there maybe progress is that
they agreed they are going to
meet

19:37.610 --> 19:44.517
again next week, at the end of
next week. Well, when Secretary
Kerry said, well, people

19:44.517 --> 19:48.554
brought a lot of new ideas,
publicly, we heard no new ideas.
What we heard was the same
mantra:

19:48.554 --> 19:51.090
We all agree it should be a
united Syria, it should be
democratic, and secular, and

19:51.090 --> 19:54.226
be diverse.

19:54.226 --> 19:59.665
But there was no resolution of
this huge hump over Assad's
future. And, you know, Turkey

19:59.665 --> 20:04.637
and Saudi want him gone now.
Russia wants -- afraid of the
chaos that could result if

20:04.637 --> 20:08.908
he were to fall precipitously
and wants him to stay. The U.S.
is the only one that has

20:08.908 --> 20:12.344
shown nay leg on that. It was
pretty clear from what Kerry
said today that the U.S. is

20:12.344 --> 20:17.349
willing to consider a transition
in which Assad may remain for a
while.

20:17.349 --> 20:22.221
JUDY WOODRUFF: Margaret, what
effect is Russia's military
intervention in Syria, which the

20:22.221 --> 20:24.990
U.S. has not been happy with,
what effect is that having on
those talks?

20:24.990 --> 20:27.359
MARGARET WARNER: Well,
it's interesting.

20:27.359 --> 20:31.330
Secretary Kerry has been telling
aides that actually this could
be an opportunity, that

20:31.330 --> 20:34.533
it could be an action-forcing
event, even though, as you said,
the U.S. was furious

20:34.533 --> 20:38.504
about this, because
it strengthens Assad.

20:38.504 --> 20:43.876
But the fact is, it has given
Russia a different seat at the
table in terms of figuring out

20:43.876 --> 20:50.282
Syria's future. One, it means
Russia has now a real interest
in getting this resolved
politically,

20:50.282 --> 20:52.284
or it's going to be sitting
there -- it's going to be
bombing forever. It's going to

20:52.284 --> 20:55.821
be in a kind of
military quagmire.

20:55.821 --> 21:01.594
So, it's also forced the United
States, you have noticed, to up
its game in Syria, more

21:01.594 --> 21:06.765
weapons to the rebels. It
revived the discussion
internally about whether to
establish a no-fly

21:06.765 --> 21:12.104
zone. So, there is a feeling
that, to a great extent, of
course, the U.S. doesn't trust

21:12.104 --> 21:17.610
what Putin's up to, but that
something may happen as a
result.

21:17.610 --> 21:21.413
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, what about
the meeting that happened this
week in Moscow where Assad

21:21.413 --> 21:25.050
flew to Moscow to meet with
Putin? What's known about that?

21:25.050 --> 21:28.854
MARGARET WARNER: What is known
about that, at least from
Russian sources I have -- and

21:28.854 --> 21:32.958
it was secondhand -- is that,
one, it was very chilly. As one
said to me, no one likes

21:32.958 --> 21:35.561
Assad.

21:35.561 --> 21:41.567
Two, that Putin was very firm
about, one, they wanted to
coordinate Russian airpower

21:41.567 --> 21:45.571
with Syrian ground troops. He
made it clear that Russia wasn't
going to send in ground

21:45.571 --> 21:47.973
troops, but he also wanted to
make sure the targeting was good
so they didn't kill a mass

21:47.973 --> 21:51.844
of civilians, that
the Russians didn't.

21:51.844 --> 21:55.681
But then they did discuss the
transition, but I'm told that
though they talked about

21:55.681 --> 22:00.753
the need for a diverse one, and
Assad, of course, of course,
that in fact Putin didn't

22:00.753 --> 22:03.289
pull the trigger and say, and,
you know, Mr. President Assad,
that will mean you have to

22:03.289 --> 22:05.024
go.

22:05.024 --> 22:08.460
So one person said to me, I have
a feeling they were talking past
each other.

22:08.460 --> 22:14.133
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Margaret, if
Putin wants some kind of
improved relationship with the

22:14.133 --> 22:18.003
U.S., wants to work something
out, what are the prospects for
that happening?

22:18.003 --> 22:22.608
MARGARET WARNER: Well, the
administration believes they're
not great, but that if -- there

22:22.608 --> 22:27.413
are two things he could do, one,
change the targeting from 85 to
90 percent moderate rebels,

22:27.413 --> 22:32.651
which is who he is hitting now,
instead of ISIS, and, two,
really use his enhanced leverage

22:32.651 --> 22:37.723
now with Assad, because he's got
Assad's back, to really push
Assad to recognize that,
ultimately,

22:37.723 --> 22:41.327
he has to agree to a
process in which he goes.

22:41.327 --> 22:45.631
And why would we do that? One,
because he's so eager to end his
international isolation

22:45.631 --> 22:50.469
and the sanctions. And, two, as
I referred to earlier, he now
has reason to fear of being

22:50.469 --> 22:53.772
sucked into kind of military
quicksand in Syria, if it just
goes on and on and on and

22:53.772 --> 22:56.208
there's no political solution.

22:56.208 --> 23:03.649
JUDY WOODRUFF: Margaret Warner,
some great reporting. We thank
you.

23:03.649 --> 23:09.722
MARGARET WARNER: Thanks, Judy.

23:09.722 --> 23:14.893
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

23:14.893 --> 23:20.499
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Benghazi, presidential politics,
and Paul Ryan, we discuss it all

23:20.499 --> 23:25.271
with Mark Shields and David
Brooks; and who's in charge of
American schools? -- journalist

23:25.271 --> 23:29.275
Dale Russakoff investigates
in her new book.

23:29.275 --> 23:34.947
But, first, we turn to the topic
of wind power. It's the
country's fastest growing energy

23:34.947 --> 23:39.618
source, expected
to triple by 2040.

23:39.618 --> 23:45.691
But the giant wind turbines can
also pose a threat to wildlife.
Thousands of birds are

23:45.691 --> 23:51.730
killed each year when they run
into turbines or are hit by
their blades. Now scientists

23:51.730 --> 23:55.534
at one of the nation's oldest
wind farms have developed a
strategy to help save protected

23:55.534 --> 23:58.470
species.

23:58.470 --> 24:04.043
Our colleagues at public TV
station KQED in San Francisco
bring you this story produced

24:04.043 --> 24:08.947
by Gabriela Quiros and
narrated by Scott Shafer.

24:08.947 --> 24:15.020
SCOTT SHAFER: The Altamont Pass,
east of San Francisco, is home
to hundreds of bird species.

24:15.020 --> 24:19.124
They hunt and play in the midst
of 3,000 wind turbines, which
can be deadly, especially

24:19.124 --> 24:20.592
to golden eagles.

24:20.592 --> 24:21.894
MAN: There's an
eagle right there.

24:21.894 --> 24:22.661
MAN: Eagle, eagle,
eagle, eagle, eagle.

24:22.661 --> 24:23.762
MAN: Right here flying below...

24:23.762 --> 24:26.231
MAN: OK, below the horizon.

24:26.231 --> 24:31.036
SCOTT SHAFER: Biologists Doug
Bell, Shawn Smallwood and Joe
DiDonato study golden eagles.

24:31.036 --> 24:34.540
MAN: We have got some good wind
going today, so this might be a
good day for seeing a few

24:34.540 --> 24:36.442
eagles.

24:36.442 --> 24:40.546
DOUG BELL, East Bay Regional
Park District: The Altamont Pass
Wind Resource Area is within

24:40.546 --> 24:44.917
and adjacent to one of the
densest nesting populations of
golden eagles in the world.

24:44.917 --> 24:50.255
SCOTT SHAFER: Golden eagles are
protected under federal law.
According to county estimates,

24:50.255 --> 24:54.960
35 golden eagles were killed by
the Altamont's turbines in 2013.

24:54.960 --> 25:00.766
DOUG BELL: Their population is
going down the drain. The
Altamont is killing more eagles

25:00.766 --> 25:03.769
than the local population
can reproduce.

25:03.769 --> 25:06.038
KRYSTA ROGERS, California
Department of Fish and Wildlife:
The primary injury on this bird

25:06.038 --> 25:09.942
is the left wing. The
carpal bone is shattered.

25:09.942 --> 25:14.980
SCOTT SHAFER: Today, Krysta
Rogers of the California
Department of Fish and Wildlife

25:14.980 --> 25:19.351
Examines a golden eagle that was
found injured on an Altamont
Pass wind farm. The bird had

25:19.351 --> 25:21.286
to be euthanized.

25:21.286 --> 25:27.326
KRYSTA ROGERS: We describe this
as blunt-force trauma, which is
consistent with a wind turbine

25:27.326 --> 25:30.362
strike, given the location
where the bird was found.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.867
MAN: The transmitter is going to
stay on here about three years.

25:34.867 --> 25:41.273
SCOTT SHAFER: The dead golden
eagle was one of 18 that
researchers had been tracking.

25:41.273 --> 25:44.376
Though four of them have died
after hitting turbines,
scientists were still able to
recover

25:44.376 --> 25:46.912
valuable data.

25:46.912 --> 25:50.115
DOUG BELL: One of the more
valuable things that we have
learned from our transmitters

25:50.115 --> 25:54.420
that we placed on eagles is that
they use the Altamont a lot.
They go in and out throughout

25:54.420 --> 25:58.390
the course of the year. They
will spend weeks at a time
there.

25:58.390 --> 26:03.295
SCOTT SHAFER: For more than a
decade, environmental groups
have been trying to get wind
companies

26:03.295 --> 26:07.833
to protect birds in this area,
says the Audubon Society's
Michael Lynes.

26:07.833 --> 26:11.203
MICHAEL LYNES, Audubon Society:
The Altamont was sort of seen as
a black eye for renewable

26:11.203 --> 26:13.839
energy, because any time someone
was proposing a new wind farm,
it would raise the specter

26:13.839 --> 26:16.141
of the Altamont Pass.

26:16.141 --> 26:20.546
SCOTT SHAFER: After chapters of
the Audubon Society and other
environmental groups sued

26:20.546 --> 26:25.484
to get birds protected, wind
companies agreed to take down
old wind turbines.

26:25.484 --> 26:29.688
MICHAEL LYNES: We wanted to move
towards getting the old turbines
out of the Altamont Pass

26:29.688 --> 26:34.593
because, in a process called
repowering, up to 30 old
turbines can be replaced with
one

26:34.593 --> 26:39.665
single new turbine, which then
results usually in significantly
less bird mortality.

26:39.665 --> 26:46.071
SCOTT SHAFER: At this wind farm,
300 turbines are coming down and
being replaced by only

26:46.071 --> 26:49.975
10 new ones, which together will
produce double the amount of
electricity, enough to power

26:49.975 --> 26:53.312
12,000 homes for a year.

26:53.312 --> 26:55.981
RICK MILLER, EDF Renewable
Energy: It's time to pull the
old machines down and put new

26:55.981 --> 26:58.217
ones up.

26:58.217 --> 27:04.256
SCOTT SHAFER: Rick Miller of EDF
Renewable Energy, which owns the
wind farm, says the

27:04.256 --> 27:08.160
repowering process will cost $35
million and is facilitated by
federal tax credits for

27:08.160 --> 27:10.128
wind energy.

27:10.128 --> 27:14.867
RICK MILLER: The turbines are
becoming much larger, much
larger rotor diameters and much

27:14.867 --> 27:18.337
taller towers. So we have really
been able to reduce the number
of turbines required

27:18.337 --> 27:22.374
to produce a tremendous amount
of energy from the same site.

27:22.374 --> 27:27.079
SCOTT SHAFER: And that means
there are fewer turbines for
birds to hit. Companies can also

27:27.079 --> 27:29.348
place the turbines
more strategically.

27:29.348 --> 27:32.117
SHAWN SMALLWOOD, Ecologist:
Three hundred meters above
ground.

27:32.117 --> 27:34.987
SCOTT SHAFER: Ecologist Shawn
Smallwood advises companies on
where to put their turbines to

27:34.987 --> 27:37.656
minimize bird deaths.

27:37.656 --> 27:40.559
SHAWN SMALLWOOD: This is where
the old turbines were, and this
is also where the burrowing

27:40.559 --> 27:44.096
owls nest. And so the fatality
rate was pretty high.

27:44.096 --> 27:48.767
SCOTT SHAFER: This wind farm was
one of the first to get new,
more efficient turbines.

27:48.767 --> 27:52.137
SHAWN SMALLWOOD: When we
repower, we put the new turbines
up on the top of the hill, where

27:52.137 --> 27:55.841
the burrowing owls are not. So,
our burrowing owl fatality rate
dropped to zero in three

27:55.841 --> 27:58.377
years of monitoring,
and that's why.

27:58.377 --> 28:03.415
SCOTT SHAFER: Smallwood says
that when wind energy companies
first installed over 7,000

28:03.415 --> 28:09.121
turbines in the Altamont Pass in
the 1980s, they gave little
consideration to bird safety.

28:09.121 --> 28:15.260
SHAWN SMALLWOOD: Those are the
most dangerous turbines in the
Altamont Pass on record. There's

28:15.260 --> 28:19.231
one 120-kilowatt turbine down
there, now removed, but it's on
record as having killed one
eagle

28:19.231 --> 28:21.867
per year for 10 years. And the
reason is because there's a lot
of eagle traffic through the

28:21.867 --> 28:23.969
lowest spots of the
Altamont Pass.

28:23.969 --> 28:30.809
SCOTT SHAFER: Birds fly lower in
some areas to avoid wind
resistance and to hunt for prey.

28:30.809 --> 28:35.147
But, with their keen eyesight
focused on the ground, eagles
might not see a wind turbine

28:35.147 --> 28:38.183
blade until it's too late.

28:38.183 --> 28:43.655
SHAWN SMALLWOOD: Social
interactions are very important.
So, an eagle responding to other

28:43.655 --> 28:47.693
eagles, chase each other around
or chase some other birds, these
are dangerous social
interactions

28:47.693 --> 28:51.396
that lead up to what we
call events, near-misses.

28:51.396 --> 28:56.435
SCOTT SHAFER: The federal
government is increasing
enforcement of laws aimed at
protecting golden

28:56.435 --> 28:59.938
eagles, including bringing
criminal charges against two
companies whose turbines killed

28:59.938 --> 29:03.375
golden eagles in Wyoming.

29:03.375 --> 29:08.480
Scott Flaherty of the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service says that
was a significant step.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.383
SCOTT FLAHERTY, U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service: The
prosecution of those two
companies certainly

29:11.383 --> 29:14.152
sent a message to companies
across the country there is
incentive there to come in and
work

29:14.152 --> 29:16.455
with us.

29:16.455 --> 29:21.159
SCOTT SHAFER: That incentive is
a new permitting system that
allows companies to kill a
limited

29:21.159 --> 29:26.031
number of eagles each year. Even
the Audubon Society's Michael
Lynes sees permits as a

29:26.031 --> 29:28.367
positive step.

29:28.367 --> 29:32.938
MICHAEL LYNES: Before, it was
sort of chaos. There was no real
regulation. There was no

29:32.938 --> 29:36.942
real enforcement. And we know
birds were getting killed in
large numbers. Now we can
actually

29:36.942 --> 29:41.480
keep track of that. We can hold
people accountable, and we can
take steps to remedy the
problem.

29:41.480 --> 29:47.052
SCOTT SHAFER: As the U.S.
increases its wind power
capability, scientists,
including Shawn

29:47.052 --> 29:52.357
Smallwood, believe fewer
turbines and better placement
are key to protecting wildlife.

29:52.357 --> 29:57.496
SHAWN SMALLWOOD: We have learned
a lot here. And so it should be
the number one laboratory

29:57.496 --> 30:01.600
in the country for learning what
not to do wrong with wind
development around the rest

30:01.600 --> 30:03.168
of the country.

30:03.168 --> 30:08.707
SCOTT SHAFER: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Scott Shafer.

30:08.707 --> 30:21.119
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been a busy
week in the political world.

30:21.119 --> 30:27.292
Hillary Clinton testified during
a marathon Benghazi Committee
hearing. Paul Ryan says

30:27.292 --> 30:32.564
yes to run for speaker of the
House, and Republican Ben Carson
surpasses Donald Trump in the
polls

30:32.564 --> 30:35.267
in Iowa.

30:35.267 --> 30:38.737
For all of that, we turn to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.
That's syndicated columnist

30:38.737 --> 30:40.739
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

30:40.739 --> 30:41.707
Welcome, gentlemen.

30:41.707 --> 30:44.543
MARK SHIELDS: You're
welcome. Thank you.

30:44.543 --> 30:48.146
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Benghazi
hearings, David, they went -- I
don't know that it was 11,

30:48.146 --> 30:50.515
but it was eight or nine
hours of testimony.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.117
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

30:52.117 --> 30:54.352
JUDY WOODRUFF: What have we
learned? What was accomplished
at this hearing?

30:54.352 --> 30:57.122
DAVID BROOKS: Nothing
was learned.

30:57.122 --> 31:02.461
We learned that the Republicans
can't stump Hillary Clinton. She
was composed, gave a

31:02.461 --> 31:06.531
lot of the same testimony she's
given before. This thing has
been going on forever. And

31:06.531 --> 31:11.570
so nothing happened, really. And
so that's good news for her.

31:11.570 --> 31:17.209
She -- her composure was
excellent. Congressmen do what
congressmen do. And so it was a
big

31:17.209 --> 31:23.048
nothing burger. And why the
Republicans remain obsessed with
this, at a time when the nation

31:23.048 --> 31:26.585
of Iraq has ceased to exist,
Syria barely exists, there's
turmoil spreading throughout

31:26.585 --> 31:29.688
the Middle East -- if you want
to attack Hillary Clinton, it
seems to me she was secretary

31:29.688 --> 31:33.191
of state at a time of
deterioration in actual
substantive grounds. Maybe that
would be a

31:33.191 --> 31:35.627
good subject.

31:35.627 --> 31:39.564
But there is a certain psychosis
that goes through people's
minds, especially about
scandals,

31:39.564 --> 31:44.136
but Clinton scandals, where they
-- where something smells, and
they think there must

31:44.136 --> 31:47.706
be something big, and they
imagine there is about to be
some big revelation that will

31:47.706 --> 31:53.178
destroy their careers. But,
since 1991, that has never
happened, and the critics have
always

31:53.178 --> 31:57.315
overshot the mark and ended up
helping the candidate. And
that's what happened.

31:57.315 --> 32:01.386
JUDY WOODRUFF: They have
survived some challenges in the
past, the Clintons, but, Mark,
nothing

32:01.386 --> 32:03.388
burger, is that
what it adds up to?

32:03.388 --> 32:09.060
MARK SHIELDS: I would feel
better if it were just the
Clintons with the Republicans. I

32:09.060 --> 32:12.898
think this has been -- for the
past seven years of the Obama
administration, it has

32:12.898 --> 32:18.904
been an obsession that -- to
prove not simply that the
administration is not capable or

32:18.904 --> 32:24.342
efficient or effective, but that
somehow it's evil, maybe even
criminal.

32:24.342 --> 32:30.615
And that's what was driving this
Benghazi hearing, that somehow
that there was some

32:30.615 --> 32:37.989
evil plot or evil scheme or
diabolical whatever. The
emphasis on Sid Blumenthal, who
was a...

32:37.989 --> 32:41.326
JUDY WOODRUFF: Her
longtime friend.

32:41.326 --> 32:47.132
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, longtime
friend, controversial, a
conspiracy buff, an apparatchik,
whatever

32:47.132 --> 32:53.104
else he is, but, I mean, hardly
somebody of Rasputin dimensions
that they wanted to elevate

32:53.104 --> 32:56.007
him to.

32:56.007 --> 32:59.611
And in doing so, they were
forced to go public with this
hearing, which they didn't want

32:59.611 --> 33:02.013
to do. They looked
bad. They had...

33:02.013 --> 33:03.281
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meaning
the Republicans.

33:03.281 --> 33:07.018
MARK SHIELDS: The
Republicans looked bad.

33:07.018 --> 33:13.992
Hillary Clinton looked
disciplined. She showed
remarkable stamina. She showed
thorough preparation.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.062
And she never went for the bait.
The bait was to get her to do
what she had done in

33:17.062 --> 33:22.033
the previous hearing, to show
exasperation, to display temper.

33:22.033 --> 33:27.138
And she just -- she came off it,
to use an adjective,
presidential. And I just think

33:27.138 --> 33:33.812
-- I just think that the
Republicans ought to drop this
and move on, but I think it is

33:33.812 --> 33:39.551
-- I think it is symptomatic of
a party that is incapable of
accepting its governing
responsibility.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.019
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly,
David, Republicans, how -- are
they hurt by this or do they
just

33:41.019 --> 33:43.455
move on?

33:43.455 --> 33:46.758
DAVID BROOKS: Not really. I
don't think they're really hurt.
I don't take the broad
indictment.

33:46.758 --> 33:52.564
Sometimes, a scandal cottage
industry gets started, and it's
fed by people who get expertise,

33:52.564 --> 33:57.135
and then the talk radio get into
it, and they get into the weeds.
And they imagine something

33:57.135 --> 34:02.207
that big is about to happen, and
the scandal cottage industries
just go on forever.

34:02.207 --> 34:06.945
And they think they hurt Hillary
Clinton's poll numbers this way,
but I swear, if they

34:06.945 --> 34:12.317
want to take a real issue, the
disarray of our Middle East
policy is a real issue.
Benghazi,

34:12.317 --> 34:17.255
if you list our foreign policy
issues of importance, it would
be number 197.

34:17.255 --> 34:21.726
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think you have
to say, Mark, this was a pretty
good week for former Secretary

34:21.726 --> 34:26.698
of State Clinton, not only the
general interpretation of the
hearings, the fact that she
doesn't

34:26.698 --> 34:30.502
have an opponent that many
people thought she could have in
Vice President Joe Biden.

34:30.502 --> 34:33.571
He said he's not running.

34:33.571 --> 34:37.776
Where does that leave
everything? What did you make of
his decision? Were you
surprised?

34:37.776 --> 34:41.646
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I was
surprised, because I didn't
know.

34:41.646 --> 34:47.319
Everybody who said they knew who
was talking didn't know, and
everybody who apparently

34:47.319 --> 34:54.192
knew wasn't talking. But I
didn't know that he wasn't going
to run.

34:54.192 --> 35:00.332
I will say this about Joe Biden.
His absence means that the happy
warrior will be missing

35:00.332 --> 35:07.405
from the Democratic battle this
year. That's what Joe -- Joe
Biden has personally at least

35:07.405 --> 35:10.241
35 percent of the world's known
reserve of authenticity.

35:10.241 --> 35:11.509
(LAUGHTER)

35:11.509 --> 35:14.813
MARK SHIELDS: And we're
looking for the authentic.

35:14.813 --> 35:20.952
Lindsey Graham, Republican from
South Carolina, who is himself a
presidential candidate and

35:20.952 --> 35:27.092
an active partisan, said of Joe
Biden, if you don't like Joe
Biden, you ought take a

35:27.092 --> 35:29.828
serious look at yourself,
because there is something wrong
with you.

35:29.828 --> 35:34.933
He is the nicest person I have
ever met. God never made a
better man than Joe Biden. This

35:34.933 --> 35:39.371
was before Joe Biden pulled out.
This was just in an interview in
Iowa a couple -- a

35:39.371 --> 35:45.243
month or so ago. So I just think
it takes a lot of courage to
run. It takes a lot more

35:45.243 --> 35:52.017
courage to pull out. And I just
-- I will miss him and his
presence in this race.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.886
JUDY WOODRUFF: The fact that
he's not in, what effect does it
have?

35:54.886 --> 35:58.456
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. Well,
obviously, it makes Hillary even
more -- she's gone from the
doldrums

35:58.456 --> 36:02.127
of three months ago now to the
unstoppable behemoth that no one
can touch in the course

36:02.127 --> 36:02.927
of a week.

36:02.927 --> 36:04.562
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

36:04.562 --> 36:09.200
DAVID BROOKS: It does take away
some of the joy. Biden could be
very eloquent, very much

36:09.200 --> 36:13.505
in touch with working-class
voters. He comes from that
background.

36:13.505 --> 36:15.140
And the other thing about what
he did, the guy was elected
senator, I think, when he

36:15.140 --> 36:15.907
was 29.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.610
MARK SHIELDS:
Twenty-nine. He was.

36:18.610 --> 36:22.047
DAVID BROOKS: And he's now
looking at the end of his
political career. And he's a
political

36:22.047 --> 36:27.118
creature. He loves politics. He
loves talking to people. And so
even getting out of the

36:27.118 --> 36:31.423
race means that his political
career will end with the
administration, one presumes.

36:31.423 --> 36:34.025
And that's a hard thing for a
guy to say, because he's been
serving all his life and

36:34.025 --> 36:36.294
he's loved the act of service.

36:36.294 --> 36:39.697
JUDY WOODRUFF: Somebody who is
taking -- or trying to take a
step up in his political

36:39.697 --> 36:44.536
career, Mark, is Paul Ryan, who
decided this week that he is
going to run for speaker of

36:44.536 --> 36:48.840
the House. He managed to get
enough of not just Republicans,
but very conservative
Republicans,

36:48.840 --> 36:51.409
to say they're going
to support him.

36:51.409 --> 36:55.313
How did he do that? To do what
John Boehner and Kevin McCarthy
couldn't do, how did this

36:55.313 --> 36:56.848
happen?

36:56.848 --> 37:00.585
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think
there were a convergence of
things.

37:00.585 --> 37:06.858
Paul Ryan is a near unique
figure in the Republican House,
in the Republican Party. He's
been

37:06.858 --> 37:12.464
a leader on philosophical and
ideological issues. He was the
candidate for vice president.

37:12.464 --> 37:18.870
He's been a leader within the
caucus and respected across all
the divisions.

37:18.870 --> 37:25.410
He laid down conditions, that he
would only accept speakership
and seek it under certain

37:25.410 --> 37:29.881
conditions. Interesting, one was
family and parental leave,
something Republicans have

37:29.881 --> 37:32.417
consistently opposed.
But Paul Ryan...

37:32.417 --> 37:34.619
JUDY WOODRUFF: For himself.

37:34.619 --> 37:37.155
MARK SHIELDS: Paul Ryan wants it
for himself. He wants to spend
-- admirably, he wants to

37:37.155 --> 37:41.826
spend time with his children,
who are in their formative and
teen years.

37:41.826 --> 37:46.131
Would that he would extend this
to all parents. And I'm sure he
will now that he's speaker,

37:46.131 --> 37:46.798
about to be speaker.

37:46.798 --> 37:48.266
(LAUGHTER)

37:48.266 --> 37:53.571
MARK SHIELDS: But I think, Judy,
it was an acknowledgment on the
part of Republicans

37:53.571 --> 37:57.308
of just how desperate their
straits were, that they couldn't
continue to flounder around

37:57.308 --> 38:00.078
as they have.

38:00.078 --> 38:04.349
This is a party, right now,
according to the Wall Street
Journal/NBC and other polls,
that

38:04.349 --> 38:10.855
the party members have no
respect for the party leaders.
And they think -- Republicans

38:10.855 --> 38:16.995
think their own party is in
terrible shape, and whereas
Democrats, either rightly or
wrongly,

38:16.995 --> 38:20.465
think that the Democratic Party
is doing fine or doing OK.

38:20.465 --> 38:25.336
But -- so I just think that this
was an acknowledgement that they
had to turn and swallow some of

38:25.336 --> 38:27.438
their differences.

38:27.438 --> 38:32.877
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does -- what
is it about him, David, that
wasn't acceptable, I mean,

38:32.877 --> 38:36.781
that wasn't there in Boehner and
McCarthy? What does he bring?

38:36.781 --> 38:39.517
DAVID BROOKS: Well, partly, the
Freedom Caucus changed. They are
good at destroying. They're

38:39.517 --> 38:41.419
not good at constructing. And
they knew they needed a leader.
There had to be some party

38:41.419 --> 38:44.589
leader to end what was going on.

38:44.589 --> 38:49.761
And so when Ryan went in to meet
with them, he said, well, if you
want me, fine. I'm out

38:49.761 --> 38:53.831
of here. I don't need this. But
then he looked at their ideas
about changing the way Congress

38:53.831 --> 38:56.234
works, and he didn't concede to
any of them, but he said, well,
those sound like decent

38:56.234 --> 38:58.703
ideas. We will discuss it.

38:58.703 --> 39:03.908
So he showed a little respect.
And they softened. And, mostly,
they softened, and because they

39:03.908 --> 39:08.713
had no real alternative. And so
it was their softening, his
display of respect, and the

39:08.713 --> 39:14.752
fact that he is a -- he is the
most policy-oriented speaker
probably of our lifetimes.

39:14.752 --> 39:18.990
There have been a lot of
politicians who have been
speaker, but he is a policy
person primarily.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.258
And he has worked with
Democrats, with Patty Murray.

39:20.258 --> 39:21.926
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

39:21.926 --> 39:23.828
DAVID BROOKS: He's done some
really tough stuff that he had
to persuade his own party

39:23.828 --> 39:28.066
to endorse, some
entitlement reforms.

39:28.066 --> 39:34.138
And so I think he may actually
help the Republican image,
because, A, he's just an
attractive

39:34.138 --> 39:39.143
guy. He's a nice guy. He's an
outgoing, friendly guy. But, B,
he actually does care about
policies.

39:39.143 --> 39:42.146
And he will be a little more
aggressive in promoting
policies.

39:42.146 --> 39:46.584
And the Tea Party was right
about Boehner. He wasn't
aggressive in promoting ideas.
And

39:46.584 --> 39:50.455
so Democrats were coming out
with proposals and ideas, and
Republicans had a black hole.

39:50.455 --> 39:53.057
JUDY WOODRUFF: But does this
mean, though, that they're going
to -- because he's in place,

39:53.057 --> 39:56.160
that they are now going to be
able to reach agreement on the
debt ceiling and do something

39:56.160 --> 39:58.763
about the highway bill? Does
this mean things are going to
get done now that weren't --
they

39:58.763 --> 40:00.665
couldn't get done before?

40:00.665 --> 40:03.735
DAVID BROOKS: I find it hard to
believe that they would ruin his
early phase by going -- shutting

40:03.735 --> 40:06.404
down the government and not
doing the debt ceiling.

40:06.404 --> 40:10.241
Further down the road,
obviously, he will have the same
problems that Boehner had.

40:10.241 --> 40:18.316
MARK SHIELDS: The party -- the
job description speaker in the
past has not consisted of
including

40:18.316 --> 40:22.654
policy, other than Newt
Gingrich, who was really the
exception there.

40:22.654 --> 40:28.626
I think, Judy, he's making -- in
part of a concession, he's
making a mistake. And I think

40:28.626 --> 40:35.366
that the speaker's job
description has been the one
person who can hold that caucus
together.

40:35.366 --> 40:41.606
And one of the tools used to do
it -- and John Boehner did it
tirelessly, and so did

40:41.606 --> 40:44.876
Nancy Pelosi -- and that is to
go out and speak to members in
their own districts, to

40:44.876 --> 40:48.112
raise money for them.

40:48.112 --> 40:51.783
And Paul Ryan, as I mentioned
earlier, doesn't want to do
that. I don't think you can
subcontract

40:51.783 --> 40:56.087
that out. I really don't. I
think -- and you can't say, gee,
I can't make it this week.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.689
Can Sam or Sally do it?

40:57.689 --> 40:59.557
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why
is that important?

40:59.557 --> 41:04.262
MARK SHIELDS: Because it's the
speaker. And it's a
transactional, personal
relationship

41:04.262 --> 41:09.600
the speaker has with his
members: And I -- remember,
David, I came in when you had
that tough primary

41:09.600 --> 41:12.637
and I said -- and I
need you on this one.

41:12.637 --> 41:17.909
And that's part of being
speaker. I think it's an added
feature that Paul Ryan brings

41:17.909 --> 41:23.748
to it, this policy dimension.
But there is no guarantee that
the Freedom Caucus is not

41:23.748 --> 41:27.585
going to bring a motion to
vacate, which is, of course,
what drove John Boehner
ultimately,

41:27.585 --> 41:30.722
which is a vote
of no confidence.

41:30.722 --> 41:36.294
And I just -- I think David's
right. John Boehner will try to
clear the decks of as

41:36.294 --> 41:40.965
many as he can of these
controversial items before he
leaves. But December 11 is the
big

41:40.965 --> 41:44.969
day. That's when the government
has to be funded. And it's going
to mean probably taking

41:44.969 --> 41:49.006
the caps off of discretionary
spending and defense spending.
And I think that's where

41:49.006 --> 41:51.609
you're going to see the Freedom
Caucus really rise up.

41:51.609 --> 41:54.712
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, very
quick, less than a minute,
David.

41:54.712 --> 41:59.150
New poll numbers out in Iowa
that show a surge, at least over
the last two months, for Ben

41:59.150 --> 42:02.787
Carson. He's up 10 points over
what he was in August. Trump is
down a little bit. Cruz

42:02.787 --> 42:05.790
is up. What's going on?

42:05.790 --> 42:09.594
DAVID BROOKS: Two things. The
evangelicals are coalescing
around Carson, and, two, there

42:09.594 --> 42:14.799
are a lot of women who will not
vote for Trump. And so he's
doing poorly among women.

42:14.799 --> 42:18.069
And so I think that is what is
happening there. I still am of
the belief that neither of them

42:18.069 --> 42:19.437
is going to get the nomination.
And so I look to...

42:19.437 --> 42:20.138
(CROSSTALK)

42:20.138 --> 42:21.939
JUDY WOODRUFF: Neither
Trump nor Carson?

42:21.939 --> 42:23.875
DAVID BROOKS: And I look to --
just because that's not the way
history has worked so far.

42:23.875 --> 42:26.611
History sometimes changes.

42:26.611 --> 42:30.081
But Rubio did well in that poll,
so I'm looking at him as the
alternative, if we ever get

42:30.081 --> 42:31.883
normal.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.619
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then Jeb
Bush, Mark, announced today he's
cutting back on staff, cutting

42:34.619 --> 42:36.754
back on his big --
his headquarters.

42:36.754 --> 42:40.091
MARK SHIELDS: Never known a
winning candidate to cut back on
staff spending or to close

42:40.091 --> 42:44.695
offices. So, it isn't good.

42:44.695 --> 42:52.036
I agree with David about Ben
Carson. And he is broadly
acceptable to more people in the

42:52.036 --> 42:57.008
Republican Party. Peter Hart did
a focus group this week of 12
Republican voters in Indiana,

42:57.008 --> 43:01.679
and it came through, their
admiration, affection for him,
his moral leadership, and
they're

43:01.679 --> 43:05.917
-- the doubts and
skepticism about Trump.

43:05.917 --> 43:11.789
And I think this is a problem
that the Republicans have to
deal with. Experience and
holding

43:11.789 --> 43:15.760
an office in this year has
become a liability among
Republicans office seekers.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.029
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK. Fascinating.

43:18.029 --> 43:22.767
Mark Shields, David Brooks,

43:50.928 --> 43:55.967
It was meant to be a
game-changer for public
education in Newark, New Jersey,
a plan launched

43:55.967 --> 44:02.507
five years ago that might show
the entire country how to remake
failing urban schools.

44:02.507 --> 44:06.978
Reporter Dale Russakoff
chronicled what became of those
efforts in her new book, "The
Prize:

44:06.978 --> 44:10.014
Who's in Charge of
America's Schools?"

44:10.014 --> 44:13.851
William Brangham recently spoke
with her for our "NewsHour"
Bookshelf.

44:13.851 --> 44:18.789
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It started
with an unlikely trio, Newark's
Democratic Mayor Cory Booker,

44:18.789 --> 44:23.494
the state's Republican Governor
Chris Christie, and Facebook
billionaire Mark Zuckerberg,

44:23.494 --> 44:28.766
who offered a whopping $100
million grant. They made the
announcement on "Oprah."

44:28.766 --> 44:33.070
The money was to be used to help
implement many oft school reform
efforts being tried

44:33.070 --> 44:38.042
out nationwide, boost pay for
the best teachers, open more
charter schools and close the
failing

44:38.042 --> 44:42.947
ones. And there have been
successes. Last year, 20 percent
of Newark's black students

44:42.947 --> 44:48.286
were enrolled in -- quote --
"above-average schools." That's
up from 12 percent in 2010,

44:48.286 --> 44:52.123
but those gains came at a price.
The community remains
distrustful of the reforms and
the

44:52.123 --> 44:56.327
exodus to charter schools
has fueled a budget crisis.

44:56.327 --> 45:01.098
In her new book, "The Prize:
Who's in Charge of America's
Schools?" former Washington Post

45:01.098 --> 45:06.337
reporter Dale Russakoff details
where reformers got it right and
where things went wrong.

45:06.337 --> 45:09.407
I talked with her recently about
how Newark's schools and
students are doing five years

45:09.407 --> 45:10.441
on.

45:10.441 --> 45:12.910
Dale Russakoff, thanks
for joining us.

45:12.910 --> 45:11.943
DALE RUSSAKOFF, Author, "The
Prize: Who's in Charge of
America's Schools?": Thanks for

45:11.943 --> 45:14.045
having me.

45:14.045 --> 45:18.282
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In your book,
you write that the trio behind
this initial effort,

45:18.282 --> 45:23.120
Cory Booker, Chris Christie, and
Mark Zuckerberg, you write about
them this way -- quote -- "Their

45:23.120 --> 45:27.491
stated goal was not to repair
education in Newark, but to
develop a model for saving

45:27.491 --> 45:31.896
it in all of urban America
and to do it in five years."

45:31.896 --> 45:36.667
That is a breathtakingly
ambitious goal. What was their
plan?

45:36.667 --> 45:40.371
DALE RUSSAKOFF: Well, actually,
I think they wanted, first of
all, to repair education

45:40.371 --> 45:45.109
in Newark first, but they saw
that they could create some kind
of a model that could then

45:45.109 --> 45:48.779
be scaled up almost like a
start-up business, which is the
way Zuckerberg would be
comfortable

45:48.779 --> 45:51.782
thinking about it at that time.

45:51.782 --> 45:57.822
But what they thought they would
do was bring in charter schools
and dramatically expand

45:57.822 --> 46:03.260
the existing footprint of the
charter schools, and then also
turn the school district into

46:03.260 --> 46:07.031
their version of a
high-performing business, with
accountability all through the
system

46:07.031 --> 46:09.934
for the teachers and the
principals and using the student
performance as the metric that

46:09.934 --> 46:12.803
everyone had to focus on.

46:12.803 --> 46:15.873
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, it has
been now five years, their
stated time frame. How is

46:15.873 --> 46:18.376
it going in Newark? How
are the kids doing?

46:18.376 --> 46:23.314
DALE RUSSAKOFF: Well, the
charter schools in Newark have
doubled in -- the enrollment

46:23.314 --> 46:27.518
has doubled, and 40 percent of
children in Newark now go to
charter schools, and almost

46:27.518 --> 46:30.655
50 percent of African-American
children go to charter schools.

46:30.655 --> 46:36.294
There has been a big exodus,
particularly in the most
high-poverty districts, which

46:36.294 --> 46:40.464
also are the ones with the most
-- the highest proportion of
African-American kids. Those

46:40.464 --> 46:45.603
skills have performed a lot
better than the district
schools. And so the children in
those

46:45.603 --> 46:49.407
schools are definitely doing
better than they probably would
have done in the district
schools.

46:49.407 --> 46:52.910
As children leave the district
schools, the money follows them.
And there is a huge budget

46:52.910 --> 46:58.182
crisis. There was a $16 million
gap in the school budget. They
have had to close and

46:58.182 --> 47:01.619
consolidate schools. Thousands
of kids have had to change
schools because schools were

47:01.619 --> 47:05.389
closing or consolidating.

47:05.389 --> 47:10.161
Teachers have been laid off.
Support staff, which is a huge
factor in Newark because there

47:10.161 --> 47:15.332
is so much poverty, extreme
poverty, violence, family
dysfunction, the lack of support
staff

47:15.332 --> 47:20.905
is a real problem. So, there's a
lot of factors that are
affecting the district schools,
but

47:20.905 --> 47:25.443
in spite of major effort, they
have not improved. In many
cases, they have gotten worse.

47:25.443 --> 47:30.281
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One of the
things that you chronicle so
devastatingly in your book is

47:30.281 --> 47:35.386
the failure of the reformers to
bring the community into the
process from the get-go.

47:35.386 --> 47:38.155
Even from the very beginning,
many people learned about this
simply by watching Oprah

47:38.155 --> 47:41.659
on television. How much of that
do you think was a factor in the
results that they have

47:41.659 --> 47:43.494
gotten?

47:43.494 --> 47:48.165
DALE RUSSAKOFF: Well, I don't
know how much of a factor it is
in the student achievement

47:48.165 --> 47:52.269
results, but certainly in the
opposition that the community
rallied against this effort,

47:52.269 --> 47:55.139
that it was the factor.

47:55.139 --> 48:00.044
You know, people have asked me,
was it the unions that brought
upon the reformers all

48:00.044 --> 48:02.480
this opposition? I honestly
don't think the unions were
capable of bringing this much

48:02.480 --> 48:03.214
opposition.

48:03.214 --> 48:05.316
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It was
just there organically?

48:05.316 --> 48:10.321
DALE RUSSAKOFF: Well, I think
the unions helped fan it, but I
think that because this whole

48:10.321 --> 48:14.291
effort was done from outside,
was done to Newark, instead of
with Newark -- that's the

48:14.291 --> 48:17.061
phrase you hear all the time.

48:17.061 --> 48:22.166
The word you hear most often in
Newark in response to this whole
effort is disrespect.

48:22.166 --> 48:28.339
People felt disrespected. And so
I think ordinary parents just
ended up flooding every public

48:28.339 --> 48:33.444
meeting, every school board
meeting, and just trying to stop
this in its tracks.

48:33.444 --> 48:36.180
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
that would have been different?
Do you think if they

48:36.180 --> 48:40.184
had actively tried to bring the
community along from the
beginning, that it would have

48:40.184 --> 48:42.286
been different?

48:42.286 --> 48:48.225
DALE RUSSAKOFF: Well, you know,
I think bringing the community
along is a complicated idea.

48:48.225 --> 48:53.297
I think, had there been a real
effort to find out from the best
teachers in the district

48:53.297 --> 48:57.868
what do you need to succeed,
what does the school need to
succeed,and has that -- have

48:57.868 --> 49:02.907
those kinds of ideas been at the
heart of trying to improve the
schools, I think then

49:02.907 --> 49:05.676
it would have been viewed as
something that really came more
authentically from the community

49:05.676 --> 49:08.245
and from the people.

49:08.245 --> 49:12.216
It was -- you know, people said
from the beginning, and I think
it was true, that there was a

49:12.216 --> 49:15.319
consensus on the ground that the
Newark schools needed dramatic
change. Nobody thought the

49:15.319 --> 49:18.189
schools -- that the status
quo was acceptable.

49:18.189 --> 49:22.359
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You write that
this was really a collection of
some of the broader

49:22.359 --> 49:27.331
ideas of the reform movement
that have been percolating
across the country.

49:27.331 --> 49:32.069
So does Newark say something
about the broader national
reform movement? What lessons
can

49:32.069 --> 49:37.308
we learn as far as national
educational reform from what has
gone in Newark?

49:37.308 --> 49:44.315
DALE RUSSAKOFF: Well, I think
that the education reform
movement is largely a movement
of,

49:44.315 --> 49:50.154
you know, well-off people,
well-educated people who are
very, very concerned about the
status

49:50.154 --> 49:55.659
of the schools, but -- and the
status of public education
nationally.

49:55.659 --> 50:00.397
I think that there are also
people throughout the poorest
communities that are also very

50:00.397 --> 50:05.069
concerned about education. And I
think the challenge that the
education reform movement

50:05.069 --> 50:10.574
seems concerned with right now
is making sure that all of those
voices in the community,

50:10.574 --> 50:14.511
the affected communities are
part of the answer, as opposed
to just being told what the
answer

50:14.511 --> 50:16.380
is.

50:16.380 --> 50:21.352
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Obviously,
now, five years on, Cory Booker
is in the Senate, Chris Christie

50:21.352 --> 50:25.756
is trying to become president,
but Mark Zuckerberg is still at
this, and -- but doing it in a

50:25.756 --> 50:28.893
slightly different way.

50:28.893 --> 50:32.496
And it seems as if he learned
something from Newark or decided
to change tack. Can you

50:32.496 --> 50:33.430
tell me a little bit about what
he's doing out in California?

50:33.430 --> 50:35.366
DALE RUSSAKOFF: Yes.

50:35.366 --> 50:39.470
Well, he said from the outset
that -- you know, he was 26 when
this started, and he

50:39.470 --> 50:43.407
said he wanted to do something
to help Newark, but he wanted to
become a better philanthropist

50:43.407 --> 50:46.744
in the process, but he was very
open about how little he knew
about philanthropy and

50:46.744 --> 50:49.647
about education.

50:49.647 --> 50:54.551
So, he -- I think he was serious
about that. And the way he's
approaching the latest gift

50:54.551 --> 51:01.292
-- he gave $120 million that's
going to be used in Bay Area
very underserved communities

51:01.292 --> 51:07.331
for school improvement. And
instead of, you know, looking
for a model that can be imposed

51:07.331 --> 51:12.269
on the school districts, he --
and he's had his staff of his
philanthropy spend a lot

51:12.269 --> 51:16.440
of time in the communities to
try to make sure that what the
community wants is what

51:16.440 --> 51:19.810
they're -- that what they're
doing is what the community
wants.

51:19.810 --> 51:23.480
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The book is
called "The Prize: Who's in
Charge of America's Schools?"

51:23.480 --> 51:25.282
Dale Russakoff, thank you
so much for being here.

51:25.282 --> 51:31.088
DALE RUSSAKOFF: Thank you
very much for having me.

51:31.088 --> 51:44.401
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online: Not everyone who marries
a U.S. citizen gets U.S.

51:44.401 --> 51:49.206
citizenship. There are
exceptions to that rule. On this
week's podcast Shortwave, we

51:49.206 --> 51:54.778
explore how those exceptions
have affected one family, who
have been barred for years

51:54.778 --> 52:01.352
from returning to the United
States. We have a link to listen
on our home page,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:01.352 --> 52:06.657
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs from our PBS
colleagues.

52:06.657 --> 52:11.128
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week," which airs
later this evening. Here's a
preview:

52:11.128 --> 52:18.369
GWEN IFILL: How Hillary Clinton
and Paul Ryan won the week, Joe
Biden's unsurprising exit,

52:18.369 --> 52:24.341
while, on the Republican side,
Jeb Bush struggles, while Ben
Carson and Donald Trump lead the

52:24.341 --> 52:30.514
field. We examine why this was
the week that was tonight on
"Washington Week" -- Judy.

52:30.514 --> 52:36.153
JUDY WOODRUFF: On "PBS NewsHour
Weekend" tomorrow: a personal
story of fleeing domestic
violence

52:36.153 --> 52:41.658
in Honduras, one of the world's
most dangerous places for women.

52:41.658 --> 52:45.429
NARRATOR: Lilian (ph) says her
boyfriend became increasingly
dangerous after he got involved

52:45.429 --> 52:49.099
with a Mexican drug
cartel called Los Zetas.

52:49.099 --> 52:53.203
WOMAN (through translator): He'd
threaten me if I spoke to the
police or made charges

52:53.203 --> 52:57.241
against him. He threatened
to set fire to the house.

52:57.241 --> 53:02.379
NARRATOR: Last year, an uncle in
Texas offered to pay smugglers
$4,000 to help Lilian flee

53:02.379 --> 53:07.217
to the United States without a
visa, a risky trip that
thousands of other women opted
to

53:07.217 --> 53:11.889
undertake as well. Lilian met
smugglers in Guatemala and began
the week-long trek through

53:11.889 --> 53:13.891
Mexico.

53:13.891 --> 53:18.162
WOMAN (through translator):
Sometimes, it's 24 hours in a
bus or walking. There are times

53:18.162 --> 53:20.664
that you're locked up alone
in a place without food.

53:20.664 --> 53:35.879
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
on "PBS NewsHour Weekend."

53:35.879 --> 53:41.452
And again to our honor roll of
American service personnel
killed in Iraq and the
Afghanistan

53:41.452 --> 53:44.688
conflict. We add them as their
deaths are made official and
photographs become available.

53:44.688 --> 53:58.836
Here, in silence, is one more.

53:58.836 --> 54:01.672
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:01.672 --> 54:02.439
Have a great weekend. Thank
you, and good night.
