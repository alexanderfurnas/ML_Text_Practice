07:34.133 --> 07:36.600
AND SO THE GERMANS CAN, I THINK,

07:36.600 --> 07:40.300
SPEAK TO PUTIN WITH A LITTLE BIT

07:40.300 --> 07:41.700
MORE CONFIDENCE, LET'S SAY, HE

07:41.700 --> 07:42.933
WOULD HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE I

07:42.933 --> 07:44.833
THEM THAN TALKING, LET'S SAY, TO

07:44.833 --> 07:47.200
OBAMA OR TO SOMEBODY FROM OTHE

07:47.200 --> 07:47.333
COUNTRIES.

07:47.333 --> 07:52.167
SO THEY'RE INCREASINGL

07:52.167 --> 07:55.933
IMPORTANT INTERLOCULAR BETWEEN

07:55.933 --> 07:57.133
THE U.S. AND RUSSIA.

07:57.133 --> 07:59.833
>> WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT MERKE

07:59.833 --> 08:00.600
AND PUTIN?

08:00.600 --> 08:01.533
>> IT'S VERY BAD

08:01.533 --> 08:03.700
AT LEAST AS BAD AS THE

08:03.700 --> 08:04.600
OBAMA/PUTIN RELATIONSHIP

08:04.600 --> 08:06.367
DON'T FORGET, SHE GREW UP IN

08:06.367 --> 08:07.333
EAST GERMANY

08:07.333 --> 08:10.600
PUTIN WAS A KGB OFFICER IN EAS

08:10.600 --> 08:11.100
GERMANY AT THE TIME.

08:11.100 --> 08:14.833
WHEN THEY FIRST MET WHEN SHE WAS

08:14.833 --> 08:16.200
CHANCELLOR, PUTIN KNEW SHE HAD A

08:16.200 --> 08:17.600
BIG FEAR OF DOGS

08:17.600 --> 08:18.933
ESPECIALLY BIG DOGS.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.000
PUTIN BROUGHT HIS BIG DOG INTO

08:20.000 --> 08:21.533
THE MEETING TO SHOW HER THAT H

08:21.533 --> 08:23.333
KNEW THAT AND THAT HE COUL

08:23.333 --> 08:25.233
INTIMIDATE HER

08:25.233 --> 08:26.433
SHE'S ALSO FELT THAT WHEN PUTI

08:26.433 --> 08:29.333
SPEAKS GERMAN TO HER, SHE'

08:29.333 --> 08:30.067
BEING INTERROGATED

08:30.067 --> 08:31.467
ON A PERSONAL LEVEL IT'S VER

08:31.467 --> 08:31.600
BAD.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.000
BUT MERKEL IS A PROFESSIONAL

08:33.000 --> 08:34.067
SHE'S A SCIENTIST.

08:34.067 --> 08:34.733
SHE'S VERY RATIONAL.

08:34.733 --> 08:36.167
SHE'S A POLITICIAN

08:36.167 --> 08:38.233
SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT YOU HAVE TO

08:38.233 --> 08:39.600
SEPARATE PERSONAL FEELINGS FRO

08:39.600 --> 08:40.500
POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.833
AND SHE'S DONE THAT AS WELL.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.600
SO SHE DOES -- I THINK SHE DOE

08:43.600 --> 08:44.400
THAT VERY EFFECTIVELY.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.067
>> WOW

08:45.067 --> 08:49.033
NOW, THIS IS IN THE CONTEXT OF A

08:49.033 --> 08:49.667
U.S./GERMAN RELATIONSHIP THAT'

08:49.667 --> 08:50.700
GONE THROUGH SOME STRAINS.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.300
WE'VE REALIZED THAT ONE ALLY HAS

08:52.300 --> 08:53.800
BEEN BUGGING THE CELL PHONE OF

08:53.800 --> 08:55.200
THE OTHER ALLY

08:55.200 --> 08:55.867
>> ABSOLUTELY.

08:55.867 --> 08:57.033
THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR

08:57.033 --> 08:58.600
RIGHT NOW IN THIS WHOL

08:58.600 --> 09:01.433
RELATIONSHIP ON RUSSIA AND

09:01.433 --> 09:02.333
CRIMEA AND UKRAINE

09:02.333 --> 09:03.567
BECAUSE THE GERMAN/AMERICA

09:03.567 --> 09:05.033
RELATIONSHIP IS REALLY AT A BA

09:05.033 --> 09:06.300
STATE RIGHT NOW.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.433
THE SNOWDEN EFFECT HAS BEEN VERY

09:07.433 --> 09:08.300
DEEP IN GERMANY.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.100
MUCH DEEPER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE

09:10.100 --> 09:10.933
REALLY, IN EUROPE.

09:10.933 --> 09:12.300
YOU HAVE TO THINK, OF COURSE

09:12.300 --> 09:14.567
ABOUT THEIR HISTORY.

09:14.567 --> 09:15.667
NOT ONLY THE NAZI PAST BUT THE

09:15.667 --> 09:18.367
EAST GERMAN STAZI.

09:18.367 --> 09:20.433
WE'RE ALWAYS LISTENING INTO EAST

09:20.433 --> 09:21.367
GERMAN CONVERSATIONS

09:21.367 --> 09:24.567
THE GERMANS ARE VERY SENSITIVE

09:24.567 --> 09:25.933
THEY ALSO FELT THE U.S. WA

09:25.933 --> 09:27.767
THEIR BEST ALLY AND REALLY A

09:27.767 --> 09:27.933
FRIEND

09:27.933 --> 09:28.967
NOW THEY FEEL BETRAYED

09:28.967 --> 09:30.367
THEY'RE KIND OF CAUGHT IN TH

09:30.367 --> 09:30.567
MIDDLE

09:30.567 --> 09:31.667
THEY HAVE A CERTAIN SENSE OF

09:31.667 --> 09:32.333
DISTANCE FROM THE U.S.

09:32.333 --> 09:33.167
THEY ALSO HAVE THE STRON

09:33.167 --> 09:34.200
ECONOMIC STAKE WITH RUSSIA

09:34.200 --> 09:35.600
AT THE SAME TIME, THE GERMAN

09:35.600 --> 09:37.267
PUBLIC AND THE GERMAN MEDIA AR

09:37.267 --> 09:38.333
EXTREMELY CRITICAL OF WHAT'S

09:38.333 --> 09:39.733
GOING ON IN RUSSIA AND WIT

09:39.733 --> 09:40.667
PUTIN IN PARTICULAR.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.000
SO IT'S A VERY DIFFICULT TIME,

09:42.000 --> 09:43.667
I'D SAY, FOR THEM RIGHT NOW.

09:43.667 --> 09:44.700
BUT IT'S A VERY TOUGH TIME FOR

09:44.700 --> 09:46.533
THE U.S. TO TRY TO WORK WITH THE

09:46.533 --> 09:48.833
GERMANS GIVEN THIS SNOWDEN

09:48.833 --> 09:50.267
IMPACT AND THE FACT THAT THEY'RE

09:50.267 --> 09:51.800
STILL VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE

09:51.800 --> 09:52.433
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

09:52.433 --> 09:53.933
>> WHAT ARE THE GERMANS DOIN

09:53.933 --> 09:54.700
RIGHT NOW?

09:54.700 --> 09:55.833
IT SEEMS NEITHER GERMANY OR TH

09:55.833 --> 09:57.567
U.S. WANT TO TAKE THE LEAD O

09:57.567 --> 09:59.467
SANCTIONS AND POSSIBLY PUT THEIR

09:59.467 --> 10:02.333
OWN COMPANIES AND THEI

10:02.333 --> 10:03.567
COUNTRIES AT A COPETITIV

10:03.567 --> 10:04.300
DISADVANTAGE

10:04.300 --> 10:07.033
>> THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.

10:07.033 --> 10:07.200
THIS IS THE IMPORTANT POINT THAT

10:07.200 --> 10:08.600
WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IN

10:08.600 --> 10:09.700
TRYING TO DEVELOP OUR OW

10:09.700 --> 10:10.300
SANCTION POLICY.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.733
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO

10:11.733 --> 10:13.400
PENALIZE OUR OWN COMPANIES

10:13.400 --> 10:15.033
OUR ECONOMIC STAKE IS MUCH

10:15.033 --> 10:16.700
SMALLER THAN THE EUROPEAN OR THE

10:16.700 --> 10:18.133
GERMAN STAKE, BUT IT'S STILL

10:18.133 --> 10:18.267
THERE.

10:18.267 --> 10:18.700
THERE ARE CERTAIN COMPANIES THAT

10:18.700 --> 10:20.300
ARE TRYING TO MAKE -- THEY HAV

10:20.300 --> 10:21.233
SOME SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS

10:21.233 --> 10:23.733
LET'S SAY, IN RUSSIA

10:23.733 --> 10:24.933
SO I THINK THAT WHAT THE GERMANS

10:24.933 --> 10:27.400
ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO TRY T

10:27.400 --> 10:29.467
FIND SOME SORT OF SOLUTION T

10:29.467 --> 10:31.167
SEND A SIGNAL TO RUSSIA THAT

10:31.167 --> 10:32.767
THIS IS BEING TAKEN VERY

10:32.767 --> 10:34.233
SERIOUSLY, BUT AT THE OTHE

10:34.233 --> 10:35.233
HAND, THEY REALIZE THAT THEY'R

10:35.233 --> 10:36.767
IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY REALLY

10:36.767 --> 10:39.200
CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE SERIOUS

10:39.200 --> 10:40.467
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS BECAUSE THE

10:40.467 --> 10:42.467
IMPACT ON THEIR ACCOUNT WOULD BE

10:42.467 --> 10:43.467
QUITE SUBSTANTIAL.

10:43.467 --> 10:44.700
DON'T FORGET THAT THEY GET ABOUT

10:44.700 --> 10:46.433
A THIRD OF THEIR ENERGY, THEIR

10:46.433 --> 10:48.200
GAS AND THEIR OIL, DIRECTLY FROM

10:48.200 --> 10:48.400
RUSSIA

10:48.400 --> 10:49.833
SO THIS WOULD HAVE A DEVASTATING

10:49.833 --> 10:51.067
IMPACT ON THEIR ECONOMY.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.467
IT'S A BIT LIKE THE U.S./CHINA

10:53.467 --> 10:53.700
RELATIONSHIP

10:53.700 --> 10:54.767
WE HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH

10:54.767 --> 10:56.700
THE CHINESE BUT AT THE SAM

10:56.700 --> 10:58.133
TIME, WE HAVE THIS VERY STRONG

10:58.133 --> 10:58.900
ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP WHIC

10:58.900 --> 11:00.600
REALLY LIMITS WHAT WE CAN DO

11:00.600 --> 11:02.167
>> HOW DO THOSE ENERGY NEEDS

11:02.167 --> 11:03.267
PLAY INTO ALL OF THIS?

11:03.267 --> 11:05.267
IT SEEMS THERE'S A FEW EUROPEA

11:05.267 --> 11:06.033
COUNTRIES ALREADY ASKING FOR THE

11:06.033 --> 11:08.433
U.S. TO START SELLING THEM

11:08.433 --> 11:08.900
NATURAL GAS.

11:08.900 --> 11:09.533
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

11:09.533 --> 11:10.600
AND WE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT

11:10.600 --> 11:11.433
DECISION HERE.

11:11.433 --> 11:12.633
BECAUSE WE WANT TO KEEP TH

11:12.633 --> 11:13.800
NATURAL GAS HERE TO KEEP OUR

11:13.800 --> 11:15.033
ENERGY PRICES DOWN

11:15.033 --> 11:18.700
AND THIS ALLOWS US TO BE MOR

11:18.700 --> 11:19.333
COMPETITIVE IN THE INTERNATIONAL

11:19.333 --> 11:20.733
COMPETITION WITH GERMAN AN

11:20.733 --> 11:21.333
EUROPEAN COMPANIES

11:21.333 --> 11:22.967
SO THE MORE THAT WE SEND T

11:22.967 --> 11:24.533
EUROPE, THE MORE THAT AFFECT

11:24.533 --> 11:25.700
OUR ECONOMY AT HOME.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.933
THE OTHER FACTOR, OF COURSE, I

11:27.933 --> 11:29.533
GAS PROM IS NOW THREATENING TO

11:29.533 --> 11:31.533
CUT OFF GAS SUPPLIES TO UKRAINE.

11:31.533 --> 11:33.467
A LOT OF THE GAS TO EUROPE GOE

11:33.467 --> 11:33.967
THROUGH UKRAINE.

11:33.967 --> 11:36.000
THE GERMANS HAVE A SEPARATE GA

11:36.000 --> 11:36.667
PIPELINE WITH THE RUSSIANS

11:36.667 --> 11:38.267
SO THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE

11:38.267 --> 11:38.967
IMMUNE FROM THAT

11:38.967 --> 11:41.033
BUT I THINK OVERALL, WE AR

11:41.033 --> 11:41.967
SEEING RIGHT NOW THAT ENERGY CAN

11:41.967 --> 11:43.900
BE A MAJOR FACTOR IN HOW THE

11:43.900 --> 11:46.567
RUSSIANS TRY TO DESTABILIZ

11:46.567 --> 11:48.933
UKRAINE AND PUT PRESSURE ON TH

11:48.933 --> 11:50.600
EUROPEANS AND ALSO PUT PRESSUR

11:50.600 --> 11:51.533
ON THE U.S./EUROPEAN

11:51.533 --> 11:52.200
RELATIONSHIP

11:52.200 --> 11:54.867
>> SO WHAT COULD GERMANY DO IN

11:54.867 --> 11:56.300
THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH PUTIN

11:56.300 --> 11:58.300
>> WELL, I THINK WHAT THEY CAN

11:58.300 --> 12:00.000
DO, I REALLY THINK THE GERMANS

12:00.000 --> 12:02.167
ARE GOING TO HAVE TO BE TH

12:02.167 --> 12:02.833
INTERMEDIARIES BETWEEN THE WES

12:02.833 --> 12:03.800
AND RUSSIA

12:03.800 --> 12:06.100
I DON'T THINK -- I THINK THE

12:06.100 --> 12:07.400
U.S. IS TOO POISONOUS RIGHT NO

12:07.400 --> 12:09.500
IN TERMS OF PUTIN'S VIEW OF US

12:09.500 --> 12:11.567
SO I THINK THEY HAVE TO BE -- TO

12:11.567 --> 12:14.767
TAKE THE LEAD AND TO TELL TH

12:14.767 --> 12:16.200
RUSSIANS ESSENTIALLY HOW SERIOUS

12:16.200 --> 12:18.733
THIS IS AND THAT THEY REALLY ARE

12:18.733 --> 12:21.633
RISKING A MUCH MORE SERIOU

12:21.633 --> 12:24.200
BREACH WITH THE WEST IF THEY

12:24.200 --> 12:25.333
DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THEY

12:25.333 --> 12:30.400
CAN'T -- I THINK CAN'T GO BEYOND

12:30.400 --> 12:30.533
CRIMEA

12:30.533 --> 12:33.000
I THINK CRIMEA IS A CONTAINABL

12:33.000 --> 12:33.133
SITUATION.

12:33.133 --> 12:34.633
IF THE RUSSIANS WERE TO GO INT

12:34.633 --> 12:35.867
EASTERN UKRAINE, I THINK WE'RE

12:35.867 --> 12:37.067
TALKING ABOUT A VERY, VERY

12:37.067 --> 12:38.500
SERIOUS UNPREDICTABL

12:38.500 --> 12:38.633
RELATIONSHIP

12:38.633 --> 12:39.900
WHAT THE GERMANS AND THE

12:39.900 --> 12:41.200
EUROPEANS ARE DOING RIGHT NOW IS

12:41.200 --> 12:42.167
THREATENING TO STOP -- THEY WERE

12:42.167 --> 12:43.967
TALKING ABOUT TRYING T

12:43.967 --> 12:45.533
LIBERALIZE VISAS WITH TH

12:45.533 --> 12:47.067
RUSSIANS INTO EUROPE, INTO

12:47.067 --> 12:50.167
RUSSIA, INTO GERMANY, SORRY.

12:50.167 --> 12:51.800
THEY WANT TO NOW SUSPEND THOSE

12:51.800 --> 12:52.033
DISCUSSIONS.

12:52.033 --> 12:53.367
THEY'RE SUSPENDING TRADE

12:53.367 --> 12:54.133
DISCUSSIONS.

12:54.133 --> 12:55.267
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT GOIN

12:55.267 --> 12:57.167
THROUGH THIS EUROPEAN UNIO

12:57.167 --> 12:58.067
TRADE ASSOCIATION WITH UKRAINE

12:58.067 --> 13:00.433
AS A WAY OF BOLSTERING UKRAINE

13:00.433 --> 13:02.400
SO THESE ARE THE KIND OF THING

13:02.400 --> 13:03.867
I THINK THAT EUROPE AND TH

13:03.867 --> 13:04.333
GERMANS CAN DO

13:04.333 --> 13:06.967
>> STEVE SAVO FROM THE

13:06.967 --> 13:07.800
TRANSATLANTIC ACADEMY, THANKS SO

13:07.800 --> 13:08.033
MUCH

13:27.600 --> 13:30.100

NUMBER OF SCHOOL MUSIC PROGRAM

13:31.900 --> 13:33.600
DURING THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.333
WHAT EFFECT THAT'S HAD O

13:36.333 --> 13:38.333
LEARNING IS DIFFICULT TO

13:38.333 --> 13:39.100
QUANTIFY, BUT THERE IS N

13:39.100 --> 13:40.600
EVIDENCE THAT PRACTICING AND

13:40.600 --> 13:42.000
PLAYING MUSIC REGULARLY DOES

13:42.000 --> 13:44.167

15:32.500 --> 15:33.233
DOCUMENTED THAT CHILDREN WHOSE

15:33.233 --> 15:34.967
MOTHERS HAVE LITTLE EDUCATIO

15:34.967 --> 15:37.467
ARE RARELY BEING READ TO AND

15:37.467 --> 15:38.567
VERBAL INTERACTION IN THOS

15:38.567 --> 15:40.833
FAMILIES IS MINIMAL.

15:40.833 --> 15:41.967

15:41.967 --> 15:45.900
ONLY PUTS THEM BEHIND IN SCHOOL,

15:45.900 --> 15:46.767
BUT THOSE CHILDREN RARELY CATC

15:46.767 --> 15:46.900
UP

15:46.900 --> 15:48.300
BECAUSE THEIR BRAINS ARE NOT

15:48.300 --> 15:50.067
DEVELOPING AS RAPIDLY AS THE

15:50.067 --> 15:53.467
BRAINS OF MORE STIMULATED KIDS

15:53.467 --> 15:55.400
>> EARLY SUSTAINED MUSIC

15:55.400 --> 15:59.367

16:01.133 --> 16:04.833
ITSELF CAN BE BUILT FOR LO

16:04.833 --> 16:04.933
INCOME KIDS.

16:04.933 --> 16:06.367
>> Reporter: MARGARET MARTIN WAS

16:06.367 --> 16:07.333
CONVINCED OF THAT.

16:07.333 --> 16:08.533
BECAUSE OF THE GRADUATION RATE

16:08.533 --> 16:09.733
OF KIDS WHO HAVE GONE THROUG

16:09.733 --> 16:10.233
HER PROGRAM.

16:10.233 --> 16:12.000
THIS YEAR, SHE SAYS, 93% OF THEM

16:12.000 --> 16:13.567
FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL IN FOUR

16:13.567 --> 16:16.600
YEARS AND WENT TO COLLEGE.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.267
BUT MARTIN ACKNOWLEDGES, SHE

16:18.267 --> 16:19.600
DOES NOT HAVE THE FORMAL

16:19.600 --> 16:21.733
TRAINING TO PROVE THAT MUSIC

16:21.733 --> 16:23.633
HELPS KIDS GRASP LANGUAGE BETTER

16:23.633 --> 16:24.133
AND BECOME MORE PROFICIENT

16:24.133 --> 16:26.600
READERS.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.633
SO SHE ENLISTED THE HELP OF THIS

WOMAN.

16:29.533 --> 16:32.667
HER NAME IS DR. NINA KRAUSE.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.233
NO ONE HAS EVER PROVEN

16:43.233 --> 16:44.800
CONCLUSIVELY THAT MUSIC IMPROVES

16:44.800 --> 16:46.000
LEARNING, AND SOME STUDIES HAV

16:46.000 --> 16:47.267
FOUND NO LINK AT ALL

16:47.267 --> 16:49.067

17:05.933 --> 17:07.800
MOTIVATED TO LEARN MUSIC AT TH

17:08.433 --> 17:10.033
HALF THE KIDS WERE SELECTED TO

17:39.300 --> 17:40.833
THERE WILL BE A WOMAN TALKIN

17:45.567 --> 17:46.900
SENTENCES THAT ARE PRESENTED I

17:46.900 --> 17:48.100

17:48.100 --> 17:49.933
TO REPEAT BACK AS MUCH OF TH

17:57.200 --> 17:58.667
GETS NOISIER AND NOISIER

17:58.667 --> 17:59.133
IT GETS HARDER AND HARDER TO

17:59.133 --> 18:03.567
HEAR THE SOUNDS.

18:03.567 --> 18:05.500

18:05.500 --> 18:06.233
TELL A TALE.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.367

18:08.367 --> 18:12.033
TRAINING ARE BETTER AT HEARING

18:12.033 --> 18:13.467
SPEECH IN NOISE.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.233
AND IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT FROM

OTHER SUBJECTS

19:53.000 --> 19:54.367
I WOULD CONCENTRATE IN MY MUSIC.

19:54.367 --> 19:55.433
