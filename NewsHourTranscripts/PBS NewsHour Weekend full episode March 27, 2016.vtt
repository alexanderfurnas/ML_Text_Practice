NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE, WHAT

06:29.033 --> 06:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING ON?

06:29.533 --> 06:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE FOREIGN FIGHTER ARE WELCOME

THAT WHAT ALL THESE CONFLICTS

07:03.633 --> 07:05.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THAT ARE HAPPENING.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHEN YOU HAVE FOREIGN

07:07.100 --> 07:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGHTERS WHO ARE REWARDED FOR

07:08.533 --> 07:11.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR TRIP, FOR THEIR SACRIFICE,

07:11.667 --> 07:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING TO THE CALIPHATE WITH

07:15.100 --> 07:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH MORE MONEY MORE SPOILS

RESENTMENT FROM THE LOCAL FIGHT

07:20.067 --> 07:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE LOCAL FIGHTERS FOR THE

07:22.367 --> 07:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MO PART LIVING UNDER ISLAMIC

07:23.700 --> 07:24.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE RULE.

07:24.367 --> 07:26.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY HAVE LESS OF A CHOICE.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THERE'S GOING TO BE SOME

07:28.967 --> 07:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCORD, THIS IS ESPECIALLY

07:30.600 --> 07:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACUTE WHEN THERE'S BATTLEFIELD

07:32.033 --> 07:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFEATS.

07:32.633 --> 07:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WHEN THEY LOSE SOMETHING

07:35.767 --> 07:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE AS WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW,

07:37.800 --> 07:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY OF PALMYRA THEY DON'T HAVE

THE VOCABULARY TO ACCOMMODATE A

07:43.467 --> 07:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFEAT.

07:43.800 --> 07:45.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS THE GROUP THAT

07:45.767 --> 07:46.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTANTLY TELLS ITS FOLLOWERS

07:46.867 --> 07:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY ARE WORKING WITH THE

07:51.800 --> 07:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WRIT OF GOD WHEN THEIR DEFEATED

07:53.433 --> 07:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER WAY OF

07:54.867 --> 07:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPLAINING THAT.

07:56.067 --> 07:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME SOMETIMES THAT MEANS

07:56.900 --> 07:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTING PEOPLE WITHIN THEIR

07:57.633 --> 07:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OWN RANKS.

07:58.433 --> 07:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE MOST PART THAT MEANS

07:59.500 --> 08:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTING SOME OF THE LOCAL

08:01.367 --> 08:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGHTERS NOT THE FOREIGNERS.

08:04.167 --> 08:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS PROJECTS THIS IMAGE OF

08:06.600 --> 08:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A FOREIGN OCCUPYING FORCE.

08:09.100 --> 08:10.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Thompson: DO YOU THINK

08:10.267 --> 08:11.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE INTERNAL CONFLICTS HAVE

08:11.467 --> 08:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POTENTIAL TO FRACTURE ISIS?

08:13.500 --> 08:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MOST OF THE PEOPLE THAT I'VE

08:15.200 --> 08:17.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKED TO, EVEN THOSE WHO LIVE

08:17.367 --> 08:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER ISLAMIC STATE RULE, THEY

08:19.600 --> 08:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE

08:20.800 --> 08:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE OF A SYMPTOM OF THE DECLINE

08:22.400 --> 08:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF ISLAMIC STATE RATHER THAN A

08:23.767 --> 08:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSE.

08:25.467 --> 08:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, IT IS VERY TEMPTING TO

08:27.567 --> 08:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY THAT ISLAMIC STATE IS BEING

08:30.533 --> 08:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TORN FROM WITHIN, BECAUSE OF

08:31.733 --> 08:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS FRACTURE, BECAUSE OF THESE

08:33.567 --> 08:34.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FOREIGN

08:34.367 --> 08:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

08:36.133 --> 08:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S NOT REALLY THE CASE.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REALLY

08:39.633 --> 08:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS ATTENTION THAT IS EXISTED

08:41.467 --> 08:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN THE GROUP THAT'S BECOMING

08:42.900 --> 08:45.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE AND MORE ACUTE AS THEY LOSE

08:45.367 --> 08:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRITORY, AS THEY LOSE FUNDING.

08:47.233 --> 08:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE CAN'T REALLY TALK ABOUT

08:48.867 --> 08:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEMISE OF THE GROUP YET, WE

08:50.400 --> 08:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T KNOW.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION

08:52.433 --> 08:54.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN
