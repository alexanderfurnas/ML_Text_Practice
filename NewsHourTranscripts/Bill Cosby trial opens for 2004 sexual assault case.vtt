JUDY WOODRUFF: The trial
of comedian and actor
Bill Cosby got under way
in Pennsylvania today.

00:05.233 --> 00:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cosby, who is now 79, has
been accused by more than 40
women of sexual assault over

00:11.233 --> 00:12.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the course of decades.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His legacy has been under
heavy attack in recent years.

00:16.133 --> 00:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the charges are old and,
in many cases, the statute
of limitations has run out.

00:22.733 --> 00:25.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Pennsylvania trial
is the only one to
go to criminal court.

00:25.466 --> 00:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
If convicted, Cosby
could face prison time.

00:28.866 --> 00:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

00:30.933 --> 00:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This case
dates back to 2004, when Cosby
is alleged to have assaulted

00:36.966 --> 00:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrea Constand, who was
then an employee at Temple
University's basketball program.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Prosecutors say Cosby
drugged and assaulted
Constand at his home.

00:45.500 --> 00:49.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cosby has said he had a
consensual extramarital
relationship with her,
and has denied all

00:49.766 --> 00:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the allegations of assault
by numerous other women.

00:53.266 --> 00:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cosby, who starred as a father
and family man in his popular
1980s sitcom, arrived at

01:00.366 --> 01:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
court today with actress Keshia
Knight Pulliam, who played his
daughters on "The Cosby Show."

01:06.066 --> 01:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Maryclaire Dale of the
Associated Press has
long been covering the
case against Cosby.

01:08.833 --> 01:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She filed the motion that
unsealed an older deposition
that Cosby gave in a civil suit

01:15.266 --> 01:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's now a key piece of
evidence in this trial.

01:17.666 --> 01:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She joins me now from
outside the courthouse in
Norristown, Pennsylvania.

01:20.833 --> 01:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maryclaire, thank you
very much for being here.

01:23.433 --> 01:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wonder if you just could
tell us, first off, from the
prosecution's stance in opening

01:30.433 --> 01:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
statements today, lay out
the case that they laid
out against Cosby today.

01:34.600 --> 01:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARYCLAIRE DALE,
Associated Press: Right.

01:38.733 --> 01:40.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The case opened
very strong today.

01:40.400 --> 01:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lawyers on both sides
came out swinging.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The prosecution started by
talking about the key issues
in the case drugs, sex, and the

01:48.566 --> 01:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issue of consent.

01:50.633 --> 01:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They said that the accuser in
this case, Andrea Constand,
could not have given consent in

01:56.700 --> 01:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the case, given that Cosby,
by his own words, in his own
deposition, acknowledges giving

01:59.733 --> 02:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
her three blue pills before he
went with her on a couch and
molested her, in her words.

02:06.700 --> 02:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, he says that they
had consensual sex acts on
the couch that night, but the

02:11.066 --> 02:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prosecution says that she was
frozen, paralyzed by the pills
he gave her, unable to stop him,

02:16.933 --> 02:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
resist, refuse, or give consent.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And from the
opening statements on Cosby's
defense, what's the sense of how

02:24.400 --> 02:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're going to try to
rebut these allegations?

02:27.533 --> 02:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARYCLAIRE DALE: They're
pointing out discrepancies
in the women's various
statements over time,

02:35.133 --> 02:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying that the details have
changed, the dates have changed.

02:38.433 --> 02:43.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In fact, for example, in
the Constand statement
to police, she initially
recalled the incident

02:45.433 --> 02:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
occurring in March of 2004,
but later told investigators
it was January of 2004.

02:51.966 --> 02:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they're pointing out, you
know, time discrepancies,
other details, and
they're saying that both

02:56.066 --> 03:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women had consensual
relationships with Cosby.

03:00.300 --> 03:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They said that Cosby and
Andrea Constand had a romantic
relationship that spans at least

03:07.366 --> 03:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
several evenings, that
she had gone to the
casino in Connecticut
with him on one trip,

03:10.800 --> 03:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been with him on
several nights for
various social occasions,
and, again, that it was

03:15.033 --> 03:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a romantic,
consensual situation.

03:17.733 --> 03:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, the prosecution is
saying that there is no way she
can give consent after having

03:22.400 --> 03:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taken these pills.

03:24.433 --> 03:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Andrea Constand's case
is obviously echoed by
dozens of women who have

03:30.066 --> 03:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said over the years that Bill
Cosby did similar acts to them.

03:32.766 --> 03:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand that the
first witness today was
one of those other women.

03:36.766 --> 03:39.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can you tell us what
she testified to today?

03:39.566 --> 03:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARYCLAIRE DALE: Yes, the first
witness called by prosecutors
was the -- what we call a prior

03:47.133 --> 03:49.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bad act accuser.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She -- her name
is Kelly Johnson.

03:51.200 --> 03:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She worked for Cosby's
agent at the William
Morris agency in the '90s.

03:55.033 --> 03:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she described a similar
situation as to Constand, a day
where she says she was beckoned

03:59.733 --> 04:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to Cosby's bungalow at the
Bel Air Hotel in about 1996,
and says he forced her to take

04:06.800 --> 04:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a pill, a white pill, and then
that she says left her, again,
dizzy, falling in and out

04:13.766 --> 04:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of consciousness.

04:15.900 --> 04:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She says she later woke
up, hours later, perhaps
the next morning, on a
bed with Cosby, where

04:19.766 --> 04:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he was forcing her
to do a sex act.

04:21.800 --> 04:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But she says she really
resisted, tried not to
take the pill, tried
to put it under her

04:26.000 --> 04:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tongue, only to have him
look at her tongue and
insist on her swallowing it.

04:32.933 --> 04:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says she feared that she
would lose her job that she
liked quite a bit at the William

04:35.333 --> 04:36.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Morris agency.

04:36.433 --> 04:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The defense
questioned her timing.

04:39.033 --> 04:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They said that there
is a deposition that
exists, I believe in a
worker's compensation

04:43.033 --> 04:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawsuit she filed, in which
she says that she went to
the hotel with Cosby in 1990,

04:48.900 --> 04:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so six years apart on that.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They really questioned
her on other details.

04:52.866 --> 04:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she says -- for instance,
they said, didn't Cosby give
you $400 for your grandmother's

04:58.733 --> 04:59.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doctor's appointment?

04:59.733 --> 05:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She didn't testify to that.

05:01.833 --> 05:05.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says she never remembers
him giving her any money,
although she does remember him

05:05.266 --> 05:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
referring her grandmother
to a doctor's appointment.

05:07.366 --> 05:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, again, they're pointing out
the consistencies, some small,
some maybe less small, in their

05:14.833 --> 05:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statements, and while
the prosecution is trying
to say to the jury,
you really have to look

05:19.933 --> 05:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and try to focus on the
differences between the man and
the actor you saw on TV and the

05:23.766 --> 05:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
roles that he created.

05:25.633 --> 05:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I
understand that Cosby himself
will not be testifying.

05:29.333 --> 05:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the -- in an earlier
deposition that Cosby
gave -- this is the
deposition that you helped

05:35.766 --> 05:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unearth -- I understand will be
a key piece of evidence here.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can you tell us what
is in that deposition?

05:39.900 --> 05:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARYCLAIRE DALE: Right.

05:43.000 --> 05:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a deposition that he gave
in 2005 and 2006, when Andrea
Constand filed a civil lawsuit,

05:51.200 --> 05:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after prosecutors, at
the time, decided not to
charge Cosby in the case.

05:55.266 --> 06:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, in that deposition,
Cosby says that he,
again, acknowledges
having a long series of

06:02.266 --> 06:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relationships with young women,
actresses, waitresses, flight
attendants, various women.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Again, he says they were -- he
considers them to be consensual.

06:10.166 --> 06:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many of those women have now
come forward to say that they
believe they were drugged

06:13.266 --> 06:15.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and molested.

06:15.266 --> 06:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the big highlights
from that deposition was Cosby
acknowledging that, in the '70s,

06:20.866 --> 06:23.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he got quaaludes, a very
powerful sedative that
the U.S. later banned.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says he obtained them
from his doctor, at least
seven prescriptions.

06:26.866 --> 06:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says he got them in his
own name, but collected them
to give to women before sex.

06:34.266 --> 06:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was one of the
things that led prosecutors
in 2015, when this came
to light, to reopen

06:40.500 --> 06:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the case and realized they
still had time to charge Cosby.

06:43.933 --> 06:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They arrested him days
before the statute of
limitations ran in late 2015.

06:47.566 --> 06:51.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
All right, Maryclaire
Dale of the Associated
Press, thanks so much.
