HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.633 --> 00:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:07.666 --> 00:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
New revelations detail what
the Obama administration knew

00:10.933 --> 00:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Russian meddling in
the presidential election
and the internal debate
about how to punish

00:16.533 --> 00:19.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
President Putin.

00:19.100 --> 00:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm
Judy Woodruff reporting
from Colorado at the Aspen
Institute's Spotlight

00:22.933 --> 00:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Health Conference.

00:25.000 --> 00:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As Congress fights over
replacing Obamacare, we
tackle the controversy
over drug pricing

00:30.466 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with Stephen Ubl, head of PhRMA.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's the nation's
largest pharmaceutical
trade association.

00:36.166 --> 00:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN UBL, President
and CEO, PhRMA: We
think, as an industry,
the pricing model needs

00:39.700 --> 00:41.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to evolve.

00:41.733 --> 00:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to move away from
paying for volume to paying
for the value of care.

00:45.066 --> 00:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And uniting
a community through health
-- how one Muslim-based group

00:49.466 --> 00:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is bringing a Chicago
neighborhood together
by focusing on its
most basic needs.

00:56.533 --> 00:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAMAR HEMPHILLM, Inner-City
Muslim Action Network: How
you going to change anything

00:59.200 --> 01:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in your neighborhood if
you really can't start
with the place that really
sustains the neighborhood?

01:02.866 --> 01:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's the food.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

01:05.400 --> 01:08.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mark Shields and David
Brooks are here to
analyze the week's news.

01:08.266 --> 01:13.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:15.533 --> 01:18.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:18.300 --> 01:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
Senate Republican health
care bill has suffered
another critical defection,

01:28.000 --> 01:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the fifth so far.

01:30.033 --> 01:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nevada Republican Dean Heller
announced in Las Vegas today
that he can't support the

01:33.333 --> 01:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bill in its current form.

01:34.933 --> 01:36.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:36.933 --> 01:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEAN HELLER (R), Nevada:
Well, it's going to be very
difficult to get me to a yes.

01:38.566 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have a lot of work to do.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But you have to protect
Medicaid expansion states.

01:43.233 --> 01:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I want.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Make sure that we're taken care
of here in the state of Nevada.

01:47.533 --> 01:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's going to be a very
difficult lift, because I can
see the other side is going

01:50.233 --> 01:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to have problems with that.

01:52.333 --> 01:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Four other
Senate Republicans oppose the
measure over its subsidies.

01:55.933 --> 02:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But with Democrats united in
opposition, GOP leaders can't
afford to lose more than two

02:00.900 --> 02:03.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of their own and
still pass the bill.

02:03.966 --> 02:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump says he wanted
to force former FBI Director
James Comey to be honest about

02:08.766 --> 02:12.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their conversations when he
suggested there might be tapes.

02:12.066 --> 02:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke to FOX News after
announcing yesterday that
he didn't make recordings.

02:16.466 --> 02:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As for firing special counsel
Robert Mueller, he said --
quote -- "We're going to have to

02:21.100 --> 02:22.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see."

02:22.766 --> 02:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Later, the White House
said Mr. Trump has no
intention of doing that.

02:25.333 --> 02:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Cincinnati, the murder
trial of a former university
police officer ended today in a

02:28.833 --> 02:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hung jury for a second time.

02:31.033 --> 02:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ray Tensing killed an
unarmed black man during a
traffic stop in July 2015.

02:35.633 --> 02:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He testified that he feared
Sam Dubose was trying to
drag him or run him over.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After a judge declared a
mistrial today, Dubose's family
called it an unjust result.

02:45.300 --> 02:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
City officials urged calm.

02:47.400 --> 02:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN CRANLEY (D), Cincinnati,
Ohio, Mayor: As a city, we
will make sure that people who

02:51.233 --> 02:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are feeling a variety of
emotions, and, in my opinion,
justifiably so, have a right to

02:57.133 --> 02:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
express themselves peacefully.

02:59.600 --> 03:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have every expectation
that that will be the case.

03:02.100 --> 03:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The University
of Cincinnati fired Tensing
last year after his indictment.

03:06.866 --> 03:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
North Korea is denying
responsibility for the
death of Otto Warmbier,
the American student

03:11.600 --> 03:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it held for more than a year.

03:13.233 --> 03:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He passed away this
week days after being
returned home in a coma.

03:16.500 --> 03:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a statement, the North Korean
Foreign Ministry said -- quote
-- "The fact that Warmbier died

03:20.933 --> 03:24.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
suddenly is a mystery
to us as well."

03:24.233 --> 03:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia and three
other Gulf Arab nations have
issued 13 demands to Qatar.

03:28.700 --> 03:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have already imposed
an economic blockade,
accusing the Persian Gulf
kingdom of supporting

03:33.433 --> 03:35.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terror groups.

03:35.433 --> 03:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, they said Qatar must shut
down the broadcaster Al-Jazeera
and downgrade diplomatic

03:40.700 --> 03:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
relations with Iran,
among other steps.

03:43.033 --> 03:45.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Qatar said it's
reviewing the demands.

03:45.666 --> 03:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials in London
began evacuating five
apartment buildings late
today over fire concerns.

03:50.533 --> 03:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hundreds of people are
affected, and repairs
could take several weeks.

03:53.933 --> 03:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The buildings have siding
similar to a high-rise
that erupted in flames
last week, killing

03:58.733 --> 04:00.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
79 people.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Investigators confirmed today
that the siding on that building
likely contributed to the

04:03.900 --> 04:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
flames' rapid spread.

04:05.866 --> 04:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FIONA MCCORMACK, Detective
Superintendent: Preliminary
tests on the insulation samples

04:08.566 --> 04:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collected from Grenfell Tower
show that they combusted
soon after the test started.

04:16.533 --> 04:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The initial tests on
the cladding tiles also
failed the safety tests.

04:21.133 --> 04:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
investigators say the fire
started in a refrigerator.

04:24.633 --> 04:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're considering manslaughter
and other criminal charges
against companies that built

04:28.566 --> 04:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and maintained the
apartment tower.

04:31.633 --> 04:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Negotiations are officially
under way to sort out Britain's
exit from the European Union.

04:35.433 --> 04:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Today at an E.U. summit,
British Prime Minister
Theresa May promised no
E.U. nationals living

04:40.000 --> 04:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the United Kingdom
would have to leave.

04:42.633 --> 04:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
May called it a good,
constructive start, but E.U.
leaders were less enthused.

04:49.500 --> 04:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia's National Election
Commission has barred opposition
leader Alexei Navalny from

04:52.166 --> 04:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
running for president.

04:54.133 --> 04:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission says a criminal
conviction for embezzlement
makes him ineligible.

04:57.900 --> 05:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The anti-corruption activist
maintains the case was
politically motivated.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, U.S.
military leaders will seek a
six-month delay before allowing

05:06.333 --> 05:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
transgender people to enlist.

05:08.833 --> 05:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Associated Press reports
service chiefs are sending
that recommendation to Defense

05:13.166 --> 05:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Secretary James Mattis.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He will make the final decision.

05:16.133 --> 05:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A ban on transgender troops
serving openly ended last year.

05:20.100 --> 05:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The service chiefs want
more time to develop
policies on the change.

05:24.733 --> 05:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump has signed
a bill aimed at making the
government more accountable to

05:28.033 --> 05:29.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
military veterans.

05:29.733 --> 05:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vets and their families looked
on during today's ceremony.

05:32.366 --> 05:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bill gives the Department
of Veterans Affairs more power
to fire employees and protect

05:38.733 --> 05:40.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whistle-blowers.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
struggled to make any headway.

05:42.966 --> 05:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Dow Jones industrial
average lost two points
to close at 21394.

05:46.900 --> 05:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 28 points,
and the S&amp;P 500 added three.

05:51.466 --> 05:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
new revelations on the Obama
administration's response to

05:55.933 --> 06:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia; the head of the nation's
largest pharmaceutical group on
the battle over health care; how

06:02.800 --> 06:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Muslim group is
rebuilding a Chicago
community; and much more.

06:14.800 --> 06:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are new revelations
today about how President Obama
learned of Russia's efforts

06:18.733 --> 06:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to tip the 2016 election in
Donald Trump's favor, and how
his administration responded.

06:25.700 --> 06:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke a short time ago to
Greg Miller, national security
correspondent for The Washington

06:28.433 --> 06:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Post, who co-authored a lengthy
investigation that the paper
published today on this topic.

06:33.266 --> 06:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I began by asking about
the role Putin played.

06:36.666 --> 06:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG MILLER, National Security
Correspondent, The Washington
Post: In early August, the

06:39.333 --> 06:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CIA comes to the White House
with a really remarkable
piece of intelligence.

06:43.233 --> 06:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's drawn on sourcing deep
inside the Russian government.

06:45.833 --> 06:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It establishes that Putin
himself is directing
this operation, this
election interference

06:52.033 --> 06:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that is just unfolding
in the United States.

06:56.133 --> 06:58.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it goes one step
farther than that.

06:58.466 --> 07:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's what's
most interesting and
extraordinary to me.

07:01.900 --> 07:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It also captures
Putin's instructions
on what the objectives
of this operation are.

07:09.133 --> 07:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He identifies those objectives
as denigrating, damaging Hillary
Clinton, trying to help defeat

07:15.266 --> 07:18.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
her, and trying to help
elect Donald Trump.

07:18.566 --> 07:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You also
point out the levels of
secrecy and precaution
taken by the administration

07:25.533 --> 07:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the intelligence agencies
in how this information gets
to the president and even

07:28.333 --> 07:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how people need to talk about
it and share information.

07:31.700 --> 07:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG MILLER: Yes, it's really
remarkable, the precautions
that the administration was

07:37.566 --> 07:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taking with this information.

07:39.566 --> 07:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This intel, when it's delivered
to the White House, is brought
by courier in an envelope

07:45.733 --> 07:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with restricted markings on it.

07:47.766 --> 07:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's eyes only, which means
it can only be shared with
the four people who are named

07:54.066 --> 07:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the envelope, President Obama
and three of his senior aides.

07:56.600 --> 08:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They then they have,
when they're done reading
this thing, put it back
in the envelope, send

08:00.900 --> 08:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it straight back to the CIA.

08:03.000 --> 08:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It sets in motion a series of
meetings, high-level meetings at
the White House in the Situation

08:08.900 --> 08:11.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Room.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only four senior officials
are initially allowed
to participate, although
that circle begins

08:14.433 --> 08:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to widen in the ensuing weeks.

08:16.500 --> 08:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even there, there are things
that I didn't know about how
the White House works that,

08:23.466 --> 08:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apparently, in the Situation
Room, there are video cameras
that send feeds to other offices

08:29.433 --> 08:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the White House, so that
others sitting at their desks
can monitor what's happening

08:32.666 --> 08:34.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that room.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All those feeds were shut off
for all of these discussions.

08:37.133 --> 08:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The only time that had
ever happened before
was in the run-up to
the bin Laden operation

08:41.300 --> 08:43.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2011.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk
a little bit about what the
Obama administration tried

08:45.166 --> 08:46.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do about it.

08:46.866 --> 08:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They debated a menu of
options, so to speak,
for quite some time.

08:50.100 --> 08:51.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG MILLER: Right.

08:51.466 --> 08:54.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, they debated and
debated and debated.

08:54.566 --> 08:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That went on for months after
this bombshell intelligence
report from the CIA.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They got off to a fast.

09:03.600 --> 09:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are groups, NSC,
interagency groups that are
convening at the White House and

09:10.433 --> 09:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kicking around ideas that are
really aggressive, sector-wide
economic sanctions that could

09:15.800 --> 09:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put a dent in Russia's economy,
cyber-retaliation that could
take portions of Russia's power

09:21.366 --> 09:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grid or other targets
offline for short
periods, even releasing
embarrassing information on

09:26.900 --> 09:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin, the way he was sort
of accused of orchestrating
embarrassing leaks
about Hillary Clinton.

09:33.800 --> 09:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
None of those end up surviving
this debate process that goes
well past the election deep

09:41.066 --> 09:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into November and December.

09:42.800 --> 09:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You
also highlight kind of
bureaucratic hurdles.

09:45.300 --> 09:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Department of Homeland
Security goes out to
states that could be
affected by this hacking

09:49.366 --> 09:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and says, we would like to help,
but the voting infrastructure in
America is not deemed critical

09:55.933 --> 09:57.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enough?

09:57.966 --> 10:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG MILLER: Yes, and this
is one of those cases where
the hyper-partisanship of our

10:01.200 --> 10:06.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
country now really works
against our security
interests in many ways.

10:08.333 --> 10:12.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So this is a case where
the Obama administration
is just trying to reach
out to state officials,

10:14.033 --> 10:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying Russia's attacking
us, we are worried about what
might happen on Election Day.

10:19.766 --> 10:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to try to help
make sure that all of our
voting systems are secure.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We can run scans.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We can try to be
of assistance here.

10:27.100 --> 10:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Republicans in particular,
state officials, resist this and
see it as sort of an overreach,

10:35.333 --> 10:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an attempted federal takeover
of state authorities,
and argue against it.

10:42.400 --> 10:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
you point out that this is
in the backdrop of a climate

10:48.433 --> 10:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where there is an underlying
assumption that Hillary Clinton
is going to win, where Donald

10:51.366 --> 10:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has gone out and
said the election is
going to be rigged anyway.

10:54.666 --> 10:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And really not until after
the election does the Obama
administration start to put all

11:00.466 --> 11:03.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
these pieces together.

11:03.100 --> 11:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER: Yes, I don't
think you can overestimate
the importance of that,
because the assumption

11:07.933 --> 11:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the White House and
as well as across media
organizations like ours
and across the country,

11:12.966 --> 11:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
frankly, there was just an
assumption that we were looking
at a Clinton -- a coming Clinton

11:16.733 --> 11:19.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

11:19.233 --> 11:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, inside the White
House, their deliberations
are, well, this is all
important, but we have

11:22.466 --> 11:25.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
got to -- we're going to
have time to deal with
this after the election.

11:25.700 --> 11:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, if we don't finish
dealing with it, well, the
Clinton administration certainly

11:30.100 --> 11:32.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can.

11:32.700 --> 11:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, they don't
want to take any action
leading up to the election
that would be perceived

11:35.766 --> 11:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as interfering politically
to help Hillary Clinton.

11:39.466 --> 11:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're worried that
that would contaminate
her expected triumph.

11:43.133 --> 11:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Greg Miller,
the reporting is fantastic,
you and your colleagues, Adam

11:46.600 --> 11:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Entous and Ellen Nakashima.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks so much for joining us.

11:48.966 --> 11:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GREG MILLER: Thank you.

11:53.133 --> 11:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As the battle
over health care rages in
Congress, one constant complaint

12:04.333 --> 12:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from consumers is
over drug prices.

12:06.933 --> 12:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is in
Colorado with our look
at that issue -- Judy.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks, Hari.

12:11.900 --> 12:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers Association, or
PhRMA, is the nation's largest

12:18.000 --> 12:20.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
group representing
drug companies.

12:20.166 --> 12:22.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Stephen Ubl is its
president and CEO.

12:22.966 --> 12:27.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I sat down with him here
at the Aspen Spotlight
Health Conference today,
and began by asking

12:29.433 --> 12:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the latest Republican
plan to overhaul Obamacare.

12:31.466 --> 12:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN UBL, President and CEO,
PhRMA: Well, it's still a very
fluid dynamic, as you know.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We haven't taken a formal
position on the bill.

12:38.600 --> 12:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's clear there
is a direction towards
more autonomy for states
to shape their insurance

12:45.066 --> 12:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
markets, as well as shaping
their own insurance designs.

12:47.233 --> 12:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we will be very engaged in
this discussion, and the prism
with which we will look at it

12:54.100 --> 12:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is making sure that patients
have access to the breakthrough
treatments and cures our

12:58.066 --> 13:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
industry is developing.

13:00.233 --> 13:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other major
health care associations,
hospitals, doctors and others

13:05.800 --> 13:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have been pretty critical.

13:07.833 --> 13:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the pharmaceutical industry
alone in a way or almost
alone in not being as worried,

13:14.033 --> 13:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as critical of what the
Republicans are doing?

13:16.500 --> 13:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN UBL: Well, I think
it's fair to say that those
stakeholders are focused on the

13:23.433 --> 13:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
same issues that we are, but,
again, I think the bill is
still making its way through the

13:28.033 --> 13:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
process, and we will be very
engaged as the possess unfolds.

13:30.500 --> 13:34.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We heard
President Trump during
the campaign speak
about the high cost of

13:34.766 --> 13:36.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
prescription drugs.

13:36.866 --> 13:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess it wasn't long after
the election he talked about
the drug companies getting

13:40.466 --> 13:43.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
away with murder.

13:43.166 --> 13:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're now hearing, though,
that the administration
may not be coming down as
hard on the pharmaceutical

13:48.666 --> 13:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
industry as some thought
moving to a different system.

13:55.500 --> 13:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that your sense of what's
happening, that you're going
to get maybe a better treatment

14:00.666 --> 14:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from this administration
than some had expected?

14:02.766 --> 14:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN UBL: I don't think I
want to speculate on what the
administration will do in this

14:06.333 --> 14:08.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
area.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say that we had a
very productive discussion
with the president with
some of our leadership

14:10.933 --> 14:15.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
earlier in the year, and
I think the president's
focused on two things.

14:15.033 --> 14:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is ensuring that we
continue to lead the world in
developing better treatments and

14:19.166 --> 14:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cures and, two, on
jobs, ensuring that
we have more domestic
investment in the United

14:26.000 --> 14:27.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

14:27.966 --> 14:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think our industry
is really poised to deliver
on both those fronts.

14:30.066 --> 14:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our industry spends $70
billion a year in research and
development, which is more than

14:35.800 --> 14:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
any other industry.

14:37.333 --> 14:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, in general, we're encouraged
by the direction we're heading.

14:40.000 --> 14:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think everybody
agrees drug prices are out
of control in this country.

14:47.500 --> 14:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pfizer announced it's
raising the prices of
100 drugs by 20 percent,
including some well-known

14:51.300 --> 14:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drugs like I guess
Viagra and Lyrica.

14:54.866 --> 14:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Drug companies have been sued,
I know, by some state attorneys
general, alleged collusion

15:01.166 --> 15:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and rising prices.

15:02.533 --> 15:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is going on?

15:04.333 --> 15:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you see is
the problem here?

15:06.666 --> 15:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN UBL: Well, I
should start by trying
to make sure that we're
on the same fact basis.

15:11.600 --> 15:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you look at Express
Scripts, which is a leading
PBM in the industry, pharmacy

15:18.500 --> 15:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
benefit manager, looking
at spending in 2016, drug
spending went up 3.5 percent.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And net prices are
up 2.8 percent.

15:26.500 --> 15:31.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you went two or
three years, prescription
drug spending was actually
the lowest growing

15:32.900 --> 15:36.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or slowest growing
category in health care.

15:36.000 --> 15:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We did go through a spike in
2014 and 2015, I would argue,
due to some anomalous factors.

15:42.100 --> 15:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FDA approved a
number of new drugs.

15:45.733 --> 15:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Medicaid was expanded.

15:48.066 --> 15:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a new cure for
hepatitis C was introduced,
which revolutionized
the treatment of that

15:54.133 --> 15:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disease and will obviate the
need for liver transplant, as
well as reduce the incidence

15:58.400 --> 15:59.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of liver cancer.

15:59.900 --> 16:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're now on the back-half
of that spike, if you will.

16:03.266 --> 16:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The python has sort of
digested the tennis ball.

16:06.333 --> 16:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even CMS' own actuaries
estimate that drug spending
will be between 4 and 6 percent

16:11.200 --> 16:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the next 10 years, which
is roughly in line with
overall health care spending.

16:15.766 --> 16:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same
time, a lot of finger-pointing
going on in the health care

16:20.700 --> 16:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
industry between the drug
companies, the pharmacy benefit
managers, hospitals, insurers.

16:27.666 --> 16:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of those fingers
are being pointed, though,
still at your industry.

16:31.400 --> 16:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN UBL: We think
there are -- we take these
issues very seriously.

16:36.366 --> 16:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we think there are
pragmatic, consumer-oriented
solutions to address
some of the issues that

16:41.100 --> 16:43.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been raised.

16:43.133 --> 16:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, for example, a lot of the
media attention in the last year
is focused on companies that

16:48.266 --> 16:50.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are really nothing like
our member companies.

16:50.266 --> 16:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are companies that are
taking old drugs without market
competition and raising the

16:54.200 --> 16:56.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
price dramatically.

16:56.700 --> 17:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we think there are
policy solutions, primarily
at the FDA, that would
address those situations.

17:02.266 --> 17:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Similarly, we think, as
an industry, the pricing
model needs to evolve.

17:05.700 --> 17:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to move away from
paying for volume to paying
for the value of care.

17:09.900 --> 17:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I was reading
that's what the administration
is -- among the things

17:14.300 --> 17:16.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the administration
is looking at.

17:16.333 --> 17:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have also read, though,
that the critics look at that
and say that, in the end, it

17:18.966 --> 17:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may work for some people, but
it's not going to work for
everybody who needs prescription

17:24.433 --> 17:26.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drugs.

17:26.933 --> 17:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN UBL: Well,
again, our sector may
be a little bit lagging
other health care sectors

17:29.800 --> 17:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this movement towards paying
based on value, as opposed to
the volume of care, but it's

17:36.466 --> 17:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
one of the rare areas
in health care policy
where everyone agrees.

17:39.000 --> 17:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Payers want to move
in this direction, our
members want to move in
this direction, providers

17:43.266 --> 17:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
want to move in this direction.

17:45.266 --> 17:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Again, take cancer therapy.

17:47.666 --> 17:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We want to be able to
offer novel discounts.

17:50.633 --> 17:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a number of
public policy barriers
that stand in the way of
moving in that direction.

17:54.400 --> 17:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of
the fundamental questions
I have heard out there
is, why can't, for

17:59.233 --> 18:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
example, Veterans Administration
folks get drug prices much
lower than what ordinary

18:06.233 --> 18:08.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people can get?

18:08.333 --> 18:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why can't there be -- why
can't there be some sort of
movement in that direction?

18:14.466 --> 18:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why can't there be
negotiations with Medicare
over the price of drugs?

18:18.366 --> 18:21.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN UBL: I think there's
been a little bit of clinical
trial on this question.

18:21.700 --> 18:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you look at countries that
have adopted models like the
VA on a broad scale, the U.K.,

18:28.766 --> 18:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for example, what you find
is that patients have less
access to novel therapies.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we think that would be a
movement in the wrong direction.

18:36.733 --> 18:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the VA, keep in mind, is a
closed system, a small number,
relatively small number of

18:42.466 --> 18:44.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hospitals and consumers.

18:44.433 --> 18:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you take those price
controls and expand them to the
entire market, you're going to

18:51.466 --> 18:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reduce patient access and we
think create distortions that
impact the rest of the market.

18:56.966 --> 18:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we believe it's much better
to move in the direction of
negotiations in the private

18:59.766 --> 19:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sector between our members and
plans, again, to try to achieve
some specific metrics tied

19:06.766 --> 19:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to patient outcomes and then
be reimbursed on a differential
basis based on whether the

19:11.500 --> 19:13.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
patient actually
achieves those outcomes.

19:13.433 --> 19:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, opioids.

19:15.466 --> 19:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know very well, I think
something like 33,000 people
died from opioid abuse in 2015.

19:22.133 --> 19:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They expect the number to go up
last year, this year, and so on.

19:25.866 --> 19:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We know towns are overwhelmed.

19:28.066 --> 19:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Critics are saying so much of
this lies at the feet of drug
companies that are promoting

19:35.100 --> 19:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drugs that people get hooked on,
and then those same companies
minimizing or even trivializing

19:40.166 --> 19:42.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the impact.

19:42.266 --> 19:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you, as someone who
sits in such a responsible
position, look at this?

19:48.433 --> 19:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN UBL: I can assure you
that -- speaking personally on
behalf of the industry, that

19:51.900 --> 19:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no one trivializes the crisis
that we're facing in this
country around opioids.

19:58.666 --> 20:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But it is a
multifactorial crisis.

20:02.000 --> 20:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of stakeholders
that need to come
together on a solution,
prescribing physicians,

20:09.366 --> 20:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
manufacturers, treatment
facilities, state and
local governments.

20:13.633 --> 20:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for our part, we're
committed to engaging with
all those stakeholders
to find solutions.

20:20.266 --> 20:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is
there going to be a
change, do you think?

20:22.366 --> 20:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHEN UBL: Well, just to give
you an example, the industry is
in favor of mandatory training

20:28.600 --> 20:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for health care professionals
to learn more about pain
management, to learn more about

20:31.033 --> 20:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
appropriate prescribing.

20:33.633 --> 20:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we want to be part of the
solution to this problem.

20:36.166 --> 20:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stephen Ubl,
pharmaceutical manufacturers
association, thank you very

20:40.600 --> 20:41.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEPHEN UBL: Thank you.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's great to be with you.

20:44.666 --> 20:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some of the
most influential figures in
health care are here in Aspen,

20:48.400 --> 20:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we will air some of my
interviews with them from
Spotlight Health next week.

20:52.733 --> 20:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Plus, at the end of the
broadcast, we will meet
a choreographer who
explains why we always

20:58.933 --> 21:00.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
feel better after
dancing -- Hari?

21:00.666 --> 21:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

21:02.966 --> 21:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields and David Brooks
take on the week's news;

21:07.366 --> 21:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one reverend's mission to
bridge racial and class divides
through what he calls moral

21:12.833 --> 21:15.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
revival.

21:15.833 --> 21:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: The South Side of
Chicago has long been plagued
with some of the highest crime

21:19.933 --> 21:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates in the nation, but one
man is trying to transform
this area by focusing on the

21:24.300 --> 21:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everyday needs and the health
of those who live there.

21:28.133 --> 21:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our story.

21:30.133 --> 21:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Along this
stretch on Chicago's South Side,
Rami Nashashibi is a familiar

21:35.233 --> 21:37.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
face.

21:37.133 --> 21:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the founder of the
nonprofit IMAN, the Inner-City
Muslim Action Network.

21:43.200 --> 21:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for more than 20 years, he's
focused on the root problems
these neighborhoods face.

21:46.433 --> 21:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMI NASHASHIBI, Founder,
Inner-City Muslim
Action Network: So,
violence, poverty, lack

21:49.733 --> 21:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of real meaningful job
opportunities, lots of
young people with very few
meaningful trajectories.

21:57.933 --> 22:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This set of blocks was ravaged
by the foreclosure crisis.

22:01.533 --> 22:05.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Nashashibi
grew up the son of a
Jordanian diplomat.

22:05.566 --> 22:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He first came to the U.S. for
college, and later got a Ph.D.
in sociology from the University

22:11.166 --> 22:13.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Chicago.

22:13.166 --> 22:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He started IMAN in 1997 to
help bridge divides he saw here
between Muslim immigrants and

22:19.933 --> 22:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
African-Americans.

22:21.933 --> 22:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The organization has grown ever
since, and now has an annual
budget of nearly $4 million,

22:28.066 --> 22:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with funding from a mix of
grants and private donations.

22:30.966 --> 22:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is social activism,
he says, grounded in faith.

22:34.166 --> 22:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI NASHASHIBI: We have been
unapologetically rooted in the
values and spiritual tradition

22:41.100 --> 22:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that comes from the Muslim
community, while, at the same
time, acknowledging that so much

22:44.233 --> 22:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of that is also very universal.

22:46.766 --> 22:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One major
focus of the organization
now, neighborhood
corner stores, the small

22:53.000 --> 22:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shops that many here rely on,
in the absence of supermarkets
in these neighborhoods, but

22:58.666 --> 23:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
also places that have
historically generated
tensions between the
Arab immigrants who own

23:03.800 --> 23:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, and their
African-Americans customers.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMAN is trying to change that.

23:09.300 --> 23:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI NASHASHIBI: That corner
store doesn't have to be what
many corner stores in Chicago

23:15.866 --> 23:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are, often a place of death,
not a spot that you really
want to go into, that we could

23:18.700 --> 23:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
radically re-imagine it.

23:21.133 --> 23:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At the
Morgan Mini Mart in
Englewood, store owner Sami
Deffala, who immigrated

23:26.833 --> 23:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Palestine, is one of 60
store owners in the area who
have signed onto IMAN's corner

23:31.133 --> 23:33.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
store campaign.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMI DEFFALA, Business
Owner: We have been in the
neighborhood for 27 years.

23:35.933 --> 23:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The idea is to
bring everyone together around
a common need: fresh and more

23:41.533 --> 23:42.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
healthy food.

23:42.733 --> 23:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SAMI DEFFALA: We
have stepped it up.

23:44.733 --> 23:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With their help, we have been
able to acquire fruits and
vegetables that are subsidized,

23:49.933 --> 23:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a lot lower price, and,
in turn, we sell them
at a lot lower price.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, that way, it's
a win-win, right?

23:55.433 --> 23:58.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And
it's much needed, says
IMAN's Shamar Hemphill.

23:58.800 --> 24:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAMAR HEMPHILL, Inner-City
Muslim Action Network: You
know, it's a war on nutrition

24:01.300 --> 24:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's constantly killing
a lot of communities.

24:02.900 --> 24:07.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Black men die at higher
rates, contributed
to their diet, right?

24:07.533 --> 24:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How you going to change
anything in your neighborhood
if you really can't
start with the place that

24:13.700 --> 24:14.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really sustains
the neighborhood?

24:14.500 --> 24:16.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's the food.

24:16.933 --> 24:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sami Deffala
says, in the process,
a new trust has emerged
between him and his

24:19.866 --> 24:20.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
customers.

24:20.866 --> 24:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMI DEFFALA: People talk.

24:21.866 --> 24:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People in the community talk.

24:23.400 --> 24:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hey, listen, that guy is a
good guy there, you know?

24:25.900 --> 24:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You don't want to go
in there and do him
any harm or any wrong.

24:30.233 --> 24:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just a few
blocks away, IMAN also
operates a free health clinic.

24:37.200 --> 24:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here, physician's assistant Muna
Odeh, whose family immigrated
from Palestine, treats many

24:42.800 --> 24:46.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
like 58-year-old Jerome
Reynolds, a diabetic
without insurance.

24:46.366 --> 24:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MUNA ODEH, Physician's
Assistant: People who are
underserved and often forgotten.

24:50.700 --> 24:55.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of times, they feel
that they are not in control
of their situation, and not

24:57.600 --> 25:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in control of their health,
because of their limited access
to funds and insurance and

25:00.500 --> 25:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things like that.

25:02.500 --> 25:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Here, too,
there's an emphasis on
making better food choices.

25:10.933 --> 25:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's another benefit
to this interaction, Muna Odeh
says, a better understanding of

25:16.666 --> 25:17.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Muslim Americans.

25:17.933 --> 25:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MUNA ODEH: All they know
is what they see on TV.

25:19.600 --> 25:23.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, obviously, that's not
ever painted in the best light.

25:23.600 --> 25:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's especially important
for me, being a Muslim female
who's covered, who wears a

25:28.433 --> 25:30.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hijab.

25:30.366 --> 25:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It shows them that we
are the same, that our
struggles are all the same.

25:33.400 --> 25:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Dr. Angela
Odoms-Young, a professor of
nutrition at the University
of Illinois-Chicago,

25:38.033 --> 25:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is studying IMAN's work.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She sees positive results.

25:42.266 --> 25:44.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

25:44.600 --> 25:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA ODOMS-YOUNG, University
of Illinois-Chicago:
Traditionally, we used
to focus on individuals.

25:46.066 --> 25:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you make a good decision
when it comes to healthy eating?

25:49.366 --> 25:54.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We now know, from a
research perspective,
that community matters.

25:54.066 --> 25:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's really important that
you have access to fruits and
vegetables, not just what you

25:58.466 --> 26:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can do as an individual.

26:00.633 --> 26:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Odoms-Young
says that IMAN is helping to
break a long-held myth that

26:04.233 --> 26:08.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
residents of low-income
communities simply don't
want healthier food.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

26:10.333 --> 26:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA ODOMS-YOUNG: There's
many people in low-income
communities and communities of

26:12.833 --> 26:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
color that they are very
interested in having access
to healthy food options.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But one of the big problems
is the structural barriers.

26:21.466 --> 26:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Another
structural barrier being
tackled here, finding
jobs for men like

26:27.866 --> 26:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Khalid Partee, a former
gang member and drug dealer.

26:30.966 --> 26:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KHALID PARTEE, Chicago: I did
14 years in federal prison.

26:34.633 --> 26:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: After his
release, Partee earned a
technical degree in heating
and air conditioning

26:39.266 --> 26:41.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ventilation.

26:41.266 --> 26:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KHALID PARTEE: I graduated
in a year-and-a-half
at the top of my class.

26:44.033 --> 26:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He credits
Nashashibi with helping to turn
around his life and now teaches

26:48.900 --> 26:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
construction skills to men
recently released from prison.

26:52.400 --> 26:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of IMAN's reentry
program designed that
was provide both jobs
and to fix up abandoned

26:59.000 --> 27:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
homes in the neighborhood.

27:01.100 --> 27:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KHALID PARTEE: When these
guys come out of prison, if
we can try to get them a trade

27:04.333 --> 27:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quickly or get them accustomed
to being in a working condition,
getting up in the morning

27:11.200 --> 27:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and coming to class and getting
up, going to work, you start
making better decisions.

27:14.300 --> 27:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You top taking less chances,
because you have responsibility.

27:19.033 --> 27:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You have got more people
that rely on you now.

27:21.333 --> 27:25.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: For Rami
Nashashibi, it's all
part of meeting the
needs of residents in

27:25.900 --> 27:28.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these often-neglected
neighborhoods.

27:28.366 --> 27:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But even after 20 years,
he admits that far
more work is needed.

27:32.500 --> 27:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI NASHASHIBI: You know, for
every one person you're able
to employ, there's 50 that are

27:38.233 --> 27:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
looking for jobs.

27:40.433 --> 27:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For every block that you
stabilize, there's the sense
that there's 25, 35 blocks that

27:47.266 --> 27:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
need that exact
same intervention.

27:49.333 --> 27:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Undaunted,
IMAN is actually expanding.

27:53.733 --> 27:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's opened a new center in
Atlanta, and hopes to work to
other cities around the nation.

28:00.233 --> 28:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown in Chicago.

28:05.133 --> 28:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

28:13.666 --> 28:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

28:16.733 --> 28:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David, let me start with you.

28:18.766 --> 28:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start talking about
the health care plan that the
Senate rolled out this week.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You surprised at what is
different, what's the same
between the House bill?

28:24.400 --> 28:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I'm
a little surprised.

28:27.066 --> 28:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
First, it's sort
of Obamacare-lite.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not going to work.

28:31.533 --> 28:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's functionally
nonoperational, because
it will encourage, when
they're healthy, to

28:34.733 --> 28:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exit the system and
then go back into the
system when they're sick.

28:38.266 --> 28:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a recipe for a death
spiral in a lot of places.

28:40.433 --> 28:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think, functionally,
it's not going to work.

28:42.400 --> 28:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Politically, I have to
say, it's kind of canny.

28:45.900 --> 28:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mitch McConnell had these
two wings of his party.

28:48.866 --> 28:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think he steered as well
as is possible to steer down
the middle to give the right,

28:55.733 --> 28:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Ted Cruz folks the cuts
in Medicaid and Medicare
and stuff like that.

28:59.033 --> 29:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He gave the center basically
the structure of Obamacare
with some of the rules about

29:03.533 --> 29:05.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
preexisting conditions.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I think, politically,
it's an act of skill.

29:07.066 --> 29:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as I look forward, is this
thing going to pass, I still
think probably not because

29:11.800 --> 29:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think you can get the
whole Republican Party behind
this thing, but I'm reminded

29:16.400 --> 29:18.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not to underestimate
Mitch McConnell.

29:18.433 --> 29:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Have the
Republicans made the case that
this is something better or

29:21.766 --> 29:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just that this is not Obamacare?

29:23.566 --> 29:25.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: It's
not Obamacare.

29:25.933 --> 29:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What it does -- you ought
to start with, what kind
of country are we in?

29:29.233 --> 29:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're in a country where
-- widening inequality.

29:32.800 --> 29:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think it's possible to
be a conservative and to support
market mechanisms basically

29:39.266 --> 29:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to redistribute wealth down
to those who are suffering.

29:41.666 --> 29:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This bill doesn't do that.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It goes the other way.

29:44.700 --> 29:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think, fundamentally, it
doesn't solve the basic problem
our country has, which is

29:47.466 --> 29:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a lot of people are
extremely vulnerable.

29:50.000 --> 29:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I do think, as a solution
any the range of health care
problems, I don't think it's

29:53.800 --> 29:55.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

29:55.033 --> 29:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't even think
repealing Obamacare.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a cheaper
version of Obamacare.

29:57.866 --> 29:59.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark?

29:59.400 --> 30:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Two things
hit me, first of all.

30:05.966 --> 30:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We know there's been
no debate, no hearings,
so that's been a cry.

30:08.033 --> 30:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's interesting, because
there is no public case to
be made for the Republican

30:12.000 --> 30:14.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
plan, none.

30:14.533 --> 30:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, at least with
the Obamacare, Affordable
Care Act, you could
say, no lifetime limit,

30:20.466 --> 30:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a children -- children
could stay on their
parents' plan until the
age of 26, no preexisting

30:25.800 --> 30:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condition will deny you
coverage, no lifetime
illness will knock you off.

30:30.533 --> 30:31.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There was a case.

30:31.766 --> 30:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You could argue
against the case.

30:33.766 --> 30:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no public case
that has been made in either
the House or the Senate.

30:37.133 --> 30:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they hold no hearings,
and there is no public debate,
because they don't want to

30:43.800 --> 30:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
take the time to make
the case for it because
they don't have a case.

30:46.866 --> 30:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they don't want to give
the other -- opposition
a case to make -- the
time to make the case

30:50.633 --> 30:52.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
against it.

30:52.766 --> 30:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what it is, the only thing
that the House and the Senate
are consistently faithful on

30:57.833 --> 30:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is that it's a major tax cut.

30:58.866 --> 31:02.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a redistribution.

31:02.166 --> 31:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama, who was, you know, if
anything, overly moderate for
many tastes, did, in fact, lay

31:10.933 --> 31:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it on the most advantaged among
us to pay, to cover people
who couldn't afford it in

31:17.133 --> 31:19.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his plan.

31:19.266 --> 31:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And a 3.8 percent tax
on unearned income for
those earning over a
quarter of a million

31:25.333 --> 31:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dollars became the rallying
cry, the organizing
principle for the opposition.

31:30.233 --> 31:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the one constant
that has been through it all.

31:33.400 --> 31:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Warren Buffett, to his
everlasting credit,
pointed out that he
will get a tax cut under

31:37.866 --> 31:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republican plan
this year of $630,000.

31:44.900 --> 31:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the redistribution.

31:47.500 --> 31:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, in the
richest nation in the
history of the world, it
is a terrible indictment,

31:52.933 --> 31:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a sad commentary that the
most vulnerable among us, the
least -- the least among us

31:58.800 --> 32:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are really tossed off as
a political statement.

32:01.933 --> 32:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Well, what's
the Democratic counter to this?

32:04.500 --> 32:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I realize that they support
Obamacare at is core, but what
about the things that they

32:08.966 --> 32:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can agree on that
need improvements?

32:11.000 --> 32:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why not come up with some
sort of a counter and
a fix and propose that?

32:13.866 --> 32:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Good question.

32:15.833 --> 32:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's one of the reasons
there has been no debate is
threat at there hasn't been the

32:18.700 --> 32:20.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opportunity for debate.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have foreclosed it.

32:21.700 --> 32:25.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, no, the Democrats
have chosen to focus all
attention on the other.

32:25.866 --> 32:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's one of the
problems the Democrats have.

32:28.500 --> 32:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they learned this week
in the Georgia 6 that there are
limits to being against Donald

32:35.066 --> 32:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trump, although Donald
Trump expands the limits
on a regular basis.

32:38.833 --> 32:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are limits to
being against him as a
political strategy and to
have political relevance

32:44.633 --> 32:45.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to voters.

32:45.633 --> 32:47.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to be for.

32:47.366 --> 32:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What
do you think about the
likelihood of passage?

32:49.733 --> 32:53.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: You
know, I am not sure.

32:53.566 --> 32:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mitch McConnell is a
master inside player.

32:56.133 --> 32:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a terrible outside player.

32:58.066 --> 32:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He doesn't make a
public case for it.

32:59.833 --> 33:02.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But, inside, he knows
the Senate well.

33:02.000 --> 33:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, what, we have had now
five Senate say that they would
have problems with it, which

33:08.100 --> 33:10.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is sort of the
opening negotiation.

33:10.366 --> 33:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Dean Heller, who we
saw earlier in Nevada,
is in real trouble.

33:17.366 --> 33:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's up for reelection in
a tough state, in a state
that has expanded Medicaid.

33:20.033 --> 33:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, Medicaid, Hari,
I think, is health care
for poorer Americans.

33:26.466 --> 33:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what this plan does is
essentially starve Medicaid.

33:30.266 --> 33:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Senate does it slower.

33:31.566 --> 33:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The House does it faster.

33:33.066 --> 33:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He brought
up the special elections.

33:35.066 --> 33:36.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have had five now.

33:36.766 --> 33:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Republicans seem to be
holding, if not winning.

33:38.933 --> 33:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is this trouble
for the Democrats?

33:40.033 --> 33:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I think so.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think the Georgia
loss is a big loss.

33:43.300 --> 33:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it's, oh, this is
always a Republican district,
it's not such a big deal.

33:47.300 --> 33:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the Democrats are going to
pick up seats, it is going to
be in upscale, highly educated

33:50.900 --> 33:52.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
suburban seats.

33:52.500 --> 33:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this was tailor-made
for that, a seat that
Trump barely won.

33:56.833 --> 34:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if after all that's
happened in the last four or
five months, they can't pick

34:00.600 --> 34:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
up the seat, that to
me is an indictment.

34:03.133 --> 34:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's first a sign that
there are limits to being
anti-Trump, second, that
the Trump phenomenon

34:09.833 --> 34:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was not just a fluke, that it's
based on some deep structural
things in the economy that

34:13.533 --> 34:18.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are driving people to
support the Republicans,
some deep structural
things in the country,

34:18.033 --> 34:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people are
extremely distrustful of
government and extremely
distrustful of Washington.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also a sign that the
Republicans, despite all that's
happened, are still considered

34:26.833 --> 34:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the party of change.

34:28.533 --> 34:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if they want change,
they're still likely to
go to the Republicans.

34:31.066 --> 34:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, finally, it's a
sign the Democratic
Party is too coherent.

34:34.166 --> 34:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have got a Bernie Sanders,
which is strong and coherent,
but that's not the kind of wing

34:38.833 --> 34:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's going to work
in this district.

34:41.666 --> 34:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Democratic center,
aside from the one candidate
they had down there, is meager.

34:48.566 --> 34:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And without that, there are
going to be just a lot of
districts you're not going to do

34:50.166 --> 34:51.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
so great in.

34:51.666 --> 34:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark, he
had a four-point answer.

34:52.333 --> 34:53.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

34:53.166 --> 34:54.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: He did.

34:54.166 --> 34:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I will cut it down to two.

34:55.566 --> 34:56.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK?

34:56.966 --> 34:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
No, politics isn't
like the Olympics.

34:59.700 --> 35:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the Olympics, you
get a silver medal,
you get a bronze medal.

35:02.966 --> 35:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's only one winner.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And David's right.

35:07.233 --> 35:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Close only counts in
horseshoes and hand
grenades and slow-dancing.

35:11.333 --> 35:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming in second, and even
a good second and a close
second, doesn't do it.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Winning is coming in first.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the Republicans did win.

35:21.166 --> 35:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, yes, it's a district
that Mitt Romney carried by 24
points and John McCain carried

35:26.933 --> 35:28.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by 19 points.

35:28.966 --> 35:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one of the things that
turned out was, when you spend
that much money -- and give

35:33.300 --> 35:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Republicans credit.

35:34.633 --> 35:37.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They turned out the
Republican vote.

35:37.166 --> 35:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you spend that much
money, then the intensity
and the passion of the
opposition, who were

35:42.766 --> 35:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democrats in
this case, is kind of
neutralized by the turnout.

35:46.033 --> 35:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were 260,000 people who
voted Tuesday in a special
election, which is 50,000 more

35:53.166 --> 35:56.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than voted in the
2014 general election.

35:56.500 --> 35:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I mean, it was a
remarkable turnout.

35:59.433 --> 36:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can't argue that, gee,
if we just had two more days,
it would have been a -- I

36:04.200 --> 36:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think the Democrats have to
come up with what they are for,
what is it, rather than simply

36:10.366 --> 36:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
being against Donald
Trump, which is...

36:12.400 --> 36:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I do think -- I
would be curious to hear Mark's
view on this -- I do think,

36:15.800 --> 36:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on net, Nancy Pelosi can be
a very masterful leader again
inside, but I do think she's

36:20.566 --> 36:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
become a central liability
for people around the country.

36:24.133 --> 36:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the question will be,
OK, if they got rid of Nancy
Pelosi as party leader, would

36:26.933 --> 36:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the next person be
just as unpopular?

36:29.166 --> 36:31.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, potentially, but I
think potentially not.

36:31.433 --> 36:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I do think, if you're a
Democrat, you do have to think
about, who is currently the

36:34.800 --> 36:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
face of our party?

36:36.300 --> 36:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pelosi
says she's worth the cost.

36:38.800 --> 36:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well,
Nancy Pelosi, I have
said before, was the most
effective House speaker

36:43.433 --> 36:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in my time in Washington.

36:45.933 --> 36:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What she did -- we talk about
the Affordable Care Act.

36:48.266 --> 36:50.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Barack Obama didn't pass
the Affordable Care Act.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nancy Pelosi passed the
Affordable Care Act.

36:52.900 --> 36:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She passed it three
times through the House
of Representatives.

36:55.333 --> 36:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has raised $141 million
last cycle for Democrats.

36:59.733 --> 37:02.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sadly, tragically,
money does matter.

37:02.500 --> 37:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Ryan's political action
committee, with unnamed donors,
spent $7 million in this special

37:09.433 --> 37:11.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think, you know,
Republicans have been
running since 1984,
when Jeane Kirkpatrick

37:14.933 --> 37:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gave the keynote address
at the convention, against
San Francisco Democrats.

37:21.866 --> 37:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, maybe Nancy
Pelosi, not a dress designer,
and buy off the rack or whatever

37:27.400 --> 37:29.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
else, but I don't think
it's going to change.

37:29.466 --> 37:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't think she will be
the determining factor on the
ballot in voters' minds in 2018.

37:35.600 --> 37:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, some
of the statements that have been
coming out of the White House,

37:38.233 --> 37:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more specifically from Donald
Trump, yesterday saying he
didn't know that there were any

37:42.066 --> 37:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tapes or any recordings,
that he didn't make any, this
follows a dozen false statements

37:48.233 --> 37:50.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the rally that he
had in Iowa this week.

37:50.366 --> 37:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you kind of just go
right back to how President
Obama bugged Trump Tower or

37:53.433 --> 37:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the millions of illegal votes
for Hillary or the size of
the crowd at the inauguration.

37:58.433 --> 38:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Any structural consequence
to the office of this?

38:00.833 --> 38:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because it doesn't seem to
be having an impact on him.

38:02.933 --> 38:04.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

38:04.433 --> 38:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I wonder, what's going
to happen to our debate?

38:07.800 --> 38:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After Trump leaves,
whenever that is, do we snap
back to what we consider
the normal standards

38:14.000 --> 38:16.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of honesty, or is
this the new norm?

38:16.066 --> 38:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why, even though
it doesn't seem like Trump to
point out, as my paper did,

38:19.066 --> 38:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a long list today, the
definitive guide to the lies
of Donald Trump, I think it's

38:23.500 --> 38:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still worth making that case,
because a lot - - the thing we
have to fear most is essentially

38:30.566 --> 38:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a plague of intellectual
laziness, a plague of
incuriosity, a plague
of apathy about honesty.

38:37.233 --> 38:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And once the whole political
system gets affected by
that, then we're really sunk.

38:41.633 --> 38:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I do think keeping his
feet on the fire, no matter
how little he pays a price

38:45.700 --> 38:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for it, is still worth doing.

38:46.800 --> 38:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mark?

38:47.800 --> 38:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I would say this.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's paying a price,
in the sense The Wall
Street Journal/NBC
poll asked voters, whom

38:53.833 --> 38:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do you believe, James
Comey or Donald Trump?

38:56.766 --> 39:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And by a 2-1 margin, voters
believe James Comey, who, until
a month ago, was a villain

39:03.233 --> 39:06.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to so many Democrats because
of the Hillary Clinton race.

39:06.033 --> 39:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Overwhelmingly, Americans
do not believe that he's
honest, or he's trustworthy,
he's knowledgeable,

39:12.966 --> 39:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's experienced or he
has the right temperament.

39:14.766 --> 39:19.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
By a 48-16 margin, they
believe the opposite.

39:21.666 --> 39:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is a real
liability for anybody who
wants to lead a country.

39:23.766 --> 39:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But in that
same poll, you see that it's
78 percent of Dems, 26 percent

39:26.933 --> 39:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Republicans who have
that trust in that case.

39:29.766 --> 39:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Mark Shields, David
Brooks, we will leave it there.

39:43.566 --> 39:45.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

39:45.600 --> 39:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We hear a lot about how divided

this thing, if you will, called
the white Southern strategy.

40:33.633 --> 40:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the goal of it was
undermine black and
white fusion coalitions.

What we're going to do is,
we're going to figure out a way
to talk that makes poor whites

40:46.700 --> 40:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

because black people and
brown people are gaining.

make poor whites, who should
be allies with poor blacks,

40:57.833 --> 41:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think that their problem,
their poverty is being caused
because black and brown people

41:02.800 --> 41:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are acquiring something or
taking something from them.

Barber.

41:32.766 --> 41:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

conservative who had worked
both for the Moral Majority,

a political group associated

Until 1983, there was a sign
at the edge of our town that
told black people they weren't

JONATHAN WILSON-HARTGROVE: Sure.

42:05.466 --> 42:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

but Reverend Barber helped me
see that I was racist, and,

42:08.700 --> 42:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more importantly, that my
racism was getting in the way
of loving Jesus, which is what

42:13.600 --> 42:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I really wanted to do.

heard Reverend Barber
some 20 years ago at

a meeting called by the
North Carolina governor.

42:21.966 --> 42:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

a motivational speech to a
gathering of young people.

42:26.566 --> 42:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wilson-Hartgrove was moved
by what Barber said and began
to understand how racism had

42:32.433 --> 42:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been used as a tool to divide.

42:34.833 --> 42:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Growing up poor,
Wilson-Hartgrove had
never before realized
what he had in common with

42:39.466 --> 42:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
poor black people.

42:41.500 --> 42:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN WILSON-HARTGROVE: We
were taught to believe that
there were people who were

42:44.600 --> 42:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
poor because they
chose to be poor.

42:47.433 --> 42:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that narrative kept us
from seeing the way that our
religion was being used to pit

us against other people.

43:26.533 --> 43:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I said, listen, this
legislature just cut,
denied Medicaid expansion.

43:33.566 --> 43:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are 1,000 people in this

care, and they can't be black,

43:39.033 --> 43:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because there are no
black people are up here.

43:40.266 --> 43:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They cut funding for
public education.

43:41.333 --> 43:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You are losing teachers here.

43:43.733 --> 43:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they have to be white.

43:46.366 --> 43:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

told you they stood on prayer

44:02.500 --> 44:03.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that they had in common.

44:03.833 --> 44:05.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

investment, first,
some people laughed.

45:45.100 --> 45:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They said we were a nuisance.

45:46.900 --> 45:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But then they started
seeing more people come,
and they looked diverse.

45:51.000 --> 45:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said, that's my
teacher getting arrested,
that's my doctor, that's
a black man and white

45:55.633 --> 45:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

What can be learned
from our experience is
that white people need

46:17.066 --> 46:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to talk about race honestly.

46:19.933 --> 46:24.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We need to say, of
course we're racist.

46:24.100 --> 46:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

You know, it's not like
it's a personal failing.

46:28.166 --> 46:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I inherited this.

46:30.133 --> 46:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Racism is about structures
that pass on what
we inherited, right?

46:36.766 --> 46:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Inequalities that we
inherited are written
into these structures.

46:39.633 --> 46:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we help white people
think about that, I think
we're making it possible to

46:46.033 --> 46:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
form alliances that we
haven't been able to form.

46:50.166 --> 46:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

When black and white people
came together right after the

46:55.300 --> 46:57.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
changed this country.

47:21.200 --> 47:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a country that was
built on the original sin of
race-based chattel slavery.

47:27.066 --> 47:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is how the, you know,
concentrated capital
in this country from
the very beginning has

47:30.733 --> 47:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
maintained power.

47:33.233 --> 47:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't think that the
future of America is possible
without dealing with it.

WILLIAM BARBER II: I'm hopeful.

47:40.033 --> 47:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Optimism is a different thing.

47:42.000 --> 47:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe we have to be the
kind of what I call moral
dissenters, moral defibrillators

47:45.733 --> 47:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who shock the nation.

47:47.333 --> 47:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we also are seeing
something in the wind.

47:50.166 --> 47:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have white people marching
with Black Lives Matter.

47:52.533 --> 47:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had a friend of mine who's a
Sikh, and she put it like this.

47:55.533 --> 48:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quickly, she said, a tomb
is dark and a womb is dark,
but there's a difference.

48:02.233 --> 48:04.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A tomb is death, a
womb is possibility.

48:04.333 --> 48:06.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's dark now.

48:06.266 --> 48:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if we push and push together
and come together, I think
this is a birthing moment.

48:12.333 --> 48:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Charlayne Hunter-Gaul.

48:17.233 --> 48:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We go back
to Judy now in Aspen -- Judy.

48:27.100 --> 48:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks, Hari.

48:29.200 --> 48:33.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We want to introduce
you to Alonzo King, a
noted choreographer who
believes dance improves

48:35.400 --> 48:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
our spirits, and that
in turn has a direct
effect on our health.

48:39.733 --> 48:41.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take a look.

48:41.200 --> 48:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALONZO KING, Choreographer:
My name is Alonzo King.

48:45.066 --> 48:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm the artistic director
of Alonzo King LINES Ballet.

48:48.733 --> 48:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a San Francisco-based
international touring
ballet company.

48:52.466 --> 48:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were invited to the Health
Festival here at Aspen, and
I brought four dancers from

48:59.500 --> 49:03.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the company to do a
demonstration and talk
about how health and
art are intertwined.

49:04.866 --> 49:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My mother took
dancing at university.

49:09.433 --> 49:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when I was a kid, she would
show me things, and I had a
blast with intimacy with my mom.

49:15.600 --> 49:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Plus, I loved moving,
so I never stopped.

49:19.533 --> 49:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a triumvirate of
body/mind/soul that is in
a balancing act for health.

49:28.733 --> 49:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If something is imbalanced, then
it's with - - it's dis-eased.

49:35.666 --> 49:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The performance that we do here
on Friday is largely a lecture
demonstration, displaying

49:41.866 --> 49:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how dance is really ideas,
that it's thought made visible,
in the same way that music is

49:47.066 --> 49:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thought made audible.

49:48.833 --> 49:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Our hope is that the
mind will be stirred and
the heart will be moved.

49:55.833 --> 49:58.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And may argue with it.

49:58.766 --> 50:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You want them to hear it and
to have some response to it.

50:03.666 --> 50:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I first began
dancing, I had no idea
that it was a profession.

50:10.266 --> 50:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I just knew that it was
an experience that made
the outer world dim.

50:15.833 --> 50:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I felt larger and euphoric.

50:23.300 --> 50:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I realized that, when
you have that experience
inside yourself, you
know that every human

50:31.033 --> 50:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
being has that potential
for that experience.

50:34.966 --> 50:38.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Tune in later tonight.

On "Washington Week,"
Robert Costa's roundtable
of reporters put the GOP
alternative to Obamacare

50:44.133 --> 50:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
under the microscope.

50:46.133 --> 50:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Find out how your health
coverage could change,
depending on where you live.

50:49.200 --> 50:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's later tonight
on "Washington Week."

50:52.866 --> 50:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On "PBS NewsHour Weekend"
Saturday: Are privately
run prisons helping
or hurting the system?

50:59.866 --> 51:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And before we
go: On my way to Colorado this
week, I stopped off in Nebraska

51:05.500 --> 51:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for an exclusive interview with
the so-called Oracle of Omaha,
billionaire Warren Buffett.

51:12.566 --> 51:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had a wide-ranging
conversation, everything
from taxes to health
care, to why there aren't

51:17.300 --> 51:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more women in top
roles in business.

51:19.733 --> 51:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There was another report
that came out recently.

51:22.300 --> 51:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Fortune 500 boards
of companies, the number
of women directors, board
of directors members,

51:27.933 --> 51:30.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has gone down.

51:30.033 --> 51:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't see that many women
running companies, even as we
used to be, or maybe there are

51:34.266 --> 51:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a few more, but it's
not a dramatic -- what's
going on with women?

51:37.733 --> 51:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT, Chairman &amp;
CEO, Berkshire Hathaway: This
country made such a terrible

51:39.333 --> 51:41.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mistake.

51:41.300 --> 51:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We said all men are created
equal in 1776, and then we
proceeded to act like women were

51:46.800 --> 51:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entitled to be secretaries
or nurses or maybe teachers.

51:48.833 --> 51:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we took 50 percent of our
talent and put them on the
sidelines in this country.

51:55.733 --> 51:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's really a tribute --
it makes me very optimistic
about America, because at least

51:58.800 --> 52:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're getting to the point where
we're starting to use close
to all of our talent, compared

52:05.233 --> 52:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to when we initially said
50 percent don't even count.

52:07.800 --> 52:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I went to Columbia Business
School, there was one woman
in our class, Maggie Shanks.

52:12.133 --> 52:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My sisters, I have got one
on each side three years
about on each side of me.

52:16.366 --> 52:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they are both
absolutely as smart as me.

52:19.700 --> 52:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We ought to take an
I.Q. test together.

52:21.766 --> 52:26.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And my older sister
says I came close.

52:27.366 --> 52:29.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:29.366 --> 52:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WARREN BUFFETT: So, they didn't
have remotely the same --
they were told in millions of

52:34.800 --> 52:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ways, not by words, just by
all kinds of signals from both
parents and teachers, that they

52:41.200 --> 52:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were loved as much as I was,
but their job was to marry
early and marry well, and, for

52:46.033 --> 52:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me, the sky was the limit.

52:47.466 --> 52:51.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it was a very,
very, very unfair world.

52:51.800 --> 52:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is -- we have made
significant progress on that.

52:54.933 --> 52:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is more progress in
some areas than others, but we
have still got a long way to

52:58.733 --> 53:00.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
go.

53:00.000 --> 53:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
there was much more.

53:02.766 --> 53:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Part one of my interview
with Warren Buffett
airs Monday night.

53:06.633 --> 53:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's it from
Aspen for tonight.

53:08.833 --> 53:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:10.100 --> 53:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:11.533 --> 53:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," have a great weekend.

53:14.166 --> 53:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and see you soon.
