JUDY WOODRUFF: Much of the
president's agenda is aimed at
kicking the economy into higher

00:02.900 --> 00:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gear and creating more jobs.

00:04.900 --> 00:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just four months into office,
the president has made numerous
claims about the jobs he's

00:05.833 --> 00:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
created and the jobs he's saved.

00:07.866 --> 00:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's in Wisconsin tonight,
and is spending a good part
of his week promoting some of

00:12.000 --> 00:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his
job-creating initiatives.

00:14.233 --> 00:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what's the real record on
some of the president's claims?

00:17.600 --> 00:19.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
William Brangham takes a
look behind the numbers.

00:19.900 --> 00:24.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today,
the president repeated
a claim he's been making
for months: His policies

00:26.300 --> 00:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are creating new jobs that
far surpass his predecessors.

00:28.633 --> 00:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: I think probably
seldom has any president

00:32.933 --> 00:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and administration done more or
had more success so early on,
including a record number of

00:37.600 --> 00:42.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
resolutions to eliminate
job-killing regulations.

00:42.200 --> 00:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we see it all over the
country, where jobs are starting
that would never have started,

00:46.333 --> 00:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ever, under any circumstance.

00:48.400 --> 00:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Earlier this
month, the president claimed
he helped claim more than

00:51.933 --> 00:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one million new jobs.

00:53.466 --> 00:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: More than a
million private sector jobs.

00:56.833 --> 01:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But that
number was based on an estimate
from a payroll company.

01:00.633 --> 01:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. Labor Department
reported far fewer jobs.

01:03.766 --> 01:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This weekend, the president
correctly tweeted out a
lower number, 600,000.

01:07.266 --> 01:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN RATTNER, Former Adviser
to President Obama: In my 40
years of being in and around

01:11.100 --> 01:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Washington and economic policy,
I have never seen a president
try to take credit for as

01:17.733 --> 01:19.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
many things as he has
tried to take credit
for on the job front.

01:19.733 --> 01:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Steve Rattner
is an analyst and Wall Street
financier who also headed

01:23.400 --> 01:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Obama's Auto
Industry Task Force.

01:26.500 --> 01:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, in the four
months before President Trump's

01:30.200 --> 01:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
election, the U.S. economy
added about 840,000 jobs.

01:33.300 --> 01:38.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the four months since
his inauguration, it's
added about 600,000.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVEN RATTNER: The U.S. economy
is like a huge battleship.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't turn fast.

01:44.233 --> 01:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think to judge any
president by a few months of
results, whether they're good

01:49.466 --> 01:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or bad, is way premature.

01:51.566 --> 01:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Veronique de
Rugy, a libertarian economist
at George Mason University, says

01:57.900 --> 02:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
giving credit to a president
for job numbers, good
or bad, is misleading.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VERONIQUE DE RUGY, George
Mason University: It's wrong
to be thinking about the power

02:03.133 --> 02:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the president
in terms of jobs.

02:05.866 --> 02:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is important to think is
how -- what kind of policies
can be put in place to grow

02:10.833 --> 02:15.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the economy, and that,
in theory, creates jobs.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Since
he was elected, the
president claims he's
persuaded numerous companies

02:23.766 --> 02:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to keep and grow jobs here
in the U.S., but analysts who
have looked at these numbers

02:28.200 --> 02:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say they're not nearly as
clear-cut as the president says.

02:30.900 --> 02:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Take the president's claim back
in December that the heating
and cooling companies United

02:34.933 --> 02:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Technologies and Carrier would
be keeping jobs in the U.S.
and not sending them to Mexico.

02:39.766 --> 02:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I will tell you
that United Technologies and
Carrier stepped it up, and

02:46.866 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now they're keeping -- actually,
the number is over 1,100
people, which is so great, which

02:51.533 --> 02:53.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is so good.

02:53.566 --> 02:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: CEO Greg
Hayes told CNBC that a personal
phone call from the president

02:57.500 --> 03:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and his business-friendly
platform were important factors.

03:00.566 --> 03:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREGORY HAYES, CEO, United
Technologies: And he simply
said, "Look, Greg, I need you to

03:03.266 --> 03:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
re-look at the decision
to close the Indianapolis
factory of Carrier."

03:06.433 --> 03:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, "We're going to do a
lot of things in this country
that is going to make it a

03:09.566 --> 03:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lot more conducive
to manufacturing."

03:11.633 --> 03:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It turned
out, though, only 800 jobs were
staying in the U.S., while 1,300

03:17.566 --> 03:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were in fact
leaving the country.

03:19.633 --> 03:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those jobs that were staying
came after the company received
$7 million in tax incentives

03:25.166 --> 03:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from the state of Indiana.

03:27.233 --> 03:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another example, just a few
weeks before the inauguration,
Ford Motor Company announced

03:31.366 --> 03:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they had scrapped plans
for a new billion-dollar
plant in Mexico.

03:35.633 --> 03:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president hailed
the decision, but Ford's
then CEO, Mark Fields,
later said not moving

03:41.833 --> 03:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to Mexico was mostly
a business decision.

03:43.933 --> 03:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK FIELDS, Former CEO, Ford
Motor Company: Well, the main
reason for not building the

03:45.866 --> 03:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
plant and canceling the
plant in Mexico is just
due to market demand.

03:49.500 --> 03:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For critics
of the president, like Steven
Rattner, these claims are P.R.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
stunts to give the
appearance of action.

03:56.066 --> 03:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN RATTNER: My colleague
and I recently put together
a list for The New York Times

03:59.900 --> 04:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of every place he
had taken credit.

04:01.733 --> 04:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, in fact, he doesn't
deserve credit for any of them.

04:04.933 --> 04:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only jobs that he
can legitimately take
credit for saving were
those 800 jobs at Carrier

04:11.133 --> 04:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Corporation early in
the administration.

04:13.666 --> 04:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In one case,
the Trump administration's
claim about job creation
has blurred job categories.

04:19.533 --> 04:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT, Environmental
Protection Agency Administrator:
Since the last -- fourth quarter

04:21.466 --> 04:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of last year until most
recently, added almost 50,000
jobs in the coal sector.

04:23.833 --> 04:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last weekend,
EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt
made this striking claim, that

04:28.700 --> 04:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
50,000 new coal jobs have been
created, which would mean the
entire U.S. coal industry had

04:34.833 --> 04:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doubled in just a few

04:36.100 --> 04:38.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Months.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact-checkers quickly pointed
out that the vast majority
of those new jobs were not in

04:40.966 --> 04:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coal, but in mining.

04:42.933 --> 04:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other interviews, Pruitt
included both categories
in the 50,000 number.

04:46.100 --> 04:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT PRUITT: You know, since
last -- the fourth quarter
of 2016, Chris, we have had

04:50.900 --> 04:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
almost 50,000 jobs created in
the mining and - - and -- and
coal sector alone, in fact,

04:57.066 --> 04:59.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the month of May,
almost 7,000 jobs.

04:59.066 --> 05:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Despite these
claims, many economists say
that, until the president's

05:02.566 --> 05:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major economic policies on
taxes, regulation and trade
are in place, they can't make a

05:08.766 --> 05:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
proper verdict on
his job creation.

05:10.800 --> 05:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VERONIQUE DE RUGY: If you look
at the stock market, there
is just a lot of excitement

05:14.066 --> 05:16.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

05:16.100 --> 05:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The question is whether they're
going to be able to translate
these into realities, which

05:21.966 --> 05:25.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then turns into real economic
growth that is based on
something else but hope.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The White
House is planning on hosting
another set of CEOs later this

05:29.933 --> 05:31.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're
going to continue to
follow the jobs story.
