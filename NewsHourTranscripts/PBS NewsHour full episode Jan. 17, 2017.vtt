JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.239 --> 00:06.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.041 --> 00:10.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER, U.S. Ambassador
to the United
Nations: I think about Syria
when I go to

00:10.477 --> 00:12.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bed at night.

00:12.312 --> 00:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I sit down with
outgoing U.N.
Ambassador Samantha Power to
talk the crisis

00:16.717 --> 00:20.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria, the threat of Russia,
and more.

00:20.087 --> 00:26.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: how cities are helping
chronically sick
patients cut back on expensive
emergency room

00:26.426 --> 00:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visits by getting to the root of
America's
health issues.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BRENNER, Camden
Coalition of Healthcare
Providers: I think we're in a
20-year arc

00:33.200 --> 00:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of recalibrating and rethinking
what is health
and what is health care, what is
the purpose

00:36.470 --> 00:39.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our health care system, what
are we trying
to accomplish?

00:39.273 --> 00:44.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And The Obama
Years series
continues with a look at race in
America under

00:45.012 --> 00:46.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the nation's first black
president.

00:47.014 --> 00:54.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.821 --> 00:57.724 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.758 --> 01:07.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President-elect
Donald Trump
faces a growing Democratic
boycott this evening,

01:07.634 --> 01:11.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with his inauguration ceremony
just three
days away.

01:11.371 --> 01:16.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congressman John Lewis and
nearly 50 House
Democrats say they will not
attend.

01:16.743 --> 01:21.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lewis had said it would be the
first inauguration
he's missed in 30 years.

01:21.348 --> 01:26.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His office corrected that today,
but Mr. Trump
tweeted that the congressman's
statement is

01:26.453 --> 01:29.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- quote -- "Wrong or lie.

01:29.222 --> 01:35.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He boycotted Bush 43 also
because he thought
it would be hypocritical to
attend."

01:35.495 --> 01:37.931 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump followed up later on FOX
News.

01:37.965 --> 01:42.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: I think
he just grandstanded, John
Lewis, and then

01:42.269 --> 01:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he got caught in a very bad lie.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, let's see what happens.

01:45.472 --> 01:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As far as other people not
going, that's OK,
because we need seats so badly.

01:48.542 --> 01:50.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope they will give me their
tickets.

01:50.944 --> 01:56.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Trump flew to
Washington
tonight for a dinner honoring
Tom Barrack,

01:56.049 --> 01:59.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a longtime friend who heads the
Inauguration
Committee.

01:59.786 --> 02:04.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Russian President
Vladimir Putin
accused the Obama administration
of trying

02:04.725 --> 02:06.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to sabotage the president-elect.

02:06.560 --> 02:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin dismissed reports that the
Kremlin has
compromising information on Mr.
Trump, including

02:12.966 --> 02:16.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using prostitutes in Moscow
during a Miss
Universe pageant.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): I do not know Mr.
Trump.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have never met him.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do not know what he will do on
the international
scene.

02:23.910 --> 02:28.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So I have no grounds for
attacking him, criticizing
him for something or protecting
him in any

02:28.548 --> 02:30.350 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We won't even appeal to the
Nobel Prize Committee
if he is awarded with a Nobel
Prize.

02:33.086 --> 02:37.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
rejected Putin's
criticism, and said -- quote --
"There is

02:37.591 --> 02:40.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a pretty stark divide here."

02:40.427 --> 02:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama today commuted
the prison
sentence of Chelsea Manning for
passing classified

02:46.266 --> 02:49.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military and diplomatic files to
WikiLeaks.

02:49.903 --> 02:55.609 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The former U.S. Army
intelligence analyst
is serving a sentence of 35
years.

02:55.642 --> 03:00.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is one of 209 inmates who
received commutations
today.

03:00.747 --> 03:03.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Another 64 received pardons.

03:03.483 --> 03:07.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Charlie Savage is covering the
story for The
New York Times.

03:07.187 --> 03:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Charlie Savage, remind us what
Chelsea Manning
was originally charged with.

03:10.490 --> 03:12.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE, The New York
Times: Hi.

03:12.225 --> 03:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Yes, thanks for having me on.

03:14.061 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when Chelsea Manning was
arrested in 2010
and charged with passing
documents to WikiLeaks,

03:19.900 --> 03:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she was charged with numerous
accounts of
violating the Espionage Act and
also was charged

03:25.806 --> 03:31.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with aiding the enemy, which is
essentially
the military justice system's
version of treason.

03:31.244 --> 03:36.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was convicted of the
Espionage Act charges,
most of them, but was acquitted
of aiding

03:36.850 --> 03:38.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the enemy.

03:38.652 --> 03:43.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she was sentenced to 35
years in prison,
which is dramatically longer
than any other

03:43.790 --> 03:48.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prison sentence ever carried out
in the American
justice system for a leak case.

03:48.328 --> 03:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do we know
why the president
decided to commute her sentence?

03:52.699 --> 03:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: So, there was a
briefing call
with senior White House
officials after the

03:58.738 --> 04:01.241 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
commutations and pardons were
announced.

04:01.274 --> 04:05.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the senior White House
official -- we
were not allowed to name them
under the ground

04:05.245 --> 04:08.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rules -- described a little bit
of the president's
thinking about this.

04:08.448 --> 04:15.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, well, she admitted that
what she
had done was wrong and
apologized for it,

04:15.555 --> 04:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and she expressed remorse and
has now been
serving nearly seven years in
prison for it.

04:23.497 --> 04:29.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most people who have been
convicted in
leak cases -- there has been
about a dozen,

04:29.035 --> 04:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most of them in the last eight
years -- have
been convicted -- have been
sentenced to one,

04:33.874 --> 04:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
two, or three years, not 35.

04:36.510 --> 04:42.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so part of this was also the
equity of
making this sentence more in the
range of

04:42.949 --> 04:45.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what other people accused of
similar conduct
have received.

04:45.585 --> 04:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the question
is, what signal
does this send?

04:48.889 --> 04:53.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, the speaker of the
House, Paul Ryan,
has issued a statement saying --
quote -- "This

04:53.226 --> 04:54.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is just outrageous."

04:54.995 --> 04:59.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says: "Chelsea Manning's
treachery put
American lives at risk and
exposed some of

04:59.166 --> 05:01.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
our nation's most sensitive
secrets."

05:01.134 --> 05:04.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he says, "The president now
leaves in
place a dangerous precedent that
those who

05:05.005 --> 05:09.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compromise our national security
won't be
held accountable for their
crimes."

05:09.442 --> 05:14.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: That's one of
many statements
like that coming out of
Republicans on the

05:14.214 --> 05:15.982 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hill.

05:16.016 --> 05:19.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We haven't heard yet from
president-elect
Trump on this, but that
statement is reflected

05:19.553 --> 05:23.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by what other people like
Senator McCain and
others have said.

05:23.256 --> 05:28.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say, as a point of just
clarification,
none of the documents that
Chelsea Manning

05:28.595 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaked were classified above the
nearly classified
level.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is to say, none of them
were top-secret.

05:34.768 --> 05:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was another thing that the
White House
discussed today in comparing her
to Edward

05:39.206 --> 05:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Snowden, who President Obama
declined to pardon.

05:43.043 --> 05:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to say they're some of the
most sensitive
secrets is an exaggeration.

05:47.214 --> 05:53.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also military prosecutors at
her court-martial
didn't accuse her or present any
evidence

05:53.620 --> 05:57.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that anyone was actually killed
as a result
of her leaks.

05:57.123 --> 06:04.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the other hand, the
government did scramble
afterward to move some people
out of potential

06:04.698 --> 06:09.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harm's way who were named in
some of the documents
as having helped American
diplomats or troops

06:09.970 --> 06:14.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in very dangerous countries,
lest they come
to harm.

06:14.040 --> 06:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the fact that no one was
killed didn't
mean that it wasn't indeed
putting some people

06:18.345 --> 06:19.312 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at risk.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she has apologized for
having done that.

06:20.914 --> 06:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Charlie Savage
with The New
York Times, thank you very much.

06:24.417 --> 06:26.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SAVAGE: Thank you.

06:26.286 --> 06:31.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also tonight, new
numbers are
out on the consequences of
repealing Obamacare.

06:31.491 --> 06:36.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Congressional Budget Office
assessed a
2016 bill that is the starting
point for this

06:36.363 --> 06:38.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
year's effort.

06:38.131 --> 06:43.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It found some 18 million
Americans would lose
coverage within a year of
repeal, if there

06:43.403 --> 06:45.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is no replacement.

06:45.071 --> 06:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The number would climb to 32
million by 2026,
again, assuming nothing replaces
it.

06:51.645 --> 06:55.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans insisted today that
they will
have a replacement.

06:55.248 --> 07:00.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The nominee to be secretary of
the U.S. Interior
Department says it's -- quote --
"indisputable"

07:00.854 --> 07:05.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that climate change is
happening, and that
humans are a big cause.

07:05.492 --> 07:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Montana Representative Ryan
Zinke spoke today
at his Senate confirmation
hearing.

07:10.463 --> 07:15.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders
pressed him
on president-elect Trump's
assertion that

07:15.435 --> 07:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
climate change is a hoax.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.405 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN ZINKE (R), Montana: I don't
believe it's
a hoax.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I believe we should...

07:21.141 --> 07:22.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont: You
do not believe
it's a hoax?

07:23.143 --> 07:24.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:24.144 --> 07:25.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
RYAN ZINKE: No.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I believe we should be prudent
to be prudent.

07:26.146 --> 07:27.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That means, I don't know
definitively.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.982 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:29.015 --> 07:32.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: If climate
change is already
causing devastating problems,
should we allow

07:32.585 --> 07:36.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fossil fuel to be drilled on
public lands?

07:36.423 --> 07:37.590 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:37.624 --> 07:40.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RYAN ZINKE: Again, we need an
economy and
jobs, too.

07:40.126 --> 07:45.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Zinke also said
he is open
to drilling more on public
lands, and that

07:45.465 --> 07:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will review President Obama's

In Turkey, authorities confirmed
they have
arrested an Uzbek national, and
said he confessed

07:55.675 --> 08:00.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to killing 39 people at an
Istanbul club early
on New Year's Day.

08:00.680 --> 08:06.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The alleged gunman was captured
late Monday
at this apartment in Istanbul's
suburbs.

08:06.186 --> 08:11.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The city's governor said
fingerprints there
matched prints from the crime
scene.

08:11.825 --> 08:18.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The search for a Malaysian
Airlines plane
has ended after three years,
$160 million

08:18.498 --> 08:20.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and no answers.

08:20.300 --> 08:26.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ships with high-tech gear
covered, in all,
nearly 50,000 square miles in
the Indian Ocean

08:26.373 --> 08:28.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
west of Australia.

08:28.241 --> 08:33.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, despite complaints from
family members,
Malaysia, Australia and China
shut down the

08:33.847 --> 08:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
official hunt for Flight 370 and
all 239 people
it carried.

08:39.185 --> 08:43.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There has been a new migrant
disaster in the
Mediterranean.

08:43.223 --> 08:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The International Organization
for Migration
reports that almost 180 people
apparently

08:48.661 --> 08:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drowned when a boat capsized off
Libya over
the weekend.

08:52.766 --> 08:57.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is based on interviews with
a handful
of survivors.

08:57.170 --> 09:02.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
British Prime Minister Theresa
May declared
today that her government wants
a clean break

09:02.208 --> 09:03.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the European Union.

09:04.010 --> 09:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
May laid out her thinking, as
Britain gets
ready to negotiate terms for
leaving the E.U.

09:09.349 --> 09:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She confirmed it means an end to
Britain's
role in Europe's single market
and to travel

09:14.954 --> 09:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without passports, but she also
issued a warning.

09:18.091 --> 09:21.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: I know
there are some voices calling
for a punitive

09:21.428 --> 09:28.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deal that punishes Britain and
discourages
other countries from taking the
same path.

09:28.768 --> 09:33.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That would be an act of
calamitous self-harm
for the countries of Europe, and
it wouldn't

09:34.007 --> 09:36.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be the act of a friend.

09:36.743 --> 09:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Britain wouldn't, indeed, we
could not accept
such an approach.

09:40.747 --> 09:46.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: May also promised
that Parliament
will be able to vote on the
final deal, likely

09:46.186 --> 09:48.288 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2019.

09:48.321 --> 09:53.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, big
automakers are announcing
plans for expansions, under
pressure from

09:53.326 --> 09:55.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president-elect Trump.

09:55.161 --> 09:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hyundai says that it will boost
its investment
in U.S. plants by 50 percent
over the next

09:59.999 --> 10:01.701 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
four years.

10:01.734 --> 10:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And General Motors will spend an
additional
$1 billion on its U.S. factories
this year.

10:07.774 --> 10:12.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today, the
Dow Jones industrial

19826.

10:13.913 --> 10:19.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 35, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
six.

10:19.752 --> 10:24.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I sit down
with U.N. Ambassador Samantha
Power in her

10:24.324 --> 10:31.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last days in office; the choice
for secretary
of education faces the Senate;
reducing health

10:31.264 --> 10:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care costs by focusing on the
sickest patients;
and much more.

10:41.307 --> 10:48.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care costs by focusing on the
sickest patients;
and much more.

10:48.047 --> 10:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President-elect Trump's nominee
to be U.S.
ambassador to the U.N., South
Carolina Governor

10:52.785 --> 11:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nikki Haley, plans to question
why the U.S.
contributes 22 percent of the
U.N.'s budget.

11:00.093 --> 11:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In prepared remarks for her
confirmation hearing
tomorrow, we also learned that
she will criticize

11:05.865 --> 11:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the recent vote condemning
Israeli settlements.

11:10.603 --> 11:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Earlier today, I sat down with
Samantha Power.

11:13.206 --> 11:16.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She's the outgoing U.S.
ambassador to the
U.N.

11:16.042 --> 11:17.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We spoke at the State
Department.

11:17.911 --> 11:23.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I began by asking why, in
her final speech,
she focused on Russia as a major
threat to

11:23.316 --> 11:25.151 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the U.S.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER, U.S. Ambassador
to the United
Nations: There is a fair amount
of competition,

11:27.120 --> 11:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
obviously, with ISIL and the
terrorist networks
around the world, China also
posing a different

11:32.492 --> 11:35.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of threat to the
rules-based order.

11:35.895 --> 11:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I thought it was very
important before
leaving to draw on my eight
years, our eight

11:41.634 --> 11:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years here in these jobs of
privilege that
we have had, to take note of the
pattern that

11:48.908 --> 11:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has developed, particularly in
the last few
years, starting with the
decision by President

11:53.880 --> 12:01.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Putin to go into Ukraine, to lie
about it,
to take Crimea, to try to annex
it, and then

12:01.187 --> 12:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria to back a regime that
gasses its
people, then to get militarily
involved with

12:05.592 --> 12:12.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that regime, itself resorting to
tactics that
were outlawed 100 years ago, and
then systematically,

12:12.498 --> 12:17.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Europe, backing these
illiberal parties
whose world view is closer to
this kind of

12:17.670 --> 12:26.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
populist authoritarian,
anti-Muslim, anti-diversity
kind of line that has been
pursued in Moscow.

12:26.613 --> 12:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of that plus, of course, the
most recent
and most egregious example that
hits close

12:32.652 --> 12:38.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to home for us, which is
interfering in our
elections through hacking,
through fake news,

12:38.191 --> 12:40.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and with an eye to trying to
help one candidate
win.

12:40.627 --> 12:45.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, when the
president-elect
speaks, as he has often, about
wanting a better

12:45.898 --> 12:51.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationship with Russia -- and,
in fact,
one of his advisers has just
said in the last

12:51.904 --> 12:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day or so, he said, the U.S.
needs to find
a way to get along better with
Russia.

12:57.010 --> 13:03.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, we need to focus less
on combating
communism and more on rejecting
radical Islam.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you react to that?

13:05.485 --> 13:08.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, let me
raise my hand
and say at no point have I been
fighting the

13:08.821 --> 13:12.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last war and seeking at the U.N.
to combat
communism.

13:13.026 --> 13:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we do have an interest
in combating
states that try to cross borders
and steal

13:17.397 --> 13:19.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parts of other people's country.

13:19.132 --> 13:23.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have an interest in combating
tactics in
war that are abhorrent and that
only fuel

13:23.102 --> 13:26.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism because they incite
people on the
ground.

13:26.539 --> 13:30.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we, as Americans, have an
interest in
ensuring that the only people
who get to vote

13:30.710 --> 13:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for our elected leaders are our
citizens,
and not some foreign people who
think that

13:40.119 --> 13:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have an interest in skewing
our election
in one direction or another.

13:43.589 --> 13:48.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I think the point that we
all agree
upon is that we have to engage
with Russia.

13:48.528 --> 13:52.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have spent, you know, as much
time with
my Russian counterpart as I have
probably

13:52.965 --> 13:57.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with anybody else, including
close family
members, over the course of the
last fur years.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have done really
important work together.

13:59.439 --> 14:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time we're at each
other on Aleppo,
on Ukraine, we're authorizing
peacekeeping

14:04.977 --> 14:09.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
missions, putting sanctions in
place on North
Korea for its nuclear tests.

14:09.582 --> 14:13.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to find means for
cooperation.

14:13.252 --> 14:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the potential difference
or the issue
that is going to need to be
adjudicated is,

14:20.426 --> 14:22.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on what terms?

14:22.228 --> 14:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we going to bring historical
amnesia and
pretend as though history is
just starting

14:27.633 --> 14:33.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on January 21, or are we going
to take into
account egregious violations of
the rules

14:33.439 --> 14:38.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the road that may have -- in
the first
instance have predated the
administration,

14:38.311 --> 14:42.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but that are inevitably going to
continue
if Russia believes that there
are no costs

14:42.648 --> 14:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to its actions, as if all it has
to do is
just wait out the United States,
and then

14:47.353 --> 14:49.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eventually we will soften our
positions and
forget about what happened?

14:50.022 --> 14:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it sounds
like you're worried
the next administration may be
prepared to

14:53.059 --> 14:54.293 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do that.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, I think
the signals
are very mixed.

14:56.162 --> 15:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that the only time
we will really
know what then-President Trump
is going to

15:02.301 --> 15:08.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do about the set of challenges
that confront
him is after he has sat down
with his advisers

15:08.641 --> 15:13.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the commander in chief, when
he's looking
at the threats and the
intelligence from the

15:13.946 --> 15:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standpoint of being the number
one decider,
when he's hearing from his
secretary of defense,

15:18.985 --> 15:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his chairman, who was the same
chairman President
Obama had, Chairman Joe Dunford,
who is an

15:23.956 --> 15:28.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outstanding public servant, who
has led our
anti-ISIL effort, on which we're
making great

15:28.561 --> 15:30.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
progress.

15:30.429 --> 15:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the president, when he is
the president,
will be also developing close
relations with

15:35.635 --> 15:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a series of other world leaders.

15:37.503 --> 15:43.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he will be hearing from some
of our closest
European friends and partners
about just how

15:43.342 --> 15:45.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
real the threat feels to them.

15:45.211 --> 15:49.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You used as one
of your examples
of Russian aggression the fact
that they stood

15:49.916 --> 15:55.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by as Syria repeatedly used --
the Syrian
regime repeatedly used chemical
weapons in

15:55.955 --> 15:57.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the civil war.

15:57.790 --> 16:02.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If that's the case, then how
does that square
with the decision by the Obama
administration

16:02.662 --> 16:10.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2013 not to have a military
response, the
red line, when President Obama
was seriously

16:10.670 --> 16:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
considering doing so and then
didn't?

16:12.738 --> 16:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, the regime
-- when chemical
weapons were used in 2013,
Russia was absolutely

16:20.880 --> 16:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
backing the Syrian regime at
that time.

16:23.149 --> 16:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were denouncing the -- of
course, the
gassing of more than 1,000
innocent civilians.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we denounced Russia's
support for that
regime.

16:31.691 --> 16:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When President Obama came out
and said he
was going to use military force,
that, as

16:37.296 --> 16:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, was what brought
Russia forward
to say, hey, hey, hey, wait,
maybe not that

16:41.200 --> 16:43.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quite -- why don't we try
something else?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybe we can work together.

16:45.404 --> 16:48.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe we can take advantage of
the fact we're,
in effect, the benefactor or the
sponsor of

16:48.975 --> 16:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this regime, where, if you don't
use military
force, we will work with you to
destroy the

16:54.180 --> 16:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chemical weapons program.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, interestingly, to this day,
even though
Russia took away the chemical
weapons program,

17:00.019 --> 17:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
declared chemical weapons
program by the regime,
Russia, to this day, denies that
it was the

17:05.925 --> 17:07.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
regime that used chemical
weapons.

17:07.660 --> 17:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it just shows you again how
loose they
are with the truth and how
absurd sometimes

17:12.064 --> 17:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their argument can be.

17:14.100 --> 17:20.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I mentioned the sequence
specifically
because I think there is a
misconception,

17:20.840 --> 17:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as we look back at that moment
and the red
line.

17:23.342 --> 17:25.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I know people have
very strong views
about it.

17:25.611 --> 17:31.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it wasn't the case that we
had before
us a set of targets that would
have eliminated

17:31.317 --> 17:32.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the chemical weapons program.

17:33.019 --> 17:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, we had to stay miles
away when we
struck from the chemical weapons
storage,

17:37.256 --> 17:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for fear of causing terrible
collateral damage
to civilians and so forth.

17:41.327 --> 17:46.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think reasonable people,
you know, can
look back and say, look, had we
bombed, maybe

17:46.065 --> 17:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things would have turned, and
the opposition
would have started to make gains
on the ground.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you could say they would
have just used
their chemical weapons.

17:52.939 --> 17:57.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the weapon itself was not
something that
our bombing was in a position to
do much about.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Syria is such a
big question.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: And a big mess,
yes.

18:01.447 --> 18:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still a big mess.

18:03.316 --> 18:07.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president and the vice
president and others
have been talking about it in
the last few

18:07.453 --> 18:09.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

18:09.288 --> 18:12.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a book that you wrote before
coming into
the administration, you talked
about how the

18:12.491 --> 18:18.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. historically lacked the
will to intervene
to stop mass atrocities, often
because of

18:18.965 --> 18:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political expediency.

18:20.933 --> 18:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people are certainly
looking at what
the Obama administration didn't
do in the

18:26.305 --> 18:32.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
early days of the Syrian
situation to stop
the killing of civilians.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you square those two
things?

18:34.413 --> 18:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Well, first, I
can tell you
that, in Syria, the president
did everything

18:42.088 --> 18:44.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he could, short of intervening
militarily.

18:44.890 --> 18:47.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so people say, oh, he should
create a
safe haven.

18:47.259 --> 18:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think those are reasonable
arguments, and
we will debate this.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Historians will debate it.

18:52.665 --> 18:56.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But there is a very real
question about, in
creating a safe haven, that
means taking out

18:56.202 --> 18:59.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian air force, because
they're bombing
civilians.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What would then have unfolded,
right?

19:01.173 --> 19:03.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are thousands of armed
groups on the
ground.

19:03.809 --> 19:11.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a sectarian, you know,
heterogeneity
that's very hard for us to track
from outside.

19:11.851 --> 19:16.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is the case that we can say with
any confidence
that that would have turned the
tide or even

19:16.288 --> 19:18.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protected the people that we
would have set
out to protect?

19:18.657 --> 19:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, again, I think people can
argue that that
is a tool that we could have
employed that

19:24.196 --> 19:25.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we didn't employ.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think that you can
argue with
any certainty that we would be
in a different

19:29.368 --> 19:31.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place in Syria right now had we
done that.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As you walk away
from serving
in government, is that the
toughest thing

19:34.507 --> 19:35.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as you look back?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA POWER: By far.

19:36.509 --> 19:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think about Syria when I go to
bed at night.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I wake up in the middle of
the night
when I hear one of my kids
coughing or crying,

19:42.748 --> 19:43.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think about Syria.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I wake up in the morning, I
think about
Syria.

19:45.351 --> 19:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But thinking about it a lot and
ending the
war are not the same thing.

19:48.821 --> 19:51.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United States
ambassador
to the U.N., Samantha...

19:51.557 --> 19:52.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: For three more
days.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For three more
days.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Samantha Power, thank you very
much.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA POWER: Thank you.

19:58.864 --> 20:11.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now:
president-elect Trump's
pick for secretary of education,
Betsy DeVos.

20:12.011 --> 20:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is a nontraditional choice
and a power
player in Republican circles.

20:16.982 --> 20:21.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her supporters applaud a woman
they see as
a disrupter focused on children.

20:21.954 --> 20:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her critics worry she will erode
crucial funds
for public schools, and that she
has not been

20:27.093 --> 20:29.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forthright in her own financial
disclosures.

20:29.995 --> 20:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is on Capitol Hill as we
speak for her
confirmation hearing.

20:33.966 --> 20:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is the focus of our
weekly segment,
Making the Grade.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham is our guide.

20:39.538 --> 20:44.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Shortly after
Betsy DeVos'
confirmation hearing began this
evening, she

20:44.443 --> 20:49.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made one thing clear: She plans
to push for
expanded school choice around
the country,

20:49.849 --> 20:54.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much as she did during her two
decades as
a major political force in her
home state

20:54.220 --> 20:55.988 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Michigan.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS, Education Secretary
Nominee:
Parents no longer believe that a
one-size-fits-all

20:57.923 --> 21:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
model of learning meets the
needs -- need
of every child.

21:01.727 --> 21:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they know other options
exist, whether
magnet, virtual, charter, home,
faith-based,

21:08.200 --> 21:10.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or any combination.

21:10.136 --> 21:14.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, too many parents are denied
access to
the full range of options.

21:14.540 --> 21:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: DeVos has
neither taught,
nor worked as an educator or
supervisor in

21:18.711 --> 21:24.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a school system, but she and her
family, whose
net worth tops $5 billion, have
used that

21:24.583 --> 21:30.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
wealth and influence as
advocates and political
donors to create more charter
schools in Michigan,

21:30.789 --> 21:33.726 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to try legalizing school
vouchers.

21:33.759 --> 21:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vouchers let parents spend
public money on
private or parochial schools.

21:37.730 --> 21:42.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She lost the voucher battle in
Michigan, but
still champions their use.

21:42.034 --> 21:45.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats are worried that DeVos
will undermine
public education across the
country.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.773 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:47.806 --> 21:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATTY MURRAY (D), Washington: We
focus our
federal policies and investments
on strengthening

21:51.110 --> 21:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
public schools for all students,
and certainly
not towards diverting taxpayer
dollars to

21:57.082 --> 22:01.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fund vouchers that don't work
for unaccountable
private schools.

22:01.654 --> 22:07.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have major concerns with how
you spent your
career and fortune fighting to
privatize public

22:07.426 --> 22:10.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
education and gut investments in
public schools.

22:10.663 --> 22:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: DeVos'
philosophy fits right
in with president-elect Trump's,
who pledged

22:15.034 --> 22:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the campaign to provide
$20 billion
in federal support for charter
schools and

22:20.506 --> 22:22.374 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vouchers.

22:22.408 --> 22:25.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her support for charters, which
are publicly
funded schools, but which
operate independently,

22:25.978 --> 22:28.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is the subject of particular
scrutiny.

22:28.314 --> 22:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Detroit Free Press found
that 75 percent
of schools in Michigan performed
better than

22:33.085 --> 22:37.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charters did, and they had some
of the weakest
oversight in the country.

22:37.790 --> 22:42.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supporters point to better gains
by African-American
and Latino students in those
schools.

22:42.461 --> 22:47.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, DeVos tried to assure
senators that
she is not an enemy of public
schools.

22:47.066 --> 22:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETSY DEVOS: The vast majority
of students
in this country will continue to
attend public

22:51.170 --> 22:52.671 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
schools.

22:52.705 --> 22:57.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If confirmed, I will be a strong
advocate
for great public schools.

22:57.076 --> 23:01.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As the hearing
continued
this evening, educators are also
watching

23:01.146 --> 23:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closely for DeVos' stance on
civil rights,
college affordability and
for-profit colleges.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on Betsy DeVos and what
she means
for education in America, I'm
joined by two

23:12.524 --> 23:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people with divergent views
about her.

23:15.027 --> 23:19.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Randi Weingarten is the
president of the American
Federation of Teachers, one of
biggest teachers

23:19.198 --> 23:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unions in the country, and one
that opposes
her nomination.

23:22.868 --> 23:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Rick Hess, who's written
several books
about teachers and education,
and is with

23:26.972 --> 23:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the conservative think tank the
American Enterprise
Institute, where Betsy DeVos is
a board member.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

23:33.812 --> 23:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANDI WEINGARTEN, President,
American Federation
of Teachers: Thank you.

23:35.214 --> 23:36.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Randi
Weingarten, I would
like to start to you.

23:36.482 --> 23:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANDI WEINGARTEN: And Rick and I
are good
friends, by the way.

23:37.549 --> 23:38.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And you two
are good friends.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's good to get out there.

23:40.386 --> 23:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Randi, you heard Betsy DeVos.

23:42.354 --> 23:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She said she's not an enemy of
public schools.

23:44.857 --> 23:46.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, what concerns you?

23:46.825 --> 23:52.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANDI WEINGARTEN: Well, that is
clearly contradictory
to the 30 years of evidence,
where she has

23:52.898 --> 23:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called public schools dead ends,
where she
has said that they should be
retired, where

23:57.336 --> 24:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she ran a campaign against
Republicans and
Democrats alike in Detroit where
her hashtag

24:04.476 --> 24:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was #endDPS, end Detroit Public
Schools.

24:07.379 --> 24:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I assume that she's saying
that now because
suburban voters, rural voters,
Democrats,

24:15.054 --> 24:20.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans alike, 90 percent of
the kids
in America attend public
schools.

24:20.225 --> 24:22.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But her record speaks volumes.

24:22.961 --> 24:28.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we're concerned about
is that record,
because, in Michigan, as you
said, for the

24:28.600 --> 24:35.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last 25 years, she has worked to
dismantle,
destabilize and defund public
schools at the

24:35.274 --> 24:43.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very same time as she's worked
to shield for-profit
charters from any kind of
accountability.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those schools have done very
badly.

24:46.285 --> 24:51.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the public schools,
particularly for black
and brown children, have been
very destabilized

24:51.390 --> 24:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in places like Flint, Detroit,
Ecore (ph)
and other places.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rick Hess, you
have heard
these criticisms before, I know.

24:58.030 --> 25:03.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is -- you believe her
record indicates
that she ought to be the
secretary of education.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you like about her?

25:05.304 --> 25:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FREDERICK HESS, Director of
Education Policy
Studies, American Enterprise
Institute: You

25:06.138 --> 25:07.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, I think she's a smart
woman.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's a thoughtful woman.

25:09.174 --> 25:12.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's spent three decades as an
educational
advocate.

25:12.277 --> 25:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, it's true that she -- her
vision about
how you advocate to serve all
children well

25:17.082 --> 25:21.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is very different from Randi's
or the AFT's.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Betsy works from a different
premise.

25:22.521 --> 25:25.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The premise is that these
dollars do not belong
to systems.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They do not belong to
bureaucracies.

25:26.792 --> 25:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They do not belong to state
education agencies
and local education agencies.

25:30.929 --> 25:36.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are -- we spend $650
billion, $700 billion
a year to educate all of our
nation's children,

25:36.835 --> 25:38.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
50 million-odd kids.

25:38.737 --> 25:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If those families think those
children are
better served in a traditional
district school

25:43.075 --> 25:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a charter school or a private
option, Betsy's
philosophy is that we ought to
regard it as

25:49.715 --> 25:53.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an opportunity to make sure that
each of these
families and each of these kids
is better

25:53.452 --> 25:55.454 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
served.

25:55.487 --> 26:00.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't understand why anybody
would necessarily
view any of that as
anti-education or anti-public

26:00.092 --> 26:01.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, Randi,
you heard this.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of that
argument?

26:03.562 --> 26:05.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RANDI WEINGARTEN: Right.

26:05.431 --> 26:12.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, at the end of the day, what
Rick is ignoring
is that 23 states have actually
reduced their

26:12.104 --> 26:15.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investment in public education
since 2008.

26:15.874 --> 26:21.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what has happened here is
that what DeVos
advocates is a zero sum game,
take the money

26:21.780 --> 26:22.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from public schools.

26:22.781 --> 26:24.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what's happened in Detroit?

26:24.950 --> 26:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kids have huge class sizes.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The buildings are decrepit.

26:28.720 --> 26:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The books that they use are from
the '60s
or the '70s.

26:32.491 --> 26:37.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what happens is that they
don't have a
real viable experience.

26:37.930 --> 26:42.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, at the same time, what has
happened is
that there's been private money
that's gone

26:42.901 --> 26:49.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into charters and gone into
vouchers to actually
overpromise parents things that
they ultimately

26:49.475 --> 26:51.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
don't get.

26:51.176 --> 26:55.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The place that has the choice
are the schools,
not the parents.

26:55.547 --> 26:58.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the point I'm trying to make
is that look
at the record.

26:59.017 --> 27:02.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The record in terms of vouchers
-- we have
had vouchers for 25 years.

27:02.354 --> 27:04.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't do very well for
kids.

27:04.656 --> 27:08.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the record in terms of the
for-profit
charters is that the for-profits
have made

27:08.727 --> 27:11.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of money, but kids have
suffered.

27:11.330 --> 27:16.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, why are we in the midst of
destabilizing,
destabilizing, destabilizing, as
opposed to

27:16.735 --> 27:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rolling up our sleeves and
actually doing
what works?

27:19.872 --> 27:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to help every child have
a safe, welcoming
neighborhood public school.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Parents want other option,
that's their right.

27:26.979 --> 27:34.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have a responsibility to
help kids
have qualified, high-quality
neighborhood

27:34.453 --> 27:36.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public schools.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Rick, one of
the arguments
that often is made here, it
seems like there

27:38.257 --> 27:41.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a tension between autonomy
and accountability.

27:41.860 --> 27:44.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone wants autonomy, so that
schools can
innovate and do what they want
to do, but

27:44.997 --> 27:48.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there should also be
accountability, so that,
if teachers are not doing a
great job, that

27:48.500 --> 27:50.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
somehow we can hold them
accountability.

27:50.335 --> 27:55.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DeVos has been very strong on
autonomy for
schools, but it seems like her
record indicates

27:55.507 --> 27:59.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's much less interested in
holding those
schools accountable when they
don't perform.

27:59.144 --> 28:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICK HESS: So, I think she's
mixed on accountability.

28:01.480 --> 28:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeb Bush, who is probably the
high priest
of Republican educational
accountability,

28:06.852 --> 28:10.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made an incredibly strong
statement on her
behalf in the last day or two.

28:10.422 --> 28:13.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's been on the board of his
Foundation
for Educational Excellence.

28:13.125 --> 28:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's supported calls for high
standards.

28:16.161 --> 28:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think you're right that
there is mixed
feelings, certainly on the
conservative side

28:20.933 --> 28:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the spectrum, about how much
we want to
have simple, centralized
measures determine

28:27.506 --> 28:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whether or not a school is good
for a kid.

28:29.441 --> 28:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's interesting to hear, you
know, Randi
talking about this, because the
AFT also has,

28:34.613 --> 28:39.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, voiced concerns about
overreliance
on simple reading and math
scores as the be-all

28:40.018 --> 28:42.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and end-all for deciding whether
schools are
doing a good job.

28:42.854 --> 28:48.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet, when we talk about
educational accountability,
simply because it is so complex
to try to

28:48.860 --> 28:55.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hold accountable 100,000
schools, because
we have so few kind of good,
objective measures,

28:56.001 --> 28:59.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it often that winds up putting
more and more
weight on reading and math
scores.

28:59.805 --> 29:04.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, for me, part of the
promise of
school choice is that if
educators can create

29:04.509 --> 29:10.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a school that families want to
send their
kid to, and looking at the test
data and looking

29:10.048 --> 29:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at other metrics of achievement,
families
think that this school is best
for their kids,

29:14.853 --> 29:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess I'm uncomfortable with
the idea that
we should -- that we should
religiously try

29:20.492 --> 29:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to deny families a school that
they think
is going to be best for their
kid.

29:23.462 --> 29:32.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Randi Weingarten,
Rick Hess, thank you both very
much.

29:32.604 --> 29:40.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:40.045 --> 29:44.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
the first
black president changed our
views on race

29:44.983 --> 29:47.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in America.

29:47.619 --> 29:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: how some lesser-known
changes to
health care might fare, given
president-elect

29:53.358 --> 29:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's vow to repeal the
Affordable Care
Act.

29:56.361 --> 30:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of those involve so-called
super utilizers,
high-cost patients who
frequently turn to

30:02.000 --> 30:08.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
emergency rooms for problems
better handled
by primary care doctors and
social workers.

30:08.306 --> 30:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Sarah
Varney reports.

30:10.509 --> 30:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This story was produced in
collaboration with
our partner Kaiser Health News.

30:15.681 --> 30:20.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Protective gown,
rubber gloves,
face mask.

30:20.786 --> 30:23.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dayna Gurley is getting dressed
for work.

30:23.555 --> 30:28.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a social worker charged
not with treating
infectious diseases, but with
figuring out

30:28.894 --> 30:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why her clients all but live in
Houston's
hospitals.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAYNA GURLEY, Social Worker:
What's been going
on?

30:33.799 --> 30:37.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: This patient, who
asked not
to be identified, has chronic
massive ulcers,

30:37.669 --> 30:43.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AIDS and hears voices and, at
times, spends
three weeks out of the month at
multiple hospitals

30:43.241 --> 30:45.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around Houston.

30:45.110 --> 30:51.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gurley is part of a promising
effort in the
U.S. health care system, honing
in on so-called

30:51.917 --> 30:57.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
super utilizers, patients with
complex problems
who frequent emergency rooms and
cost public

30:57.789 --> 30:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and private insurers dearly.

30:59.925 --> 31:05.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Super utilizers make up just 5
percent of
the U.S. population, but they
account for

31:05.230 --> 31:07.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
50 percent of health care
spending.

31:07.332 --> 31:11.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As health care costs continue to
rise, providers
are trying to find these
patients and get

31:11.570 --> 31:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the root of their problems.

31:13.739 --> 31:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An effort to do just that
started in New Jersey's
poorest city, Camden.

31:18.443 --> 31:23.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Family physician Dr. Jeffrey
Brenner was inspired
by how police departments were
using crime

31:23.181 --> 31:25.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
data to detect hot spots.

31:25.517 --> 31:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To find Camden's health care hot
spots, Brenner
dug into ambulance records and
E.R. data to

31:30.889 --> 31:34.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show how high-cost patients were
shuttling
between city hospitals.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

JEFFREY BRENNER, Camden
Coalition of Healthcare
Providers: In America, we're
medicalizing

31:37.763 --> 31:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
social problems, and we're
criminalizing social
problems, and we're wasting huge
amounts of

31:40.799 --> 31:42.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
public resources.

31:42.634 --> 31:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: To steer super
utilizers away
from expensive emergency care,
Brenner's team,

31:48.039 --> 31:52.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including social workers Latonya
Oliver (ph)
and Bill Nice (ph), seek
patients out in local

31:52.911 --> 31:54.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighborhoods.

31:54.179 --> 31:55.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: There's been a few patients
that I have
had like that.

31:55.614 --> 32:00.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: They work
intensively with people
like Peter Bowser (ph).

32:00.752 --> 32:06.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bowser was once homeless, and
went to the
E.R. 28 times in one year.

32:06.625 --> 32:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Because I was telling
people when I was
staying in the shelter, I said,
when I get

32:10.562 --> 32:12.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my place, I said, I'm going to
maintain it.

32:12.864 --> 32:16.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But after they
helped get a
permanent roof over his head,
Bowser's trips

32:16.902 --> 32:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the E.R. all but stopped.

32:18.637 --> 32:22.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: And I think you would
prefer to spend
your time here than the hospital
any day of

32:22.908 --> 32:24.442 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the week.

32:24.476 --> 32:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: This high-touch,
data-driven
approach has yielded big
savings.

32:26.945 --> 32:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
E.R. visits for the first group
of patients
dropped by 40 percent, cutting
monthly hospital

32:31.883 --> 32:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bills from $1.2 million to
$500,000.

32:36.121 --> 32:40.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Affordable Care Act has
boosted efforts
like this around the country by
funding so-called

32:40.959 --> 32:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accountable care organizations,
teams of health
care professionals who team up
to improve

32:45.864 --> 32:49.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care, lower costs and reap the
savings.

32:49.501 --> 32:54.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was Brenner's pioneering
work in Camden
that inspired others, including
the program

32:54.506 --> 32:59.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Houston, a sprawling city
desperate to
aid its sickest and most
isolated patients.

32:59.444 --> 33:04.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
While the more than 100
hospitals here typically
know their own super utilizers,
they had no

33:04.850 --> 33:08.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way of knowing the top users
across the entire
city.

33:08.553 --> 33:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tackling that problem took
unprecedented planning
among typically disjointed city
and county

33:13.625 --> 33:15.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
agencies, hospitals and
nonprofits.

33:15.794 --> 33:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: And you know that guy
that you helped
me get appointments for the
other day?

33:21.099 --> 33:23.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He apparently had warrants out
for his arrest.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Oh, OK.

33:25.203 --> 33:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Now, many of the
hospitals here,
including the county hospital,
Ben Taub, pool

33:28.907 --> 33:34.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their data and send it to Kallol
Mahata, a
former oil industry I.T.
engineer with the

33:34.079 --> 33:37.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Patient Care Intervention
Center, who combines
it into one database.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: And we saw that breakdown
by EMS.

33:39.551 --> 33:44.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Mahata and Dr.
David Buck, the
group's founder, help to
identify patients

33:44.422 --> 33:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the top of the list, the
outliers of the
outliers.

33:48.927 --> 33:53.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the data comes from the
Houston Fire
Department's 911 calls.

33:53.498 --> 33:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, teams are dispatched to
parks and neighborhoods
to find the patients.

33:58.203 --> 34:02.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Firefighters and paramedics like
Thomas Pierrel
(ph) often know these residents
from those

34:02.274 --> 34:06.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
emergency calls, but, this time,
their mission
is different.

34:06.511 --> 34:07.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We make appointments.

34:08.013 --> 34:09.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We find specialists.

34:09.180 --> 34:12.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We try to maximize the resources
that you
have.

34:12.083 --> 34:15.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The results of
these intensive
interventions can be stunning.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Timmy Williams was dying when
Dayna Gurley
found him.

34:18.623 --> 34:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAYNA GURLEY: Has your blood
pressure been
that high in the past three or
four weeks?

34:22.227 --> 34:23.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TIMMY WILLIAMS, Houston
Resident: Mm-hmm.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAYNA GURLEY: It has been?

34:24.229 --> 34:25.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIMMY WILLIAMS: Yes, the B.E. is
high.

34:25.363 --> 34:27.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The B.E. is up there.

34:27.098 --> 34:30.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: He was holed up at
home and
reeling from untreated HIV that
had progressed

34:30.435 --> 34:32.037 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to AIDS.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He couldn't take care of his
young son, and
cycled through Houston's
hospitals.

34:34.973 --> 34:39.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAYNA GURLEY: When we first met
Timmy, he
was very hard to engage.

34:39.844 --> 34:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We knew that he probably wasn't
taking any
of his medication, and he was
very skinny.

34:46.918 --> 34:51.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Gurley arranged
for a home aide
to care for Williams seven days
a week, got

34:51.456 --> 34:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his apartment cleaned and the
lights turned
back on.

34:54.292 --> 35:03.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now Williams' HIV is
undetectable and his
health, and life, have been
steadied.

35:03.034 --> 35:07.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although these efforts involve
many staff
members, in the two years since
the Patient

35:07.105 --> 35:11.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Care Intervention Center has
been up and running,
costs for those in the program
have gone down

35:11.676 --> 35:15.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
83 percent and hospital visits
by 70 percent.

35:15.213 --> 35:19.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAYNA GURLEY: I really want to
get to know
them and spend time with them.

35:19.884 --> 35:22.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But it can be
difficult to keep
these programs moving.

35:22.854 --> 35:27.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Often, those savings go straight
to insurance
companies and government payers.

35:27.392 --> 35:31.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Dr. Buck and Dayna Gurley
were once banned
from a Houston hospital that was
afraid of

35:31.563 --> 35:34.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
losing money if their high-cost
patients stopped
showing up.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.434 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

35:36.468 --> 35:37.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BUCK, Patient Care
Intervention Center:
Nobody wants to take ownership
of any of it.

35:37.836 --> 35:41.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The people just want ownership
of what they
have authority over.

35:41.473 --> 35:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's really the issue.

35:43.174 --> 35:49.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Back in Camden,
even Dr. Brenner
is less optimistic than he once
was.

35:49.614 --> 35:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His office now overflows with
pillows and
kitchenware for clients they're
trying to

35:53.651 --> 35:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
place in housing, and he thinks
homelessness
and entrenched financial
interests in health

35:58.023 --> 35:59.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care are the biggest barriers.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.092 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:01.126 --> 36:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BRENNER: I think this is
going to
take a lot longer than I ever
imagined.

36:03.695 --> 36:08.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're in a 20-year arc
of recalibrating
and rethinking what is health
and what is

36:08.233 --> 36:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care, what is the purpose
of our health
care system, what are we trying
to accomplish?

36:12.804 --> 36:18.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But Brenner still
believes these
intensive efforts are the best
way to help

36:18.543 --> 36:20.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
patients like Timmy Williams.

36:20.578 --> 36:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's now healthy enough to make
his way around
the city on his own.

36:24.049 --> 36:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says Gurley did more than
rescue him from
his darkest days.

36:27.218 --> 36:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMMY WILLIAMS: I had to put it
in my head
that no one is going to do it
for me.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have to do it for myself.

36:34.459 --> 36:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have got to step out and do it
myself.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Read this here.

36:37.262 --> 36:38.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: This whole thing?

36:38.797 --> 36:40.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TIMMY WILLIAMS: Yes.

36:40.598 --> 36:44.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: At home now with
his son, his
illness no longer gets in the
way of being

36:44.602 --> 36:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the father he wants to be.

36:47.105 --> 36:51.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But efforts like these could be
undercut if
president-elect Donald Trump and
the Republican

36:51.676 --> 36:56.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress follow through on their
vow to repeal
the Affordable Care Act.

36:56.314 --> 36:59.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's unclear what would come
next.

36:59.617 --> 37:10.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Kaiser Health News,
I'm Sarah Varney in Houston,
Texas.

37:10.462 --> 37:18.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to our series
The Obama
Years.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we look back at the
legacy of the
nation's first black president.

37:21.906 --> 37:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I, Barack Hussein Obama...

37:25.844 --> 37:31.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Decades before he
made history
as the first African-American
president, Barack

37:31.549 --> 37:33.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama was a man of uncommon
circumstances.

37:33.952 --> 37:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Born to a Kenyan father and a
white mother
from Kansas, Obama's childhood
was split between

37:41.192 --> 37:46.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Indonesia and Hawaii, where he
was raised
by his white grandparents.

37:46.197 --> 37:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The young Obama was largely
shielded from
the racial injustices of 1960s
America, says

37:53.438 --> 37:55.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ta-Nehisi Coates of "The
Atlantic" magazine.

37:55.240 --> 37:59.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TA-NEHISI COATES, "The
Atlantic": To not go
to schools and wonder why your
schools are

37:59.677 --> 38:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrible, to not have to deal
with the fear,
the violence, to not really have
to deal with

38:03.781 --> 38:04.749 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the police.

38:04.782 --> 38:07.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he was aware of it, but it
wasn't personal.

38:07.919 --> 38:13.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Longtime friend
and senior
White House adviser Valerie
Jarrett says his

38:13.258 --> 38:17.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
upbringing made Obama uniquely
equipped to
navigate what lay ahead.

38:17.695 --> 38:20.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VALERIE JARRETT, Senior
Presidential Adviser:
He was used to living in a
family where white

38:20.865 --> 38:23.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people loved him and cared
deeply about him.

38:23.468 --> 38:27.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he goes into every
situation with the
assumption that he is going to
be respected

38:27.639 --> 38:28.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and treated well.

38:28.873 --> 38:32.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After law school,
Obama moved
to Chicago.

38:32.177 --> 38:37.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He became a civil rights
attorney, a community
organizer and, eventually, a
state senator

38:37.515 --> 38:40.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
representing the South Side of
Chicago.

38:40.952 --> 38:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama gained national attention
in 2004, when
he delivered the keynote address
at the Democratic

38:46.891 --> 38:48.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
National Convention.

38:48.693 --> 38:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: There's not a
black America
and a white America and Latino
America and

38:55.333 --> 38:56.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Asian America.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.269 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's the United States of
America.

38:58.303 --> 39:00.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:00.071 --> 39:04.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In 2007, after
serving just
two years in the Senate, Obama
decided to

39:04.742 --> 39:09.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
test America's readiness to
accept a black
man as president.

39:09.380 --> 39:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For months, he campaigned on a
message of
hope and change.

39:12.917 --> 39:18.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But it wasn't until the
surfacing of racially
charged sermons by his former
minister that

39:18.590 --> 39:20.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he addressed race head on.

39:20.258 --> 39:22.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The anger is real.

39:22.193 --> 39:23.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is powerful.

39:23.962 --> 39:30.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to simply wish it away, to
condemn it
without understanding its roots,
only serves

39:30.702 --> 39:34.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to widen the chasm of
misunderstanding that
exists between the races.

39:34.472 --> 39:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: From the moment
he took office,
expectations were high.

39:38.142 --> 39:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EUGENIA PETE, Obama Supporter: I
have a little
boy.

39:40.378 --> 39:44.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He can -- he can do what he
wants to do.

39:44.382 --> 39:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, he don't have to be
just a rap star
or basketball player, you know?

39:52.523 --> 39:55.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He can do it.

39:55.360 --> 39:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The sky is truly the limit now.

39:58.730 --> 40:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the president
had to strike
a balance between being a voice
for black

40:04.102 --> 40:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans and president of the
entire country,
says Ta-Nehisi Coates of "The
Atlantic."

40:09.140 --> 40:13.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TA-NEHISI COATES: He was always
walking this
line, and he had to walk the
line.

40:13.378 --> 40:14.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know what I mean?

40:14.479 --> 40:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, you're president of the
United States.

40:16.281 --> 40:21.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is true that the majority of
people who
you serve, who you represent,
that's not the

40:22.020 --> 40:23.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
South Side of Chicago anymore.

40:23.788 --> 40:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of the first
tests came
just months into Mr. Obama's
first term, when

40:28.459 --> 40:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a white police officer arrested
black Harvard
Professor Henry Louis Gates
trying to get

40:34.666 --> 40:35.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into his own home.

40:35.800 --> 40:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The Cambridge
police acted stupidly.

40:41.406 --> 40:48.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I think we know, separate
and apart from
this incident, is that there is
a long history

40:48.479 --> 40:55.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in this country of
African-Americans and Latinos
being stopped by law enforcement
disproportionately.

40:55.453 --> 41:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After backlash
from the law
enforcement community, the
president said

41:00.625 --> 41:02.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he had overreacted.

41:02.460 --> 41:07.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He invited Gates and the officer
who had arrested
him to the White House for what
would become

41:07.565 --> 41:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
known as the beer summit.

41:09.600 --> 41:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president experienced
unusual vitriol
from his opponents, including an
outburst

41:15.373 --> 41:20.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from South Carolina
Representative Joe Wilson
that members of both parties
called disrespectful.

41:20.978 --> 41:21.946 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

41:21.979 --> 41:24.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE WILSON (R), South Carolina:
You lie!

41:24.849 --> 41:26.584 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

41:26.617 --> 41:30.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For the remainder
of his first
term, the president rarely used
the bully

41:30.188 --> 41:32.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pulpit to talk about race.

41:32.390 --> 41:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He focused instead on broader
issues, like
the economy and reforming the
nation's health

41:37.729 --> 41:40.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care system.

41:40.064 --> 41:45.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the president's domestic
record in his
second term would be largely
defined by a

41:45.269 --> 41:49.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
series of events that
spotlighted racial tensions.

41:49.440 --> 41:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2012, when neighborhood watch
volunteer
George Zimmerman shot and killed
Trayvon Martin,

41:56.280 --> 42:02.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an unarmed black teenager, the
president spoke
out in a surprisingly personal
way.

42:02.854 --> 42:04.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Valerie Jarrett was with him
just beforehand.

42:04.655 --> 42:08.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: And I was in
the Oval Office
with a couple of other senior
staff.

42:08.626 --> 42:14.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he said to us, in an
extraordinarily emotional
way: "I want to talk about this
because, if

42:14.499 --> 42:16.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had a son, he would look like
Trayvon."

42:16.434 --> 42:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: When I think about
this boy,
I think about my own kids.

42:23.174 --> 42:24.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Again, Ta-Nehisi
Coates:

42:24.842 --> 42:29.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TA-NEHISI COATES: The moment he
spoke out,
it completely politicized the
trial.

42:29.647 --> 42:30.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know what I mean?

42:31.015 --> 42:35.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Trayvon became a symbol of
Obamaism, or
something like that.

42:35.453 --> 42:39.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, it became racialized in a
sort of way.

42:39.223 --> 42:44.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In 2014, Michael
Brown, another
unarmed black teen, was shot and
killed by

42:44.929 --> 42:46.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Ferguson, Missouri, police
officer.

42:46.631 --> 42:53.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A year later, a black man named
Freddie Gray
died in police custody in
Baltimore.

42:53.604 --> 42:59.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in Charleston, South
Carolina, a white
man massacred nine black
parishioners during

42:59.744 --> 43:00.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a Bible study.

43:00.978 --> 43:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA (singing): Amazing
grace, how
sweet the sound.

43:05.082 --> 43:16.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

43:16.294 --> 43:20.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jarrett says
these events brought
to the surface racial unease
that already

43:20.965 --> 43:22.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
existed.

43:22.467 --> 43:24.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE JARRETT: Those tensions
were there
before we had a video camera.

43:24.168 --> 43:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We just didn't see them on the
news and in
the social media the way we are
today.

43:28.172 --> 43:33.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a lot of that has
encouraged particularly
young people to come out and
peacefully demonstrate,

43:33.711 --> 43:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get involved with their local
government,
to hold them more accountable
than perhaps

43:37.715 --> 43:39.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they were.

43:39.517 --> 43:42.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile,
President Obama's
Justice Department aggressively
prosecuted

43:42.820 --> 43:44.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
civil rights abuses.

43:44.722 --> 43:49.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He highlighted racial
disparities within the
criminal justice system.

43:49.794 --> 43:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mr. Obama spearheaded
initiatives like
My Brother's Keeper, a
mentorship program

43:55.633 --> 43:57.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for young men of color.

43:57.902 --> 44:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in his farewell speech this
month, the
president acknowledged there was
much left

44:03.207 --> 44:05.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to accomplish.

44:05.042 --> 44:09.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Race relations are
better than
they were 10, or 20, or 30 years
ago, no matter

44:09.313 --> 44:10.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what some folks say.

44:10.815 --> 44:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're not where we need to
be, and all
of us have more work to do.

44:16.888 --> 44:18.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

44:18.723 --> 44:21.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yesterday, I sat
down yesterday
with three individuals who have
given a lot

44:21.592 --> 44:27.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of thought to Mr. Obama's legacy
and his impact
on black Americans.

44:27.365 --> 44:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're joined by James Peterson.

44:29.433 --> 44:34.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's director of Africana
studies at Lehigh
University and the host of
"Remix."

44:34.705 --> 44:38.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a podcast dedicated to race
and politics.

44:38.209 --> 44:42.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rael Nelson James, she oversees
diversity
work for the Bridgespan Group.

44:42.280 --> 44:46.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's anyone profit philanthropic
advisory
firm.

44:46.050 --> 44:51.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Sherrilyn Ifill, president
of the NAACP
Legal Defense Fund.

44:51.322 --> 44:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
James Peterson, how do you look
back on his
presidency overall?

44:55.726 --> 44:57.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES PETERSON, Director of
Africana Studies,
Lehigh University: You know,
Folks from my

44:57.562 --> 45:01.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parents' generation couldn't
imagine there
being a black president of the
United States.

45:02.033 --> 45:04.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I think we have to honor
that piece
of it.

45:04.735 --> 45:09.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for progressive folks, the
substance of
the policies sometimes just
isn't there.

45:09.340 --> 45:15.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as we sort of
transition into
the next administration, we're
going to be

45:15.246 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of queued up to be very,
very nostalgic
about President Obama.

45:18.583 --> 45:22.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have to understand there
were lots
of challenge, not just based on
obstructionism,

45:22.687 --> 45:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but based on sort of the kind of
centrist
politics that have dominated
Democratic Party

45:26.591 --> 45:31.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics for the last couple of
decades that
President Obama really
represented.

45:31.162 --> 45:33.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sherrilyn Ifill,
what about
that?

45:33.064 --> 45:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERRILYN IFILL, President,
NAACP Legal Defense
and Educational Fund: Well, it's
interesting.

45:34.865 --> 45:38.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually think we're going to
need more
time to assess the substantive
record as well.

45:38.269 --> 45:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's kind of hard to
fully assess
it at this moment.

45:41.706 --> 45:45.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, when you think about
health care
reform, when you think about one
of the president's

45:45.176 --> 45:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first acts was signing the Lilly
Ledbetter
Equal Pay Act for Women, when
you look at

45:50.014 --> 45:54.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the work in the criminal justice
space, which
was largely executed through the
Department

45:55.019 --> 46:00.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Justice, but through this
president's Department
of Justice and with his full
support and with

46:00.691 --> 46:05.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his interest and strong desire,
you look at
the Smart on Crime policies,
ending solitary

46:05.930 --> 46:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confinement for juveniles, you
look at his
clemency, he's granted clemency
to more people

46:11.969 --> 46:15.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than any of the 11 presidents
before him combined.

46:15.272 --> 46:19.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, the federal system, the
federal prison
system and the federal criminal
justice system,

46:19.310 --> 46:21.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a fraction compared to the
system in the
states.

46:21.712 --> 46:25.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the purpose was really to
set an example,
to show what can be done and
what should be

46:25.783 --> 46:28.219 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
done around criminal justice.

46:28.252 --> 46:33.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Same for voting rights and the
effort to really
stand against this effort of
voter suppression

46:33.391 --> 46:35.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of African-American voters.

46:35.092 --> 46:39.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Rael Nelson
James, we're
talking about his overall legacy
and what

46:39.997 --> 46:45.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that meant in many instances for
black Americans,
whether it was aimed at
specifically black

46:45.569 --> 46:47.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Americans or not.

46:47.371 --> 46:49.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAEL NELSON JAMES, Bridgespan
Group: It's
a tightrope walk to be the first
black person

46:49.840 --> 46:55.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to be in a position,
particularly the presidency,
and to balance what it means to
be the president

46:55.413 --> 47:00.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the entire United States, and
what it means
to be black community to see the
first black

47:00.251 --> 47:02.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
person as president.

47:02.453 --> 47:09.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what those expectations
were, I felt,
weren't always fair in terms of
what it truly

47:09.160 --> 47:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
means to hold that office, and
the kind of
balance that one has to have,
and because,

47:16.233 --> 47:19.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as was said, President Obama's a
political
moderate.

47:20.004 --> 47:25.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so those who are on the left
who are truly
progressive, I think, should
have expected

47:25.209 --> 47:28.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he would fall short of
their expectations.

47:28.679 --> 47:41.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This sort of desire that he
would speak to
or evangelize a sort of black
community platform

47:41.625 --> 47:48.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
above all else, I think, was
sort of an unfair
expectation, though I think we
got at times

47:48.332 --> 47:51.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really strong messages, you
know, about being
black in America.

47:51.936 --> 47:55.005 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: James Peterson,
were the expectations
unfair?

47:55.039 --> 47:59.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES PETERSON: Some of the
expectations were
absolutely unfair, not just from
black America,

47:59.744 --> 48:04.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but from white America, and not
just from
those on the left, but from
those on the right.

48:04.715 --> 48:09.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He sort of took on the historic
moment, in
a sense that the expectations
for some kind

48:09.186 --> 48:14.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of post-racial, utopian,
harmonious society
kind of was on his shoulders,
especially early

48:14.525 --> 48:16.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on in his first term

48:16.460 --> 48:20.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we were disabused of
that notion fairly
early on.

48:20.064 --> 48:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think folks came to their
senses a little
bit.

48:22.733 --> 48:26.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when we -- even if we just
take a look
at his messaging that has been
directed towards

48:26.937 --> 48:32.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African-Americans, too often,
President Obama
trucked in the kind of
discourses that those

48:32.276 --> 48:38.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the right used, in terms of
the behavioral
challenges, or lack thereof,
that sometimes

48:38.082 --> 48:41.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people want to hang structural
responsibility
around.

48:41.886 --> 48:48.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, he's often sort of
articulating
a narrative of personal
responsibility.

48:48.259 --> 48:52.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's nothing wrong with
personal responsibility,
but all of us are also aware of
the fact that

48:52.630 --> 48:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are structural challenges
in the United
States that have -- are sort of
part of income

48:58.769 --> 49:02.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inequality, part of racial
stratification.

49:02.106 --> 49:07.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's legitimate for
folks to have
expected President Barack Obama
to speak more

49:07.111 --> 49:11.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strongly about those things,
even in the environment
of obstructionism, even in an
environment

49:11.515 --> 49:16.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where there's a rise of
racialized hate over
the last eight years, based on
the fact that

49:16.954 --> 49:18.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he is the first black president.

49:18.756 --> 49:22.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sherrilyn Ifill,
what about
this notion that he, as James
Peterson just

49:22.993 --> 49:25.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
put it, trucked in the language
of those on
the right?

49:25.863 --> 49:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERRILYN IFILL: Well, I always
wanted more
from this president and
probably...

49:29.099 --> 49:30.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you had many
meetings with
him.

49:30.901 --> 49:34.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SHERRILYN IFILL: In many
meetings with him
around criminal justice reform,
around judicial

49:34.038 --> 49:35.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nominations, around any number
of issues.

49:35.940 --> 49:38.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I always wanted more, and
will probably
want more of any president.

49:38.943 --> 49:41.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I'm always pushing a
president to do more.

49:41.378 --> 49:43.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do I think he could have done
more?

49:43.180 --> 49:47.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I always went very clearly with
a question
about what was available for the
president

49:47.785 --> 49:52.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do, and within the context of
what he could
do, was he will willing to go up
to the line?

49:52.156 --> 49:55.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there are some issues in
which he
was doing as much as he possibly
could.

49:56.026 --> 49:57.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The headwinds from the right
were unbelievable.

49:57.895 --> 50:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what we might have
wanted, particularly
in the space of legislation,
just couldn't

50:02.733 --> 50:04.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
happen with this Congress.

50:04.702 --> 50:06.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rhetorically, it's a whole
'nother story.

50:06.637 --> 50:08.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People wanted to hear what they
wanted to
hear.

50:08.606 --> 50:12.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in many ways, the
president's rhetoric
was precisely what he promised
it would be

50:12.176 --> 50:13.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the campaign trail.

50:14.011 --> 50:17.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people just didn't want
to hear it,
because many of us put all our
hopes and dreams

50:17.147 --> 50:19.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and wishes for this first black
president
into him.

50:19.817 --> 50:24.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he was remarkably
consistent in who
he said he was and what he
believed.

50:24.588 --> 50:27.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for that, I was grateful,
because I always
felt like I knew who I was
dealing with.

50:27.491 --> 50:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
said in an
interview just recently that he
thinks race

50:31.228 --> 50:37.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relations in this country are
somewhat better,
far from perfect, but are better
after his

50:37.067 --> 50:38.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidency.

50:38.068 --> 50:39.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rael Nelson James, what do you
think?

50:39.870 --> 50:44.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAEL NELSON JAMES: I think what
we learned
from President Obama's time in
office is that

50:44.575 --> 50:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no one person, no one black
person or progressive
person in office can change the
structural

50:51.682 --> 50:57.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
climate of our institutions that
really matter
to people of color and other
marginalized

50:57.454 --> 51:01.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
communities enjoying full and
equal rights
in our country.

51:01.792 --> 51:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: James Peterson?

51:03.694 --> 51:07.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES PETERSON: We have seen a
rise in racialized
and racist discourses online,
and we have

51:07.765 --> 51:12.803 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen a rise of hate groups in
response to
the first black president.

51:12.836 --> 51:14.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think there's two ways of
looking at
that.

51:14.838 --> 51:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think some folks will look at
that and say,
hey, the excavation of the
residue of white

51:18.809 --> 51:21.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supremacy and racism is an
important piece.

51:21.078 --> 51:24.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need for those folks to come
out of the
shadows, so that people can
understand that

51:24.515 --> 51:28.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
racism is real, and so folks can
appreciate
the work still that is left to
be done.

51:28.919 --> 51:34.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we also can't blame
President Obama because
discourses have become more
racialized because

51:34.058 --> 51:35.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he's the first black president,
right?

51:35.326 --> 51:38.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, that's just a reality of
change and
progress.

51:38.262 --> 51:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so things are not
necessarily worse off
in terms of racial discourses.

51:43.133 --> 51:47.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when we look at specific
issues, if you
look at income inequality, when
you look at

51:47.771 --> 51:52.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
black wealth and black
resources, some of
those things have declined over
these last

51:52.076 --> 51:53.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
eight years.

51:53.978 --> 51:56.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the challenge for us is not
to blame President
Obama for that, but to
understand that he's

51:56.747 --> 51:59.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of a lightning rod for
racial issues
because he's the first black
president.

51:59.917 --> 52:02.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sherrilyn Ifill,
racial relations
at the end of his term?

52:02.186 --> 52:05.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERRILYN IFILL: Well, you know,
I would take
an issue like policing reform.

52:05.456 --> 52:07.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are our relations better?

52:07.291 --> 52:08.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

52:08.292 --> 52:10.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's been contentious.

52:10.194 --> 52:12.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These are tough, hard
conversations.

52:12.363 --> 52:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is an issue that has
stayed below
the surface, has not been in the
mainstream,

52:16.367 --> 52:21.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has not been seen, and has not
been grappled
with in the past in ways that it
has been

52:21.939 --> 52:23.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over the past four or five
years.

52:23.674 --> 52:27.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, just
quickly, does he
get credit for bringing those
issues out and

52:27.611 --> 52:29.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fact that there is more
conversation around
them now?

52:29.713 --> 52:32.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERRILYN IFILL: Well, if I take
something
like policing reform, it wasn't
the president

52:32.316 --> 52:35.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that really brought it out, but
it was how
the president responded once it
was brought

52:35.886 --> 52:37.688 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

52:37.721 --> 52:41.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Ferguson happened, and he
was able to
say, you know, we want to make
sure that people

52:41.225 --> 52:45.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not committing crimes, but,
at the same
time, we want to make sure that
police are

52:45.496 --> 52:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not using excessive force, when
he sent Eric
Holder down to Ferguson to meet
with people,

52:50.334 --> 52:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he engaged the Department
of Justice
in doing twice as many pattern
and practice

52:54.538 --> 52:58.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
investigations of
unconstitutional policing
as have ever happened before,
those are the

52:58.842 --> 53:01.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ways in which he responded to
something that
was presented.

53:01.845 --> 53:05.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, as we approach the
new presidency,
we might see a very different
response.

53:05.716 --> 53:09.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we will know that there
really was
a difference in having President
Obama in

53:09.253 --> 53:11.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the White House.

53:11.155 --> 53:13.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's
impossible to condense
eight years into one
conversation, but thank

53:13.690 --> 53:15.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you, all three of you.

53:15.626 --> 53:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sherrilyn Ifill, Rael Nelson
James, James
Peterson, we thank you all.

53:25.402 --> 53:30.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's the
"NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:30.207 --> 53:31.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:31.375 --> 53:33.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

53:33.777 --> 53:43.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.

53:43.821 --> 53:49.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
