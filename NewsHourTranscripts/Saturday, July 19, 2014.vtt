the latest from eastern Ukraine on the
downing a Malaysia Airlines flight 17

00:17.070 --> 00:20.140
you hear from a reporter who visited the
scene at the wreckage today

00:20.140 --> 00:23.970
israeli troops intensified their search
for tiles in gaza

00:23.970 --> 00:27.699
used to conceal rockets as the
Palestinian death count rises

00:27.699 --> 00:32.079
and in our signature segment eight
months after the strongest typhoon

00:32.079 --> 00:35.610
on record hit the Philippines the
recovery is showing few signs of

00:35.610 --> 00:36.390
progress

00:36.390 --> 00:40.820
throughout the entire typhoons on there
are more than one million people still

00:40.820 --> 00:41.470
living in

00:41.470 --> 00:46.280
inadequate housing next on PBS Newshour

WNET studios at Lincoln Center in New
York re: Sreenivasa

00:50.200 --> 00:55.080
good evening thanks for joining us
ukraine today accused russia and

00:55.080 --> 00:57.170
pro-russian separatists a destroying

00:57.170 --> 01:01.560
evidence that could offer clues about it
down into that Malaysia Airlines plane

01:01.560 --> 01:03.390
carrying 290 a people

01:03.390 --> 01:06.780
the plane went down Thursday in an area
I eastern Ukraine where the separatists

01:06.780 --> 01:09.280
have been battling Ukrainian government
forces

01:09.280 --> 01:13.370
for more about all this we're joined now
via Skype from Ukraine by Paul Sony is

01:13.370 --> 01:15.540
the moscow correspondent for The Wall
Street Journal

01:15.540 --> 01:18.659
earlier today he visited the disaster
scene and posted

01:18.659 --> 01:22.350
these pictures on Twitter so Paul is the
site secure

01:22.350 --> 01:25.430
and who's in control it it depends what
you mean by secure

01:25.430 --> 01:30.500
but the rebels are in control the site
I'll it isn't it territory

01:30.500 --> 01:34.630
i'm too bad hour-and-a-half East oMG
northeast

01:34.630 --> 01:37.900
the city yet done yet ask that is is in
possession

01:37.900 --> 01:41.250
up separatists I and de rÃ©serve

01:41.250 --> 01:46.479
on-site so they RF you're standing with
guns in the middle of the road that goes

01:46.479 --> 01:47.450
right through

01:47.450 --> 01:50.580
the field where most of the debris has
fallen

01:50.580 --> 01:54.140
I saw that but from what I could
ascertain

01:54.140 --> 01:58.140
there is no perimeter around the actual
site did you see

01:58.140 --> 02:02.510
any indications are that investigation
taking place is there evidence being

02:02.510 --> 02:05.150
gathered do we know anything about the
black boxes

02:05.150 --> 02:09.369
I we do not know where the black box

02:09.369 --> 02:13.010
are there's been a lot of rumors about
that initially some separatists told

02:13.010 --> 02:14.260
Russian news sources that some

02:14.260 --> 02:18.060
that have been recovered separatist
leader and a nest today alexander but I

02:18.060 --> 02:18.630
die

02:18.630 --> 02:23.440
said that they had not recover them on
so in terms of the investigation

02:23.440 --> 02:27.830
I don't see any suggestion any certain
investigation was going on today

02:27.830 --> 02:30.910
the only thing that happened today that
was near was that day

02:30.910 --> 02:35.550
did start retrieving some of the bodies
Ukrainian intelligence officials said

02:35.550 --> 02:37.410
today that they have pictures

02:37.410 --> 02:42.190
I love some of these anti-aircraft
missile launchers on trucks moving back

02:42.190 --> 02:46.520
into Russia and that's just 10 hours
after the planes went down they say that

02:46.520 --> 02:47.170
that is

02:47.170 --> 02:50.690
the direct link that Russia was
supplying these missiles in the first

02:50.690 --> 02:51.140
place as

02:51.140 --> 02:55.569
Russia responded to any in this iressa

02:55.569 --> 03:00.520
has said that they want a all impartial
objective investigation into what

03:00.520 --> 03:01.150
happened

03:01.150 --> 03:05.150
I'll though latimer peyton has blamed
Ukraine

03:05.150 --> 03:09.099
for the accident but he hasn't Blaney
and Ukraine for sitting on a plane it's

03:09.099 --> 03:09.980
very careful

03:09.980 --> 03:14.290
difference there what he said is ukraine
created a situation essentially or

03:14.290 --> 03:15.760
something like this could happen

03:15.760 --> 03:19.520
by invading they eastern part of their
own country

03:19.520 --> 03:23.950
to put down the separatist rebellion and
he said he'll bite deciding to use force

03:23.950 --> 03:27.129
into play tortures that insider a
country that created a situation

03:27.129 --> 03:31.440
we're in this could happen I so that's
basically the Russian line

03:31.440 --> 03:34.480
this point in terms of the pictures I

03:34.480 --> 03:37.640
you know the pictures that ukraine
security services hashed

03:37.640 --> 03:41.700
up put out I think the line you not just
for russia from a lot of countries is

03:41.700 --> 03:41.970
that

03:41.970 --> 03:46.000
that they want entered national %uh
objective investigation which

03:46.000 --> 03:49.739
into that up not sort of people posting
does our website

03:49.739 --> 03:54.379
and what does the Ukrainian government
say is evidence that Russia or the

03:54.379 --> 03:56.349
progression separatists have destroyed

03:56.349 --> 04:00.220
you know I don't

04:00.220 --> 04:04.280
I I didn't specify as far as I know
exactly what it is

04:04.280 --> 04:07.530
%uh exactly what evidence they just said

04:07.530 --> 04:10.700
a steam to you is in to know that the
evidence have been destroyed

04:10.700 --> 04:13.700
I'm you up when I was there I didn't see
any signs of looting

04:13.700 --> 04:17.169
evidence I'll I say I was not there for
the whole top

04:17.169 --> 04:20.320
I made it to the whole perimeter so it's
a cigar tell aren't

04:20.320 --> 04:23.449
but you certainly evidenced would have
been damaged

04:23.449 --> 04:26.770
or regardless because the fact that it
has been laughed

04:26.770 --> 04:30.500
%uh without a secure perimeter for so
long %uh in the heat

04:30.500 --> 04:34.240
it does seem like are getting has been
moved when I was there a lot of personal

04:34.240 --> 04:34.990
attacks

04:34.990 --> 04:39.340
up into different piles I'm so it does
seem like stuff has been moved already

04:39.340 --> 04:40.479
at the scene

04:40.479 --> 04:43.940
I'm and certainly they're moving stuff
in our to take out the bodies I and the

04:43.940 --> 04:45.100
investigation doesn't sing

04:45.100 --> 04:48.760
to BRT occurring simultaneous and i'm
taking up the bodies so in terms and

04:48.760 --> 04:52.570
a already this the site being
jeopardized

04:52.570 --> 04:55.770
for investigations on any evidence being
spoiled

04:55.770 --> 04:59.030
regardless of whether it's actually
physically been takin that probably

04:59.030 --> 05:00.580
already is the case

05:00.580 --> 05:04.070
also near the wall street journal
joining us via Skype from Ukraine thanks

05:04.070 --> 05:06.580
so much

05:06.580 --> 05:10.500
extracting turning now to the other
major international story dominating the

05:10.500 --> 05:12.380
headlines the invasion of Gaza

05:12.380 --> 05:16.320
an offensive israel says is designed to
locate tunnels and designed to stop

05:16.320 --> 05:17.050
rockets

05:17.050 --> 05:22.590
from being fired from Gaza into Israel
Palestinian Authority say more than 330

05:22.590 --> 05:26.300
palestinians most of them civilians have
been killed during the past two weeks

05:26.300 --> 05:30.729
israel says militants have fired more
than 1600 rockets into Israel during

05:30.729 --> 05:31.690
that time

05:31.690 --> 05:34.810
for more we're joined now by a Skype
from jerusalem by Jody

05:34.810 --> 05:38.100
read or in she is the new york times
bureau chief they're so what's the

05:38.100 --> 05:40.580
latest on the ground offensive this been
happening there

05:40.580 --> 05:44.410
over the past couple days well the
letting that happen with this morning

05:44.410 --> 05:47.440
%uh Houston militants again invaded

05:47.440 --> 05:52.870
I Israel through it all and they engaged
with I soldiers on the ground there on

05:52.870 --> 05:55.210
patrol and killed two israeli soldiers

05:55.210 --> 05:58.430
and whatnot killed as well in a gunfight
on

05:58.430 --> 06:02.120
its it the second time in three days
that at

06:02.120 --> 06:05.580
notion to come through tunneled into
Israel and that was their basic

06:05.580 --> 06:08.820
reading that that ground operation was
begun so

06:08.820 --> 06:12.370
I it Israeli military and political
leaders have

06:12.370 --> 06:15.380
learned at this threat and that their

06:15.380 --> 06:19.630
determined to destroy all the time no
better in got that lead into Israel

06:19.630 --> 06:23.060
2008 future invasion Bay talk about that
its

06:23.060 --> 06:26.380
if that got and got through they could
kidnap

06:26.380 --> 06:30.150
a israeli civilians from their keep the
team that are located there

06:30.150 --> 06:33.630
or at go on a killing spree we've also
heard that this is I'll

06:33.630 --> 06:37.440
the ground offensive and the air
offensive is created a refugee situation

06:37.440 --> 06:38.020
and there's

06:38.020 --> 06:42.940
some 47,000 refugees heading to
different UN shelters in the area

06:42.940 --> 06:46.100
yeah I get caught up in work today over
50 out and and

06:46.100 --> 06:49.229
at my colleague and Bernard in got that
reported

06:49.229 --> 06:52.130
it's really much higher than that
because so many people they are not

06:52.130 --> 06:53.400
going to the shelter just

06:53.400 --> 06:56.430
we in their homes and going to relatives
houses or

06:56.430 --> 07:00.150
at Brent I'm so there's any number maybe
a hundred thousand people

07:00.150 --> 07:04.639
gorgeous but yes any update on the
diplomatic front any efforts towards a

07:04.639 --> 07:06.660
cease-fire

07:06.660 --> 07:09.720
not really I doesn't seem to be much
progress the israeli

07:09.720 --> 07:13.060
keep saying a Mac that's the Egyptian
ago at their

07:13.060 --> 07:16.470
they're ready for it I'm back it's
unclear where

07:16.470 --> 07:20.479
Inc and John Kerry again rumored to be
covering to Cairo and and have not

07:20.479 --> 07:21.430
showed up

07:21.430 --> 07:24.990
on I believe I'm keno and it's supposed
to be coming today I haven't heard

07:24.990 --> 07:26.360
anything about but at

07:26.360 --> 07:30.770
actually happening or what you doing
here so there's no a public progress

07:30.770 --> 07:35.380
you don't know I can what's this doing
to us. leverage

07:35.380 --> 07:38.610
in the region well I think US that

07:38.610 --> 07:42.449
lost a lot of its leverage in the region
lot lot its credibility here

07:42.449 --> 07:46.370
starting really where what happened with
cereal and

07:46.370 --> 07:50.690
obama said he was gonna attack and then
yeah I at congress and then

07:50.690 --> 07:55.259
ended up with a negotiated solution i
lot of people here thought that was side

07:55.259 --> 07:59.020
a real change up at resolve Washington

07:59.020 --> 08:02.789
show observe its own red line then just
threw out the arrow

08:02.789 --> 08:06.130
and it has changed at America as well

08:06.130 --> 08:09.229
the other thing of course is that take a
lot of other that

08:09.229 --> 08:12.910
think that play and now we've got this
huge crisis and Ukraine

08:12.910 --> 08:16.300
at diverting attention and of course
they're still here on negotiations

08:16.300 --> 08:20.990
set I think people here I'm are not
relying on the US the way they have

08:20.990 --> 08:24.240
before right jury were doing on the New
York Times

08:24.240 --> 08:29.380
thanks so much thank you there was a
series of bombings in Baghdad today

08:29.380 --> 08:33.409
authorities say at least 27 people were
killed including four policemen

08:33.409 --> 08:36.929
after bombs were detonated in Shiite
neighborhoods in the capital

08:36.929 --> 08:41.399
the attacks were the biggest since Sunni
extremists overran significant portions

08:41.399 --> 08:42.050
of northern

08:42.050 --> 08:46.040
and western Iraq weeks ago militants in
egypt today attacked a government

08:46.040 --> 08:48.470
checkpoint in the western part of the
country

08:48.470 --> 08:52.279
and fifteen soldiers reportedly were
killed the attack is believed to be

08:52.279 --> 08:55.730
retaliation for the government's
crackdown against supporters of the

08:55.730 --> 08:57.739
deposed President Mohammed Morsi

08:57.739 --> 09:01.319
the attack took place around sunset when
Muslims break their fast

09:01.319 --> 09:05.989
during Ramadan and a US drone strike
today in Pakistan near the border with

09:05.989 --> 09:08.279
Afghanistan reportedly killed 15

09:08.279 --> 09:12.249
militants it was the fourth drone strike
in the area since the beginning a

09:12.249 --> 09:14.160
Pakistani government offensive

09:14.160 --> 09:17.100
more than a month ago back in this
country the Environmental Protection

09:17.100 --> 09:21.579
Agency has taken steps to block the
development of a huge gold and copper

09:21.579 --> 09:23.069
mine in Alaska

09:23.069 --> 09:26.309
the EPA said the mine would have cause
what it called

09:26.309 --> 09:31.230
irreversible damage to one of the
world's last intact salmon ecosystems

09:31.230 --> 09:35.300
the state of Alaska and the mining
operators are suing the EPA

09:35.300 --> 09:38.519
they say the agency has exceeded its
authority

09:38.519 --> 09:42.170
industry altercation involving New York
City Police is drawing more attention

09:42.170 --> 09:43.309
today

09:43.309 --> 09:46.819
cell phone video obtained by The New
York Daily News shows a police officer

09:46.819 --> 09:50.129
apparently using a chokehold to bring
down a man they believe was

09:50.129 --> 09:55.220
selling untaxed cigarettes air card or a
43-year-old asthmatic died at a hospital

09:55.220 --> 09:57.949
an hour later a heart attack on Thursday

09:57.949 --> 10:01.819
the father of six can be heard on the
tape saying repeatedly that he could not

10:01.819 --> 10:02.670
breed

10:02.670 --> 10:06.069
while an officer pressed his face into
the sidewalk

10:06.069 --> 10:09.610
to have the officers involved were put
on desk duty New York City Police

10:09.610 --> 10:11.720
Department policy forbids the use

10:11.720 --> 10:15.860
%uh chokeholds and a new study found
that banning the use of hand-held cell

10:15.860 --> 10:20.999
phones by drivers does not necessarily
reduce the number of traffic accidents

10:20.999 --> 10:24.179
a professor from the University of
Colorado Boulder who examined data for

10:24.179 --> 10:25.170
six months

10:25.170 --> 10:29.459
preceding and following california's law
that forces drivers not to handle their

10:29.459 --> 10:30.649
phones while driving

10:30.649 --> 10:35.129
thinks the conversations on the phones
might be just as distracting as whether

10:35.129 --> 10:40.860
drivers are holding their phones are not

10:40.860 --> 10:47.860

parts of China and the Philippines

11:00.290 --> 11:03.800

doesn't begin to compare with the loss

11:03.800 --> 11:08.250
of life caused by another typhoon that
ravaged the Philippines late last year

11:08.250 --> 11:12.200

11:18.050 --> 11:22.140
after the storm hit but not all the
money that was pledged an

still to come

11:41.940 --> 11:46.070
a storm surge a wall of water twenty
feet high

is being a joint today the smile on her
mother's face

12:29.670 --> 12:32.709
says it all I'm plus

12:32.709 --> 12:37.890
I am so happy that she has grown I'm
happy that we survived and we're all

12:37.890 --> 12:39.070
here together

12:39.070 --> 12:42.260
but the smiles fade when the talk turns
to

12:42.260 --> 12:46.260
the trauma inflicted by the typhoon do
you still want to live here

12:46.260 --> 12:50.810
and Tacloban the Sun amina we want to
live far away from the sea

12:50.810 --> 12:57.230
when it's raining in the weeds get
higher I'm afraid all over again

12:57.230 --> 13:00.019
I'll in the language of

13:00.019 --> 13:04.779
international relief efforts the
humanitarian situation has stabilized

13:04.779 --> 13:06.350
across the affected regions

13:06.350 --> 13:11.130
but eight months later this is what
stabilized looks like

13:11.130 --> 13:15.640
tens of thousands of families still
living in refugee tent

13:15.640 --> 13:20.110
or makeshift shacks the Philippine
government has reportedly bill

13:20.110 --> 13:25.050
fewer than 200 above the 200 thousand
permanent homes it promised

13:25.050 --> 13:28.209
and now growing concerns about

13:28.209 --> 13:31.730
unsanitary conditions the threat of
communicable diseases

13:31.730 --> 13:36.810
and will pay with a massive rebuilding
that lies ahead and

13:36.810 --> 13:40.779
the international community pledged
about eight hundred million dollars in

13:40.779 --> 13:42.190
post-disaster aid

13:42.190 --> 13:45.329
but just 463 million

13:45.329 --> 13:49.779
has been delivered and help from the
central Philippine government has also

13:49.779 --> 13:51.070
been slow to a rock

13:51.070 --> 13:55.040
categorically I'm not pleased with the
response

13:55.040 --> 13:58.399
talk no one mare Alfred from Aldis says

13:58.399 --> 14:02.839
the pace of recovery has picked up
recently in central Tacloban today

14:02.839 --> 14:04.490
businesses are reopening

14:04.490 --> 14:09.260
streets are filled with traffic again
but many are still furious with the

14:09.260 --> 14:10.959
Philippine government's response

14:10.959 --> 14:15.110
why do we still have I'm you sleeping in
tents and children now

14:15.110 --> 14:19.570
catching ammonia from the heat and all
that and it's really heartbreaking

14:19.570 --> 14:22.870
the man chosen as the typhoon recoveries
are

14:22.870 --> 14:26.149
penfield lax on insist the recovery

14:26.149 --> 14:29.670
is now on track and he tries to
emphasize the positive

14:29.670 --> 14:34.550
the fact that we don't have an epidemic
we don't if I mean

14:34.550 --> 14:37.980
and there's no breakdown of law and
order a

14:37.980 --> 14:41.079
I think government is responded the well
enough

14:41.079 --> 14:45.399
lax on admits the recovery has not gone
as quickly as he hoped

14:45.399 --> 14:49.209
partly he says because relief efforts
have to be closely monitored

14:49.209 --> 14:52.660
to eliminate corruption they cannot get
away with it because

14:52.660 --> 14:56.920
I'll be there watching because that's
part of my Monday but as of now

14:56.920 --> 15:00.500
the government still has not released
its promised master plan

15:00.500 --> 15:05.520
reconstruction so many Filipinos have
had to rely on their own initiative

15:05.520 --> 15:10.350
to do with the government has not done
so far jumping Filipinos are

15:10.350 --> 15:15.240
very used to there are a couple love
commonly used expressions that you here

15:15.240 --> 15:18.199
in the Philippines especially in
difficult times

15:18.199 --> 15:22.350
Behala now there's nothing we can do
about it we'll just have faith that

15:22.350 --> 15:26.510
things will get better then there's
discarded along

15:26.510 --> 15:30.910
if it's broken well we'll just figure
out some way to patch it together

15:30.910 --> 15:34.090
and get it working again

15:34.090 --> 15:37.040
it helps explain the efforts of dante
and earl or

15:37.040 --> 15:40.530
linger they set up an outdoor soup
kitchen

15:40.530 --> 15:43.720
the hundreds of local children who lost
homes

15:43.720 --> 15:47.990
siblings parents all the more remarkable

15:47.990 --> 15:52.820
given that dante and lore lost 32
relatives in the storm

15:52.820 --> 15:57.550
and three of their four children their
two youngest boys were crushed under a

15:57.550 --> 15:58.450
crossbeam

15:58.450 --> 16:02.400
when their house collapsed and mean we
find them

16:02.400 --> 16:03.190
holding

16:03.190 --> 16:08.610
hands they couldn't find their
daughter's body for another two days

16:08.610 --> 16:12.240
so this is how they deal with their
grief

16:12.240 --> 16:15.610
by helping others we do these difference

16:15.610 --> 16:18.820
the is for him tuned

16:18.820 --> 16:24.050
ordinary Filipinos find in their own way
to deal with the crisis

16:24.050 --> 16:31.050
the people who could began building
their own shelters almost immediately

16:32.190 --> 16:32.529
and

16:32.529 --> 16:36.650
it continues today and many have ignored
a government decree

16:36.650 --> 16:40.670
to not rebuild close to the water again
nowhere

16:40.670 --> 16:43.690
is that more obvious then in the
district of unabomb

16:43.690 --> 16:49.130
completely wiped out by the typhoon but
patch back together within two months

16:49.130 --> 16:52.670
today it's a crowded warren of makeshift
shacks

16:52.670 --> 16:55.860
much worse than living conditions here
before the storm

16:55.860 --> 16:59.880
and now sharing space with three
enormous freighters

16:59.880 --> 17:03.370
still stranded on shore for the people
%uh unabomb

17:03.370 --> 17:07.730
the freighters are hawking symbols the
slow and uneven recovery

17:07.730 --> 17:11.500
that they blame in large part on the
government did the government promised

17:11.500 --> 17:12.370
they would

17:12.370 --> 17:16.880
help give you a new home newhouse at
night allowing

17:16.880 --> 17:21.079
promised but no no sign a video

17:21.079 --> 17:25.050
in fact throughout the entire typhoons
om

17:25.050 --> 17:29.179
the UN estimates there are more than one
million people still living in

17:29.179 --> 17:32.920
inadequate housing still vulnerable to
the next big storm

17:32.920 --> 17:36.540
and well people here are well aware of
the danger

17:36.540 --> 17:40.400
they say they're more immediate concern
is jobs

17:40.400 --> 17:43.590
which are in short supply for
individuals

17:43.590 --> 17:47.600
and entire industries like so many here

17:47.600 --> 17:51.580
Emily Ortega and her husband haven't
found work they're still dependent on

17:51.580 --> 17:53.120
humanitarian aid

17:53.120 --> 17:57.770
and to have this region's biggest
industry were decimated by the typhoon

17:57.770 --> 18:01.080
more than 30 million coconut trees were
wiped out

18:01.080 --> 18:05.280
affecting the livelihood of 1 million
families who farm coconuts

18:05.280 --> 18:11.490
it will take more than seven years for
any new trees to bear fruit

18:11.490 --> 18:15.850
and fishermen aren't very much better
loose on took a steal your

18:15.850 --> 18:20.640
has fished these waters all his life
today barely catches enough to feed his

18:20.640 --> 18:22.950
family this is all you caught today

18:22.950 --> 18:28.540
only this only this up

18:28.540 --> 18:32.200
loose onto says the force of the storm
the debris

18:32.200 --> 18:36.610
the pollutants left in the water have
seriously damaged the fishing grounds

18:36.610 --> 18:40.500
well government and humanitarian aid
groups move quickly

18:40.500 --> 18:44.970
to replace thousands have destroyed
boats fishermen say they now need

18:44.970 --> 18:48.190
bigger boats to go farther out to sea
the

18:48.190 --> 18:51.630
mother mean even plus he did to my
stomach before the typhoon

18:51.630 --> 18:55.440
there was a variety of issuer some could
be as big as five kilos

18:55.440 --> 18:59.550
now we can only catch this I guess the
fish went to another place

18:59.550 --> 19:04.190
cogan addition by shape fishing is in
bad shape Philippine Red Cross chairman

19:04.190 --> 19:08.170
Richard Gordon has been one of the most
vocal critics of the government

19:08.170 --> 19:11.610
same it still hasn't done enough to me
bill or

19:11.610 --> 19:16.000
revitalize the economy in the disaster
zone from the ground up

19:16.000 --> 19:20.280
so you really have to come in and you
know let the day following the cause so

19:20.280 --> 19:21.020
much damage

19:21.020 --> 19:24.110
solve the problem in terms up
reconstruction skills

19:24.110 --> 19:27.980
so that and a brace so they took the
daily wake up the economy

19:27.980 --> 19:32.430
Gordon also says the Philippine
government is not yet prepared for the

19:32.430 --> 19:33.550
next big storm

19:33.550 --> 19:37.880
so the Red Cross is now stacking
supplies in new warehouses around the

19:37.880 --> 19:38.460
region

19:38.460 --> 19:42.510
that's what I did and sponsoring
community education drills

19:42.510 --> 19:47.460
on how to respond to typhoon warnings
and with the Philippine school year just

19:47.460 --> 19:48.370
beginning

19:48.370 --> 19:51.380
this is the state have many schools in
the region

19:51.380 --> 19:55.750
more than 18,000 classrooms need to be
rebuilt or repaired

19:55.750 --> 20:00.310
so most classes are being held in
temporary huts or tense

20:00.310 --> 20:04.270
so love these children

20:04.270 --> 20:07.620
walk for miles just take part in school
activities

20:07.620 --> 20:12.310
organized by the aid group Save the
Children here

20:12.310 --> 20:16.650
eleven-year-old Sheila Mae can enjoy the
company of other children

20:16.650 --> 20:19.970
and draw pictures up what nearly
everyone here lost

20:19.970 --> 20:23.670
their homes treat really important that
children how

20:23.670 --> 20:27.230
safe space where they can play in Marion
and

20:27.230 --> 20:30.830
recover from the impact on the typhoon

20:30.830 --> 20:34.140
Save the Children Kate Nolan says the
Philippines

20:34.140 --> 20:37.470
still needs a great deal with help from
the international community

20:37.470 --> 20:40.910
but as often happens months after a
major disaster

20:40.910 --> 20:45.270
money is starting to dry up as donor
fatigue sets in

20:45.270 --> 20:49.500
Save the Children has only raised
two-thirds of the donations it says it

20:49.500 --> 20:50.030
needs

20:50.030 --> 20:53.320
for its operations here people and
things will

20:53.320 --> 20:56.780
generous but unless people continued to

20:56.780 --> 21:01.250
mobilize that longer term support to
help people to recover

21:01.250 --> 21:04.380
typhoon high and could be devastating
legacy

21:04.380 --> 21:07.800
word thousands of children and their
families up

21:07.800 --> 21:08.750
me

21:08.750 --> 21:11.190
don't like me

21:11.190 --> 21:16.370
for Emily ortega the young mother whose
child was born in the rubble the town

21:16.370 --> 21:17.580
destroyed

21:17.580 --> 21:22.340
in the way have the strongest typhoon
ever recorded

21:22.340 --> 21:25.600
every day with her child her family

21:25.600 --> 21:29.580
is a gift she never expected but like

21:29.580 --> 21:33.880
so many other survivors she fears her
family will never again

21:33.880 --> 21:40.309
feel completely safe and secure

21:40.309 --> 21:43.389
to learn more about life on the ground
where the typhoon struck

21:43.389 --> 21:47.909
read our producer's notebook online

in

22:15.150 --> 22:18.580
and now to viewers like you

22:18.580 --> 22:22.870
your take about some of our recent work
much of what we heard was about last

22:22.870 --> 22:23.390
weekend's

22:23.390 --> 22:27.340
signature story describing how many
people don't think to share their online

22:27.340 --> 22:29.160
account information with loved ones

22:29.160 --> 22:34.180
and the consequences are that after they
die Sally Garza wrote us on Facebook

22:34.180 --> 22:37.830
this is a really important issue that
people need to talk about

22:37.830 --> 22:41.720
I know we had to deal with a lot of this
on my dad passed away a few years ago

22:41.720 --> 22:45.350
make sure you have a plan for what
happens to your digital accounts

22:45.350 --> 22:50.450
Hannah BP added this the level of
problem depends on what kind of account

22:50.450 --> 22:51.430
it is of course

22:51.430 --> 22:55.190
it's mostly concerned because I'm
identity theft if accounts are closed

22:55.190 --> 22:55.760
out

22:55.760 --> 22:59.670
and no one is able to war is on a where
they need to manage and monitor them

22:59.670 --> 23:03.050
they can be access by those that
shouldn't have access

23:03.050 --> 23:07.830
while those who should are locked out
even without identity theft it can be a

23:07.830 --> 23:09.240
major issue if

23:09.240 --> 23:13.140
assets are inaccessible or take a very
long time to recover

23:13.140 --> 23:17.110
for family leaving them vulnerable to
predators in the in term

23:17.110 --> 23:21.530
this is what we heard from Karen
Lawrence coleman if you see it coming

23:21.530 --> 23:24.780
you can just shut down your online
accounts better yet

23:24.780 --> 23:30.110
shut them down as you no longer use them
by the time you hit 75 the account you

23:30.110 --> 23:32.270
use are likely to be down by half

23:32.270 --> 23:36.800
that's probably a good time to start
doing without most if you live that long

23:36.800 --> 23:40.880
getting rid of them is great peace of
mind considering how criminals you

23:40.880 --> 23:42.860
Social Security death records

23:42.860 --> 23:48.110
Patricia Biggs had these words of advice
perhaps people should tell those they

23:48.110 --> 23:49.660
love the important things

23:49.660 --> 23:54.870
while they're still alive just sayin by
Jeffrey dick had his own solution

23:54.870 --> 23:58.590
I'm gonna bombard my children with
pre-recorded messages

23:58.590 --> 24:03.090
time to be sent years after I die
