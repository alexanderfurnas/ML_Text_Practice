04:02.333 --> 04:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE EIGHT STANDARDIZED TESTS

04:03.433 --> 04:04.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY YEAR.

04:04.767 --> 04:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S ALMOST ONE TEST A MONTH

04:05.700 --> 04:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR.

04:07.433 --> 04:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A FACEBOOK VIDEO YESTERDAY,

04:08.833 --> 04:10.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT SAID TEACHERS HAVE

04:10.567 --> 04:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOLD HIM THE PRESSURE TO TEACH

04:11.967 --> 04:12.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THOSE TESTS, QUOTE: "TAKES

THE JOY OUT OF TEACHING AND

04:13.667 --> 04:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEARNING."

04:15.233 --> 04:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS ADMINISTRATION HAS NOW

04:16.833 --> 04:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELEASED A "TESTING ACTION PLAN"

04:17.867 --> 04:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH NEW GUIDELINES.

04:19.433 --> 04:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR MORE INSIGHT ON THAT, I'M

04:27.233 --> 04:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS VERY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE, WHY

04:29.133 --> 04:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS HE COMING OUT NOW?

04:30.233 --> 04:32.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK THEY WANTED TO

04:32.667 --> 04:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET PAST THE SPRING TESTING THE

04:34.300 --> 04:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUSH LAST YEAR, OR THIS YEAR,

04:36.233 --> 04:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK ALSO THERE WAS A

04:37.433 --> 04:38.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORT COMING OUT FROM COUNCIL

04:38.767 --> 04:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF GRADE CITY SCHOOLS WHICH IS A

COALITION OF 20 URBAN SCHOOL

04:42.433 --> 04:43.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRICT AND THEY GENERALLY HAVE

04:43.567 --> 04:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN PROTESTING BUT THE

04:45.000 --> 04:46.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPERINTENDENT SET OUT TO FIND

04:46.367 --> 04:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:47.600 --> 04:50.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING AND THE REPORT CAME OUT

04:50.267 --> 04:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SATURDAY WITH THEY ARE JUST, AS

04:51.633 --> 04:53.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SAID, YOU KNOW, EIGHT TEST

04:53.067 --> 04:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YEAR, THERE ARE JUST SO MANY,

04:55.833 --> 04:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO MANY DIFFERENT TESTS, A LOT

04:57.033 --> 04:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THESE TESTS ARE NOT ONLY

04:58.733 --> 05:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONEROUS BUT KIND OF POINT LESS

05:00.133 --> 05:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND PURPOSELESS AND NOT TIED TO

05:01.433 --> 05:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE WANT THEM TO BE TIED TO,

05:02.967 --> 05:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEARNING IN THE CLASSROOM.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: SO THE PRESIDENT

05:05.600 --> 05:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACKNOWLEDGES MAYBE WE ARE

05:07.800 --> 05:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTING KIDS TOO MUCH, EVEN

05:10.433 --> 05:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AKNOWLEDGES HIS ADMINISTRATION

05:11.600 --> 05:12.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAY BE PART OF THE PROBLEM.

05:12.867 --> 05:14.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS HE PROPOSING AS A

05:14.067 --> 05:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBLE SOLUTION TO THAT A?.

05:15.567 --> 05:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK WHAT WILL JUMP OUT TO

05:16.667 --> 05:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE IS HE WANTS A CAP ON THE

05:18.200 --> 05:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME SPENT ON TESTING SO NO MORE

05:20.233 --> 05:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN TWO PERCENT OF CLASSROOM

05:21.333 --> 05:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME SHOULD BE SPENT ON TESTING

05:22.767 --> 05:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IS A REDUCTION FROM

05:24.233 --> 05:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THE COUNCIL OF GRADE SCHOOL

05:26.967 --> 05:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUND BUT THEY ARE PROPOSING

05:28.133 --> 05:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS LIKE, SAYING NO TEACHER

05:30.067 --> 05:31.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD BE EVALUATED SOLELY ON

05:31.767 --> 05:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTS, NO CHILD SHOULD BE, NO

05:34.267 --> 05:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD FROM HIGH SCHOOL

05:35.000 --> 05:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADUATION OR ANY CUTOFF SHOULD

05:36.633 --> 05:37.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE ATTACHED SOLELY TO A TEST SO

05:37.967 --> 05:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS A BIG DEAL, BIG

05:40.100 --> 05:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROPONENTS OF TESTING THAT GOT

05:41.467 --> 05:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
US IN TROUBLE, THEY WANTED

05:42.633 --> 05:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTING THE PROBLEM IS WE

05:43.833 --> 05:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTED TYING IT TOO TO TOO MANY

05:46.633 --> 05:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS, TEACHERS WON'T GET

05:48.067 --> 05:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TENURE IF THEY DON'T PASS THE

05:49.500 --> 05:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEST OR THE KIDS, OR KIDS WON'T

05:52.133 --> 05:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL IF

05:53.600 --> 05:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DON'T PASS THE TESTS.

05:54.367 --> 05:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: 0 SO THE

05:55.533 --> 05:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADVOCATES OF TESTING SAY, OKAY

05:57.067 --> 05:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF REFORM IS

05:58.533 --> 06:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USEFUL BUT DON'T THROW THE BABY

06:01.967 --> 06:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT WITH THE BATH WATER.

06:03.933 --> 06:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY, THIS IS A 15 YEAR

06:05.767 --> 06:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPROACH, BEFORE THIS IS

06:06.733 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING, THERE WAS AT THAT LOT

06:07.467 --> 06:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF KIDS, PARTICULARLY IN URBAN

06:09.433 --> 06:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOLS, WHO WERE NOT LEARNING

06:10.967 --> 06:13.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING, AND SO, NOT LEARNING

06:13.567 --> 06:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- NOT LEARNING IS WORSE BUT

06:14.700 --> 06:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS NO ACCOUNTABILITY AND

06:16.300 --> 06:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO STANDARDS AND PASSING THEM

06:19.267 --> 06:20.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM GRADE TO FRAYED SO THIS IS

06:20.467 --> 06:22.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN EFFORT TO MAKE SURE WE HAD

06:22.167 --> 06:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME ACCOUNTABILITY, THIS IS A

06:24.200 --> 06:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$600 BILLION INDUSTRY, PUBLIC

06:25.133 --> 06:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL IN AMERICA, IT IS

06:26.233 --> 06:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REASONABLE TO EXPECT AT THAT WE

06:27.567 --> 06:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD WANT WITH SOME

06:28.667 --> 06:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCOUNTABILITY BUT THE PROBLEM

06:29.700 --> 06:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS, AS IN MANY THINGS THE

06:31.900 --> 06:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENDULUM SWUNG TOO FAR.

06:32.500 --> 06:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

06:33.433 --> 06:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A HUGE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE ACROSS

06:35.267 --> 06:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY, A LOT OF PARENTS

06:36.800 --> 06:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN

06:38.100 --> 06:39.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A REAL UPROAR OVER THIS

06:39.767 --> 06:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTING, DO YOU THINK THIS

06:40.967 --> 06:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFORT BY THE PRESIDENT, THIS

06:42.067 --> 06:44.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INITIATIVE IS GOING TO PUT -- IS

06:44.367 --> 06:46.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO SATISFY THE CRITICS?

06:46.267 --> 06:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, I REALLY DON'T THINK

06:47.100 --> 06:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS, I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

06:48.600 --> 06:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE SAYING THIS IS TOO LITTLE

06:50.400 --> 06:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOO LATE.

06:50.933 --> 06:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, THE QUESTION REALLY

06:51.900 --> 06:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN IN SUBURBAN DISTRICTS

06:53.300 --> 06:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE PEOPLE FELT SCHOOLS ARE

06:55.033 --> 06:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FINE, WHY IS THERE THIS PUSH?

06:56.400 --> 06:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING FINE,

06:57.367 --> 06:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS NOT OUR PROBLEM.

06:58.533 --> 06:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OPT OUT MOVEMENT WE HAVE

06:59.700 --> 07:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEN HAS LARGELY BEEN IN

07:01.733 --> 07:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBURBAN DISTRICTS AND WE HAVE

07:03.233 --> 07:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEN VERY FEW OPT OUTS IN URBAN

07:05.700 --> 07:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRICTS, I THINK THE PROBLEM

07:06.833 --> 07:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS GOING TO SAY WE WANT THIS CAP

07:09.000 --> 07:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON TESTING BUT WHAT KIND OF

07:10.900 --> 07:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTS WILL WE BE ALLOWED TO USE,

07:12.233 --> 07:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM,

07:14.867 --> 07:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOL IN THIS COUNTRY ASK A

07:16.333 --> 07:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TEST OR YOU SHOULDN'T USE

07:19.233 --> 07:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS TEST, THAT IS THE PROBLEM

07:20.300 --> 07:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE GOING TO SEE AGAIN AS

07:22.100 --> 07:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WILL CALL IT A FEDERAL

THIS SEEMS TO BE A VERY

08:13.300 --> 08:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTENTIOUS MEETING THESE LAST

08:14.267 --> 08:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEW WEEKS, EXPLAIN WHAT IS GOING

08:15.600 --> 08:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THERE.

08:16.167 --> 08:18.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS

08:18.567 --> 08:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BISHOPS WERE DISCUSSING,

08:20.600 --> 08:22.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BISHOPS FROM AROUND THE WORLD,

08:22.800 --> 08:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT 270 OF THEM PLUS ANOTHER

08:23.767 --> 08:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
50 OR 60 DELEGATES AND OBSERVERS

08:26.100 --> 08:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE DISCUSSING FAMILY ISSUES.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DISCUSSED A WHOLE RANGE OF

08:29.167 --> 08:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES, BUT THE KEY, THE TWO KEY

08:32.633 --> 08:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELEMENTS THAT EMERGE AS THE MOST

08:35.433 --> 08:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTENTIOUS WAS HOW THE CHURCH

08:37.300 --> 08:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE MORE MERCIFUL TO THOSE

08:41.433 --> 08:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CATHOLICS WHO ARE DIVORCED, THE

08:43.367 --> 08:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHURCH DOES NOT RECOGNIZE

08:44.700 --> 08:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVORCE AND THEN REMARRIED

08:45.900 --> 08:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH WITHOUT

08:47.000 --> 08:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVING A CHURCH ANNULMENT.

08:49.633 --> 08:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, A GOOD NUMBER OF THEM WANT

08:50.733 --> 08:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO RETURN TO THE CHURCH

08:53.667 --> 08:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETELY WILLING TO BE ALLOWED

08:54.700 --> 08:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO RECEIVE COMMUNION.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AS THINGS STAND NOW, THEY

08:58.967 --> 09:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN ONLY RECEIVE COMMUNION IF

09:01.567 --> 09:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ABSTAIN FROM SEX WITH THEIR

09:03.833 --> 09:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW PARTNER.

09:04.800 --> 09:05.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHERWISE, THEY ARE CONSIDERED

09:05.567 --> 09:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE AN ADULTEROUS

09:06.667 --> 09:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP.

09:08.167 --> 09:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF

09:09.467 --> 09:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTROVERSY ABOUT THAT, AND A

09:11.500 --> 09:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF REQUESTS, PARTICULARLY

09:12.933 --> 09:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE GERMAN BISHOPS AND

OTHER BISHOPS CONFERENCES IN

09:17.167 --> 09:18.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EUROPE, AND EVEN ONE OR TWO

09:18.767 --> 09:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BISHOPS IN THE STATES, SO THE

09:20.300 --> 09:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROPOSAL WAS TO ALLOW LOCAL

09:24.200 --> 09:26.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BISHOPS OR A CONFESSOR TO DECIDE

09:26.967 --> 09:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER WITH THE CATHOLIC ON A

09:29.533 --> 09:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASE-BY-CASE BASIS WHETHER HE OR

09:30.633 --> 09:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE FEELS THAT IN GOOD

09:32.433 --> 09:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSCIENCE THEY CAN GO TO

09:33.567 --> 09:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNION.

09:34.533 --> 09:38.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THIS WAS APPROVED AS A

09:38.867 --> 09:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBILITY BY THE SYNOD THAT

09:39.900 --> 09:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS TO BE DEVELOPED A BIT BUT

09:42.067 --> 09:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS CLEARLY A VICTORY FOR

09:43.267 --> 09:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEY DECIDED JUST TO SIDESTEP

THAT ISSUE ALMOST TOTALLY AND

10:46.900 --> 10:49.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONLY MENTION OF

10:49.667 --> 10:52.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOMOSEXUALITY IS HOW TO -- HOW

10:52.567 --> 10:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

10:59.167 --> 11:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT RESTATED THE CHURCH'S

11:00.767 --> 11:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSITION THAT A HOMOSEXUAL
