JUDY WOODRUFF: And just one
more of the poll's findings.

00:03.466 --> 00:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When asked about the president's
financial dealings, 33 percent
of those polled say they

00:08.866 --> 00:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believe he has done
something illegal.

00:10.900 --> 00:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An additional 28 percent
feel he has done something
unethical, but not illegal.

00:17.066 --> 00:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And 31 percent believe he
has done nothing wrong.

00:19.833 --> 00:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our correspondent John Yang
takes a closer look at ethical
concerns over the president's

00:24.266 --> 00:29.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
business interests
and his unprecedented
early reelection run.

00:31.233 --> 00:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The day President
Trump took the oath of office,
he did something no chief

00:37.700 --> 00:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
executive before him had ever
done on Inauguration Day, filed
the paperwork to be an official

00:44.700 --> 00:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
candidate for reelection.

00:46.866 --> 00:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The move allows him to raise,
money more than $13 million in
the first three months of the

00:53.866 --> 00:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, and hold rallies paid for
by his campaign, like this one
last week in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

01:00.633 --> 01:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: We're not even
campaigning, and look at this

01:01.933 --> 01:03.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crowd.

01:03.133 --> 01:04.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: The president
of the United States!

01:04.766 --> 01:07.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: But he
is campaigning.

01:07.400 --> 01:12.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His first reelection
event was just 29 days
into his presidency.

01:14.433 --> 01:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All five of his campaign-paid
rallies have been in states he
won in last year's election:

01:19.000 --> 01:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Florida, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Pennsylvania, and Iowa.

01:26.000 --> 01:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Campaign events give him greater
flexibility, like being able
to sell Make America Great

01:31.733 --> 01:34.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Again merchandise.

01:34.200 --> 01:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL STEEL, Republican
Strategist: This is
an opportunity for the
president to spread

01:35.733 --> 01:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his message directly to his most
active and energized supporters.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's also an opportunity
to raise money, to
sell merchandise.

01:46.666 --> 01:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In some cases, like the
fund-raiser here in Washington,
it's an opportunity to patronize

01:49.400 --> 01:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his own business establishments.

01:51.500 --> 01:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: And I am here to
tell you about our incredible
progress in making America

01:56.600 --> 01:58.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great again.

01:58.100 --> 01:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They have been
vintage Donald Trump.

01:59.800 --> 02:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: We are
going to start taking
care of our country.

02:04.200 --> 02:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And they seem to
boost Mr. Trump's mood, getting
him out of Washington and in

02:10.266 --> 02:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
front of enthusiastic crowds.

02:12.766 --> 02:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, here at the
Trump International Hotel,
just five blocks away
from the White House,

02:19.600 --> 02:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first big fund-raiser of the
2020 campaign, it's benefiting
both the Trump campaign and

02:24.333 --> 02:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Republican
National Committee.

02:25.966 --> 02:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The top ticket is
$35,000 a head.

02:30.933 --> 02:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The choice of venue highlights
the flow of campaign cash into
Trump Organization businesses,

02:37.900 --> 02:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a practice, which is legal, of
his first run that continues
in his bid for reelection.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Trump campaign
declined a request to
comment for this story.

02:47.166 --> 02:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But deputy campaign manager
Michael Glassner told the
Associated Press that they chose

02:53.633 --> 02:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Trump Hotel because it's a
premier and convenient location.

02:59.366 --> 03:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has walked away
from day-to-day management of
his hotels, golf courses and

03:01.966 --> 03:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other businesses, placing all
his assets into a trust, of
which he's the sole beneficiary.

03:08.866 --> 03:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ethics lawyer Kenneth Gross
says he's never seen a candidate
pay so much money to his

03:14.466 --> 03:16.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own businesses.

03:16.566 --> 03:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KENNETH GROSS, Ethics
Law Expert: What we saw
during the campaign is
the campaign committee

03:18.500 --> 03:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paying Trump facilities,
whether it's the Trump Hotel
or Mar-a-Lago, or renting space

03:25.666 --> 03:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the Trump Tower in New
York, which it did for the
campaign headquarters, buying

03:32.066 --> 03:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump steaks, Trump vodka,
Trump wine, Trump ice.

03:38.900 --> 03:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All this is money from the
campaign that eventually
goes to fatten the
wallets of Trump, Inc.

03:45.633 --> 03:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know of anything illegal
about having a campaign do
a campaign visit at your own

03:53.433 --> 03:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
owned facility, as long
as it's arms-length.

03:55.800 --> 03:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think, from an appearance
standpoint, it's not great.

03:58.600 --> 04:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The reelection
campaign spent more
than $6.3 million in
the first three months

04:04.200 --> 04:06.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the year.

04:06.833 --> 04:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than $450,000 of that
went to Trump businesses,
including rent at the
Trump Tower in New York

04:12.166 --> 04:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Trump hotels in New York
and Las Vegas, catering from
Trump restaurants, and thousands

04:17.966 --> 04:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of dollars for
Trump bottled water.

04:20.133 --> 04:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Critics say holding campaign
events at Trump properties
also gives them free publicity

04:25.033 --> 04:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and added prestige.

04:27.366 --> 04:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lawsuit from the Democratic
attorneys general of
Maryland and the District
of Columbia alleges

04:33.533 --> 04:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, since Mr. Trump took
office, goods and services sold
by various Trump businesses

04:38.000 --> 04:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have sold at a premium.

04:39.700 --> 04:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It said room rates at
his D.C. hotel have gone
up hundreds of dollars.

04:43.500 --> 04:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARL RACINE, D.C. Attorney
General: Never in the history
of this country have we had

04:47.333 --> 04:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a president with these
kinds of extensive business
entanglements or a president who

04:53.766 --> 04:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
refused to adequately distance
themselves from their holdings.

04:57.200 --> 05:02.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: White House Press
Secretary Sean Spicer called
the suit partisan politics.

05:04.200 --> 05:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, at the Trump Hotel
fund-raiser, the only politics
on anybody's mind is likely

05:09.333 --> 05:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be the 2020 campaign, as
the man who rewrote the book on
running for president appears

05:14.166 --> 05:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be trying to rewrite the
book on running for reelection.

05:18.633 --> 05:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
John Yang in Washington.
