04:26.100 --> 04:28.267
THEY HAD A THREE-HOUR MEETIN

04:28.267 --> 04:30.500
EARLIER AND APPARENTLY, THER

04:30.500 --> 04:32.600
IS -- EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLIN

04:32.600 --> 04:34.467
OVER THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE OF THIS

04:34.467 --> 04:34.933
TEXT

04:34.933 --> 04:37.067
FOREIGN MINISTERS ZARIF SAID

04:37.067 --> 04:39.300
EARLIER TODAY, HE SAID EVERY

04:39.300 --> 04:41.200
WORD AND EXPRESSION HAS IT'S OWN

04:41.200 --> 04:43.567
MEANING AND REQUIRES CAUTION

04:43.567 --> 04:44.967
THEN HIS DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER

04:44.967 --> 04:46.933
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON

04:46.933 --> 04:49.067
SAID AT ONE POINT HE CALLED THIS

04:49.067 --> 04:50.567
BREATHE TAKINGLY DIFFICULT AND

04:50.567 --> 04:54.100
AGAIN, HE REFERRED TO WORDS AN

04:54.100 --> 04:54.200
TEXT

04:54.200 --> 04:57.500
AND HE SAID, YOU KNOW, THA

04:57.500 --> 04:58.700
WE'RE MAKING MORE PROGRESS H

04:58.700 --> 05:00.500
SAID THAN YESTERDAY, BUT IT IS

05:00.500 --> 05:01.967
NOT AT ALL CLEAR THAT WE'LL HAVE

05:01.967 --> 05:02.900
THIS DONE TONIGHT.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.433
>> SO IF BOTH SIDES WANT A DEAL,

05:05.433 --> 05:06.400
WHY IS THIS PROVING SO

05:06.400 --> 05:06.967
DIFFICULT?

05:06.967 --> 05:09.567
>> YOU KNOW, THAT'S A VERY GOO

05:09.567 --> 05:11.433
QUESTION, HARI, BECAUSE I THIN

05:11.433 --> 05:13.633
IT INVITES ONE TO STEP BACK.

05:13.633 --> 05:17.200
IN OTHER WORDS, YES, THEY AR

05:17.200 --> 05:18.533
ARGUING ABOUT IT'S REPORTED.

05:18.533 --> 05:21.533
WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH TH

05:21.533 --> 05:23.700
PLUTONIUM HEAVY REACTOR, THE ONE

05:23.700 --> 05:25.633
YOU CAN'T BOMB ONCE OPERATIONA

05:25.633 --> 05:27.167
BECAUSE IT WILL SPREAD DEADL

05:27.167 --> 05:27.500
RADIATION.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.167
THERE IS STILL APPARENTLY SOME

05:29.167 --> 05:32.167
HASSLE ABOUT THE WORDING O

05:32.167 --> 05:34.200
IRAN'S ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES

05:34.200 --> 05:36.333
BUT THOSE ARE JUST SMALL

05:36.333 --> 05:39.300
RELATIVELY SMALL SPECIFICS

05:39.300 --> 05:42.133
WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE HERE IS

05:42.133 --> 05:43.767
EACH SIDE WANTS TO MAINTAI

05:43.767 --> 05:44.800
LEVERAGE FOR THE BIG DEAL THEY

05:44.800 --> 05:47.000
ARE SUPPOSED TO NEGOTIATE IN THE

05:47.000 --> 05:48.533
NEXT SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR.

05:48.533 --> 05:51.500
WITH ALL THE ATTENTION WE FOCU

05:51.500 --> 05:53.633
ON THIS FIRST PHASE DEAL, IT'S

05:53.633 --> 05:55.133
THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG AND THE

05:55.133 --> 05:57.333
IDEA WAS SIMPLY FOR EACH SIDE TO

05:57.333 --> 05:59.200
GIVE ENOUGH TO SORT OF FREEZ

05:59.200 --> 06:00.867
IRAN'S PROGRAM AT LEAST IN

06:00.867 --> 06:03.100
PLACE, RELIEF A FEW SANCTIONS TO

06:03.100 --> 06:05.100
BUY TIME ON THE CLOCK, WHICH I

06:05.100 --> 06:06.967
WHAT EVERYONE SAYS, SO THAT IRAN

06:06.967 --> 06:09.733
WON'T ACHIEVE NEW CLEAR BREAKOUT

06:09.733 --> 06:11.333
BEFORE THEY CAN NEGOTIATE

06:11.333 --> 06:12.933
FINAL, FINAL DEAL.

06:12.933 --> 06:15.400
SO EACH SIDE WANTS TO MAINTAIN A

06:15.400 --> 06:18.000
LOT OF PAINFUL LEVERAGE OVER THE

06:18.000 --> 06:18.733
OTHER.

06:18.733 --> 06:21.467
SO FOR IRAN, THAT MEANS, OKAY,

06:21.467 --> 06:23.433
MAYBE WE'LL FREEZE MANY PARTS OR

06:23.433 --> 06:26.733
ALL OF OUR PROGRAM, BUT WE DON'T

06:26.733 --> 06:28.300
WANT TO NOT STILL LOOK FRANKLY

06:28.300 --> 06:32.300
LIKE A THREAT, AND THE U.S. AN

06:32.300 --> 06:34.533
THE WEST ARE WILLING TO EASE

06:34.533 --> 06:35.867
SOME SANCTIONS, BUT THEY DON'T

06:35.867 --> 06:37.967
WANT TO RELAX THE ONES THAT IRAN

06:37.967 --> 06:40.100
REALLY CARES ABOUT, THE OIL,

06:40.100 --> 06:42.867
TRADING SANCTIONS, THE ONE THA

06:42.867 --> 06:44.200
BASICALLY HAVE KEPT THEM OUT O

06:44.200 --> 06:46.567
THE GLOBAL MY NATIONAL SYSTE

06:46.567 --> 06:48.700
BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID THAT

06:48.700 --> 06:49.800
ONCE -- IF THE U.S. DOES THA

06:49.800 --> 06:52.267
AND THE WEST DOES THAT, IRAN

06:52.267 --> 06:53.667
WON'T HAVE ANY INCENTIVE T

06:53.667 --> 06:54.567
CONTINUE WITH THE SECOND FACE OF

06:54.567 --> 06:56.433
THE NEGOTIATIONS

06:56.433 --> 07:01.367
SO THERE'S -- IT'S REALL

07:01.367 --> 07:01.767
TACTICAL AND STRATEGIC AND

07:01.767 --> 07:06.233
POLITICAL, AS WE KNOW, BOT

07:06.233 --> 07:06.467
IRANIANS AND AMERICANS HAV

07:06.467 --> 07:07.800
HEADLINERS AT HOME THEY HAVE T

07:07.800 --> 07:08.267
SATISFY.

07:08.267 --> 07:10.800
>> SO IF WE SEE NO DEAL REACHE

07:10.800 --> 07:12.333
HERE, WE KIND OF SAW IT TW

07:12.333 --> 07:12.900
WEEKS AGO.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.267
THERE WAS A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

07:15.267 --> 07:17.200
ENERGY, A BUILDUP, IF THERE IS

07:17.200 --> 07:19.000
NO DEAL REACHED HERE, WHAT DOE

07:19.000 --> 07:22.400
THAT DO TO THE MOMENTUM OF THI

07:22.400 --> 07:24.067
CONVERSATION

07:24.067 --> 07:29.633
>> HAR, IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT.

07:29.633 --> 07:31.700
WE'RE REALLY THERE

07:31.700 --> 07:33.400
WE'RE ALMOST THERE, BRINGING I

07:33.400 --> 07:34.967
THE BIG GUNS AND GOT SO CLOS

07:34.967 --> 07:37.467
BUT FAILED

07:37.467 --> 07:39.400
THIS TIME WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE

07:39.400 --> 07:42.333
TIME AND THE MINISTERS WEREN'T

07:42.333 --> 07:43.967
SUPPORTED TO COME IN UNTIL I

07:43.967 --> 07:45.733
WAS REALLY CLOSE AND THEY WERE

07:45.733 --> 07:47.633
SUPPOSED TO CORRECT A FINA

07:47.633 --> 07:48.200
VERSION.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.133
INSTEAD, AFTER THREE DAYS OF

07:50.133 --> 07:51.333
TALKS, IT DIDN'T QUITE GET FAR

07:51.333 --> 07:51.733
ENOUGH

07:51.733 --> 07:53.867
THEY AGREED TO COME IN

07:53.867 --> 07:55.767
IT IS HARD -- I MEAN, IT'S NOT

07:55.767 --> 07:57.967
IMPOSSIBLE TO GO TO THAT WELL, A

07:57.967 --> 07:59.433
THIRD TIME BUT EACH TIME YOU

07:59.433 --> 08:02.200
PULL OUT YOUR BIG CARD OR YOUR

08:02.200 --> 08:05.967
BIG GUN, IT DIMINISHES ITS

08:05.967 --> 08:06.133
CLOUD.

08:06.133 --> 08:07.433
AT THE SAME TIME, WHAT I

08:07.433 --> 08:09.067
KEEPING THE PARTIES GOING IS

08:09.067 --> 08:11.267
WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE

08:11.267 --> 08:13.233
SO THE WEST LOOKS AND SAYS WELL,

08:13.233 --> 08:18.433
FOR IRAN, THE ALTERNATIVE IS T

08:18.433 --> 08:26.200
CONTINUE TO URANIUM ENRICHMENT

08:26.200 --> 08:28.667
POINT TO BE BASICALLY NUCLEA

08:28.667 --> 08:31.367
WEAPONS READY AND FOR IRAN I

08:31.367 --> 08:33.333
WOULD MEAN IF THERE IS NO DEAL

08:33.333 --> 08:35.400
THE U.S. CONGRESS FOR ONE IS

08:35.400 --> 08:38.167
GOING TO IMPOSE TOUGHE

08:38.167 --> 08:41.400
SANCTIONS, SENATE MAJORITY

08:41.400 --> 08:42.900
LEADER HARRY REID IS READY T

08:42.900 --> 08:44.400
LET A BILL MOVE STARTING

08:44.400 --> 08:46.500
DECEMBER 9th

08:46.500 --> 08:49.033
SO THE ALTERNATIVE IS REALLY

08:49.033 --> 08:51.833
REALLY POTENTIALLY UGLY BECAUS

08:51.833 --> 08:53.700
THERE IS THE THREAT OF

08:53.700 --> 08:57.667
POTENTIALLY AN ISRAELLY STRIKE

08:57.667 --> 08:59.367
THAT'S WHAT IS KEEPING THE

08:59.367 --> 09:00.200
PARTIES ON THE TABLE

17:20.967 --> 17:22.500
THAT'S POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT TO

17:33.433 --> 17:34.967
THERE'S AN APPRECIATION FOR TH

17:34.967 --> 17:37.400
VALUE OF A TOOL LIKE THIS TO

19:01.600 --> 19:03.767
USUAL.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.000
CHINA'S LONG HAD A CONTENTIOUS

THE GOVERNMENTS THAT HAVE COME

19:30.233 --> 19:30.833

19:34.367 --> 19:37.833
A GREATER ANIMOSITY TOWARD

19:50.700 --> 19:52.100
LOCAL JOURNALISTS TO DO THAT O

19:52.100 --> 19:52.767

19:52.767 --> 19:54.500
THEY WANT TO CONTROL THA

19:54.500 --> 19:55.233

>> NOT ONLY THEIR OWN JOURNALIST

20:04.467 --> 20:05.767
BUT THE STATE MEDIA.

20:05.767 --> 20:07.833
THEY CONTROL WHO IS THE BAD GUY,

20:07.833 --> 20:10.400
WHO IS THE GOOD GUY AND HOW IT

20:10.400 --> 20:12.433
SHOULD BE PORTRAYED.

20:12.433 --> 20:14.133
WHAT THEY DON'T LIKE IS WHEN THE
