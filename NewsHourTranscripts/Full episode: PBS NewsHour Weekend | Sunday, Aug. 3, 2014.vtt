ISRAEL BEGINS A LARGE SCALE

00:14.514 --> 00:16.216
WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM GAZA,

00:16.216 --> 00:17.618
BUT THE CONFLICT CONTINUES.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.653
HOW BOTH SIDES ARE FIGHTING IT

00:19.653 --> 00:21.255
OUT ON THE SOCIAL MEDIA

00:21.255 --> 00:22.122
BATTLEFIELD.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.258
>> THE CONTEST FOR WORLD

00:24.258 --> 00:25.425
OPINION ON NUMEROUS LEVELS,

00:25.425 --> 00:26.360
CERTAINLY THE GOVERNMENTS ARE

00:26.360 --> 00:28.228
WAGING THAT CONTEST.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.596
>> Sreenivasan: AND ISLAMIC

00:29.596 --> 00:31.265
JIHADISTS MAKE IMPORTANT NEW

00:31.265 --> 00:31.965
GAINS IN IRAQ.

00:31.965 --> 00:35.269
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.604
>>FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS

00:37.604 --> 00:39.473
IN LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:39.473 --> 00:40.674
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.876
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:42.876 --> 00:44.678
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.646
ISRAEL TODAY BEGAN A MAJOR

00:45.646 --> 00:47.047
WITHDRAWAL OF ITS GROUND TROOPS

00:47.047 --> 00:49.182
FROM GAZA BUT ITS SHELLING OF

00:49.182 --> 00:49.917
HAMAS TARGETS THERE CONTINUES.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.485
ONE ATTACK THERE TODAY KILLED

00:51.485 --> 00:52.853
TEN PEOPLE AT A U.N. SCHOOL

00:52.853 --> 00:55.022
PROMPTING CONDEMNATION FROM

00:55.022 --> 00:56.857
A UN OFFICIAL WHO WAS ASKED

00:56.857 --> 00:57.925
WHETHER HAMAS IS USING CHILDREN

00:57.925 --> 00:58.725
AT HUMAN SHIELDS.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.027
>> YES THERE ARE CERTAINLY

01:00.027 --> 01:01.361
BEHAVIORS THAT EXPOSE THE

01:01.361 --> 01:02.863
POPULATION ON THE GROUND BY

01:02.863 --> 01:04.298
MILITANT GROUPS THAT OPERATE

01:04.298 --> 01:06.867
CLOSE TO CIVILIAN PREMISES, BUT

01:06.867 --> 01:08.669
CERTAINLY IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:08.669 --> 01:10.470
EXTENT OF THE DAMAGE, THE EXTENT

01:10.470 --> 01:12.239
OF THE PHYSICAL DESTRUCTION BUT

01:12.239 --> 01:14.675
ALSO THE EXTENT OF THE LOSS OF

01:14.675 --> 01:16.610
HUMAN LIFE-- AND I WITNESSED

01:16.610 --> 01:18.245
THAT MYSELF VISITING THIS WEEK

01:18.245 --> 01:19.279
THE PEDIATRIC WARD IN THE MAIN

01:19.279 --> 01:21.114
HOSPITAL IN GAZA-- SEEING THE

01:21.114 --> 01:23.016
BROKEN BODIES OF THE CHILDREN

01:23.016 --> 01:24.618
THERE, THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY

01:24.618 --> 01:26.553
MIND WHATSOEVER THAT

01:26.553 --> 01:28.355
INSUFFICIENT MEASURES OF

01:28.355 --> 01:29.690
PRECAUTION AND CONTROL AND

01:29.690 --> 01:32.259
PROTECTION ARE BEING TAKEN

01:32.259 --> 01:34.194
INCLUDING BY THE ISRAELI

01:34.194 --> 01:35.495
DEFENSE FORCE WHEN ENGAGING IN

01:35.495 --> 01:36.596
GAZA.

01:36.596 --> 01:37.698
>> Sreenivasan: THE STATE

01:37.698 --> 01:39.499
DEPARTMENT ALSO WAS UNUSUALLY

01:39.499 --> 01:41.068
BLUNT IN ITS CRITICISM OF

01:41.068 --> 01:42.936
ISRAEL, SAYING THE UNITED STATES

01:42.936 --> 01:44.638
WAS APPALLED BY THE ATTACK,

01:44.638 --> 01:46.006
WHICH IT CALLED DISGRACEFUL.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.008
IT ADDED ISRAEL MUST DO MORE TO

01:48.008 --> 01:50.177
MEET ITS OWN STANDARDS AND AVOID

01:50.177 --> 01:51.178
CIVILIAN CASUALTIES.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.779
FOR MORE ABOUT THE CONFLICT WE

01:52.779 --> 01:53.947
ARE JOINED ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT

01:53.947 --> 01:54.881
VIA SKYPE FROM JERUSALEM BY

01:54.881 --> 01:55.749
JOSEF FEDERMAN OF THE ASSOCIATED

01:55.749 --> 01:56.650
PRESS.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.818
>> FIRST LET'S TALK ABOUT

01:57.818 --> 01:58.685
WITHDRAWAL OF ISRAELI TROOPS IS

01:58.685 --> 02:00.954
HAPPENING AND HAPPENING MORE

02:00.954 --> 02:03.123
THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.392
>> THE ISRAELI ARMY CONFIRMED

02:05.392 --> 02:07.995
THEY ALREADY PULLED OUT THE

02:07.995 --> 02:09.229
BULK, THE MAJORITY OF THE GROUND

02:09.229 --> 02:11.064
TROOPS THAT WERE IN GAZA, THEY

02:11.064 --> 02:12.399
STILL HAVE A LIMITED PRESENCE

02:12.399 --> 02:14.434
THERE, BUT THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO

02:14.434 --> 02:15.869
FIND A WAY TO WIND DOWN THIS

02:15.869 --> 02:16.536
OPERATION.

02:16.536 --> 02:18.538
THEY WON'T GIVE ANY FIRM

02:18.538 --> 02:20.107
NUMBERS, BUT WE CAN SEE WITH OUR

02:20.107 --> 02:22.009
OWN EYES WE HAVE REPORTERS ALONG

02:22.009 --> 02:25.312
THE BORDER WE HAVE ARMED,

02:25.312 --> 02:27.414
ARMORED VEHICLES LEAVING

02:27.414 --> 02:28.348
CROSSING BACK INTO THE BORDER

02:28.348 --> 02:29.816
AND BEING TAKEN AWAY BY TRUCKS,

02:29.816 --> 02:32.185
WE SAW SOLDIERS AND TANKS

02:32.185 --> 02:33.553
WALKING AWAY FROM THEIR TANKS,

02:33.553 --> 02:35.322
ROLLING UP THEIR BELONGINGS AND

02:35.322 --> 02:37.024
THINGS SO THERE DEFINITELY SEEM

02:37.024 --> 02:39.393
TO BE SIGNS ISRAEL IS ENTERING A

02:39.393 --> 02:42.562
NEW PHASE, WHETHER THIS ACTUALLY

02:42.562 --> 02:43.797
BRINGS AN TONED THE FIGHTING I

02:43.797 --> 02:44.998
THINK THAT WILL TAKE A FEW MORE

02:44.998 --> 02:45.165
DAYS.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.867
>> IS THE ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL

02:46.867 --> 02:47.634
BECAUSE THEY ARE STAFFED WITH

02:47.634 --> 02:49.569
THE DESTRUCTION OF THE TUNNELS?

02:49.569 --> 02:50.604
>> EXACTLY.

02:50.604 --> 02:53.140
WHAT THE ARMY TOLD ME IS THEY

02:53.140 --> 02:54.274
THINK THEY HAVE LOCATED I THINK

02:54.274 --> 02:58.578
OVER 30 OF THESE TUNNELS, A

02:58.578 --> 02:59.679
NETWORK THAT REACHED THE BORDER

02:59.679 --> 03:01.581
AND WENT UNDERGROUND INTO ISRAEL

03:01.581 --> 03:02.816
IN MANY CASES.

03:02.816 --> 03:04.951
THEY HE THEY FOUND THE VAST

03:04.951 --> 03:06.586
MAJORITY TO THE TUNNELS AND HIT

03:06.586 --> 03:07.654
THE SYSTEM HARD, SO THEY DON'T

03:07.654 --> 03:08.855
NEED TO HAVE THAT GROUND

03:08.855 --> 03:10.090
PRESENCE IN THERE.

03:10.090 --> 03:11.224
WHAT I THINK YOU MAY SEE IN THE

03:11.224 --> 03:13.360
NEXT FEW DAYS, AGAIN, DEPENDING

03:13.360 --> 03:15.295
ON HOW HAMAS REACTS IF THE

03:15.295 --> 03:16.997
ROCKETS CONTINUE TO FLY, ISRAEL

03:16.997 --> 03:19.099
IS GOING TO RESPOND MOST LIKELY

03:19.099 --> 03:21.501
THROUGH AIR STRIKES OR MAYBE

03:21.501 --> 03:23.170
ARTILLERY FIRE FROM THE ISRAELI

03:23.170 --> 03:24.604
SIDE OF THE BORDER, BUT YOU ARE

03:24.604 --> 03:25.906
NOT GOING TO SEE THE HEAVY

03:25.906 --> 03:26.907
GROUND FIGHT YOU HAVE SEEN OVER

03:26.907 --> 03:28.041
THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.743
>> IN THE MEANTIME THERE WAS A

03:29.743 --> 03:31.845
PRETTY LARGE FUNERAL FOR THE

03:31.845 --> 03:32.879
LIEUTENANT THAT WAS DECLARED

03:32.879 --> 03:33.914
MISSING IN YESTERDAY AND

03:33.914 --> 03:34.881
DECLARED DEAD.

03:34.881 --> 03:37.451
>> YES, ABOUT 15,000 PEOPLE

03:37.451 --> 03:39.453
ARRIVED AT THE FUNERAL, IT IS

03:39.453 --> 03:41.188
STILL GOING ON, AS FAR AS I

03:41.188 --> 03:41.321
KNOW.

03:41.321 --> 03:43.290
>> IN THE MOST RECENT UPDATE WE

03:43.290 --> 03:45.058
HAD IN TERMS OF THE U.N. SCHOOL

03:45.058 --> 03:47.794
THAT WAS HIT AGAIN, ANY DETAILS

03:47.794 --> 03:49.129
ON THAT?

03:49.129 --> 03:50.697
>> THE SCHOOL, THE FRONT GATE OF

03:50.697 --> 03:52.866
THE SCHOOL WAS HIT EARLY THIS

03:52.866 --> 03:54.267
MORNING ON THE, IT SOUNDED LIKE

03:54.267 --> 03:55.635
A PRETTY BAD ATTACK BECAUSE A

03:55.635 --> 03:57.571
NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE OUTSIDE

03:57.571 --> 03:58.672
ACCEPTING FOOD RATIONS, PEOPLE

03:58.672 --> 04:00.140
HAD BEEN SEEKING SHELTER THERE

04:00.140 --> 04:01.875
AND HAPPENED RIGHT AT THAT TIME,

04:01.875 --> 04:04.111
AT LEAST TEN PEOPLE, ALSO CIVIL,

04:04.111 --> 04:06.146
ALL CIVILIANS WERE KILLED, 35

04:06.146 --> 04:07.047
PEOPLE WERE WOUNDED THIS IS

04:07.047 --> 04:08.415
PROBABLY THE SIXTH OR SEVENTH

04:08.415 --> 04:09.850
TIME SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS

04:09.850 --> 04:11.551
HAPPENED, AND THE U.N. ONCE

04:11.551 --> 04:14.121
AGAIN IS BLAMING ISRAEL, SAYS IT

04:14.121 --> 04:15.288
WAS ISRAELI FIRE.

04:15.288 --> 04:17.657
>> HAS THE SENTIMENT ON THE SORT

04:17.657 --> 04:18.959
OF THE ISRAELI STREET CHANGED AT

04:18.959 --> 04:20.660
ALL IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS NOW?

04:20.660 --> 04:22.062
IT HAS BEEN FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS

04:22.062 --> 04:23.697
WE ARE INTO THIS CONFLICT?

04:23.697 --> 04:25.499
>> NO, IT IS REALLY STRIKING TO

04:25.499 --> 04:26.933
ME HOW WIDESPREAD THE SUPPORT

04:26.933 --> 04:28.768
SEEMS TO BE, I THINK ONE POLL

04:28.768 --> 04:30.303
RECENTLY SAID SOMETHING LIKE

04:30.303 --> 04:31.671
95 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION,

04:31.671 --> 04:35.075
THE JEWISH POPULATION SUPPORTS

04:35.075 --> 04:36.510
THIS OPERATION, THERE REALLY

04:36.510 --> 04:39.513
SEEMS TO BE WALL-TO-WALL SUPPORT

04:39.513 --> 04:41.114
AND BELIEF THAT, YOU KNOW, THE

04:41.114 --> 04:42.782
GOAL OF THE OPERATION TO HALT

04:42.782 --> 04:45.685
ROCKET ATTACKS, TO STRIKE AT

04:45.685 --> 04:46.853
TUNNELS THAT ARE BEING DUG ALONG

04:46.853 --> 04:51.124
THE BORDER INTO ISRAEL IS A

04:51.124 --> 04:54.628
NOBLE GOAL AND JUSTIFIED AND I

04:54.628 --> 04:55.595
DON'T SEE THAT SOFTENING MY TIME

04:55.595 --> 04:56.396
SOON.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.098
>> WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.633
WHAT IS HAPPENING ON THE SORT OF

04:59.633 --> 05:02.469
STREETS OF GAZA RIGHT NOW?

05:02.469 --> 05:04.004
>> WELL, THE PEOPLE OF GAZA AND

05:04.004 --> 05:06.706
THE LEADERS OF GAZA, HAMAS

05:06.706 --> 05:07.507
LEADERS ALSO BELIEVE THAT WHAT

05:07.507 --> 05:08.508
THEY ARE DOING IS JUSTIFIED,

05:08.508 --> 05:10.110
THEY FEEL THAT THEY ARE

05:10.110 --> 05:12.412
DEFENDING THEMSELVES NOT ONLY

05:12.412 --> 05:13.747
AGAINST ISRAELI ATTACKS BUT

05:13.747 --> 05:15.048
AGAINST THE ISRAELI BLOCKADE,

05:15.048 --> 05:17.717
THIS BLOCKADE THAT WAS IMPOSED

05:17.717 --> 05:20.487
BACK IN 2006, 2007 WHEN HAMAS

05:20.487 --> 05:23.290
FIRST CAME TO POWER, THE

05:23.290 --> 05:25.725
BLOCKADE IS REALLY STIFLED THE

05:25.725 --> 05:28.128
ECONOMY THERE, THERE ARE

05:28.128 --> 05:29.729
SHORTAGE, IT IS HARD -- THE

05:29.729 --> 05:32.265
UNEMPLOYMENT IS VERY HIGH AND

05:32.265 --> 05:33.867
HAMAS IS SAYING FOR THIS

05:33.867 --> 05:35.101
FIGHTING TO END THEY WANT AN END

05:35.101 --> 05:36.436
TO THIS BLOCKADE AS WELL.

05:36.436 --> 05:38.371
>> JOSEF FEDERMAN OF THE

05:38.371 --> 05:40.173
ASSOCIATED PRESS JOINING US LIVE

05:40.173 --> 05:41.374
FROM SKYPE IN JERUSALEM, THANK

05:41.374 --> 05:42.442
YOU VERY MUCH.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.945
>> THANK YOU.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.346
>> Sreenivasan: TURNING NOW TO

05:46.346 --> 05:47.047
ANOTHER TROUBLE SPOT-- IRAQ--

05:47.047 --> 05:47.814
WHERE ISLAMIC JIHADISTS, WHO

05:47.814 --> 05:48.648
RECENTLY SEIZED LARGE PARTS OF

05:48.648 --> 05:49.349
THE NORTH AND WEST OF THE

05:49.349 --> 05:50.250
COUNTRY, ARE REPORTED TO HAVE

05:50.250 --> 05:51.618
MADE NEW IMPORTANT GAINS.

05:51.618 --> 05:52.886
FOR THE LATEST FROM IRAQ, WE ARE

05:52.886 --> 05:54.221
JOINED NOW FROM BAGHDAD VIA

05:54.221 --> 05:55.455
SKYPE BY NOUR MALAS OF THE WALL

05:55.455 --> 05:57.991
STREET JOURNAL.

05:57.991 --> 05:58.959
>> FIRST OF ALL, HOW SIGNIFICANT

05:58.959 --> 06:01.127
WAS THE CAPTURE OF THESE TOWNS?

06:01.127 --> 06:02.829
>> IT IS QUITE SIGNIFICANT,

06:02.829 --> 06:05.298
BECAUSE SIPS THE ISLAMIC STATE

06:05.298 --> 06:06.600
STARTED ITS OFFENSIVE IN THE

06:06.600 --> 06:08.034
NORTH IN JUNE THIS IS THE FIRST

06:08.034 --> 06:10.403
TIME THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO

06:10.403 --> 06:13.974
SEIZE ANY SIGNIFICANT TERRITORY,

06:13.974 --> 06:15.508
THE SITUATION IS STILL FLUID UP

06:15.508 --> 06:17.777
THERE, BUT THEY SEIZED THESE

06:17.777 --> 06:19.613
TOWNS AND TWO SMALL OIL FIELDS

06:19.613 --> 06:21.448
AND IN ANOTHER TOWN ARE JUST

06:21.448 --> 06:24.050
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY

06:24.050 --> 06:27.454
FROM THE YAZIDI RELIGIOUS

06:27.454 --> 06:29.122
ETHNOCOMMUNITY SO THERE IS A

06:29.122 --> 06:31.324
BUDDING HUMANITARIAN CRISIS

06:31.324 --> 06:34.261
THERE AND ALSO CALLS INTO

06:34.261 --> 06:35.695
QUESTION THE STRENGTH OF THE

06:35.695 --> 06:37.797
FORCES THAT HAVE REALLY BEEN ONE

06:37.797 --> 06:39.799
OF THE FIRST LINES OF DEFENSE IN

06:39.799 --> 06:41.034
IRAQ AGAINST THE INSURGENTS.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.469
>> ALSO HEARD THERE MIGHT HAVE

06:42.469 --> 06:45.205
BEEN A DAM THAT WAS TAKEN OVER,

06:45.205 --> 06:46.473
IS THERE A CONSEQUENCE TO THAT?

06:46.473 --> 06:47.674
>> ABSOLUTELY, THAT SITUATION IS

06:47.674 --> 06:48.675
ALSO VERY FLUID, IT IS NOT CLEAR

06:48.675 --> 06:51.444
AT ALL, BUT THE ISLAMIC STATE

06:51.444 --> 06:53.847
HAVE ACTUALLY TAKEN OVER THE DAM

06:53.847 --> 06:55.482
WHICH IS THE COUNTRY'S LARGEST.

06:55.482 --> 06:58.084
WE HAVE SPOKEN TO SOME PEOPLE

06:58.084 --> 06:59.552
SAY PESHAWAR FIGHTERS ARE UNTIL

06:59.552 --> 07:02.055
I DON'T HAVE THIS BUT THE

07:02.055 --> 07:03.156
CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE HUGE FOR

07:03.156 --> 07:06.926
THIS, THEY COULD FLOOD, IT MAY

07:06.926 --> 07:08.428
EVEN AFFECT POWER SUPPLIES, WE

07:08.428 --> 07:11.164
HAVE SEEN THE STRUGGLE FOR

07:11.164 --> 07:12.666
RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE

07:12.666 --> 07:14.968
LIKE ELECTRICITY AND POWER PLAY

07:14.968 --> 07:16.670
OUT BETWEEN REBELS AND THE

07:16.670 --> 07:18.571
REGIME IN SYRIA AS WELL AND OVER

07:18.571 --> 07:20.607
THERE THE ISLAMIC STATE HAS BEEN

07:20.607 --> 07:21.574
PRETTY SUCCESSFUL IN DOING THAT

07:21.574 --> 07:23.476
SO DEFINITELY THAT IS A KEY AREA

07:23.476 --> 07:25.512
OF CONCERN HERE.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.113
>> EARLIER THIS WEEK WE SAW

07:27.113 --> 07:29.316
STORIES COMING OUT OF MOSUL, A

07:29.316 --> 07:31.551
CITY THAT ISIS NOW CONTROLS, THE

07:31.551 --> 07:33.053
CHRISTIANS WERE PUSHING BACK

07:33.053 --> 07:34.988
BECAUSE OF THE DESTRUCTION OR A

07:34.988 --> 07:36.323
SERIES OF DESTRUCTION OF

07:36.323 --> 07:37.324
SHRINES.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.425
>> UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE

07:38.425 --> 07:39.859
PUSHING BACK AS MUCH AS THEY ARE

07:39.859 --> 07:42.495
JUST FLEEING THE PROVINCE, IN

07:42.495 --> 07:44.531
MANY CASES FLEEING IRAQ ALL

07:44.531 --> 07:46.232
TOGETHER IF THEY CAN, THE

07:46.232 --> 07:48.001
DESTRUCTION OF A RELIGIOUS

07:48.001 --> 07:49.703
SHRINE, NOT JUST FOR CHRISTIANS

07:49.703 --> 07:53.239
BUT MUSLIMS OF ALL SECRETARY

07:53.239 --> 07:55.141
SECRETARY, SECRETARY SECONDS.

07:55.141 --> 07:59.379
>> SECTS IS STARTING NOW A TEST

07:59.379 --> 08:01.748
GROUND FOR WHETHER LOCAL

08:01.748 --> 08:03.216
RESIDENTS ARE GOING TO START A

08:03.216 --> 08:04.884
BACKLASH AGAINST THESE

08:04.884 --> 08:06.086
INSURGENTS, BECAUSE THEY ARE

08:06.086 --> 08:07.454
TOUCHING THE PARTS OF THEIR

08:07.454 --> 08:09.389
TERRITORY AND HISTORY THAT ARE

08:09.389 --> 08:10.990
SO SACRED AND SHARED BY ALL

08:10.990 --> 08:11.958
SECOND SECRETARIES HERE.

08:11.958 --> 08:13.493
>> WHAT SHRINES HAVE BEEN

08:13.493 --> 08:14.394
DESTROYED?

08:14.394 --> 08:18.298
>> THERE WAS A MAJOR MOSQUE ..

08:18.298 --> 08:20.433
AND SHRINE SAYS TO CONTAIN THE

08:20.433 --> 08:22.802
TOMB OF JONAH, A PROPHET,

08:22.802 --> 08:26.773
IMPORTANT TO ALL RELIGIONS AND

08:26.773 --> 08:28.975
THEY BLEW THAT UP LAST WEEK.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.978
THEY ALSO HAVE ATTACKED SHIITE

08:31.978 --> 08:34.080
RELIGIOUS SHRINES AND IN THIS

08:34.080 --> 08:35.248
LATEST INCIDENT IN THE NORTHWEST

08:35.248 --> 08:37.717
WE ARE SEEING THEM ATTACK OTHER

08:37.717 --> 08:42.655
SHRINES, SO THERE IS REALLY

08:42.655 --> 08:44.691
OFFENSE ON THE CULTURE THAT IS

08:44.691 --> 08:45.558
ELECTRIFYING THE RESIDENTS OF

08:45.558 --> 08:46.993
THE NORTH, NO MATTER HOW THEY

08:46.993 --> 08:48.595
ACTUALLY FEEL ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

08:48.595 --> 08:50.029
THE MILITARY SIDE OF THINGS,

08:50.029 --> 08:52.932
THEY FEEL THERE IS JUST AN

08:52.932 --> 08:54.100
UNACCEPTABLE ENCROACHMENT ON

08:54.100 --> 08:55.702
THEIR HISTORY AND THEIR SHARED

08:55.702 --> 08:56.636
HERITAGE.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.004
>> WELL, WHAT IS THE IRAQI

08:58.004 --> 08:59.038
GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO ALL OF

08:59.038 --> 09:01.241
THIS? HAS THEY JUST BEEN

09:01.241 --> 09:02.008
LETTING THIS HAPPEN?

09:02.008 --> 09:04.010
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT THEY HAVE

09:04.010 --> 09:07.013
LAUNCHED A WIDE SCALE MILITARY

09:07.013 --> 09:09.048
OFFENSIVE, AROUND TIKRIT TO PUSH

09:09.048 --> 09:11.418
BACK THE ISLAMIC STATE THERE,

09:11.418 --> 09:14.354
THEY ARE USING AERIAL

09:14.354 --> 09:16.089
BOMBARDMENT, IN SOME CASES THEY

09:16.089 --> 09:17.590
ARE SORT OF COUNTING ON THIS

09:17.590 --> 09:20.827
LOCAL BACKLASH, HOPING THAT THE

09:20.827 --> 09:23.396
ISLAMIC STATE REALLY CAN'T PLANT

09:23.396 --> 09:24.831
ROOTS AND LOCAL RESIDENT WILL

09:24.831 --> 09:26.533
START TO TURN AGAINST THEM,

09:26.533 --> 09:29.602
INCLUDING TRIBESMEN, QUOTING

09:29.602 --> 09:31.671
LOCAL SOURCES THAN THE MEANTIME

09:31.671 --> 09:33.473
IRAQI FORCES ARE TRYING TO

09:33.473 --> 09:37.210
REGROUP AND STRENGTHEN THEIR

09:37.210 --> 09:40.246
FOCUS ON HOLDING THE KEY CITIES

09:40.246 --> 09:43.049
AND MAKING SURE THAT THE

09:43.049 --> 09:45.084
INSURGENTS DON'T PUSH SOUTHWARDS

09:45.084 --> 09:46.052
TOWARD THE CAPITAL.

09:46.052 --> 09:47.787

10:01.201 --> 10:02.635
FOLLOWING THE JIHADISTS'

MILITARY GAINS.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.605
THE RIGHT REVEREND DAVID WALKER

10:05.605 --> 10:07.106
TOLD THE OBSERVER NEWSPAPER THAT

10:07.106 --> 10:08.775
THE COST TO THE UK WOULD BE

10:08.775 --> 10:10.176
MINISCULE COMPARED TO WHAT

10:10.176 --> 10:11.478
BRITAIN SPENT ON THE WAR IN

10:11.478 --> 10:12.512
IRAQ.

10:12.512 --> 10:14.013
HE SAYS THE UK NOW HAS A MORAL

10:14.013 --> 10:15.014
DUTY TO HELP.

10:15.014 --> 10:15.915

10:23.022 --> 10:24.924
THE PLANE CARRYING 298 PEOPLE

10:24.924 --> 10:26.726
WAS BROUGHT DOWN BY A MISSILE

10:26.726 --> 10:28.027

10:29.262 --> 10:30.430

SPOKE AT THE SERVICE.

10:33.766 --> 10:39.472
>> WHEN THEIR INNOCENT BODIES

10:39.472 --> 10:46.246
WERE SHOT OUT OF THE SKY, I

10:46.246 --> 10:49.382
STRETCHED MY ARMS AS HIGH AS I

10:49.382 --> 10:53.786
COULD AND SCREAMED FOR THEM.

RECENT SURGE IN ILLEGAL

10:59.392 --> 11:00.326
IMMIGRATION ONCE AGAIN EXPOSES

11:00.326 --> 11:01.427
AMERICA'S VULNERABILITY TO

11:01.427 --> 11:03.062
TERRORISTS HOPING TO ENTER THE

11:03.062 --> 11:06.599
UNITED STATES FROM MEXICO.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.401
>> WE NOTICED A VERY DANGEROUS

11:08.401 --> 11:10.403
TREND A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN THE

11:10.403 --> 11:12.805
IRANIAN KUDS FORCE-- AN EXTERNAL

TERRORIST GROUP IF YOU WILL

11:13.740 --> 11:14.908
SUPPORTED BY THE COUNTRY OF

UNITED STATES TO KILL THE SAUDI

11:21.314 --> 11:22.715
AMBASSADOR.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.584
SO CLEARLY OUR ENEMIES AND

11:24.584 --> 11:26.553
ADVERSARIES UNDERSTAND THAT IT

11:26.553 --> 11:28.488
IS A WEAKNESS.

11:28.488 --> 11:29.689
>> Sreenivasan: FOR A SECOND

11:29.689 --> 11:30.990
STRAIGHT DAY, UP TO HALF A

11:30.990 --> 11:32.392
MILLION PEOPLE IN AND AROUND

11:32.392 --> 11:35.795
TOLEDO, OHIO, STILL CANNOT

11:35.795 --> 11:38.631
SAFELY DRINK THEIR TAP WATER.

11:38.631 --> 11:39.499
THE CITY'S MAYOR SAID THE WATER

11:39.499 --> 11:40.400
QUALITY IS IMPROVING BUT THAT IT

11:40.400 --> 11:41.301
IS STILL CONSIDERED TOXIC.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.235
PARENTS WERE ALSO ADVISED NOT TO

11:42.235 --> 11:43.269
BATHE THEIR CHILDREN IN IT.

11:43.269 --> 11:44.304
THE PROBLEM APPARENTLY STEMS

FROM ALGAE BLOOMS IN NEARBY LAKE

11:48.107 --> 11:49.375
LOW IN SUPERMARKETS, BUT IS

11:49.375 --> 11:50.677

11:50.677 --> 11:52.178
STATE AUTHORITIES AND THE

11:54.247 --> 11:55.281
IN CALIFORNIA THIS WEEKEND,

11:55.281 --> 11:56.683
GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN DECLARED A

11:56.683 --> 11:58.217
STATE OF EMERGENCY AS A WILDFIRE

11:58.217 --> 11:59.419
RAGED ALONG THE CALIFORNIA-

11:59.419 --> 12:01.120
OREGON BORDER.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.722
IT'S ONE OF MORE THAN A DOZEN

12:02.722 --> 12:03.990
BURNING AROUND THE STATE, ALL OF

12:03.990 --> 12:05.124
THEM MADE WORSE BY THE LINGERING

12:05.124 --> 12:06.793
DROUGHT THERE.

12:06.793 --> 12:07.560
SEVERAL HOMES THROUGHOUT THE

12:07.560 --> 12:09.228
STATE HAVE BEEN DESTROYED AND

12:09.228 --> 12:11.864
SEVERAL COMMUNITIES EVACUATED.

12:11.864 --> 12:13.666
STARTING TUESDAY NEW FOOD AND

12:13.666 --> 12:15.001
DRUG ADMINISTRATION RULES WILL

12:15.001 --> 12:17.136
LIMIT HOW MUCH GLUTEN CAN BE IN

12:17.136 --> 12:19.272
PRODUCTS LABELED AS GLUTEN FREE.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.707
THE USE OF THE LABEL ITSELF IS

12:20.707 --> 12:22.141
VOLUNTARY.

12:22.141 --> 12:23.443
AND THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT THAT

12:23.443 --> 12:27.146
A PACKAGE CONTAINING GLUTEN

12:27.146 --> 12:28.414
EXPRESSLY SAY SO.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.716
AND THE NATIONAL DEBATE ABOUT

12:29.716 --> 12:30.783
MARIJUANA USE PLAYED OUT THIS

WEEKEND IN THE NEW YORK TIMES IN

12:31.918 --> 12:33.186
TWO COMPETING ADS.

12:37.156 --> 12:39.058
AD EXTOLLING MARIJUANA'S MEDICAL

12:39.058 --> 12:40.393
BENEFITS.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.694
IT WAS PLACED BY LEAFLY, AN

12:41.694 --> 12:43.363
ORGANIZATION ONE WRITER CALLED

12:43.363 --> 12:45.298
"YELP FOR WEED" BECAUSE IT HELPS

12:45.298 --> 12:47.700
USERS FIND POT DISPENSARIES.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.669
A SEPARATE AD PLACED BY A NUMBER

12:49.669 --> 12:51.671
OF GROUPS, INCLUDING AN

12:51.671 --> 12:53.539
ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS GRASS IS

12:53.539 --> 12:55.942
NOT GREENER, WARNED THAT THE

12:55.942 --> 12:57.410
RELAXATION OF MARIJUANA LAWS

12:57.410 --> 12:58.745
AROUND THE COUNTRY IS CREATING

12:58.745 --> 13:00.013
BUSINESSES SELLING WHAT THEY

13:00.013 --> 13:01.514
CALLED A HIGHLY HABIT-FORMING

13:01.514 --> 13:14.260
PRODUCT.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.428
THIS WEEK, COLORADO BECAME THE

13:15.428 --> 13:17.196
MOST RECENT STATE TO BEGIN

13:17.196 --> 13:19.432
ISSUING DRIVERS LICENSES TO

13:19.432 --> 13:21.734
PEOPLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR

13:21.734 --> 13:23.102
IMMIGRATION STATUS, JOINING

13:23.102 --> 13:24.103
SEVERAL OTHER STATES AND

13:24.103 --> 13:25.538
WASHINGTON DC BY PERMITTING

13:25.538 --> 13:26.806
PEOPLE WHO HAVE TEMPORARY STATUS

13:26.806 --> 13:28.274
AND THOSE WHO ENTERED THE

13:28.274 --> 13:30.043
COUNTRY ILLEGALLY TO DRIVE.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.511
YESTERDAY, I SPOKE WITH IVAN

13:31.511 --> 13:32.679
MORENO OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

13:32.679 --> 13:37.016
FROM DENVER.

13:37.016 --> 13:37.950
>> FIRST OF ALL, 10,000 PEOPLE

13:37.950 --> 13:40.053
HAVE ALREADY SIGNED UP FOR THIS,

13:40.053 --> 13:42.855
AND I HAVE GOT TO ASK, WHAT IS

13:42.855 --> 13:44.057
THIS DRIVER'S LICENSE GET YOU,

13:44.057 --> 13:46.092
JUST THE ABILITY TO DRIVE?

13:46.092 --> 13:47.026
>> YES.

13:47.026 --> 13:49.729
IT GETS YOU THE ABILITY TO

13:49.729 --> 13:51.264
DRIVE, ESSENTIALLY AND FOR SOME

13:51.264 --> 13:54.200
OF THE IMMIGRANTS WHO I HAVE

13:54.200 --> 13:55.468
TALKED TO AND THEIR ADVOCATES

13:55.468 --> 13:58.705
THEY ALSO SAY THAT IT GIVES THEM

13:58.705 --> 14:01.641
A CERTAIN PEACE OF MIND SO THAT

14:01.641 --> 14:04.510
WITH THEIR INTERACTS WITH LAW

14:04.510 --> 14:06.245
ENFORCEMENT THEY WILL FEEL A BIT

14:06.245 --> 14:08.681
MORE COMFORTABLE AND A BIT MORE

14:08.681 --> 14:10.950
AT EASE, AND ALSO AGAIN I THINK

14:10.950 --> 14:13.252
IT JUST GOES INTO IMMIGRANTS

14:13.252 --> 14:14.887
FEELING LIKE IT GIVES THEM A

14:14.887 --> 14:17.256
DEGREE OF LEGITIMACY THAT REALLY

14:17.256 --> 14:19.125
A LOT OF THEM PROBABLY WON'T

14:19.125 --> 14:20.026
EVER HAVE WHILE THEY ARE IN THIS

14:20.026 --> 14:20.793
COUNTRY.

14:20.793 --> 14:23.696
>> AND THAT SAME LEVEL OF

14:23.696 --> 14:25.832
LEGITIMACY HAS BE TO BE A SOURCE

14:25.832 --> 14:28.701
OF CONCERN FOR CRITICS, THEY ARE

14:28.701 --> 14:29.736
ILLEGAL IN THE FIRST PLACE WE

14:29.736 --> 14:31.571
ARE ENABLING THEM TO STAY THERE

14:31.571 --> 14:32.371
AND NOW HAVE APPOINTMENTS

14:32.371 --> 14:34.707
WHENEVER THEY SHOW UP TO DMV,

14:34.707 --> 14:36.609
SHOULDN'T WE MEET THEM WITH A

14:36.609 --> 14:37.677
CUSTOM OFFICIAL THERE?

14:37.677 --> 14:39.479
>> WELL, TO THE FIRST PART OF

14:39.479 --> 14:41.180
YOUR STATEMENT, THAT HAS BEEN

14:41.180 --> 14:42.815
PART OF THE ARGUMENT FROM PEOPLE

14:42.815 --> 14:44.717
IS THAT IT WILL, OPPONENT OF

14:44.717 --> 14:47.887
THIS IT WILL ENCOURAGE OR REWARD

14:47.887 --> 14:48.921
ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR.

14:48.921 --> 14:50.289
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO ANYONE WHO

14:50.289 --> 14:53.426
HAS ACTUALLY SAID LET'S PUT

14:53.426 --> 14:54.694
FEDERAL AUTHORITIES OUTSIDE OF

14:54.694 --> 14:58.698
THIS DMVs AND ARREST AND DEPORT

14:58.698 --> 15:00.032
THESE PEOPLE BUT I THINK THE

15:00.032 --> 15:01.367
BIGGEST CONCERN IS THAT AGAIN

15:01.367 --> 15:03.302
YOU ARE KIND OF SANCTIONING

15:03.302 --> 15:05.304
ILLEGAL BEHAVIOR IS WHAT CRITICS

15:05.304 --> 15:06.806
OF THIS LAW SAY.

15:06.806 --> 15:07.840
>> SO WHO IS PUSHING FOR THE LAW

15:07.840 --> 15:10.042
IN THE FIRST PLACE AND HOW LONG

15:10.042 --> 15:11.577
HAVE THEY BEEN WORKING ON IT?

15:11.577 --> 15:13.946
>> WELL, IT WAS THE DEMOCRATIC

15:13.946 --> 15:16.749
CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE HERE IN

15:16.749 --> 15:18.618
COLORADO AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED

15:18.618 --> 15:21.821
IT, SO IT WAS SUPPORTED BY

15:21.821 --> 15:23.122
DEMOCRATS AND ACTUALLY LAST YEAR

15:23.122 --> 15:24.824
WAS THE FIRST YEAR THAT IT WAS

15:24.824 --> 15:25.825
INTRODUCED HERE.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.860
COLORADO IS PART OF THIS WAVE OF

15:27.860 --> 15:29.395
STATES THAT PASSED THIS LAW.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.697
YOU MENTIONED THAT IT WAS -- IT

15:31.697 --> 15:33.366
IS 11 STATES THAT HAVE IT, BUT

15:33.366 --> 15:36.369
MOST OF THOSE WERE LAST YEAR,

15:36.369 --> 15:38.037
EIGHT TO BE EXACT.

15:38.037 --> 15:41.841
SO THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING THAT

15:41.841 --> 15:44.010
I THINKABLE, TO BE PERFECTLY

15:44.010 --> 15:45.111
BLUNT KIND OF CAME OUT OF

15:45.111 --> 15:47.547
NOWHERE LAST YEAR AND I THINK IT

15:47.547 --> 15:50.016
GREW OUT OF SOME FRUSTRATION

15:50.016 --> 15:51.450
THAT, YOU KNOW, CONGRESS'S

15:51.450 --> 15:53.486
INABILITY TO PASS ANY SORT OF

15:53.486 --> 15:54.287
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION

15:54.287 --> 15:55.221
REFORM.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.523
>> SO WHO IS PAYING FOR THIS

15:57.523 --> 15:58.291
PROGRAM?

15:58.291 --> 16:00.726
>> WELL, THE PROGRAM IS INTENDED

16:00.726 --> 16:03.095

16:03.095 --> 16:04.697
THE PEOPLE WHO ARE APPLYING FOR

16:04.697 --> 16:06.232
THESE LICENSES AND

16:06.232 --> 16:08.668
IDENTIFICATION CARDS ARE PAYING

16:08.668 --> 16:10.903
FOR THOSE -- FOR THESE SERVICES

16:10.903 --> 16:12.405
THEMSELVES AND FOR THAT REASON

16:12.405 --> 16:14.707
THE DRIVER'S LICENSES AND THE

16:14.707 --> 16:16.142
IDS ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN WHAT

16:16.142 --> 16:17.577
THE REST OF THE GENERAL

16:17.577 --> 16:19.879
POPULATION PAYS BY ABOUT DOUBLE

16:19.879 --> 16:21.948
THE AMOUNT THAT PEOPLE USUALLY

16:21.948 --> 16:25.151
PAY, SO THERE IS NO STATE

16:25.151 --> 16:26.385
FUNDING GOING TO SUPPORT THIS

16:26.385 --> 16:27.086
PROGRAM.

16:27.086 --> 16:28.120

16:33.626 --> 16:36.696
WITH A DRIVER'S LICENSE NOW?

16:36.696 --> 16:38.231
>> THERE ARE.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.032
IN COLORADO THESE LICENSES AND

16:40.032 --> 16:41.601
IDENTIFICATION CARDS ARE CLEARLY

16:41.601 --> 16:43.402
MARKED TO SAY THAT THEY CAN'T BE

16:43.402 --> 16:45.404
USED FOR VOTING, THEY CAN'T BE

16:45.404 --> 16:48.741
USED TO ACCESS FEDERAL BENEFITS

16:48.741 --> 16:51.944
AND THE IDEA TOO IS THAT YOU

16:51.944 --> 16:53.312
CAN'T TAKE YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE

16:53.312 --> 16:54.981
OR ID CARD TO THE AIRPORT AND
