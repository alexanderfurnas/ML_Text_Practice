HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.806 --> 00:06.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.807 --> 00:08.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.242 --> 00:11.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On tonight's "PBS NewsHour": the
tragic fallout
from Italy's earthquake.

00:11.778 --> 00:17.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The death toll rises to 281,
while aftershocks
destroy bridges, cutting off
access to those

00:17.484 --> 00:18.852 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in need.

00:18.886 --> 00:23.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also ahead this Friday: inside
the mind of
swing state voters.

00:23.090 --> 00:26.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We go to the pivotal
battleground of Virginia
to see what residents are saying
about the

00:26.827 --> 00:28.428 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

00:28.462 --> 00:30.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARISSA BAPTISTA, Contractor: I
would say
that I would vigorously support
her.

00:30.130 --> 00:35.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON KATZMAN, Tax Preparer: He
was drawing
these crowds of ordinary
citizens in.

00:35.369 --> 00:39.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It got me involved at an
emotional level.

00:39.106 --> 00:40.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And it's
Friday.

00:40.741 --> 00:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
are here to
analyze the week's news.

00:43.810 --> 00:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:51.018 --> 00:53.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:53.854 --> 01:03.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The U.S. and
Russia neared
an agreement today that aims to
reduce hostilities

01:03.463 --> 01:05.299 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

01:05.332 --> 01:08.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Word of the progress came after
an hours-long
meeting in Geneva between
Secretary of State

01:08.201 --> 01:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Kerry and his Russian
counterpart, Sergei
Lavrov.

01:11.238 --> 01:16.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Kerry said the deal, if
completed, will make
the possibility of a lasting
truce more likely.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he conceded there was more
work to be
done.

01:19.112 --> 01:23.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: In the
next days, our experts will be
meeting here

01:23.383 --> 01:31.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Geneva to conclude the few
remaining technical
issues and to move forward in
order to take

01:31.959 --> 01:38.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the steps necessary to build the
confidence
to overcome the deep mistrust
that does exist

01:38.665 --> 01:40.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on all sides.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: An earlier
cessation of
hostilities failed after
numerous regime and

01:43.837 --> 01:45.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rebel violations.

01:45.505 --> 01:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Syria, one of the
war's longest
stand-offs drew closer to
ending.

01:50.077 --> 01:54.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of residents and
fighters were allowed
to evacuate the Damascus suburb
of Daraya,

01:54.247 --> 01:57.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which has been under government
siege since
2012.

01:57.784 --> 02:02.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Kerry accused the
Syrian army of
forcing them to surrender.

02:02.155 --> 02:07.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A suicide truck bombing in
Southeast Turkey
killed at least 11 police
officers today.

02:07.194 --> 02:08.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Another 78 people were wounded.

02:08.862 --> 02:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened at a checkpoint just
steps from
a police station near the Syrian
border.

02:12.265 --> 02:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kurdish militants claimed
responsibility.

02:14.735 --> 02:19.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the latest in a string of
attacks targeting
the country's police and
military.

02:19.106 --> 02:24.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Philippine government has
agreed to an
indefinite cease-fire with
communist rebels.

02:24.211 --> 02:28.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's aimed at ending one of
Asia's longest-running
insurgencies, a conflict that's
killed at

02:28.648 --> 02:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
least 40,000 people since the
1960s.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The deal was the culmination of
peace talks
in Oslo, Norway.

02:34.688 --> 02:40.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It includes a timetable for
discussions about
political, economic and
constitutional reforms.

02:40.193 --> 02:42.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A government representative
hailed the agreement.

02:42.629 --> 02:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESUS DUREZA, Representative of
the Philippine
Government: This is an historic
and unprecedented

02:49.136 --> 02:50.937 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event.

02:50.971 --> 02:56.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of us have been here doing
this before,
but I think we're looking at a
very opportune

02:56.476 --> 03:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunity that we can finish
off what we
have started a long time ago.

03:00.781 --> 03:04.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Representatives from both
sides agreed to return to Oslo
in October

03:04.451 --> 03:06.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for further negotiations.

03:06.820 --> 03:12.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France's top administrative
court overturned
a controversial ban on the
so-called burkini

03:12.092 --> 03:13.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in one resort town today.

03:13.894 --> 03:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The body-covering swimsuit worn
by Muslim
women has sparked a fierce
debate in France.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Martin Geissler of Independent
Television
News has our report from Paris.

03:22.569 --> 03:27.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN GEISSLER: These were the
pictures that
divided France and shocked the
world beyond,

03:27.174 --> 03:32.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Muslim woman forced by a group
of armed
policemen to remove her clothing
on a public

03:32.145 --> 03:33.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beach.

03:33.914 --> 03:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The burkini was banned by more
than a dozen
French towns for being overtly
religious.

03:38.785 --> 03:43.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The law had wide public support,
but activists
from one town took it to the
highest court

03:43.423 --> 03:44.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Paris today.

03:44.524 --> 03:47.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judges ruled it should be
suspended.

03:47.894 --> 03:57.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: It's against the civil
freedom of religion,
and now the decision of the
Conseil d'Etat

03:57.871 --> 03:59.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is final.

03:59.673 --> 04:03.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN GEISSLER: As absurd as
this all may
seem, it's important to remember
the context.

04:03.677 --> 04:08.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
France has suffered a series of
terror attacks
over recent months, and the
country feels

04:08.448 --> 04:10.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
embattled and angry.

04:10.250 --> 04:15.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICOLAS SARKOZY, French
President (through
translator): I support without
any hesitation

04:15.088 --> 04:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the mayors who have banned the
burkini to
preserve public order.

04:19.226 --> 04:24.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ask for a law forbidding it on
the entire
territory of the republic.

04:24.564 --> 04:29.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN GEISSLER: There was
little sign of
stress at the manmade beach on
the banks of

04:29.136 --> 04:35.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sand today, Parisians
enjoying some late
summer sunshine, no burkinis to
be seen.

04:35.041 --> 04:37.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that didn't stop the debate.

04:37.110 --> 04:42.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"We have been victims of terror
in this country,"
he says, "and the burkini is a
clear symbol

04:42.382 --> 04:43.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Islam.

04:43.383 --> 04:44.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's why it offends people."

04:44.684 --> 04:48.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: We live in a free
country, so they
do what they want.

04:48.455 --> 04:53.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they want to wear something
like this,
it's not...

04:53.059 --> 04:54.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: It's no problem.

04:54.761 --> 04:56.496 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Yes.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN GEISSLER: These are
extreme times in
France, and many here believe
they require

04:59.933 --> 05:01.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
extreme measures.

05:01.668 --> 05:06.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the republic's great
founding values,
freedom, equality and
brotherhood, are being

05:06.506 --> 05:09.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tested now like never before.

05:09.209 --> 05:14.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As this country debates the best
way forward,
it's being forced to ask some
difficult questions

05:14.681 --> 05:16.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of itself.

05:16.516 --> 05:19.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The human
rights lawyer
fighting the ban said that while
today's ruling

05:19.386 --> 05:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
applied to only one town, it
should set a
legal precedent throughout the
country.

05:24.257 --> 05:28.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the Food
and Drug Administration
wants all U.S. blood banks to
start screening

05:28.929 --> 05:30.730 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the Zika virus.

05:30.764 --> 05:34.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That requirement had previously
been limited
to areas with active Zika
transmission like

05:34.434 --> 05:36.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Puerto Rico and parts of
Florida.

05:36.803 --> 05:41.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, the FDA ordered
facilities in
Miami and Fort Lauderdale to
stop taking blood

05:41.241 --> 05:45.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
donations until Zika screening
could begin.

05:45.045 --> 05:49.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Donald Trump's
campaign is taking
fresh heat over its new CEO,
Steve Bannon.

05:49.316 --> 05:54.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Guardian reported Bannon
registered to
vote in the swing state of
Florida using the

05:54.321 --> 05:58.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
address of a vacant home, a move
that would
violate election laws.

05:58.858 --> 06:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Trump spokesman insisted he's
moved elsewhere
in Florida.

06:02.028 --> 06:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, various news outlets
revealed Bannon
was charged with domestic
violence in 1996.

06:07.801 --> 06:10.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He allegedly grabbed his
then-wife's neck
and wrist.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The case was dismissed when she
didn't testify.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We will have more on the
campaign later in
the program.

06:16.042 --> 06:20.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The federal government will give
Amtrak a
nearly $2.5 billion loan, the
largest in the

06:20.847 --> 06:22.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
history of the Transportation
Department.

06:22.616 --> 06:26.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be used for improvements
on the busy
Northeast Corridor, which goes
from D.C.,

06:26.353 --> 06:27.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through New York, to Boston.

06:27.854 --> 06:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amtrak will buy new trains,
upgrade tracks,
and improve platforms.

06:32.559 --> 06:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama created the
world's largest
marine protected area today.

06:36.162 --> 06:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Marine National Monument is
located off
the coast of his native Hawaii.

06:39.766 --> 06:44.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will now quadruple in size,
to span nearly
600,000 square miles.

06:44.971 --> 06:48.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The sanctuary will protect more
than 7,000
different species, including sea
turtles and

06:48.708 --> 06:50.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
whales.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Josh
Earnest explained
why the president felt it was
time to act.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
There is a role for Congress to
play in terms

06:56.783 --> 07:05.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of setting aside certain
territory, lands
and waters in the United States
for future

07:05.191 --> 07:06.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
preservation.

07:06.893 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we haven't seen a lot of
congressional
activity of any sort really over
the last

07:11.564 --> 07:13.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few years.

07:13.300 --> 07:18.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it has turned the
president's attention
to more robust use of executive
action.

07:18.538 --> 07:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Hawaii's
National Marine
Monument was originally created
a decade ago,

07:22.609 --> 07:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under President George W. Bush.

07:24.878 --> 07:29.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal Reserve Chair Janet
Yellen said the
case for raising U.S. interest
rates has gotten

07:29.049 --> 07:30.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stronger in recent months.

07:30.917 --> 07:34.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She spoke at an international
gathering of
central bankers in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming.

07:34.721 --> 07:38.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Yellen gave no indication of
when the
Fed might raise rates.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That led to choppy trading on
Wall Street
today.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 53 points
to close above 18396.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose six.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The S&amp;P 500 fell three.

07:48.935 --> 07:52.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
lost a fraction
of a percent.

07:52.605 --> 07:57.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the shrinking
window for finding survivors of
Italy's devastating

07:57.711 --> 08:03.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
earthquake; voters lay bare
their hopes and
frustrations in the presidential
election;

08:03.316 --> 08:09.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks on
this week's
news; how robots could stop the
invasive lionfish;

08:09.422 --> 08:21.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and much more.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Three days after a powerful
earthquake hit
Central Italy, the death toll
has climbed

08:25.004 --> 08:27.307 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
higher to 281.

08:27.340 --> 08:31.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rescue operations have been
called off in
some parts, as hopes of finding
survivors

08:31.578 --> 08:33.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fades.

08:33.480 --> 08:36.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For an on-the-ground report, we
turn to special
correspondent Christopher
Livesay in Amatrice.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spoke with him a short time
ago.

08:39.018 --> 08:40.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christopher, thanks for joining
us.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The thing with earthquakes is,
it's not just
one quake.

08:43.656 --> 08:45.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are the aftershocks you're
feeling?

08:45.558 --> 08:50.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: Well,
everyone is on
edge in the town of Amatrice,
where I'm standing,

08:50.063 --> 08:55.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but all over this region, they
have been rippling
throughout ever since the
initial quake on

08:55.168 --> 08:57.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wednesday, all the way through
just a few
moments ago.

08:58.004 --> 09:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the biggest one happened at
about 6:30
this morning.

09:01.408 --> 09:06.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It reached 4.8 on the Richter
scale and it
sent structures around Amatrice
toppling to

09:06.479 --> 09:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the ground, ones that were still
standing.

09:08.415 --> 09:13.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the last time I spoke
to you, you
might recall a church that was
standing behind

09:13.586 --> 09:15.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

09:15.455 --> 09:18.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We actually had to move to a
different location
because that church was deemed
unstable and

09:18.191 --> 09:22.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bell tower could have
toppled at any moment.

09:22.462 --> 09:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's been the case for some
roads leading
into this town, also for a
bridge that was

09:27.200 --> 09:28.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a central pipeline.

09:28.968 --> 09:33.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As I was trying to get back into
the city,
I couldn't get past a certain
road because

09:33.273 --> 09:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they were demolishing a hospital
that was
on the brink of collapse.

09:37.544 --> 09:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that's making the rescue
effort very difficult,
but rescuers, when you talk to
them, they

09:42.782 --> 09:47.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will tell you that, at this
point, three days
into their efforts, they're
really not counting

09:47.320 --> 09:49.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on finding anyone alive.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How
significant is it, if
that infrastructure starts to
crumble or is

09:52.292 --> 09:57.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deemed too unsafe to travel,
that resources,
like people, and goods and
services are getting

09:57.430 --> 09:59.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through those roads and bridges?

09:59.332 --> 10:03.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: Well, you
would be surprised
by the breadth of people who
have come out

10:03.970 --> 10:05.772 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to lend a hand.

10:05.805 --> 10:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You hear accents from all over
Italy, people
from as far north of Milan and
Venice, all

10:10.910 --> 10:14.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way to the tip of the toe of
the Italian
boot, shall we say.

10:14.581 --> 10:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some volunteers come from
even further
afield.

10:17.050 --> 10:23.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke to a group of Israeli
volunteers who
are lending help as trauma
therapists today.

10:23.590 --> 10:29.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then another, even more
surprising group
of people I spoke to, 50
volunteers, all of

10:29.662 --> 10:36.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them migrants from Africa, when
I asked them
why they were doing this, they
said, look,

10:36.269 --> 10:37.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we're here to help.

10:37.937 --> 10:41.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the same way Italy helped us
in our time
of need, we want to help as
well.

10:41.808 --> 10:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Given the
scale of all the
buildings that have collapsed,
who is responsible

10:46.312 --> 10:50.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for rebuilding or in some of the
cases the
newer buildings, making sure
that they didn't

10:50.717 --> 10:52.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fall in this earthquake?

10:52.452 --> 10:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY: Well, there
is sort of
a reckoning that is taking place
right now,

10:55.588 --> 10:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lot of soul-searching and some
finger-pointing.

10:59.058 --> 11:05.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, a couple of probes have
been opened
into some structures that
toppled down that

11:05.565 --> 11:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some people believe shouldn't
have.

11:07.300 --> 11:12.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One in particular in the town of
Accumoli,
which is close to here, that
church tower

11:12.272 --> 11:14.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
came tumbling to the ground.

11:14.207 --> 11:19.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was 10 years after an
expensive restoration
process took place on this
church that should

11:19.879 --> 11:21.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have made it earthquake-proof.

11:21.814 --> 11:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That steeple that came crashing
down killed
a family of four people.

11:25.251 --> 11:30.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so now people are trying to
find out who's
responsible for that or if it's
just Mother

11:30.256 --> 11:31.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nature.

11:31.624 --> 11:35.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another example was a school in
this town
that came crashing down.

11:35.461 --> 11:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was a public building that,
again, should
have been built up to code and
should have

11:39.566 --> 11:41.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been retrofitted.

11:41.501 --> 11:45.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No matter how old these
buildings are, the
question is, can you make
something earthquake-proof

11:45.505 --> 11:50.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a part of the country that's
seen seismic
activity since time immemorial?

11:50.343 --> 12:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Christopher Livesay
joining us from Italy tonight,
thanks so much.

12:01.921 --> 12:08.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country: It's
been quite a week for political
news, with

12:08.428 --> 12:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allegations of racism from both
presidential
candidates, and calls to disband
the philanthropic

12:13.866 --> 12:16.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
behemoth that is the Clinton
Foundation.

12:16.436 --> 12:21.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the country watches all of
this unfold,
we take the temperature of the
race.

12:21.140 --> 12:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our Judy Woodruff sat down this
week with
a group of six voters in
Northern Virginia,

12:25.845 --> 12:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the few competitive
states this election
year.

12:28.147 --> 12:30.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about the
candidates.

12:30.850 --> 12:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have been through this pretty
long, some
would say tortured process of
figuring out

12:35.221 --> 12:37.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who the nominees were going to
be, especially
on the Republican side.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We started out with a big field
of candidates.

12:40.393 --> 12:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's now winnowed down to Donald
Trump.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Alison, what do you think about
Donald Trump?

12:47.133 --> 12:51.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALISON KATZMAN, Tax Preparer:
Early on, like,
I would say last August, I felt
Trump was

12:51.404 --> 12:53.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to be the nominee.

12:53.806 --> 12:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was just something.

12:55.008 --> 12:59.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was drawing these crowds of
ordinary citizens
in.

12:59.779 --> 13:05.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he did his first Virginia
rally in Richmond
in October, I drove all the way
down there

13:05.818 --> 13:16.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Richmond International
Raceway, and
it was like a huge pep rally or
a rah-rah

13:16.295 --> 13:17.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
revival.

13:18.031 --> 13:22.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It got me involved in an
emotional level in
a way that none of the other
candidacies,

13:22.702 --> 13:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just listened to somebody on
television, did.

13:25.905 --> 13:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I also very much liked the
fact that he
was a businessman.

13:29.308 --> 13:33.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bill Lupinacci,
have you said
you voted Republican for a long
time.

13:33.646 --> 13:37.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what do you make of the
argument that
Donald Trump is somebody with
business experience?

13:37.784 --> 13:40.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL LUPINACCI, Small Business
Owner: I have
disavowed my association with
the Republican

13:40.987 --> 13:46.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party for this election, because
I find him
morally repugnant.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have done business with his
companies.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have bought our software.

13:50.930 --> 13:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The word on the street is, get
the money up
front.

13:53.966 --> 13:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other people, other vendors of
his say, get
the money up front.

13:57.403 --> 14:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he pays us in credit cards
when he has
bought our software, his
companies, not him

14:02.508 --> 14:04.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
personally.

14:04.243 --> 14:13.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The things that he says in his
rallies to
try to incite violence, to
inflame people

14:13.686 --> 14:15.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is sickening to me.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I won't have anything to do with
it anymore.

14:17.657 --> 14:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm having nothing to do with
the Republican
Party this year, as are many
other Republicans,

14:21.794 --> 14:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like George Will and President
Bush and others,
saying they're not going to for
him.

14:25.098 --> 14:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marissa, what do
you think?

14:27.266 --> 14:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is your take on Donald
Trump?

14:28.568 --> 14:30.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARISSA BAPTISTA, Contractor:
So, I have three
young children.

14:30.336 --> 14:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm actually the PTA president
of a school,
an elementary school of about
800 kids.

14:36.509 --> 14:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a sizable portion of
English-language
learners -- we call them ELL --
and then free

14:41.314 --> 14:48.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and reduced lunch children,
children who are
from a lower socioeconomic
status or group.

14:48.588 --> 14:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it angers me when people
say, well, we're
wasting all these money on these
children

14:54.761 --> 14:55.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are illegal.

14:55.928 --> 14:57.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're children.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They want to be educated.

14:58.798 --> 15:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They come here for a better
life.

15:00.700 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, how do we say, because you
were not
born here or because you were
some type of

15:05.872 --> 15:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anchor baby or just something
that is derogatory
along those lines, that you
don't also deserve

15:10.576 --> 15:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the same opportunities as every
child that's
born here?

15:13.012 --> 15:18.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ALISON KATZMAN: If those
children who are
coming here illegally had been
born in the

15:18.317 --> 15:21.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home countries that they belong
in, they wouldn't
be here anyway.

15:21.988 --> 15:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where do we draw the line?

15:23.956 --> 15:26.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At some point, we're getting
inundated.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's costing such as where I
grew up.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I grew up in Appalachia.

15:31.564 --> 15:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's poor children there that
were part
of the poor lunch, the free
lunch program

15:36.102 --> 15:38.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and needed Head Start.

15:38.137 --> 15:40.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're being ignored.

15:40.072 --> 15:44.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's like, oh, bless the illegal
immigrant
children, illegal alien
children.

15:44.811 --> 15:52.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're not taking it out on
the children,
but their parents are coming
here, are plotting

15:53.019 --> 15:59.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring them here with the idea
that, oh,
no, we're not going to want to
send them back.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me bring in
Farah here.

16:01.127 --> 16:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have been hearing this
conversation about
immigrants, illegal immigrants
and other immigrants,

16:06.499 --> 16:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are hurting this country.

16:08.067 --> 16:11.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think, and as it
connects to Donald
Trump?

16:11.571 --> 16:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FARAH IMAM, School Principal:
There were things
like -- there were drugs, there
were immigration

16:17.210 --> 16:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems, there was unemployment
long before
this perception of an immigrant
wave.

16:26.886 --> 16:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's been a long -- it's been
around long
time.

16:29.355 --> 16:32.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the history of our nation,
the history
of our great nation.

16:32.425 --> 16:35.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's kind of what has built
us and brought
us to where we are.

16:35.995 --> 16:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, when we look at
Trump or any
other candidate, we need to
think of how we

16:42.168 --> 16:47.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can address those problems and
not just say,
we have to fight this and not do
anything

16:47.874 --> 16:49.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about it, essentially.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Corey, what about
that?

16:51.644 --> 16:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have looked at him closely.

16:53.145 --> 16:54.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You say you're going to vote for
him.

16:54.914 --> 16:56.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What about that?

16:56.182 --> 16:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COREY SOLVAN, Contractor: Donald
Trump is
very well-educated.

16:57.950 --> 17:03.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of his language that's
being spun
into being divisive, I don't
think you will

17:03.089 --> 17:05.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see these extreme policies come
out of him.

17:05.458 --> 17:11.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what you will see is him
using effective
communication tactics that any
effective leader

17:11.063 --> 17:17.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does and utilizes to actually
bring forward
the issues, so that we can bring
policy into

17:17.670 --> 17:19.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legislation.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marissa, could
that be an explanation,
that he's doing this to shock
people and to

17:23.509 --> 17:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get the conversation going, and
that he's
not going to do this if he's
elected?

17:26.712 --> 17:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARISSA BAPTISTA: So, that he's
relying on
theatrics and abusing people on
Twitter.

17:30.716 --> 17:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, I work for a large
corporation.

17:33.786 --> 17:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leaders in my corporation
would never
act the way in which he's acting
on such a

17:38.824 --> 17:43.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
large stage, with him
potentially being the
leader of our country.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it just would never
happen.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, I mean, I think...

17:47.600 --> 17:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY SOLVAN: If you study,
though, any effective
communicator, leadership,
self-development

17:53.272 --> 17:56.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
professional, they all use these
tactics in
interventions.

17:56.342 --> 17:57.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They use these tactics in...

17:57.843 --> 18:00.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What kind of
tactics are you
referring to?

18:00.046 --> 18:03.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COREY SOLVAN: Powerful rhetoric,
offensive
rhetoric, things that get
people's attention

18:03.749 --> 18:06.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and allow you to say, wait a
minute, I have
to think about this.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are my values?

18:08.554 --> 18:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do they affect the larger
masses of people
outside myself and inside my
circle?

18:12.858 --> 18:18.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But let me --
Tom, what about
that tactic?

18:18.297 --> 18:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Could this just be a tactic to
get people
talking?

18:20.266 --> 18:25.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM SMITH, Retired Teacher: Yes,
I mean, the
tactic, I would call bullying.

18:25.171 --> 18:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's really picking on people
who are vulnerable.

18:28.374 --> 18:34.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the word repugnant was used
to describe
him.

18:34.447 --> 18:39.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just -- I don't find any
positive values
in the guy.

18:39.352 --> 18:43.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk about his business
knowledge, $650
million in debt.

18:43.589 --> 18:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's had how many bankruptcies?

18:46.692 --> 18:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not the way you run a
successful business.

18:49.028 --> 18:52.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know what's going to
happen in the
end, but I certainly don't want
that leadership

18:52.264 --> 18:53.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the White House.

18:53.265 --> 18:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Alison.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALISON KATZMAN: OK.

18:56.035 --> 19:00.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you want the talk about
divisiveness, I
would point to the Obama
administration, and

19:00.973 --> 19:04.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hence Hillary as a subsequent
administration.

19:04.577 --> 19:11.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't vote for Obama in 2008,
but I thought
maybe it's a good thing we have
got an African-American

19:11.717 --> 19:16.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, and it will bring
racial harmony,
and, well, it's time, and even
though I didn't

19:16.222 --> 19:17.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care for him.

19:17.957 --> 19:24.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But all he's done is pretty much
sneer and
look down and feel like
Americans who have

19:24.163 --> 19:29.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been here for a long time, like
myself and
my family, are the enemy.

19:29.969 --> 19:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I can see this is
clearly an
election that's bringing up
strong emotions

19:35.241 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and reactions.

19:37.043 --> 19:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're now confronted with two
choices, two
main party choices, Donald Trump
and Hillary

19:40.713 --> 19:41.680 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

19:41.714 --> 19:42.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have decided to vote for
Clinton.

19:42.915 --> 19:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARISSA BAPTISTA: Absolutely,
yes.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why?

19:45.284 --> 19:50.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARISSA BAPTISTA: It was
probably because
I didn't like Trump.

19:50.589 --> 19:56.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if there were other
Republican candidates
that were maybe a little more
moderate, then

19:56.729 --> 19:59.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I could be swayed to vote the
other side.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To vote against
Clinton.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:02.668 --> 20:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARISSA BAPTISTA: To vote
Republican, which
I have never done in the past.

20:04.537 --> 20:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it about
Clinton?

20:07.139 --> 20:08.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You sound hesitant?

20:09.008 --> 20:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARISSA BAPTISTA: It's not
necessarily that
I'm hesitant.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think I just don't know
enough.

20:13.612 --> 20:18.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we were talking about,
you know, how
much time have you spent just
listening to

20:18.617 --> 20:22.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of the rhetoric or just the
information
that is coming out on TV?

20:23.022 --> 20:23.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I work.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have three young children.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a lot of my information
doesn't come from
the news.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It comes from what I see on the
Internet.

20:29.395 --> 20:32.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tom, what about
you, as you
look at the choices?

20:32.531 --> 20:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM SMITH: I feel like the
economic mess that
we're a part of now goes way
back, and both

20:40.139 --> 20:43.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
parties bear equal
responsibility.

20:43.476 --> 20:49.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The losers have been the lower
half or the
lower -- at this point, maybe,
90 percent

20:49.048 --> 20:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Americans, but certainly the
lower half.

20:53.919 --> 20:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think either of the
choices right
now are going to serve that
lower half.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton or Trump?

21:00.059 --> 21:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOM SMITH: Clinton or Trump.

21:02.528 --> 21:09.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for me, the power of
appointments is
really critical for the future
of the country,

21:09.435 --> 21:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Supreme Court, the attorney
general, EPA,
just down the line.

21:15.574 --> 21:21.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, I have more confidence
in who her
appointees would be than I --
than if Trump

21:21.647 --> 21:22.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were president.

21:22.648 --> 21:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Farah, what about
you?

21:24.383 --> 21:30.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FARAH IMAM: I do tend to agree
with Democratic
Party when it comes to social
policy.

21:30.456 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I comes down to if I had to
choose between
Trump or Clinton, I'm
conflicted.

21:36.295 --> 21:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I had to choose between only
those two,
then maybe I wouldn't vote.

21:40.199 --> 21:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But knowing that I had...

21:41.500 --> 21:42.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:42.768 --> 21:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Could you imagine
yourself
voting for Clinton?

21:43.802 --> 21:45.437 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
FARAH IMAM: Yes.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.438 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

21:46.472 --> 21:47.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just difficult.

21:47.473 --> 21:50.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why?

21:50.943 --> 21:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FARAH IMAM: There is a lack of
sincerity that
I feel with her.

21:57.483 --> 22:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know some people that I
speak with are,
like, oh, you're just saying
that because

22:01.520 --> 22:02.488 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she's a woman.

22:02.521 --> 22:05.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I'm a woman, too, so it's
not that.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's, I don't find her
relatable.

22:08.027 --> 22:18.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't feel like she can, even
though she's
a mother, she's a working
mother, she just

22:18.070 --> 22:23.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- she has a hard time relating
to a broader
population.

22:23.742 --> 22:27.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to come
back to you,
Bill.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're a traditional Republican.

22:29.715 --> 22:31.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We wouldn't expect you to
support the Democrat.

22:31.584 --> 22:35.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But did you even give her any
thought in this
election?

22:35.187 --> 22:37.389 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BILL LUPINACCI: It's a
possibility.

22:37.423 --> 22:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I doubt I'm going to vote for
her.

22:38.991 --> 22:40.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I seriously doubt.

22:40.793 --> 22:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But vilifying her and making her
into -- as
the right has done, into this
caricature is

22:47.633 --> 22:48.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just wrong.

22:48.968 --> 22:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm more likely to vote for
neither a Democrat
or a Republican.

22:52.137 --> 22:54.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm looking at both Gary Johnson
and Jill
Stein.

22:54.840 --> 22:59.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm struck that,
in a state
where Hillary Clinton is
supposedly polling,

22:59.378 --> 23:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know, 10 points ahead,
that there
is no one here who is
enthusiastic for Hillary

23:04.283 --> 23:05.251 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

23:05.284 --> 23:07.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Am I hearing you correctly?

23:07.086 --> 23:09.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARISSA BAPTISTA: Actually, now
that I think
about it, I think, because of
her position

23:09.655 --> 23:14.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
within the Democratic Party, so
she falls
in lines with things that
typical Democrats

23:14.793 --> 23:21.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
support, pro-choice,
pro-immigration, stronger
restriction on like gun laws, or
tightening

23:21.200 --> 23:23.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up those gun laws.

23:23.135 --> 23:29.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think she falls in line
with the Democratic
Party, the platform, so, in
that, I would

23:29.508 --> 23:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say that I would vigorously
support her.

23:31.844 --> 23:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would plan to
vote for her?

23:33.746 --> 23:35.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARISSA BAPTISTA: Oh,
absolutely, yes.

23:35.147 --> 23:39.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOM SMITH: And I will vote for
her, for sure.

23:39.251 --> 23:42.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't imagine a country run by
Trump.

23:43.022 --> 23:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to try to
sum this all
up by asking you all whether you
think it's

23:47.459 --> 23:51.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possible for the country to come
together,
or are we just destined, at
least for the

23:51.096 --> 23:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
next number of years, to be
divided?

23:53.532 --> 23:55.334 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Corey?

23:55.367 --> 24:00.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
COREY SOLVAN: I think,
unfortunately, I think
we're looking at four more years
of division.

24:00.205 --> 24:01.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You would like to...

24:01.373 --> 24:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No matter who is
elected, you're
saying?

24:02.274 --> 24:03.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COREY SOLVAN: Yes.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would like to hope and wish
for it to
be different, but we have come
so far apart,

24:06.879 --> 24:10.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's going to take time to start
healing and
coming back to a middle ground
on everyday

24:10.749 --> 24:12.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
issues that affect all of us.

24:12.384 --> 24:13.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bill, what do you
think?

24:13.652 --> 24:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can the country come together
under these
circumstances?

24:15.654 --> 24:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BILL LUPINACCI: What I'm hoping
for, what
I think could be possibly the
best for the

24:21.026 --> 24:26.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
country, is if these
independents get enough
vote, because people are so
disgusted with

24:27.032 --> 24:31.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both the Republicans and the
Democrats, that
these two independents, Gary
Johnson and Jill

24:31.403 --> 24:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stein, get enough votes that it
puts the fear
of God into them and saying, oh,
maybe four

24:36.608 --> 24:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years from now, a third party
can win.

24:39.011 --> 24:41.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's going to be almost
impossible for them
to win this year.

24:41.914 --> 24:45.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But maybe it will scare them
enough to say,
one of these parties just might
take it in

24:45.818 --> 24:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
four years because the country
is fed up.

24:48.754 --> 24:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does anybody see
coming together,
or do we just live with this
division?

24:55.427 --> 25:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FARAH IMAM: This nation was
built on hope
and perseverance and renewed
chances.

25:01.467 --> 25:06.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel like, no matter what,
we will find
ways to come together again.

25:06.872 --> 25:10.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will find topics to come
together again.

25:10.843 --> 25:15.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're all kind of aching
for it, no
matter Republican, Democrat,
independent.

25:15.814 --> 25:23.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we all kind of need
that, that moment
of unity again, because we're
all kind of

25:23.288 --> 25:26.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like, oh, my gosh, the ship is
sinking.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But -- so that's -- so, I do
have hope.

25:29.495 --> 25:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we're
going to leave
it there.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We thank you all very much.

25:33.332 --> 25:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a lot more we could
talk about tonight.

25:35.467 --> 25:43.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But this has really been a
wonderful conversation
and I thank you all very much.

25:43.742 --> 25:54.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That brings us
to the analysis
of Shields and Brooks.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

25:57.990 --> 26:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start with your reactions
to what you
saw, this group of voters.

26:01.827 --> 26:04.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's always great
to hear the
voices of real voters.

26:04.930 --> 26:10.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they're -- you know, we
see polls,
and it's 57 percent, we figure
everybody's

26:10.135 --> 26:11.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
monolithic.

26:11.904 --> 26:15.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet you get -- what you get
is, you get
the texture in the conversation
like that.

26:15.541 --> 26:23.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I found Alison really almost
compelling,
the woman who had voted for
Barack Obama in

26:23.048 --> 26:30.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2008 and really felt that she
and the demographic
of, I guess, white American
voters had been

26:30.889 --> 26:32.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
neglected and forgotten.

26:33.025 --> 26:38.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just -- in the past eight
years, and Democrats'
attention to other agendas.

26:38.430 --> 26:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just -- I found the voices
just really
revealing.

26:44.570 --> 26:49.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And most of all, it shows the
lack of enthusiasm
about this election.

26:49.441 --> 26:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When 51 percent of Republicans,
according
to Gallup poll, and 42 percent
of Democrats

26:55.380 --> 27:00.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say they wish their party had
nominated somebody
else, I think it was reflected
in Judy's session.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, first, I
disagree with
Mark.

27:02.688 --> 27:03.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think we are real voters.

27:03.689 --> 27:04.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:04.690 --> 27:06.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Do we not bleed?

27:06.492 --> 27:07.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

27:07.493 --> 27:09.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But, yes, I'm
really shocked.

27:10.028 --> 27:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like a lot of people one runs
across, a lot
of people in that focus group
were -- just

27:14.299 --> 27:18.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
couldn't imagine a Trump
presidency, but found
Clinton distrustworthy.

27:18.570 --> 27:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then say she wins -- and
according to
the upshot out of my newspaper,
it's like

27:22.474 --> 27:24.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an 88 percent chance or
something like that.

27:24.510 --> 27:28.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But say that we go to an
inaugural or we go
into an administration with
someone the country

27:28.647 --> 27:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fundamentally doesn't trust.

27:30.215 --> 27:33.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what does that do to the
morale of the
country?

27:33.051 --> 27:36.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And is there a way she can
become more trustworthy,
where she can reintroduce
herself in some

27:36.989 --> 27:39.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way, maybe after an election,
not in the heat
of a campaign?

27:39.424 --> 27:44.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Somehow, it just seems so
dispiriting, if
she does win, that we would go
through four

27:44.429 --> 27:49.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years where people feel this
personal distrust
for the commander in chief.

27:49.234 --> 27:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That can't be good for the
country, if it
stays like that.

27:51.403 --> 27:56.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Today, there
was even a
tepid endorsement by Bush
adviser Paul Wolfowitz,

27:56.141 --> 28:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying that he would vote for
Clinton, but
really it just came down to this
choice between

28:00.546 --> 28:02.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the lesser of two evils.

28:02.414 --> 28:07.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems so much that these
campaigns right
now is positioning about not
that our candidate

28:07.319 --> 28:08.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is not so great.

28:08.320 --> 28:09.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's just that the other
candidate is worse.

28:09.621 --> 28:11.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

28:11.390 --> 28:14.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the last endorsement in the
world that
Hillary Clinton wants at this
point is the

28:14.493 --> 28:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man who made the case publicly
to go to war
in Iraq and admitted that the
argument was

28:21.266 --> 28:26.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- consensus argument was on
weapons of mass
destruction, because that was
what everybody

28:26.438 --> 28:28.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could get behind.

28:28.307 --> 28:36.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the cause -- cause for going
to war was
just, you know, a contrivance.

28:36.415 --> 28:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's not -- Hillary Clinton
probably doesn't
want to be reminded of her
support for that

28:43.221 --> 28:44.790 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
venture.

28:44.823 --> 28:49.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think she probably now has
enough Republican
foreign policy endorsements.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.363 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:51.396 --> 28:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also this
week, we talked
a little bit about the rise of
the alt-right

28:55.434 --> 28:57.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
movement, the white supremacist
movement.

28:57.669 --> 29:01.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have got this week one
candidate calling
the other a racist, and then him
responding

29:01.406 --> 29:03.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back that she's a bigot.

29:03.909 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where are we here?

29:04.910 --> 29:05.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

29:06.011 --> 29:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I guess we're getting it
out in the
open.

29:07.713 --> 29:12.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I happen to think Donald Trump's
campaign
began with an act of ethnic
signaling, or

29:12.751 --> 29:14.553 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the San Bernardino thing
happened, and
he wanted to ban Muslim
immigration into the

29:18.190 --> 29:22.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
country, entrance into the
country, that is
-- that was blanketing an entire
ethnic group

29:22.828 --> 29:24.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or an entire religion.

29:24.229 --> 29:25.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's bigotry.

29:25.530 --> 29:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so that was the thing that
exploded his
campaign.

29:28.200 --> 29:34.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there have been just signals
all along
the way between alt-right and
the Trump campaign.

29:34.239 --> 29:40.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it just seems to me there is
always a
danger in every party to be
taken over by

29:40.112 --> 29:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some radical, angry fringe, the
John Birch
Society for the Republican Party
in the 1960s.

29:46.718 --> 29:51.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hubert Humphrey was -- spent --
and Eugene
McCarthy and other people spent
a lot of time

29:51.723 --> 29:54.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to get the communists out
of the Democratic
Party in the 1940s.

29:54.226 --> 29:59.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a famous confrontation
in Minnesota
where Humphrey's suit was wet --
was -- he

29:59.631 --> 30:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was spit upon so much, it was
soaking wet.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And parties have to control
themselves so
some vicious element doesn't
take over.

30:05.637 --> 30:08.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Republican Party has not
controlled
the alt-right movement.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, therefore, it has come into
the movement.

30:10.909 --> 30:14.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has welcomed it in with a
wink and a
nod.

30:14.780 --> 30:16.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is a long-term problem
for the party.

30:16.615 --> 30:20.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a long-term problem that
you're basically
an all white party.

30:20.252 --> 30:25.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so that's just a core
problem that Trump
has now exacerbated and blown
up.

30:25.057 --> 30:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I mean,
Secretary Clinton
might have not called him
specifically a racist,

30:27.693 --> 30:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but she's basically pointed
instance after
another after another where --
and this is

30:32.397 --> 30:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during a week where Donald Trump
goes out
and tries to lure
African-American votes,

30:37.402 --> 30:38.704 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Latino votes.

30:38.737 --> 30:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: To be very blunt,
I will state
my case.

30:44.009 --> 30:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has gone to, on a
consistent
basis, the meanest corners of
the American

30:49.715 --> 30:55.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soul, appealed to the basest and
darkest side
of all Americans.

30:56.021 --> 31:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He began his presidential bid
publicly by
charging falsely, by alleging
libelously that

31:05.130 --> 31:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president of the United
States wasn't
an American: My people are out
there.

31:09.668 --> 31:11.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're finding all of this
stuff.

31:11.603 --> 31:18.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He began his candidacy with,
they're rapists,
they're murderers, they're
coming here for

31:18.877 --> 31:23.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that purpose, speaking of
Mexican immigrants
to this country.

31:23.615 --> 31:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
David said about the Muslim ban.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's going to build the wall.

31:28.120 --> 31:32.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, it's -- everything about
it has been
dark and mean-spirited.

31:32.457 --> 31:34.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But let me just say one caveat.

31:34.726 --> 31:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I thought Hillary Clinton
delivered the
speech well.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She wasn't strident.

31:39.698 --> 31:46.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is the worst course for
her to win
a campaign, because you win a
campaign this

31:46.138 --> 31:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way -- and he's not a dog
whistle.

31:49.541 --> 31:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's a canine choir, OK, of dark
impulses.

31:53.145 --> 31:58.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you win a campaign this way,
and you have
agreed upon nothing about where
we are as

31:58.917 --> 32:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a people, what we ought to do
next, what we
ought to think about as the
great challenges

32:03.388 --> 32:05.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facing our country in the next
generations.

32:05.690 --> 32:09.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All you have greed upon is that
the person
is unacceptable.

32:09.161 --> 32:13.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And your political honeymoon,
your presidential
honeymoon basically ends on
Tuesday -- about

32:13.131 --> 32:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
midnight of election night.

32:14.900 --> 32:18.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is no agreement on who we
are as a people,
what we ought to do as a people.

32:18.937 --> 32:23.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would just say, if this is
where we're
going in this campaign -- it's
obviously where

32:23.575 --> 32:29.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he is and where he continues to
go -- but
if she goes that way, and just
to drive him

32:29.214 --> 32:32.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
down further, it's going to be a
terrible,
terrible result.

32:32.684 --> 32:36.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I also do think
one has to -- and
she wasn't too guilty of this, I
don't think.

32:36.421 --> 32:40.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One has to continually
distinguish between
Trump and the Trump supporters.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's too easy to say, oh,
they're all
a bunch of racists.

32:41.827 --> 32:42.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Which is -- we
don't know.

32:44.462 --> 32:46.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's probably -- it's not
true in our
experience.

32:46.131 --> 32:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's not fair.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: It's unfair.

32:49.868 --> 32:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think my answer has
always been,
he's the wrong answer to a right
question,

32:51.903 --> 32:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a lot of people feel a lot
of anxiety.

32:54.072 --> 32:56.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They feel they have lost
dignity, they have
lost a role.

32:56.741 --> 33:02.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sometimes, in those cases,
they do go
to a little ethnic tribal fear.

33:02.681 --> 33:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the way to ease that fear is
not to say,
oh, they're all a bunch of
racists.

33:07.252 --> 33:10.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's not guilty of that,
but it's something
that is floating around in the
conversation.

33:10.255 --> 33:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, she did a
pretty good
job of separating, tactically
and strategically,

33:14.926 --> 33:20.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Republican Party, the Paul
Ryans, the
Bob Doles, the John McCains,
that he's an

33:20.799 --> 33:22.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aberration, he's an anomaly.

33:22.267 --> 33:25.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I thought that was a
well-crafted part of
the speech.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk a
little bit
about immigration.

33:27.372 --> 33:29.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a Trump supporter, you
call it a
pivot.

33:29.174 --> 33:35.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're a critic, you say this
is a flip-flop,
but what to make of this
particular change

33:35.247 --> 33:37.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in his stance?

33:37.148 --> 33:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well, the
change -- the
fact that he's changing stance
is not surprising,

33:41.019 --> 33:43.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the man has a severe
problem with
impulse control.

33:43.688 --> 33:47.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that he was consistent
for a little
while is the odd situation for
him.

33:47.492 --> 33:50.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The only thing he's been
consistent upon is
narcissism so far.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this was him responding
to different
audiences.

33:53.965 --> 33:59.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a new campaign team comes
in, and they
look at a bunch of poll numbers,
and they

33:59.170 --> 34:02.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see he's not doing well, and
he's especially
not doing well among moderate
Republicans.

34:03.008 --> 34:05.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are not doing well among
Latinos.

34:05.076 --> 34:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there is this very crude
pander both
on him saying he will be great
for African-Americans,

34:09.748 --> 34:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then on the immigration, the
pander.

34:11.616 --> 34:14.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the crudity of it is what is
so striking.

34:14.886 --> 34:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's a guy who actually -- to
the extent
that people really did like him,
or do like

34:18.790 --> 34:21.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him, it's because he speaks his
mind.

34:21.526 --> 34:26.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to throw that away on such a
blatant flip-flop
is a sign not just that he made
some strategic

34:26.498 --> 34:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pivot or something.

34:28.300 --> 34:34.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a sign that he has
attention span problems,
and that he has -- he just wants
to please

34:34.739 --> 34:37.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whatever audience he happens to
be in front
of at that moment.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is just not a lot of
competency
he has shown.

34:39.844 --> 34:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: The defense of
Donald Trump
consistently has been, look, he
may be a bully,

34:44.149 --> 34:49.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he may be a blowhard, but at
least you know
where he stands, he's not your
typical politician.

34:49.788 --> 34:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You get -- he is who he says he
is.

34:53.158 --> 34:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he turns out not to be who
he says he
is.

34:55.627 --> 35:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He began the campaign, that was
the raison
d'etre for his candidacy was
building the

35:00.332 --> 35:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wall, and rounding up these 12
million undocumented
immigrants, or illegals, as he
called them,

35:05.603 --> 35:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and banishing them to the outer
darkness of
the netherworld, or wherever.

35:09.808 --> 35:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now -- now the ban on all
Muslims was
just a suggestion, he says.

35:16.848 --> 35:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now he's backing off on this.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, what is it?

35:21.152 --> 35:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, I'm always skeptical
about motives,
but I have to look at it and
say, Mitt Romney

35:26.758 --> 35:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carried white women by 56 to 42
over Barack
Obama for his vote.

35:32.397 --> 35:38.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's getting murdered among
white women right
now, especially college-educated
white women.

35:38.670 --> 35:39.738 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

35:39.771 --> 35:41.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Because he is who he is.

35:41.673 --> 35:45.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's an embarrassment to say
you're for
Donald Trump.

35:45.610 --> 35:46.945 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You can't do it.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't look at your kids in
self-respect.

35:48.813 --> 35:56.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, to make him somehow, I think
-- make them
less uncomfortable in somehow
supporting him,

35:56.321 --> 36:00.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's a vote to try and
appeal to the
moderate Republicans David's
talking about

36:00.925 --> 36:01.893 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to come home.

36:01.926 --> 36:03.261 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It's OK.

36:03.294 --> 36:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's really not as bad as we
thought he was
or he seemed to be.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
See, he's really moderating.

36:08.199 --> 36:09.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
To me, that's what this...

36:10.001 --> 36:12.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: In this cosmos of
Trump bashing,
I feel like I want to say some
nice thing

36:12.771 --> 36:14.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about Donald Trump.

36:14.539 --> 36:17.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Wollman ice rink in
Central Park,
which he built, is a fantastic
ice rink.

36:17.575 --> 36:18.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: It is.

36:18.576 --> 36:19.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he built it when it wasn't
being built.

36:19.811 --> 36:20.779 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

36:22.547 --> 36:23.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
let's try to
get through a couple of
non-Trump-related

36:23.214 --> 36:24.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
topics then.

36:24.215 --> 36:26.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: OK.

36:26.051 --> 36:28.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Bernie
Sanders' new political
organization about the
revolution had a bit

36:28.453 --> 36:30.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a rocky start.

36:30.388 --> 36:33.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A bunch of his aides decided to
leave en masse
because they were concerned
about the direction

36:33.958 --> 36:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it was going and who was
leading it.

36:35.960 --> 36:41.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does this mean the end of the
revolution,
or is this just a step?

36:41.232 --> 36:45.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: This means that
putting together
an organization after a campaign
based on

36:45.937 --> 36:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a campaign is always difficult.

36:48.440 --> 36:52.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's frequently attempted,
rarely pulled off.

36:52.777 --> 36:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I don't think there is any
question that
constituency is still there.

36:55.847 --> 36:57.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is very much a change
election.

36:57.615 --> 36:59.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a change -- you heard it
in Judy's
piece.

36:59.918 --> 37:00.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People want a change.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is not a status quo
election.

37:02.887 --> 37:08.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is that Trump, we
mentioned him,
represents a change that is
chaos to people

37:08.259 --> 37:09.227 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and scary.

37:09.260 --> 37:10.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with Sanders, when you get
an outsider,
you're not going to get --
you're usually

37:12.997 --> 37:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not going to get a lot of
competence.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What you want are insider's
competence with
an outsider's perspective.

37:17.435 --> 37:19.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's a rarity.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, when you get somebody
who has not
been in the system, just putting
together

37:21.573 --> 37:24.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organizations, a lot of the
management stuff
has not been their bailiwick.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

37:25.343 --> 37:27.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Howard Dean did a
pretty good
job after 2004.

37:27.245 --> 37:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
syndicated columnist
Mark Shields, New York Times
columnist David

37:32.417 --> 37:36.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Brooks, thank you both.

37:36.921 --> 37:41.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

HARI SREENIVASAN: The Syrian
conflict is in
its fifth year, making Jordan
home to more

37:48.399 --> 37:54.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
than 1.3 million Syrian
refugees, many struggling
with trauma and the
psychological costs of

37:54.973 --> 37:56.708 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

37:56.741 --> 38:00.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
With fewer than 100
psychologists in Jordan,
doctors and social workers are
struggling

38:00.445 --> 38:02.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to fill the mental health care
gap.

38:02.647 --> 38:05.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
University of California
Berkeley journalism
students bring us this story.

38:05.917 --> 38:10.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's narrated by Lacy Jane
Roberts.

38:10.121 --> 38:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: The war in
Syria led Nisreen
Katbi to flee her home country
four years

38:22.567 --> 38:24.235 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

38:24.269 --> 38:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now she runs a center in Amman,
Jordan, that
cares for refugees fleeing from
Syria.

38:28.773 --> 38:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're recovering from the
trauma of war.

38:31.509 --> 38:37.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Souriyat Across Borders is a
home away from
home for refugees suffering from
both physical

38:37.215 --> 38:39.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and emotional disabilities.

38:39.717 --> 38:44.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They get rehabilitative care and
live full-time
at the center, all free of
charge.

38:44.756 --> 38:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NISREEN KHAZNA KATBI, Souriyat
Across Borders:
This is where they have their
physical therapy

38:49.160 --> 38:50.929 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
training.

38:50.962 --> 38:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: Nisreen and
her staff care
for a rotating group of 30 men,
women, and

38:55.033 --> 38:56.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
children.

38:56.901 --> 39:00.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The residents can stay at the
center until
they're rehabilitated, after
which many return

39:00.171 --> 39:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to their families in war-torn
Syria.

39:03.441 --> 39:08.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Nisreen sees people with
amputations, spinal
cord injuries, and head traumas.

39:08.379 --> 39:11.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But she says the injuries aren't
only physical.

39:11.082 --> 39:18.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NISREEN KHAZNA KATBI: They faced
some frightening
situations, like the bombings,
the killing,

39:18.790 --> 39:22.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
losing their limbs or had these
severe injuries.

39:22.093 --> 39:27.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: But Souriyat
Across Borders
has no full-time mental health
professionals

39:27.098 --> 39:28.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on staff.

39:28.766 --> 39:32.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, when a mental health
training project
run by a group of
California-based doctors

39:32.704 --> 39:36.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
came to Amman, Nisreen signed
up.

39:36.374 --> 39:44.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Saad Shakir leads CPR, or
Care Program
for Refugees.

39:44.816 --> 39:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At first, CPR's goal was to give
direct mental
health care to Syrian refugees,
but after

39:50.021 --> 39:55.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seeing the overwhelming number
of people needing
help, they instead began
offering mental health

39:55.493 --> 40:02.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
first aid training to
clinicians, counselors,
teachers, and even legal
consultants, anyone

40:02.333 --> 40:03.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who works with refugees.

40:03.334 --> 40:05.036 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:05.069 --> 40:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAAD SHAKIR, Care Program for
Refugees: While
being a physician, I'm a
humanitarian.

40:08.106 --> 40:12.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, seeing all the devastation
going on, it's
like I want to have an impact in
a positive

40:12.944 --> 40:14.746 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

40:14.779 --> 40:19.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: Dr. Atef
Al-Qasem is CPR's
on-the-ground partner and
training manager

40:19.083 --> 40:22.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for the Noor Al-Hussein
Foundation's Institute
for Family Health.

40:23.021 --> 40:28.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was eager to partner with Dr.
Shakir after
seeing an increase of refugees
needing quality

40:28.526 --> 40:29.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mental health care.

40:29.527 --> 40:31.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ATEF AL-QASEM, Noor Al-Hussein
Foundation
Institute for Family Health
(through translator):

40:33.398 --> 40:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The goal of the training is to
have anyone
dealing with refugees be able to
provide psychological

40:35.767 --> 40:40.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first aid; 19 percent of people
we see have
been victims of torture.

40:40.305 --> 40:43.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We also see PTSD, depression,
anxiety.

40:43.708 --> 40:45.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All of them need immediately
treatment.

40:45.610 --> 40:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: Dr. Al-Qasem
says that
it is hard to provide individual
treatment,

40:50.982 --> 40:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with so many patients and so few
professionals.

40:53.951 --> 41:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he is encouraging caretakers
and mental
health workers to apply group
therapy.

41:00.892 --> 41:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At their field clinic in the
Zaatari refugee
camp, the counselors with the
Noor Al-Hussein

41:06.030 --> 41:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Foundation try to see as many
people as possible
in group therapy.

41:09.667 --> 41:14.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The camp is one of the biggest
in the world,
home to 70,000 refugees.

41:14.272 --> 41:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Am Sanad Al-Badi works as a
counselor in the
camp, where he says he confronts
mental health

41:19.310 --> 41:21.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stigmas.

41:21.212 --> 41:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AM SANAD AL-BADI, Counselor
(through translator):
We have a mobile team which make
visits to

41:23.081 --> 41:28.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees to talk about the need
of psychosocial
counseling because the
psychological support

41:28.286 --> 41:30.021 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is necessary.

41:30.054 --> 41:33.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: Once
individuals start
coming to group therapy,
counselors help them

41:33.291 --> 41:35.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cope with trauma and loss.

41:35.193 --> 41:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AM SANAD AL-BADI (through
translator): Common
trauma we see is loss trauma.

41:39.230 --> 41:43.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I ask them to remember their
happy memories
and encourage positive thinking
about the

41:43.668 --> 41:45.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

41:45.503 --> 41:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: Back in
Amman, Doctors
Without Borders is treating
refugees who have

41:49.073 --> 41:53.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been physically disfigured from
Syria, Yemen,
and Iraq.

41:53.177 --> 41:58.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dr. Gwenola Ghanes manages the
hospital's
mental health program.

41:58.082 --> 42:02.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says there is no way to
predict how people
will react to a traumatic event.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.322 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENOLA GHANES, Doctors Without
Borders: On
a psychological point of view,
there is no

42:07.592 --> 42:08.793 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rules.

42:08.826 --> 42:11.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not a mathematical
equation.

42:11.396 --> 42:18.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the people will develop
symptoms such
as depression or anxiety
disorder, and a small

42:18.469 --> 42:20.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
percentage of PTSD.

42:20.204 --> 42:25.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: Children
especially can
be affected by the trauma of
war.

42:25.543 --> 42:28.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Talha Al-Ali is a pediatric
counselor.

42:28.312 --> 42:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He works with young victims to
rebuild trust.

42:31.315 --> 42:33.084 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

42:33.117 --> 42:34.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TALHA AL-ALI, Pediatric
Counselor: They start
at the beginning to have the
small social

42:34.485 --> 42:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
networks while playing or while
doing activities
together.

42:37.789 --> 42:42.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, a child will start to
adapt again with
building relationships, and
especially to

42:42.860 --> 42:44.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
build trustful relationships.

42:44.862 --> 42:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But to protect them from the
trauma, no one
will be able to protect them
while they are

42:50.101 --> 42:51.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
living in a war.

42:52.003 --> 42:55.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: After the
training, Nisreen
Katbi says she will be able to
provide better

42:56.007 --> 42:57.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care for the patient-residents.

42:57.809 --> 43:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NISREEN KHAZNA KATBI: I have
learned how to
deal with certain cases, like if
he is having

43:05.082 --> 43:12.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
constant nightmares, or if he is
aggressive
in a certain way or depressed.

43:12.056 --> 43:16.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: Dr. Ghanes
agrees that,
while this kind of training is
useful, much

43:16.961 --> 43:18.129 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more is needed.

43:18.162 --> 43:19.163 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

43:19.197 --> 43:20.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWENOLA GHANES: It's useful, but
it's not
enough.

43:20.865 --> 43:25.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On a humanitarian point of view,
we need to
train a lot of people in a short
time.

43:25.937 --> 43:29.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: CPR hopes to
return to
Amman once a year.

43:29.907 --> 43:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Nisreen hopes she will
eventually be able
to train her whole staff.

43:33.377 --> 43:37.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NISREEN KHAZNA KATBI: This is
the most important
thing for us to do.

43:37.448 --> 43:42.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to raise an awareness
about how to
deal with victims of war.

43:42.787 --> 43:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LACY JANE ROBERTS: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm Lacy Jane Roberts in Amman,
Jordan.

43:54.365 --> 44:05.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lionfish have
voracious
appetites that are upsetting
coral reef ecosystems

44:05.142 --> 44:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from Rhode Island to Venezuela.

44:07.211 --> 44:11.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a new nonprofit company has
an unusual
plan to restore balance to those
environments

44:11.749 --> 44:13.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before it's too late.

44:13.551 --> 44:17.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the latest edition of our
online series
"ScienceScope," science producer
Nsikan Akpan

44:17.154 --> 44:18.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has the scoop.

44:18.189 --> 44:21.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The lionfish is an
invasive
species.

44:21.425 --> 44:23.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's also Darwin's nightmare.

44:23.861 --> 44:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In its native home of the
Indo-Pacific, the
lionfish is a fierce,
unrelenting predator.

44:28.599 --> 44:34.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the mid-1980s, exotic pets,
including lionfish,
became popular in the U.S.
Scientists suspect

44:34.372 --> 44:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pet owners eventually dumped
their adult lionfish
in the Atlantic.

44:37.608 --> 44:41.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The lionfish now threatens
ecosystems up and
down the Atlantic.

44:41.646 --> 44:42.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But they should watch out.

44:42.647 --> 44:45.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A new robot is entering the
fray.

44:45.182 --> 44:51.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Meet the lionfish terminator.

44:51.923 --> 45:06.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To learn about this robot, we
traveled here
to Bermuda, where we teamed up
with the Nekton

45:06.037 --> 45:07.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mission.

45:07.872 --> 45:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This 30 scientific organizations
and companies
wants to conduct one of the
largest marine

45:12.476 --> 45:14.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
life surveys in history.

45:14.145 --> 45:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OLIVER STEEDS, Mission Director,
Nekton: These
divers are the first 1,900
meters.

45:17.381 --> 45:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then these extraordinary
submersibles
go down even further.

45:19.650 --> 45:24.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have adapted some with some
of the latest
filming and scientific
equipment, so, we can

45:24.288 --> 45:28.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sample, we can study, and we can
research,
as welcome as taking scientists
down into

45:28.092 --> 45:29.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those depths.

45:29.594 --> 45:32.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Of the earth's
oceans, only
5 percent have been explored.

45:32.563 --> 45:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means we know more about
the moon than
the water that covers 70 percent
of the Earth.

45:36.934 --> 45:42.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Nekton wants to fill the
knowledge gap by
making a baseline measurement of
ocean health.

45:42.473 --> 45:48.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's because our are facing
threats, including
the spread of invasive species
like the lionfish.

45:48.746 --> 45:53.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chris Flook is a collector of
marine specimens
for the Bermuda Aquarium Museum
and Zoo.

45:53.417 --> 45:57.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was one of the first to
notice the
region's lionfish invasion 16
years ago.

CHRIS FLOOK, Bermuda Aquarium
Museum and Zoo:
But then very quickly, I started
to notes

46:00.524 --> 46:04.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, over time, we were losing
small fish
from these areas where I
traditionally went

46:04.395 --> 46:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and found lots of small juvenile
fish.

46:06.030 --> 46:09.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And lionfish were becoming more
and more common.

46:09.166 --> 46:13.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, by about 2007, we actually
started a culling
program in Bermuda to tackle
these invasive

46:13.738 --> 46:15.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
species.

46:15.539 --> 46:18.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Now known as the
Bermuda Lionfish
Task Force, the team holds daily
dives and

46:18.542 --> 46:21.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fishing tournaments to rid their
waters of
these invaders.

46:21.545 --> 46:26.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Its members consist of
recreational swimmers,
professional divers and even
local scientists

46:26.083 --> 46:27.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like Dr. Gretchen
Goodbody-Gringley.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:29.320 --> 46:30.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRETCHEN GOODBODY-GRINGLEY,
Bermuda Institute
of Ocean Sciences: The lionfish
are a threat

46:30.855 --> 46:33.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the ecosystem because, first
and foremost,
they're voracious predators.

46:33.057 --> 46:39.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they consume an exorbitant
amount of food,
more than any other potential
predator out

46:39.764 --> 46:42.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
there right now.

46:42.867 --> 46:49.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All of the white part is
solidified fat, because
it's unique to lionfish that
they overconsume,

46:49.707 --> 46:53.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the point that they get fatty
liver disease.

46:53.277 --> 46:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: This is because
smaller fish
in this region don't recognize
the lionfish

46:57.648 --> 46:58.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a threat.

46:58.649 --> 47:01.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They swim right up to it and get
gobbled up.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Basically, the lionfish just
opens its mouth.

47:03.988 --> 47:09.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a big dilemma, because the
task force
can tackle lionfish only in
shallow water.

47:09.593 --> 47:14.999 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
But in Bermuda,
Goodbody-Gringley has found
most lionfish live 200 feet
below the surface.

47:15.032 --> 47:18.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That depth is largely
inaccessible to the
average sport diver.

47:18.369 --> 47:21.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's not too deep for a
robot.

47:21.472 --> 47:25.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Goodbody-Gringley and Nekton
have teamed with
a new nonprofit called RISE, or
Robots in

47:25.543 --> 47:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Service of the Environment,
that is developing
a lionfish-hunting robot.

47:29.213 --> 47:31.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GEOFFREY GARDNER, Robots in the
Service of
the Environment: The leading
candidate is

47:31.082 --> 47:36.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
based on an electrofishing
techniques, where
if you put the lionfish between
two electrodes

47:36.454 --> 47:41.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and apply an electric current,
that current
voltage kills the lionfish or
stuns the lionfish.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The device is in
its development
stage.

47:43.994 --> 47:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And dive teams are testing how
lionfish might
react to a robot arm with two
metal electrode

47:48.599 --> 47:49.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
plates.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The lionfish have few predators
in the Atlantic.

47:52.403 --> 47:55.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As a result, they're not
conditioned to flee
anything.

47:55.172 --> 48:00.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Notice here, when the probe
approaches from
behind, the lionfish stay still.

48:00.177 --> 48:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saltwater is highly conductive,
so it should
act almost like a straight wire
between two

48:04.615 --> 48:05.883 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
electrodes.

48:05.916 --> 48:08.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That should keep other nearby
fish from being
stunned.

48:08.586 --> 48:11.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But is the mass killing of
lionfish ethical?

48:11.722 --> 48:14.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The lionfish is a pest, but it's
also a living
creature.

48:14.925 --> 48:17.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We spoke with ocean ecologist
James Morris.

48:17.328 --> 48:22.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MORRIS, Ocean Ecologist:
We harvest
fish all over the U.S. and the
planet.

48:22.333 --> 48:28.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't think there is
really any ethical
issues with, you know, utilizing
the resource.

48:28.706 --> 48:34.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if we're looking for an
ethical question,
it's one around introducing
non-native species

48:34.278 --> 48:38.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the impact that it has on
the region and
specifically the biodiversity.

48:38.482 --> 48:39.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: That's it for now.

48:39.917 --> 48:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm Nsikan Akpan, and this is
"ScienceScope"
from the "PBS NewsHour."

48:44.488 --> 48:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares.

48:55.699 --> 49:02.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, an update to a story we
brought you
earlier this year.

49:02.106 --> 49:07.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last June, Darius Nabors set out
to visit
all 59 national parks in 59
weeks to commemorate

49:07.611 --> 49:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Park Service's centennial
anniversary.

49:09.780 --> 49:14.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spoke with Nabors on the
National Mall
recently, as he prepared to
finish his tour

49:14.251 --> 49:16.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Maine's Acadia National Park
this week.

49:16.854 --> 49:19.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DARIUS NABORS, Visiting National
Parks: My
name is Darius Nabors, and I'm
visiting all

49:19.890 --> 49:21.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
59 national parks in 59 weeks.

49:21.892 --> 49:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been a little crazy.

49:23.594 --> 49:28.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have essentially been all over
the country
visiting all the national parks,
and just

49:28.199 --> 49:29.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spending time in beautiful
places.

49:29.967 --> 49:34.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I like to say that I traded
the modern
conveniences of life, like a
microwave and

49:34.438 --> 49:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a coffee maker and things like
that, for beautiful
sunrises, beautiful sunsets and
just beautiful

49:39.243 --> 49:41.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
views of our country.

49:41.078 --> 49:46.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most recently, kind of coming
west, I went
from Badlands National Park in
South Dakota,

49:46.116 --> 49:50.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Hot Springs in Arkansas,
mammoth cave in
Kentucky, and then all the way
down to Florida,

49:50.521 --> 49:55.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where there's Biscayne National
Park, Everglades
National Park, and Dry Tortugas
National Park.

49:55.626 --> 50:01.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's additionally a park in
the U.S. Virgin
Islands, so we did have to go
out there.

50:01.599 --> 50:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They actually have an underwater
trail.

50:03.400 --> 50:07.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they have little signs that
are kind of
put down into the ground that
when you're

50:07.905 --> 50:09.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
snorkeling, you can pass over
them.

50:09.907 --> 50:13.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The thing I love about the parks
is there's
such -- well, it showcases the
diversity of

50:13.644 --> 50:15.980 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country in terms of geology
or environment.

50:16.013 --> 50:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so those underwater ones are
just totally
different.

50:18.916 --> 50:19.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You get to see alligators.

50:19.917 --> 50:20.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You get to see fish.

50:20.918 --> 50:22.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You get to see manatees.

50:22.686 --> 50:25.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're going to Acadia last
for our 59th
park, and it's one that I
haven't been to,

50:25.789 --> 50:27.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so I'm very excited about that.

50:27.825 --> 50:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They always say you got to watch
a sunrise
on Cadillac Mountain, so I will
go and do

50:30.961 --> 50:32.596 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

50:32.630 --> 50:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first one on the East
Coast, and
so it's kind of special in that
sense.

50:35.933 --> 50:39.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I think, for the trip,
it's been
a trip of going to bed and
waking up with

50:39.770 --> 50:40.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the sun.

50:40.971 --> 50:43.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's just going to be
another beautiful
sunrise.

50:43.407 --> 50:45.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's wonderful that we have all
59 of these
parks.

50:45.876 --> 50:49.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I always say that, if you can
get Congress
to agree on something, like the
beauty of

50:49.046 --> 50:51.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a natural place, then it means
it's pretty
special.

50:51.582 --> 50:55.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I'm just super thankful
that we have
set aside these places for other
people to

50:55.853 --> 50:56.787 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enjoy.

50:56.820 --> 50:57.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just get out there and see it.

50:58.022 --> 50:59.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't have to go camp in the
backcountry,
like I do.

50:59.823 --> 51:02.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what I love, but I think
it's important
for other people to do the
things that they

51:02.860 --> 51:04.561 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
love.

51:04.595 --> 51:06.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If they want to go to an
overlook and look
there, if they want to go and do
a hike, if

51:06.463 --> 51:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they want to spend time with
family or friends,
I think that's the wonderful
part about the

51:10.000 --> 51:16.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parks, is it provides so many
experiences
for so many people to enjoy it
in ways that

51:16.907 --> 51:18.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they like.
