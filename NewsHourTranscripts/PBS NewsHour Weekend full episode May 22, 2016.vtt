NOT APPROVED BY THE CONGRESS.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE MOVING

03:24.633 --> 03:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANUFACTURING FROM CHINA WHICH

03:26.733 --> 03:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD BEEN BOOMING FOR A NUMBER OF

03:28.633 --> 03:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS TO VIETNAM BASED ON LOWER

CHAINS.

03:33.467 --> 03:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THE

03:34.900 --> 03:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT IS SAYING LOOK THIS IS

03:36.300 --> 03:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TREND THAT IS UNDERWAY.

03:37.433 --> 03:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF U.S. MANUFACTURING HAS

BEEN OFFSHORE IN CHINA AND

03:41.100 --> 03:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WE WANT TO BE IN PLAY IN VIETNAM

03:44.067 --> 03:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND U.S. COMPANIES ARE

03:45.133 --> 03:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONDING SAYING YES IT MAKES

03:47.367 --> 03:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENSE, THE TRADE DEAL WOULD

03:50.733 --> 03:53.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOWER TARIFFS ON SHOES AND

03:53.067 --> 03:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPAREL AND TEXTILES.

03:54.333 --> 03:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY NOT GET IN WITH VIETNAM, AND

03:57.300 --> 03:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIETNAM'S ECONOMY IS POISED TO

03:58.500 --> 03:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVE ON THIS.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS TRADE DEAL COULD DO

04:01.333 --> 04:03.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AND THAT COULD LOWER PRICES

04:03.667 --> 04:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR U.S. CONSUMERS IF IT'S

04:05.933 --> 04:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EASIER TO MAKE THE TARIFFS

04:07.133 --> 04:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOWER.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROBLEM IS THAT A LOT OF

04:10.067 --> 04:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIONS AND LABOR ORGANIZATIONS

04:11.333 --> 04:12.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE UNITED STATES ARE SAYING

04:12.567 --> 04:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE BEEN DECIMATED BY THIS

04:15.300 --> 04:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFSHORING IN MANUFACTURING AND

04:16.433 --> 04:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WILL MAKE IT WORSE.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE PEOPLE SAYING BOTH

04:19.000 --> 04:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIDES THERE'S BENEFITS FOR THE

04:20.700 --> 04:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. AND VIETNAM AND THE U.S. IS

04:22.133 --> 04:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THAT IS A WAY TO DRAW

04:24.733 --> 04:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIETNAM CLOSER AND RAISE LABOR

04:27.567 --> 04:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS IN

VIETNAM AND OTHER COUNTRIES AS

04:30.700 --> 04:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF THE DEAL.

04:31.800 --> 04:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE ARMS

04:34.067 --> 04:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBARGO.

04:34.433 --> 04:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF IT IS LIFTED WHAT GUARANTEE

04:36.467 --> 04:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THE UNITED STATES HAVE THAT

04:38.400 --> 04:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIETNAM WILL ADDRESS HUMAN

04:40.533 --> 04:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHTS ABUSES FOR EXAMPLE?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THERE IS NO GREAT

04:44.033 --> 04:44.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUARANTEES.

04:44.767 --> 04:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE QUESTION IS BOTH ON THE ARMS

04:47.667 --> 04:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBARGO AS THE TRADE DEAL AND

04:49.433 --> 04:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRADE DEAL THEY GOT A

04:51.033 --> 04:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEPARATE AGREEMENT WITH VIETNAM

04:53.133 --> 04:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFYING SPECIFIC MEASURES

04:54.367 --> 04:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WOULD TAKE TO PROTECT LABOR

04:55.733 --> 04:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WORKERS.

04:56.633 --> 04:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMAN RIGHTS IT'S FREE SPEECH

04:59.300 --> 05:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND VIETNAM HAS SHOWN EFFORT AND

05:01.633 --> 05:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREED A POLITICAL PRISONER ON

05:03.400 --> 05:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EVE OF THE PRESIDENT COMING

05:04.600 --> 05:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE BUT THE U.S. WANTS TO SEE

05:06.733 --> 05:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE AND THERE'S PRESSURE IN THE

05:08.067 --> 05:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES NOT TO LIFT THE

05:10.300 --> 05:12.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBARGO AMONG HUMAN RIGHTS

05:12.000 --> 05:12.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUPS.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SAW THE AIDES COME HERE LAST

05:14.867 --> 05:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEK TO SEE WHETHER VIETNAM WAS

05:16.067 --> 05:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
READY.

05:16.967 --> 05:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY LIFTED PART OF THE EMBARGO

05:19.100 --> 05:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO YEARS AGO BASED ON MARITIME

05:21.033 --> 05:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE

05:23.367 --> 05:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT IS HAPPENING

05:24.533 --> 05:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE CHINESE NAVY.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NOW THERE IS A QUESTION

05:27.433 --> 05:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THIS IS A BROADER

05:29.200 --> 05:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBARGO.

05:30.133 --> 05:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU MIGHT SEE POTENTIAL LIFTING

05:32.733 --> 05:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING THAT WILL TAKE TIME

05:34.300 --> 05:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER TIME TO SORT OF SEE HOW

05:38.833 --> 05:40.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIETNAM MAKES PROGRESS ON HUMAN

05:40.067 --> 05:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHTS AND IF THEY DON'T, MAYBE

05:43.100 --> 05:45.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WILL NOT SELL CERTAIN TYPES

05:45.067 --> 05:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WEAPONS.

05:45.800 --> 05:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN IF THEY ANNOUNCE A LIFTING

05:48.967 --> 05:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE EMBARGO IT COULD TAKE

05:51.133 --> 05:52.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEVERAL YEARS FOR THE DEFENSIVE

05:52.867 --> 05:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEAPONS TO BE ACTUALLY

05:54.533 --> 05:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXCHANGED.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WOULD GIVE THE U.S. NOT

05:57.533 --> 05:59.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY THIS ADMINISTRATION BUT A

05:59.967 --> 06:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCCESSOR TIME TO JUDGE WHETHER

06:01.733 --> 06:03.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIETNAM MOVED ENOUGH.

06:19.633 --> 06:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKELY" MANSOUR WAS KILLED, BUT

06:20.900 --> 06:22.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT COULD BE A FEW DAYS BEFORE

06:22.000 --> 06:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S. HAD THE EVIDENCE

06:22.700 --> 06:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMING THAT.

06:24.300 --> 06:25.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE ATTACK AUTHORIZED BY

06:32.367 --> 06:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT OBAMA VIOLATED ITS

06:33.067 --> 06:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:38.467 --> 06:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

JENNIFER TELL US MORE ABOUT WHO

06:59.067 --> 06:59.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS WITHIN THE HIERARCHY OF

06:59.867 --> 07:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TALIBAN?

07:01.200 --> 07:02.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE WAS A TALIBAN LEADER HE

07:02.067 --> 07:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK OVER LAST SUMMER.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS A BIT OF A CONTROVERSY

07:04.867 --> 07:05.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WHEN HE TOOK OVER AFTER

07:05.967 --> 07:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT OMAR HAD

07:07.733 --> 07:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN DEAD FOR TWO YEARS, THERE

07:10.167 --> 07:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A BIT OF A POWER STRUGGLE

07:11.967 --> 07:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DIVISION AMONG THE TALIBAN

07:14.100 --> 07:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER MANSOUR THEY TOOK

07:15.533 --> 07:16.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRITORY IN AFGHANISTAN AND

07:16.467 --> 07:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY TOOK HINDUS FOR A FEW DAYS

07:18.500 --> 07:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRST TIME THEY HAVE BEEN

07:24.033 --> 07:26.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABLE TO TAKE A CITY THAT SIZE

07:26.200 --> 07:28.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFGHANISTAN'S FIFTH LARGEST

07:28.067 --> 07:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY.

07:31.633 --> 07:34.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CONTROL MORE TERRITORY AND

07:34.167 --> 07:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTEST MORE TERRITORY THAN THEY

07:35.533 --> 07:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE SINCE 2001.

07:37.633 --> 07:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO UNDER THE TALIBAN REALLY SAW

07:41.300 --> 07:44.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A RESURGENCE AND STRENGTH.

07:44.167 --> 07:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY WERE FRACTURED.

07:49.633 --> 07:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHY WOULD THE OBAMA

07:50.967 --> 07:52.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER HIM A

07:52.067 --> 07:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORTHY TARGET WORTH SENDING

07:53.300 --> 07:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRONES AFTER?

07:54.800 --> 07:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> PRESIDENT OBAMA MADE THE

07:56.067 --> 07:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORDER HIMSELF.

07:57.933 --> 07:59.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORMALLY THE AMERICAN FORCES

07:59.267 --> 08:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANNOT TARGET THE TALIBAN AND I

08:00.800 --> 08:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASKED THAT QUESTION AND THEY

08:02.600 --> 08:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADE THE DECISION BECAUSE HE AND

08:04.533 --> 08:07.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS FIGHTERS WERE PLANNING

08:07.167 --> 08:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKS AGAINST AFGHAN FORCES

08:10.133 --> 08:13.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AMERICAN FORCES AND

08:13.367 --> 08:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEREFORE WERE A THREAT TO U.S.

08:15.467 --> 08:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES.

08:16.433 --> 08:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IS THE JUSTIFICATION

08:17.333 --> 08:18.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY USED FOR THE DRONE STRIKE

08:18.467 --> 08:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT KILLED HIM.

08:24.133 --> 08:24.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT DOES THIS DRONE STRIKE

08:24.967 --> 08:26.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE DEATH MEAN FOR THE PEACE

08:26.567 --> 08:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKS AND THE PEACE PROCESS?

08:28.000 --> 08:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT IS THE BIG QUESTION

08:29.367 --> 08:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW.

08:30.900 --> 08:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH THE PEACE

08:31.667 --> 08:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCESS, HOW WILL THINGS GO FROM

08:32.700 --> 08:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW ON?

08:34.067 --> 08:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF

08:37.200 --> 08:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY SAID IN AFGHANISTAN

08:38.033 --> 08:38.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY HE HOPES THAT IT WILL

08:38.967 --> 08:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRING THE TALIBAN INTO THE PEACE

08:40.767 --> 08:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCESS.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT WILL

08:42.600 --> 08:44.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN NOW.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THERE WILL BE A POWER

08:45.500 --> 08:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRUGGLE TO SEE WHO REPLACES HIM

08:48.300 --> 08:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHETHER THE TALIBAN WILL

08:49.633 --> 08:50.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINUE FIGHTING AS THEY HAVE

08:50.667 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE AFGHAN FORCES TAKING

08:54.033 --> 08:56.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PUNISHING CASUALTIES ACROSS THE

08:56.433 --> 08:56.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT THE PEACE PROCESS WILL

08:58.567 --> 08:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
