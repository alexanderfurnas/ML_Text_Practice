JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first, say
New Hampshire,
and most people in the political
world think

00:04.438 --> 00:08.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first-in-the-nation primary,
coming up February
9.

00:08.108 --> 00:13.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, these days, there's
another, more disturbing
distinction for the Granite
State, the expectation

00:13.981 --> 00:19.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that last year's fatal drug
overdoses will
hit a record 400 deaths.

00:19.920 --> 00:26.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, presidential candidates
and state political
leaders gathered for a forum to
tackle addiction

00:26.293 --> 00:28.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the growing heroin crisis.

00:28.362 --> 00:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I traveled to New Hampshire last
month to
get a firsthand look at the
epidemic and its

00:33.166 --> 00:35.402 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
repercussions.

00:35.435 --> 00:40.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like the rest of the country,
New Hampshire
has long grappled with its share
of drug abuse.

00:40.140 --> 00:48.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the past few years, the
easy availability
of cheap heroin and fentanyl,
another opiate,

00:48.181 --> 00:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has exploded into a crisis that
leaders in
both parties say needs urgent
attention.

00:53.487 --> 00:57.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MAGGIE HASSAN (D), New
Hampshire: The
opioid epidemic is really our
most pressing

00:57.891 --> 01:00.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
public health and public safety
issue right
now.

01:00.594 --> 01:03.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA SYTEK (R), Former New
Hampshire House
Speaker: Drug abuse has always
been a challenge

01:03.196 --> 01:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for New Hampshire, but, with the
opioid crisis,
it has reached epic proportions.

01:07.401 --> 01:13.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Democrats like
Governor Maggie
Hassan and Republicans like the
former Speaker

01:13.540 --> 01:19.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the State Assembly Donna
Sytek agree the
state was slow to recognize what
was happening

01:19.980 --> 01:23.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in front of everyone's eyes.

01:23.216 --> 01:28.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's no mistaking it here
at HOPE for
New Hampshire, where the
holidays mean no

01:28.388 --> 01:31.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
slowdown in people needing help
on their road
to recovery.

01:31.892 --> 01:36.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOLLY CEKALA, Hope for New
Hampshire: Some
people are staying busy,
connecting with their

01:36.463 --> 01:38.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
peers, staying in recovery.

01:38.365 --> 01:43.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The center
provides nonclinical
support for men and women coping
with an alcohol

01:44.004 --> 01:49.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or drug addiction that in many
cases started
with a painkiller prescribed by
a physician.

01:49.576 --> 01:55.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOLLY CEKALA: You can be tall,
short, white,
black. You could speak English,
you could

01:55.115 --> 02:03.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not. You could be a CEO or you
could be a
homeless vet. And it really just
doesn't discriminate.

02:03.323 --> 02:09.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Director of
recovery supports,
Holly Cekala, herself in
long-term recovery,

02:10.030 --> 02:15.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told us the center was created
in response
to a growing need in New
Hampshire's largest

02:15.435 --> 02:17.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
city, Manchester.

02:17.237 --> 02:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOLLY CEKALA: Even if I opened
up six more
treatment centers here, you're
still going

02:21.675 --> 02:26.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to fill them. And you're still
going to have
a rotation, unless we protect
our investment

02:26.880 --> 02:28.715 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in treatment.

02:28.749 --> 02:35.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The statistics
are staggering.
In 2013, New Hampshire saw 192
drug overdose

02:35.555 --> 02:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deaths. That number shot up to
326 in 2014.
As of mid-December, 342 people
died this past

02:46.333 --> 02:49.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year. And the fatalities are
just the tip
of the iceberg.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LINDA SAUNDERS PAQUETTE,
Executive Director,
New Futures: We have a
population in New Hampshire

02:51.872 --> 03:00.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of about 1.3 million people. And
approximately
100,000 folks are in need of
substance use

03:01.014 --> 03:02.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
treatment.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Linda Saunders
Paquette is
the executive director of New
Futures, a group

03:06.820 --> 03:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that advocates for drug and
alcohol abuse
prevention and reduction.

03:10.791 --> 03:16.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA SAUNDERS PAQUETTE: With
those high rates
of people with substance use
disorder, we

03:16.630 --> 03:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are also second to last in the
country when
it comes to somebody in need of
treatment

03:21.435 --> 03:24.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being able to access

03:24.371 --> 03:29.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Access is an issue state
Representative Gladys
Johnsen saw firsthand almost a
decade ago.

03:29.876 --> 03:34.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GLADYS JOHNSEN (D), New
Hampshire State Representative:
It's really a disease. And I had
not owned

03:34.347 --> 03:36.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that until I witnessed it.

03:36.216 --> 03:42.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Years before she
became a state
legislator, the father of
Johnsen's grandson

03:42.422 --> 03:44.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fatally overdosed in their home.

03:44.958 --> 03:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLADYS JOHNSEN: My daughter
Jorinda (ph) comes
running upstairs at 5:15. "I
can't wake Jesse

03:50.397 --> 03:52.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
(ph). I can't wake Jesse."

03:52.132 --> 03:57.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we, of course, rushed down
there. And
Jesse was gone. And we --
immediately, my

03:57.637 --> 04:01.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
husband did the chest
compressions, and I
tried breathing in his mouth.
And I knew in

04:02.008 --> 04:09.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my heart he was gone. And so,
you know, it
has taken me a long time. And he
wasn't -- they

04:09.182 --> 04:11.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weren't married, but he was one
of mine.

04:11.518 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Johnsen says just
weeks before
Jesse's death, he had tried to
get help for

04:16.756 --> 04:18.558 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his addiction.

04:18.592 --> 04:23.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GLADYS JOHNSEN: It still hurts
my soul. I
watched him call place after
place after place

04:23.296 --> 04:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after place, saying: "I really
need help.
Can you find me a place?" And he
could not

04:30.137 --> 04:32.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
find a place because he didn't
have any money.

04:32.873 --> 04:38.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bryan Patriquin,
an intern
at HOPE for New Hampshire, told
us that although

04:38.111 --> 04:44.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he has gotten help throughout
his four years
of recovery, stories like
Jesse's are all

04:44.184 --> 04:46.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
too common.

04:46.052 --> 04:48.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRYAN PATRIQUIN, HOPE for New
Hampshire: If
we were to walk down the streets
of Manchester,

04:48.555 --> 04:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it would be a matter of time
before we saw
a drug deal happen. But if you
call a treatment

04:55.529 --> 05:02.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
center right now, you're going
to get a waiting
list for four to six weeks, on
average.

05:02.202 --> 05:07.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The drug crisis
here is not
just happening behind closed
doors. Among

05:07.307 --> 05:12.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the cans and bottles littering
the state's
parks and little league fields,
authorities

05:12.445 --> 05:17.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
have found lots of drug
paraphernalia, including
hundreds of needles.

05:17.918 --> 05:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Drug abuse is such a problem,
that Manchester's
mayor, Ted Gatsas, says he has
regular visits

05:24.191 --> 05:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from parents of young people
who've overdosed
on opioids like heroin and
fentanyl.

05:29.629 --> 05:34.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TED GATSAS (R), Mayor of
Manchester, New Hampshire:
We need to do something about
it. If we don't,

05:34.568 --> 05:38.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're not going to have to worry
about building
more beds to try and treat
people. We're going

05:38.071 --> 05:39.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have to start building more
coffins.

05:39.873 --> 05:45.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Maggie
Hassan has
presented her own set of
proposals to combat

05:45.478 --> 05:50.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the opioid crisis. It seems
likely the legislature
will adopt at least some of
them.

05:51.017 --> 05:55.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MAGGIE HASSAN: The most
important thing
we know we need to do is
increase access to

05:55.722 --> 06:00.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
treatment in New Hampshire, and
that really
boils down to making sure we
reauthorize our

06:00.694 --> 06:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medicaid expansion program,
because, for the
first time, under Medicaid
expansion, the

06:05.899 --> 06:09.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Medicaid program covers
treatment and behavioral
health issues.

06:09.869 --> 06:15.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Realizing drug
abuse has become
an issue important to New
Hampshire, the presidential

06:15.642 --> 06:17.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hopefuls have also responded.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Look,
I have some personal experience
with this

06:19.546 --> 06:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just as a dad. It's the most
heartbreaking
thing in the world to have to go
through.

06:24.517 --> 06:29.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate:
My friend, they found him dead
in a motel

06:29.122 --> 06:36.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
room by himself with an empty
bottle of Percocet
and an empty quart of vodka. He
was 52 years

06:36.096 --> 06:47.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
old. My friend had every success
in the world,
as we define it, and then,
because of his

06:47.607 --> 06:49.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
addiction, he had nothing.

06:49.409 --> 06:54.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: State
Representative Johnsen
raised the drug crisis at a
Clinton campaign

06:54.080 --> 06:55.915 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event.

06:55.949 --> 07:00.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GLADYS JOHNSEN: We are
grandparents raising
our 10-year-old grandson,
because his father,

07:00.654 --> 07:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we lost him to an overdose.

07:02.589 --> 07:08.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Well, I have to say, Gladys,
that you're the

07:08.094 --> 07:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
third grandmother that I have
personally met
in New Hampshire in the last
several months

07:12.866 --> 07:15.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who is raising a grandchild
because of drugs.

07:15.602 --> 07:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donna Sytek, who
recently endorsed
New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie, says the

07:21.007 --> 07:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
debate now lies in how to solve
the problem.

07:23.943 --> 07:28.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA SYTEK: When budgets get
tight, that's
one area where there are
cutbacks. And so

07:28.815 --> 07:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it has been a problem. There
hasn't been a
lot of money. It's not
surprising that New

07:34.587 --> 07:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire doesn't spend a lot on
that. We
don't spend a lot on a lot of
other programs,

07:39.526 --> 07:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because we believe in small
government.

07:41.227 --> 07:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is, after
all, the state
with the motto "Live Free or
Die."

07:47.100 --> 07:53.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even so, Republican Mayor Gatsas
is in favor
of spending more on law
enforcement to tackle

07:53.440 --> 07:55.175 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the crisis.

07:55.208 --> 07:59.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TED GATSAS: We need to start
from the top,
and preventing folks from
getting addicted

07:59.779 --> 08:05.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by preventing the cross-line of
heroin coming
across into this state.

08:05.085 --> 08:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Hassan,
who is backing
Hillary Clinton for president,
argues the

08:09.889 --> 08:14.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state investment in treatment is
not only
the right thing to do for
addicts, but also

08:14.761 --> 08:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the best interest of the
business community.

08:16.730 --> 08:22.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MAGGIE HASSAN: This has got
a huge economic
impact. We have a 3.2 percent
unemployment

08:22.235 --> 08:27.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate in New Hampshire. It's one
of the lowest
in the country. If we can't find
a work force

08:27.774 --> 08:33.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that isn't struggling with an
addiction problem,
that has a direct economic
impact on us.

08:33.313 --> 08:39.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Advocates say
that understanding
addiction and eliminating its
stigma should

08:39.085 --> 08:41.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go hand in hand with treatment.

08:41.154 --> 08:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA SAUNDERS PAQUETTE: In the
past, a person
who had an addiction was thought
to have a

08:46.760 --> 08:55.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moral failing. But thanks to
science, we now
know that addiction is a chronic
relapsing

08:55.201 --> 08:57.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
brain disease.

08:57.036 --> 09:01.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's
exactly what HOPE
for New Hampshire stresses to
politicians

09:01.641 --> 09:04.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and to those struggling with
addiction.

09:04.177 --> 09:10.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRYAN PATRIQUIN: At 21
years-old, I was well
