02:03.156 --> 02:06.226
FIGHTERS, A DECISION THEY WOULD

02:06.226 --> 02:09.196
NOW SUPPORT BY A SLENDER MARGIN.

02:09.196 --> 02:11.064
IRAN REPORTEDLY HAS DEVELOPED A

02:11.064 --> 02:12.265
NEW CRUISE MISSILE SAID TO BE

02:12.265 --> 02:13.533

02:27.114 --> 02:28.448
A TOP IRANIAN MILITARY OFFICIAL

02:28.448 --> 02:29.649
HAILED THE DEVELOPMENT AS A

02:29.649 --> 02:30.917
SIGNIFICANT BOOST TO IRAN'S

02:30.917 --> 02:33.720
MILITARY DEFENSES.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.088
AUTHORITIES IN HONG KONG ARE

02:35.088 --> 02:36.256
CRACKING DOWN ON THE PRO-

02:36.256 --> 02:37.090
DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATIONS THAT

02:37.090 --> 02:37.958

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CITY

02:44.765 --> 02:46.400
GOVERNMENT.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.801
THE PROTESTS ARE OVER NEW RULES

02:47.801 --> 02:48.902
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE CENTRAL

02:48.902 --> 02:50.771
GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING TO SCREEN

02:50.771 --> 02:52.305
ALL CANDIDATES HOPING TO LEAD

02:52.305 --> 02:53.840
HONG KONG BEFORE THEIR NAMES CAN

02:53.840 --> 02:56.643
APPEAR ON THE BALLOT.

02:56.643 --> 02:58.111
THE VOLCANO THAT ERUPTED WITHOUT

02:58.111 --> 02:59.246
WARNING IN JAPAN YESTERDAY, WAS

02:59.246 --> 03:00.047
FAR MORE DEADLY THAN ORIGINALLY

03:00.047 --> 03:01.548
THOUGHT.

03:01.548 --> 03:02.983
DESPITE RESCUE EFFORTS,

03:02.983 --> 03:04.451

03:13.160 --> 03:15.228
INTO THE SKY.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.997
BACK IN THIS COUNTRY,

03:16.997 --> 03:18.532

03:24.471 --> 03:26.106
THE MEN TURNED AROUND AND SHOT

03:26.106 --> 03:27.340

03:27.340 --> 03:28.275
THE OFFICER RETURNED FIRE, BUT

03:28.275 --> 03:29.309
APPARENTLY DID NOT HIT EITHER OF

03:29.309 --> 03:30.677
THE SUSPECTS.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.279
THE INCIDENT IS NOT BELIEVED TO

03:32.279 --> 03:33.747
BE CONNECTED TO THE RECENT

03:33.747 --> 03:35.348
RACIAL UNREST IN THAT ST. LOUIS

ACCORDING TO A COMPANY

05:28.728 --> 05:30.864
WELCOME RECEPTION FOR THE INDIAN

05:30.864 --> 05:33.333
PRIME MINISTER.

05:33.333 --> 05:39.606
THE ENTIRE ARENA WAS EXCITED.

05:39.606 --> 05:42.242
THERE WAS A PENT UP EXCITEMENT

05:42.242 --> 05:44.177
OF THE INDIAN AMERICAN

05:44.177 --> 05:45.645
COMMUNITY, TO WELCOME HIM HERE

05:45.645 --> 05:47.714
AS THE NEW INDIAN PRIME

05:47.714 --> 05:48.848
MINISTER.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.050
AND HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.385
>> HE WAS ELECTED LAST SPRING IN

05:52.385 --> 05:53.220
A LANDSLIDE.

05:53.220 --> 05:55.822
TELL US WHY HE WAS ELECTED WITH

05:55.822 --> 05:58.391
SUCH A DECISIVE VICTORY AND A

05:58.391 --> 05:59.459
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HIM.

05:59.459 --> 06:04.197
>> HE CAMPAIGNED VERY

06:04.197 --> 06:08.034
SPECIFICALLY ON A CAMPAIGN OF

06:08.034 --> 06:11.037
GOOD GOVERNMENT, PLAGUED BY

06:11.037 --> 06:12.939
CORRUPTION SCANDALS SO THE GOOD

06:12.939 --> 06:14.374
GOVERNANCE MESSAGE WAS A VERY

06:14.374 --> 06:15.075
IMPORTANT ONE.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.276
VOTERS WERE HEARING THAT AND

06:16.276 --> 06:17.877
SAYING YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:17.877 --> 06:19.379
LET'S VOTE FOR A CHANGE.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.914
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY HIS MESSAGE

06:20.914 --> 06:22.616
ON ECONOMIC GROWTH AT A TIME

06:22.616 --> 06:25.051
WHEN INDIAN GROWTH RATES HAD

06:25.051 --> 06:28.822
DIPPED BLOW 5% FROM PEAKS OF

06:28.822 --> 06:33.393
AROUND 10%, IN 2010.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.563
CITIZENS HEARD THE MODI MESSAGE,

06:36.563 --> 06:38.865
THE PROMISE OF GREATER JOBS AND

06:38.865 --> 06:39.699
OPPORTUNITIES.

06:39.699 --> 06:41.067
I THINK THAT WAS THE SECRET OF

06:41.067 --> 06:42.269
THE SUCCESS OF HIS PARTY.

06:42.269 --> 06:45.071
>> THERE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF

06:45.071 --> 06:46.673
IRRITATIONS BETWEEN THE INDIAN

06:46.673 --> 06:47.540
GOVERNMENT AND THE UNITED STATES

06:47.540 --> 06:48.808
OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.143
WHAT ARE THOSE IRRITATIONS AND

06:50.143 --> 06:51.411
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PRESIDENT

06:51.411 --> 06:52.345
AND THE PRIME MINISTER WILL

06:52.345 --> 06:53.213
DISCUSS BECAUSE OF THROWS?

06:53.213 --> 06:55.415
>> IT CERTAINLY HAS BEEN

06:55.415 --> 06:56.016
THOSE...

06:56.016 --> 06:59.052
>> IT IS CERTAINLY THE CASE,

06:59.052 --> 07:01.855
THAT WAS EXACERBATED BY THE FACT

07:01.855 --> 07:03.456
THAT INDIAN GROWTH RATE SLOWED

07:03.456 --> 07:04.791
WHICH MADE THE BUSINESS

07:04.791 --> 07:06.159
ENVIRONMENT A LOT MORE

07:06.159 --> 07:07.294
CHALLENGING FOR A LOT OF

07:07.294 --> 07:09.729
AMERICAN COMPANIES THAT HAD

07:09.729 --> 07:12.432
PREVIOUSLY BEEN BIG CHAMPIONS OF

07:12.432 --> 07:13.400
THE INDIAN STORY.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.869
AREAS OF TRADE, AREAS WHERE WE

07:15.869 --> 07:21.007
DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE, INDIA

07:21.007 --> 07:23.810
RECENTLY DECIDED NOT TO RATIFY A

07:23.810 --> 07:25.679
VERY IMPORTANT AGREEMENT REACHED

07:25.679 --> 07:30.450
UNDER THE WTO, TRADE

07:30.450 --> 07:35.955
FACILITATION AGREEMENT.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.758
POSSIBILITY OF THE CIVIL NUCLEAR

07:38.758 --> 07:40.126
INITIATIVE MOVE INTO A

07:40.126 --> 07:41.461
COMMERCIAL OPERATION THAT'S

07:41.461 --> 07:42.595
ANOTHER IRRITANT THAT'S BEEN OF

07:42.595 --> 07:43.663
LONG STANDING.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.332
>> AND FINALLY WHAT IS HIS

07:45.332 --> 07:46.299
STANCE, HIS APPROACH TO

07:46.299 --> 07:47.100
PAKISTAN?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.202
>> HE HAS AN APPROACH TO

07:49.202 --> 07:51.171
PAKISTAN THAT SEEMS PREMISED ON

07:51.171 --> 07:54.074
THE IDEA THAT OUTREACH AND

07:54.074 --> 07:56.076
COMMUNICATION CAN TRY TO HELP

07:56.076 --> 07:57.677
BRIDGE THEIR DIVIDE VERY EARLY

07:57.677 --> 07:58.712
ON.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.579
THE PRIME MINISTER INVITED ALL

07:59.579 --> 08:01.247
THE HEADS OF GOVERNMENT FROM THE

08:01.247 --> 08:03.183
SURROUNDING COUNTRIES IN SOUTH

08:03.183 --> 08:07.520
ASIA TO ATTEND HIS INAUGURATION.

08:07.520 --> 08:10.156
BUT AMONG THE MEETINGS HE HELD

08:10.156 --> 08:14.994
WITH HEADS OF GOVERNMENT, HIS

08:14.994 --> 08:19.332
MEETING WITH NOAZ SHARIF HAS

08:19.332 --> 08:21.601
BEEN PAID MOST INTEREST TO.

08:21.601 --> 08:24.604
A PLANNED MEETING BETWEEN INDIAN

08:24.604 --> 08:26.706
AND PAKISTANI FOREIGN

08:26.706 --> 08:27.474
SECRETARIES WAS CANCELLED

08:27.474 --> 08:30.009
BECAUSE THE PAKISTANI HIGH

08:30.009 --> 08:34.013
COMMISSIONER HAD MET WITH

08:34.013 --> 08:36.216
KASHMIRI SEPARATISTS.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.219
A CALL FOR MORE DIALOGUE WITH

08:39.219 --> 08:42.188
PAKISTAN BUT THIS IS VERY FIRM

08:42.188 --> 08:43.957
THAT HAD CAN'T TAKE PLACE.

08:43.957 --> 08:46.025
HE IS LOOKING MORE FOR PAKISTAN

08:46.025 --> 08:50.830
DO MORE TO REIN IN THE ARE

08:50.830 --> 08:55.135
THREAT OF TERRORISTS SO THEY ASK

08:55.135 --> 08:57.036
NORMALIZE THEIR RELATIONS.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.907
>> ALYSSA AYRES, THANK YOU SO

09:00.907 --> 09:02.442
MUCH FOR HAVING US.

09:02.442 --> 09:05.678
AND NOW TO OUR SIGNATURE

09:05.678 --> 09:06.379
SEGMENT.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.949
OUR ORIGINAL IN DEPARTMENT

09:09.949 --> 09:16.222
REPORTS

09:16.222 --> 09:16.956
IN-DEPTH REPORTS FROM AROUND THE

09:16.956 --> 09:20.126
NATION AND THE WORLD.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.561
TONIGHT, THE MID-TERM ELECTIONS.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.662
VOTERS ACROSS THE NATION GO TO

09:22.662 --> 09:24.230
POLLS LESS THAN SIX WEEKS FROM

09:24.230 --> 09:25.265
NOW, AND THE BIGGEST QUESTION

09:25.265 --> 09:26.065
HEADING INTO ELECTION DAY IS

09:26.065 --> 09:27.066
WHETHER THE G.O.P. WILL REGAIN

09:27.066 --> 09:27.901
CONTROL OF THE UNITED STATES

09:27.901 --> 09:28.701
SENATE.

09:28.701 --> 09:29.602
ONE RACE THAT WILL HELP

09:29.602 --> 09:30.403
DETERMINE THAT IS BEING FOUGHT

09:30.403 --> 09:31.304
IN KANSAS, A RELIABLY REPUBLICAN

09:31.304 --> 09:32.138
STATE WHERE THE STATE'S LONGTIME

09:32.138 --> 09:33.006
REPUBLICAN SENATOR AND ITS

09:33.006 --> 09:33.940
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR ARE BOTH,

09:33.940 --> 09:34.874
PERHAPS UNEXPECTEDLY, IN

09:34.874 --> 09:35.575
TROUBLE.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.376
WHY?

09:36.376 --> 09:37.243
NEWSHOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

09:37.243 --> 09:38.111
JEFF GREENFIELD TRAVELED THERE

09:38.111 --> 09:39.612
RECENTLY AND HAS OUR REPORT.

09:39.612 --> 09:40.814
>> Reporter: THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL

09:40.814 --> 09:41.981
SEE JUST ABOUT ANY AUTUMN IN

09:41.981 --> 09:43.716
KANSAS: FIELDS OF CORN THAT

09:43.716 --> 09:45.251
AWAIT THE HARVEST, THE SEARCH

09:45.251 --> 09:46.853
FOR FOOD AT A FARMER'S MARKET OR

09:46.853 --> 09:47.787
AT OKLAHOMA JOE'S ALWAYS CROWED

09:47.787 --> 09:50.590
BARBECUE.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.925
AND THIS IS WHAT YOU'LL HEAR:

09:51.925 --> 09:53.126
THE ROAR OF THE CROWDS AND THE

09:53.126 --> 09:54.561
MOTORCYCLES AT A KANSAS STATE

09:54.561 --> 09:56.095
FOOTBALL GAME.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.297
BUT FOR ALL THAT IS FAMILIAR IN

09:57.297 --> 09:58.565
THIS PLACE, IN THIS SEASON,

09:58.565 --> 09:59.766
THERE IS ONE THING HAPPENING

09:59.766 --> 10:01.367
HERE THAT IS ALMOST TOTALLY

10:01.367 --> 10:02.869
UNPRECEDENTED, SOMETHING SO

10:02.869 --> 10:04.404
SURPRISING, ALMOST SHOCKING,

10:04.404 --> 10:06.272
THAT IT HAS REPUBLICANS FROM

10:06.272 --> 10:07.907
MAINE TO HAWAII ASKING, "WHAT'S

10:07.907 --> 10:10.610
THE MATTER WITH KANSAS?"

10:10.610 --> 10:12.145
IN WHAT IS SURELY THE BIGGEST

10:12.145 --> 10:14.013
SURPRISE OF THE 2014 MIDTERMS,

10:14.013 --> 10:16.015
BOTH REPUBLICAN SENATOR PAT

10:16.015 --> 10:17.851
ROBERTS AND REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR

10:17.851 --> 10:19.919
SAM BROWNBACK FIND THEMSELVES IN

10:19.919 --> 10:21.988
SERIOUS POLITICAL PERIL IN THIS

10:21.988 --> 10:24.123
MOST REPUBLICAN OF STATES, TWO

10:24.123 --> 10:25.992
RACES THAT WERE ON NO ONE'S

10:25.992 --> 10:27.660
RADAR A FEW MONTHS AGO, ONE OF

10:27.660 --> 10:29.362
WHICH MAY DECIDE WHO CONTROLS

10:29.362 --> 10:31.064
THE UNITED STATES SENATE.

10:31.064 --> 10:32.532
IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE AN OBSERVER

10:32.532 --> 10:34.100
LIKE THEKANSAS CITY STAR'SDAVE

10:34.100 --> 10:35.668
HELLING, WHO'S COVERED POLITICS

10:35.668 --> 10:37.504
FOR ALMOST 35 YEARS, TO FEEL AS

10:37.504 --> 10:39.372
IF HE'S NOT IN KANSAS ANYMORE,

10:39.372 --> 10:40.807
WHERE EVERY STATEWIDE OFFICIAL

10:40.807 --> 10:42.709
AND EVERY MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS

10:42.709 --> 10:44.143
REPUBLICAN.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.745
SO IF SOMEONE HAD TOLD YOU UP

10:45.745 --> 10:47.046
TILL SAY EIGHT MONTHS AGO THAT

10:47.046 --> 10:48.248
YOU WOULD BE SEEING THE RACE FOR

10:48.248 --> 10:49.516
BOTH SENATOR AND GOVERNOR

10:49.516 --> 10:50.717
DEVELOP THE WAY IT HAS, WHAT

10:50.717 --> 10:52.118
WOULD YOU HAVE TOLD THEM?

10:52.118 --> 10:53.419
>> THAT THEY'RE SMOKING

10:53.419 --> 10:54.254
SOMETHING THAT'S LEGAL IN

10:54.254 --> 10:57.790
COLORADO BUT NOT IN KANSAS.

10:57.790 --> 10:58.825
KANSAS MAY BE, JEFF, ONE OF THE

10:58.825 --> 11:00.260
MOST REPUBLICAN STATES IN THE

11:00.260 --> 11:01.761
COUNTRY.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.329
SO I DON'T THINK ANYONE A YEAR

11:03.329 --> 11:04.931
AGO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT AT ANY

11:04.931 --> 11:06.900
LEVEL THAT EITHER SAM BROWNBACK

11:06.900 --> 11:08.468
AND CERTAINLY PAT ROBERTS WOULD

11:08.468 --> 11:09.869
BE IN ANY MAJOR TROUBLE.

11:09.869 --> 11:13.406
THEY ARE.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.174
>> Reporter: FOR THE 78-YEAR-OLD

11:15.174 --> 11:16.476
ROBERTS, POLITICAL VULNERABILITY

11:16.476 --> 11:17.677
IS AN UNWELCOME STRANGER.

11:17.677 --> 11:18.945
FIRST ELECTED TO THE HOUSE 34

11:18.945 --> 11:20.713
YEARS AGO, ROBERTS IS FINISHING

11:20.713 --> 11:22.348
HIS THIRD TERM IN THE SENATE,

11:22.348 --> 11:24.450
CONTINUING A STRING OF G.O.P.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.052
VICTORIES THAT STRETCHES BACK TO

11:26.052 --> 11:29.722
1938.

11:29.722 --> 11:31.925
BUT ROBERTS HAS BEEN HIT BY THE

11:31.925 --> 11:33.626
SAME CROSSWINDS THAT HAVE

11:33.626 --> 11:34.961
BUFFETED OTHER VETERAN

11:34.961 --> 11:36.663
REPUBLICANS: THE SENSE THAT HE'S

11:36.663 --> 11:38.731
"GONE WASHINGTON."

11:38.731 --> 11:40.400
IN FEBRUARY, THENEW YORK TIMES

11:40.400 --> 11:42.201
REVEALED THAT ROBERTS HAS NO

11:42.201 --> 11:43.336
HOME IN KANSAS, THAT HE RENTS

11:43.336 --> 11:44.671
OUT A ROOM IN A SUPPORTER'S

11:44.671 --> 11:45.872
HOUSE ON A GOLF COURSE AND HAS

11:45.872 --> 11:46.940
RARELY BEEN SEEN BACK IN THE

11:46.940 --> 11:49.309
STATE.

11:49.309 --> 11:50.877
AND ROBERTS IS FIGHTING ANOTHER

11:50.877 --> 11:52.211
PERCEPTION: THAT HE'S TOO MUCH

11:52.211 --> 11:53.580
PART OF THE SYSTEM, A SYMBOL OF

11:53.580 --> 11:54.547
THE OLDER ORDER, AND OUT OF STEP

11:54.547 --> 11:56.482
WITH TEA PARTY CONSERVATIVES,

11:56.482 --> 11:57.417
SOMETHING THAT MAY BE REFLECTED

11:57.417 --> 12:01.020
BY HOW HE DESCRIBES HIMSELF.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.822
>> PEOPLE USED TO ASK ME ALL THE

12:02.822 --> 12:04.390
TIME WHAT KIND OF REPUBLICAN I

12:04.390 --> 12:06.559
WAS, I'M JUST A REPUBLICAN.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.627
BUT I WOULD SAY PROBABLY AN

12:07.627 --> 12:09.395
EISENHOWER REPUBLICAN.

12:09.395 --> 12:10.196
I KNOW BOB DOLE.

12:10.196 --> 12:11.030
HE'S A VERY DEAR FRIEND.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.432
HE JUST CUT AN AD FOR ME.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.933
SO I'M A BOB DOLE REPUBLICAN.

12:13.933 --> 12:15.134
BUT I'M ALSO THE FOURTH MOST

12:15.134 --> 12:16.169
CONSERVATIVE SENATOR IN THE

12:16.169 --> 12:18.605
SENATE.

12:18.605 --> 12:20.473
>> Reporter: THIS AUGUST,

12:20.473 --> 12:22.575
ROBERTS NARROWLY SURVIVED A

12:22.575 --> 12:23.776
PRIMARY AGAINST A TEA PARTY

12:23.776 --> 12:26.145
OPPONENT.

12:26.145 --> 12:27.847
UNTIL A FEW WEEKS AGO, ROBERTS'

12:27.847 --> 12:30.850
BEST ASSET MAY HAVE BEEN THE

12:30.850 --> 12:33.419
DIVIDED OPPOSITION.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.088
HE FACED BOTH A DEMOCRAT AND AN

12:35.088 --> 12:37.023
INDEPENDENT.

12:37.023 --> 12:38.825
THEN, DEMOCRAT CHAD TAYLOR

12:38.825 --> 12:39.926
DROPPED OUT OF THE RACE, LEAVING

12:39.926 --> 12:41.260
ROBERTS TO FACE 45-YEAR-OLD GREG

12:41.260 --> 12:42.395
ORMAN, A BUSINESSMAN AND CO-

12:42.395 --> 12:43.429
FOUNDER OF A PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM

12:43.429 --> 12:44.697
WITH THE WEALTH TO FUND HIS OWN

12:44.697 --> 12:45.798
CAMPAIGN.

12:45.798 --> 12:47.200
HE ALSO HAS A PAST THAT INCLUDES

12:47.200 --> 12:49.102
MEMBERSHIP IN BOTH MAJOR

12:49.102 --> 12:50.103
POLITICAL PARTIES, BOTH OF WHICH

12:50.103 --> 12:51.738
HE NOW DISAVOWS.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.840
>> BOTH PARTIES TAKE EXTREME

12:53.840 --> 12:56.376
POSITIONS.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.611
YOU KNOW THE WAY HARRY REID IS

12:58.611 --> 12:59.946
RUNNING THE SENATE, HE'S RUNNING

12:59.946 --> 13:02.448
THE SENATE LIKE A DICTATORSHIP.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.684
HE'S NOT ALLOWING COMPROMISE,

13:04.684 --> 13:07.153
HE'S NOT ALLOWING DEBATE.

13:07.153 --> 13:07.987
AND WE'VE GOT THE SAME PROBLEM

13:07.987 --> 13:09.255
IN THE HOUSE WITH THE

13:09.255 --> 13:10.356
REPUBLICANS SO I THINK BOTH

13:10.356 --> 13:12.692
PARTIES ARE REALLY TO BLAME FOR

13:12.692 --> 13:14.794
THE DYSFUNCTION THAT WE HAVE IN

13:14.794 --> 13:16.462
WASHINGTON TODAY.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.597
>> Reporter: THE RACE HAS DRAWN

13:17.597 --> 13:18.865
INTENSE NATIONAL ATTENTION

13:18.865 --> 13:20.066
BECAUSE OF SIMPLE ARITHMETIC:

13:20.066 --> 13:21.467
WITH REPUBLICANS NEEDING SIX

13:21.467 --> 13:22.702
SEATS TO TAKE THE SENATE, A

13:22.702 --> 13:23.970
ROBERTS LOSS WOULD MAKE THAT

13:23.970 --> 13:25.838
NUMBER MUCH TOUGHER TO REACH.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.373
THAT, ORMAN SAYS, WOULD GIVE HIM

13:27.373 --> 13:28.708
A LOT OF LEVERAGE SHOULD HE BE

13:28.708 --> 13:30.510
ELECTED.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.944
PERHAPS TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT,

13:31.944 --> 13:33.279
ORMAN IS NOT SAYING WHICH PARTY

13:33.279 --> 13:34.247
HE'D ALIGN HIMSELF WITH, OR, AS

13:34.247 --> 13:37.550
THEY SAY IN WASHINGTON, CAUCUS.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.751
IT FALLS UPON YOU, MR. ORMAN, TO

13:38.751 --> 13:39.652
DECIDE WHO GOVERNS THE SENATE

13:39.652 --> 13:41.287
FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.222
THAT'S A DECISION YOU WILL HAVE

13:43.222 --> 13:44.957
TO MAKE.

13:44.957 --> 13:46.159
ARE THE VOTERS OF KANSAS

13:46.159 --> 13:47.760
ENTITLED TO KNOW BEFORE THEY

13:47.760 --> 13:48.494
VOTE FOR YOU WHAT THAT DECISION

13:48.494 --> 13:50.263
IS?

13:50.263 --> 13:51.664
>> WE WILL CAUCUS WITH WHICHEVER

13:51.664 --> 13:52.932
PARTIES WILL BE WILLING TO

13:52.932 --> 13:53.933
PROMOTE A PRO-PROBLEM-SOLVING

13:53.933 --> 13:55.568
NONPARTISAN AGENDA.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.003
AND IF THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO DO

13:57.003 --> 13:58.438
THAT THEN WE'RE NOT GOING TO

13:58.438 --> 14:00.239
WORK WITH THEM.

14:00.239 --> 14:01.574
>> Reporter: IF THE SENATE RACE

14:01.574 --> 14:03.176
HERE HAS NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS,

14:03.176 --> 14:04.377
THE GOVERNOR'S RACE SEEMS TO

14:04.377 --> 14:06.245
ILLUSTRATE AN OLD POLITICAL

14:06.245 --> 14:07.313
ADAGE, THAT ALL OR AT LEAST A

14:07.313 --> 14:09.716
LOT OF POLITICS IS LOCAL.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.084
GOVERNOR BROWNBACK'S PROBLEM

14:11.084 --> 14:12.685
STEMS NOT FROM DEMOCRATS BUT

14:12.685 --> 14:14.220
OVERWHELMINGLY FROM KANSAS

14:14.220 --> 14:14.987
REPUBLICANS, WHO ARE A SPECIAL

14:14.987 --> 14:16.556
BREED.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.057
THE 58-YEAR-OLD BROWNBACK WAS

14:18.057 --> 14:19.525
ELECTED GOVERNOR FOUR YEARS AGO,

14:19.525 --> 14:20.526
AFTER TWO TERMS IN THE U.S.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.361
SENATE.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.129
HE BROUGHT WITH HIM A STRONGLY

14:23.129 --> 14:24.230
CONSERVATIVE AGENDA, BOTH ON

14:24.230 --> 14:25.331
SOCIAL ISSUES LIKE ABORTION AND

14:25.331 --> 14:26.532
WITH HISTORICALLY LARGE TAX

14:26.532 --> 14:29.535
CUTS, AN EXPERIMENT, BROWNBACK

14:29.535 --> 14:31.270
SAID, IN SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMICS.

14:31.270 --> 14:33.206
FOR NATIONAL REPUBLICANS, TAX-

14:33.206 --> 14:34.440
CUTS ARE AN UNALLOYED GOOD.

14:34.440 --> 14:35.441
BUT KANSAS REPUBLICANS?

14:35.441 --> 14:39.412
WELL...

14:39.412 --> 14:41.714
>> THEY LIKE THEIR SENATORS TO

14:41.714 --> 14:43.182
HAVE A STRONG REPUBLICAN POINT

14:43.182 --> 14:46.886
OF VIEW.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.653
THE DEMANDS OF BEING GOVERNOR

14:47.653 --> 14:49.622
ARE QUITE DIFFERENT.

14:49.622 --> 14:50.823
AND WHEN HE CAME BACK, HE SORT

14:50.823 --> 14:51.991
OF PURSUED WHAT WAS VERY, VERY

14:51.991 --> 14:53.359
OBVIOUSLY A STRONGLY

14:53.359 --> 14:56.496
CONSERVATIVE AGENDA.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.197
>> Reporter: WHEN THOSE CUTS

14:58.197 --> 14:59.532
OPENED UP A PROJECTED BUDGET

14:59.532 --> 15:00.566
SHORTFALL OF HUNDREDS OF

15:00.566 --> 15:02.769
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND

15:02.769 --> 15:03.703
THREATENED THE LEVEL OF SCHOOL

15:03.703 --> 15:05.037
FUNDING, THAT UNSETTLED MODERATE

15:05.037 --> 15:06.005
KANSAS REPUBLICANS AND WIDENED A

15:06.005 --> 15:07.006
RIFT BETWEEN THEM AND

15:07.006 --> 15:07.907
CONSERVATIVES THAT HAD BEEN

15:07.907 --> 15:09.108
AROUND FOR YEARS.

15:09.108 --> 15:10.309
TWO YEARS AGO, BROWNBACK LED

15:10.309 --> 15:12.078
SUCCESSFUL PRIMARY CAMPAIGNS

15:12.078 --> 15:14.580
AGAINST MODERATE LEGISLATORS.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.849
BUT THIS PAST JULY, THOSE

15:16.849 --> 15:18.718
REPUBLICANS RETALIATED AGAINST

15:18.718 --> 15:21.087
BROWNBACK BY JOINING 100 FELLOW

15:21.087 --> 15:23.923
REPUBLICANS IN ENDORSING THE

15:23.923 --> 15:25.424
DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT, STATE

15:25.424 --> 15:27.593
LEGISLATOR PAUL DAVIS.

15:27.593 --> 15:29.262
DAVIS HAS SEIZED ON BROWNBACK'S

15:29.262 --> 15:32.298
EXPERIMENT LABEL.

15:32.298 --> 15:34.600
IS THIS A STATE THAT ISN'T

15:34.600 --> 15:36.435
PARTICULARLY FOND OF EXPERIMENTS

15:36.435 --> 15:41.474
IN POLITICS?

15:41.474 --> 15:42.909
>> WELL, I WOULD SAY YES.

15:42.909 --> 15:44.277
IT IS DEFINITELY A STATE THAT IS

15:44.277 --> 15:45.278
NOT PARTICULARLY FOND OF

15:45.278 --> 15:46.145
EXPERIMENTS.

15:46.145 --> 15:46.979
THEY DON'T WANT A GOVERNOR WHO'S

15:46.979 --> 15:47.847
GOING TO TURN THEIR STATE INTO A

15:47.847 --> 15:51.384
SCIENCE LABORATORY.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.119
>> PEOPLE, I DON'T THINK THEY

15:53.119 --> 15:54.654
DON'T LIKE CHANGE.

15:54.654 --> 15:57.957
I DON'T THINK THEY TRUST CHANGE.

15:57.957 --> 16:02.261
SO I CAME OUT HERE AND SAID,

16:02.261 --> 16:06.999
"LOOK WE HAVEN'T BEEN GROWING.

16:06.999 --> 16:07.767
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUR TAX RATES

16:07.767 --> 16:09.068
DOWN SO WE CAN GROW."

16:09.068 --> 16:09.936
>> Reporter: AND ABOUT THAT

16:09.936 --> 16:10.803
EXPERIMENT WORD?

16:10.803 --> 16:11.671
>> YEAH, I SHOULDN'T HAVE USED

16:11.671 --> 16:12.505
THAT WORD.

16:12.505 --> 16:13.372
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS IT'S

16:13.372 --> 16:14.207
WORKING WELL.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.174
WE'RE GROWING.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.075
WE'VE GOT RECORD EMPLOYMENT IN

16:16.075 --> 16:16.876
KANSAS.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.044
>> Reporter: THEN, AFTER A BRIEF

16:18.044 --> 16:18.778
DISCUSSION WITH AN AIDE...

16:18.778 --> 16:19.612
>> Reporter: THE THINGS WE'RE

16:19.612 --> 16:20.646
DOING ARE NOT ANYTHING NEW.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.714
GOING TO... GETTING YOUR INCOMES

16:21.714 --> 16:22.815
TAXES DOWN, WE GOT NINE STATES

16:22.815 --> 16:23.716
WITHOUT AN INCOME TAX.

16:23.716 --> 16:24.817
THAT'S NOT NEW.

16:24.817 --> 16:25.852
SO NOTHING WE'RE DOING IS NEW.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.320
NOW IT'S NEW THAT WE'RE DOING IT

16:27.320 --> 16:28.321
BUT NOTHING THAT WE'RE DOING IS

16:28.321 --> 16:29.255
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT'S DONE

16:29.255 --> 16:31.991
BEFORE.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.292
>> Reporter: THE RACE FOR

16:33.292 --> 16:34.193
SENATOR AND THE RACE FOR

16:34.193 --> 16:35.294
GOVERNOR OBVIOUSLY HAVE

16:35.294 --> 16:36.896
DIFFERENT DYNAMICS, BUT HERE'S

16:36.896 --> 16:38.231
WHAT THEY HAVE IN COMMON: THE

16:38.231 --> 16:39.665
POLITICAL SURVIVAL OF SENATOR

16:39.665 --> 16:41.033
ROBERTS AND GOVERNOR BROWNBACK

16:41.033 --> 16:42.401
DEPENDS ON THEIR ABILITY TO

16:42.401 --> 16:43.603
DEFINE THEIR OPPONENTS WITH

16:43.603 --> 16:48.808
EXACTLY THE SAME LABEL.

16:48.808 --> 16:50.176
>> JUST ANOTHER VOTE FOR BARACK

16:50.176 --> 16:51.143
OBAMA.

16:51.143 --> 16:55.047
>> DAVIS, DON'T DELEGATE KANSAS

16:55.047 --> 16:56.849
TO AN OBAMA LIBERAL.

16:56.849 --> 17:01.520
>> LIKE OBAMA, GREG ORMAN WILL

17:01.520 --> 17:02.588
SAY ANYTHING TO

17:02.588 --> 17:04.156
>> HE IS A LIBERAL DEMOCRAT AND

17:04.156 --> 17:06.225
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE JEB BUSH,

17:06.225 --> 17:07.426
AND YOU HAVE JOHN McCAIN, YOU

17:07.426 --> 17:08.694
HAVE RAND PAUL... YOU GOT ABOUT

17:08.694 --> 17:09.795
EVERYBODY IN THE PARTY COMING--

17:09.795 --> 17:11.264
CONSERVATIVE, I DON'T SAY

17:11.264 --> 17:12.732
MODERATE-- REGULAR REPUBLICANS

17:12.732 --> 17:13.900
KNOWING HOW IMPORTANT THIS RACE

17:13.900 --> 17:14.834
IS BECAUSE THEY KNOW GREG IS A

17:14.834 --> 17:15.835
LIBERAL DEMOCRAT.

17:15.835 --> 17:16.702
AND WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE OF

17:16.702 --> 17:18.905
THOSE FOLKS.

17:18.905 --> 17:20.606
>> Reporter: IT'S A LABEL ORMAN

17:20.606 --> 17:21.707
IS DETERMINED NOT TO WEAR.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.575
>> THE KANSAS ELECTORATE IS VERY

17:22.575 --> 17:23.976
COMPLEX.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.445
THEY'RE ALSO VERY INDEPENDENT.

17:26.445 --> 17:27.813
YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE LIKE ROSS

17:27.813 --> 17:28.748
PEROT AND ROSS PEROT

17:28.748 --> 17:29.582
SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED IN

17:29.582 --> 17:31.217
KANSAS.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.185
>> Reporter: IN FACT,

17:33.185 --> 17:34.620
INDEPENDENT PEROT GOT NEARLY 27%

17:34.620 --> 17:35.721
OF THE KANSAS POPULAR VOTE WHEN

17:35.721 --> 17:37.156
HE RAN FOR PRESIDENT IN 1992.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.824
AND IF YOU ASK PAUL DAVIS IF

17:38.824 --> 17:40.059
HE'S CAMPAIGNING WITH HIS FELLOW

17:40.059 --> 17:41.627
DEMOCRATS, HIS ANSWER TELLS YOU

17:41.627 --> 17:43.029
EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW

17:43.029 --> 17:46.399
ABOUT HIS STRATEGY.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.668
ARE THERE ANY NATIONAL DEMOCRATS

17:48.668 --> 17:50.002
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO CAMPAIGN

17:50.002 --> 17:50.937
FOR YOU IN THE NEXT SEVERAL

17:50.937 --> 17:52.004
WEEKS HERE IN KANSAS?

17:52.004 --> 17:52.872
>> WELL I'M DOING SOMETHING

17:52.872 --> 17:54.307
DIFFERENT.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.508
I'M ACTUALLY CAMPAIGNING WITH A

17:55.508 --> 17:56.842
LOT OF REPUBLICANS.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.210
YOU KNOW GOVERNOR BROWNBACK'S

17:58.210 --> 17:59.512
BRINGING IN THE LIKES OF RICK

17:59.512 --> 18:00.346
PERRY AND CHRIS CHRISTIE AND

18:00.346 --> 18:01.514
WHAT I LIKE TO SAY IS HE'S OUT

18:01.514 --> 18:02.748
CAMPAIGNING WITH REPUBLICAN FROM

18:02.748 --> 18:04.583
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND I'M OUT

18:04.583 --> 18:05.918
CAMPAIGNING WITH REPUBLICANS

18:05.918 --> 18:10.156
FROM KANSAS.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.290
>> Reporter: AS IN EVERY

18:11.290 --> 18:12.792
CAMPAIGN, THE OUTCOME COULD

18:12.792 --> 18:14.160
HINGE ON THE UNANTICIPATED.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.594
JUST IN THE LAST WEEK, PAUL

18:15.594 --> 18:16.796
DAVIS HAS HAD TO EXPLAIN HOW HE

18:16.796 --> 18:17.997
WAS CAUGHT UP IN A POLICE RAID

18:17.997 --> 18:19.231
AT A STRIP CLUB 16 YEARS AGO.

18:19.231 --> 18:21.600
AND SOME REPUBLICANS HAVE BEGUN

18:21.600 --> 18:24.236
TO HINT THAT SENATE CANDIDATE

18:24.236 --> 18:26.605
ORMAN'S WALL STREET TIES MAY BE

18:26.605 --> 18:28.174
AS BIG A PROBLEM FOR HIM AS THEY

18:28.174 --> 18:31.110
WERE FOR MITT ROMNEY IN 2012.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.812
BUT WHAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING IS

18:32.812 --> 18:35.181
THE UNANTICIPATED ON STEROIDS:

18:35.181 --> 18:37.183
THE POSSIBILITY THAT AMERICA'S

18:37.183 --> 18:38.985
REDDEST STATE MIGHT GO BLUE THIS

18:38.985 --> 18:41.487
YEAR.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.728
>> Stewart: THE DEBATE OVER

18:48.728 --> 18:49.996
PERSONAL PRIVACY VERSUS NATIONAL

18:49.996 --> 18:51.464
SECURITY TOOK A NEW TURN

18:51.464 --> 18:52.531
THURSDAY WHEN THE DIRECTOR OF

18:52.531 --> 18:53.733
THE F.B.I. CRITICIZED APPLE AND

18:53.733 --> 18:55.001
GOOGLE FOR DEVELOPING ENCRYPTED

18:55.001 --> 18:56.535
SMART PHONES, DEVICES, HE SAYS

18:56.535 --> 18:58.371
WOULD ALLOW PEOPLE TO PLACE

18:58.371 --> 19:00.072
THEMSELVES BEYOND THE LAW.

19:00.072 --> 19:01.407
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS, WE ARE

19:01.407 --> 19:02.808
JOINED NOW BY JULIA ANGWIN.

19:02.808 --> 19:03.809
SHE IS A SENIOR REPORTER AT "PRO

19:03.809 --> 19:09.815
PUBLICA."

19:09.815 --> 19:11.350
JULIA WHAT IS IT THESE COMPANIES

19:11.350 --> 19:12.818
ARE DOING THAT HAS THE FBI SO

19:12.818 --> 19:13.853
CONCERNED?

19:13.853 --> 19:15.821
>> TO THINK ABOUT THIS THEY ARE

19:15.821 --> 19:19.191
ALLOWING YOU TO ENCRYPT THE

19:19.191 --> 19:24.463
EQUIVALENT OF YOUR HARD DRIVE.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.832
YOU CAN ENCRYPT YOUR HARD DRIVE

19:26.832 --> 19:29.035
SO YOU CAN ENCRYPT THAT.

19:29.035 --> 19:31.637
WHAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR SMARTPHONE

19:31.637 --> 19:33.105
WOULD BE SECURE AND NOT

19:33.105 --> 19:34.607
AVAILABLE TO ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T

19:34.607 --> 19:36.575
HAVE YOUR PASS CODE.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.511
ALMOST EVERY BIT OF DATA I HAVE

19:38.511 --> 19:41.580
ON MY SMARTPHONE MIGHT BE

19:41.580 --> 19:43.516
DUPLICATED SOMEWHERE ELSE.

19:43.516 --> 19:47.053
PHOTOS MIGHT BE BACKED UP ON

19:47.053 --> 19:48.687
iCLOUD.

19:48.687 --> 19:53.092
IF IT'S STORED SOMEWHERE ELSE IT

19:53.092 --> 19:54.160
MOST LIKELY IS AVAILABLE TO THE

19:54.160 --> 19:55.094
FBI.

19:55.094 --> 19:56.962
>> WHY IS THE FBI SO UPSET?

19:56.962 --> 19:58.864
>> THEY WANT THEIR JOB TO BE AS

19:58.864 --> 20:00.499
EASY AS POSSIBLE.

20:00.499 --> 20:01.934
SLIGHTLY SYMPATHETIC TOT IDEA

20:01.934 --> 20:03.469
THAT WE WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO

20:03.469 --> 20:04.870
HAVE AS MANY TOOLS AS POSSIBLE

20:04.870 --> 20:06.172
BUT IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WE

20:06.172 --> 20:08.474
ARE TALKING ABOUT A VERY SMALL

20:08.474 --> 20:09.909
SUBSET OF THEIR DATA WHICH IS

20:09.909 --> 20:11.043
THE PHYSICAL DEVICE.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.079
THEY HAVE TO GET THE ACTUAL

20:13.079 --> 20:14.346
DEVICE FROM YOU BUT IN THE END

20:14.346 --> 20:15.514
THEY ARE GOING TO GET THAT

20:15.514 --> 20:16.882
INFORMATION AND THEY HAVE NOT

20:16.882 --> 20:18.951
YET PRESENTED AN ACTUAL CASE

20:18.951 --> 20:20.953
WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE FAILED TO

20:20.953 --> 20:22.221
COMPLETE THEIR INVESTIGATION

20:22.221 --> 20:22.922
WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.890
>> WHAT IS ITS FOR THESE SILICON

20:24.890 --> 20:27.493
VALLEY GIANTS TO UP THEIR GAME

20:27.493 --> 20:28.627
ON PRIVACY AT THIS POINT?

20:28.627 --> 20:32.398
>> IN THE POST-SNOWDEN ERA THEY

20:32.398 --> 20:35.000
REALIZE THEY CAN USE THIS AS A

20:35.000 --> 20:36.402
MARKETING TOOL.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.704
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WE'VE

20:38.704 --> 20:40.806
SEEN KIND OF A PRIVACY WAR.

20:40.806 --> 20:43.876
APPLE CAME OUT WITH ITS

20:43.876 --> 20:44.977
ENCRYPTED DEFAULT SETTING FOR

20:44.977 --> 20:46.612
YOUR PHONE AND IMMEDIATELY

20:46.612 --> 20:48.581
GOOGLE CAME OUT AND SAID WE'RE

20:48.581 --> 20:50.182
DOING THE SAME THING.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.651
IT WOULD BE FAIR THAT GOOGLE

20:52.651 --> 20:55.521
OFFERED THE OPTIONS BEFORE BUT

20:55.521 --> 20:56.956
NOT AS DEFAULT.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.091
WE'RE SEEING IT ON CAMERA

20:59.091 --> 21:01.527
REVOLUTION AND NOW ON PRIVACY SO

21:01.527 --> 21:04.930
THAT MIGHT USHER IN AN ERA WHERE

21:04.930 --> 21:07.466
PEOPLE MIGHT COMPETE ON PRIVACY

21:07.466 --> 21:08.834
FEATURES.

21:08.834 --> 21:12.404
>> APPLE CEO SAYING WE SELL

21:12.404 --> 21:13.606
DEVICES NOT YOUR DATA.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.908
>> THAT'S HIS DIFFERENTIATING

21:15.908 --> 21:17.076
POINT.

21:17.076 --> 21:19.378
NOT SELLING IT DIRECTLY BUT

21:19.378 --> 21:21.147
SELLING THE ADVERTISERS THE

21:21.147 --> 21:23.749
ABILITY TO ACCESS INFORMATION

21:23.749 --> 21:24.550
ABOUT YOU.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.085
YOU DON'T PAY GOOGLE ANYTHING

21:26.085 --> 21:29.388
THE WAY I'M PAYING IT SEEMS

21:29.388 --> 21:31.123
UNGODLY AMOUNTS TO APPLE ALL THE

21:31.123 --> 21:32.124
TIME.

21:32.124 --> 21:34.560
>> TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

21:34.560 --> 21:37.630
WHY THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN ANY

21:37.630 --> 21:38.631
ENCRYPTION WE'VE DONE BEFORE?

21:38.631 --> 21:41.400
>> WE'VE ALWAYS HAD THE IDEA

21:41.400 --> 21:43.035
THAT THE INFORMATION AT HOME IS

21:43.035 --> 21:44.270
SECURE, IF YOU WANT IT YOU ARE

21:44.270 --> 21:46.105
GOING TO HAVE TO GET THAT DEVICE

21:46.105 --> 21:47.239
AND BREAK INTO IT.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.909
SO IT'S NOT THAT DIFFERENT.

21:49.909 --> 21:51.477
BUT THE ITEMS WE CALL AROUND

21:51.477 --> 21:56.715
WITH US, THEY GET SEIZED IN

21:56.715 --> 21:58.083
ARRESTS AND POLICE WOULD LIKE TO

21:58.083 --> 21:59.518
THUMB THROUGH THEM AND THEY CAN

21:59.518 --> 22:00.519
GET ALMOST ALL THAT INFORMATION

22:00.519 --> 22:01.220
THE OTHER WAYS.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.721
THEY CAN GO TO THE CELL PHONE

22:02.721 --> 22:03.822
CARRIER.

22:03.822 --> 22:05.791
IF THEY WANT TO KNOW WHO YOU'RE

22:05.791 --> 22:07.993
CALLING THE NSA HAS HANDY LOGS

22:07.993 --> 22:10.095
OF ALL THAT BUT LET'S SAY THE

22:10.095 --> 22:12.565
POLICE DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO NSA

22:12.565 --> 22:14.633
LOGS, THEY CAN GO TO AT&T OR

22:14.633 --> 22:17.002
VERIZON WITH A SEARCH WARRANT

22:17.002 --> 22:20.806
AND GET IT FROM THEM.

22:20.806 --> 22:25.711
>> JULIA ANGWIN, THANK YOU SO

22:25.711 --> 22:32.251
MUCH.

22:32.251 --> 22:33.385
