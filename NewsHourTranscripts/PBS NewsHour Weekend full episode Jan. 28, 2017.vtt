WHO HAS BEEN DETAINED.

05:38.438 --> 05:39.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:39.940 --> 05:41.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HOW MANY WOULD-BE IMMIGRANTS AND

05:57.958 --> 05:59.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:01.161 --> 06:02.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO ANYONE AT

ANY OFFICIALS, WHO HAVE TOLD YOU

06:06.366 --> 06:07.934 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT WHAT THEY KNOW AND WHAT

06:07.934 --> 06:12.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE?

06:12.005 --> 06:13.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT FEELS AS THOUGH THERE

06:13.106 --> 06:15.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALMOST ISN'T A PROCESS, AS

06:15.709 --> 06:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE

06:17.744 --> 06:20.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO PROCESS AND DEAL WITH

06:20.180 --> 06:21.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EXECUTIVE ORDERS AREN'T SURE

06:21.615 --> 06:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXACTLY HOW TO INTERPRET THEM.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT IT

06:24.351 --> 06:26.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPLIES TO GREEN CARD HOLDERS.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER PEOPLE THINK THAT IT ONLY

06:27.687 --> 06:29.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPLIES TO REFUGEES.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE'S A LOT OF-- A LOT OF

06:30.590 --> 06:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHAOS, A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY,

06:31.691 --> 06:33.026 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT THAT LEADS TO

06:33.026 --> 06:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONGER DETENTION TIMES, EVEN FOR

06:34.894 --> 06:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

NAFTA'S RENEGOTIATION IMMINENT,

17:40.760 --> 17:42.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEXAS BUSINESS LEADERS LIKE

ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT THE FUTURE

OF NAFTA?

17:48.367 --> 17:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I MEAN, MAYBE "WORRIED" IS

17:50.536 --> 17:52.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A-- TOO BIG OF A WORD.

17:52.471 --> 17:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THAT THE PURE REALITY OF

17:55.641 --> 17:57.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAFTA IS GOING TO SHOW THE

17:57.576 --> 18:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFITS OF NAFTA, AND THE

18:00.279 --> 18:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSEQUENCES OF DISMANTLING

18:01.948 --> 18:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NAFTA WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO

18:04.283 --> 18:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THREE COUNTRIES.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THIS THING HAS SUCH A

18:08.387 --> 18:11.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MASSIVELY INTERCONNECTED,

18:11.657 --> 18:13.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

18:13.059 --> 18:15.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE IT APART.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ALMOST LIKE HUMPTY DUMPTY,

18:38.751 --> 18:39.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T REDUCE THE VIOLENCE IN THE

CITY, HE'D "SEND IN THE FEDS."

18:42.755 --> 18:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE 4,000 SHOOTINGS AND

NEARLY 800 GUN HOMICIDES THERE

LAST YEAR.

18:47.259 --> 18:48.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

I AM JOINED FROM CHICAGO BY "USA

AAMER, TO DESCRIBE WHAT WAS

19:04.443 --> 19:06.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING ON IN CHICAGO, PRESIDENT

19:06.779 --> 19:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP USED THE WORD "CARNAGE,"

19:08.114 --> 19:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH QUITE LITERALLY MEANS,

19:09.782 --> 19:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGE-SCALE KILLING OF PEOPLE.

19:11.450 --> 19:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IN THIS INSTANCE IT MIGHT

19:12.618 --> 19:13.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY BE THE ACCURATE WORD TO

19:13.953 --> 19:14.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
USE.

19:14.954 --> 19:17.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT CHICAGO

19:17.289 --> 19:18.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE'RE HAVING THESE KIND OF

19:18.457 --> 19:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBERS?

19:19.625 --> 19:21.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, WHAT'S UNIQUE ABOUT

19:21.127 --> 19:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHICAGO IS THAT I THINK SORT OF

19:23.295 --> 19:25.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS

19:25.131 --> 19:28.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE SAW IN THE '90s AND

19:28.067 --> 19:29.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATE '80s, IN THE MIDST OF THE

THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS THAT

19:32.972 --> 19:35.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSED THOSE SPIKES IN VIOLENCE

19:35.141 --> 19:36.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAVE GONE DOWN ELSEWHERE IN

19:36.809 --> 19:37.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIG CITIES LIKE NEW YORK AND

19:37.810 --> 19:39.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:39.478 --> 19:40.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDRESSED HERE.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE THING THAT UPSET PEOPLE WAS

19:44.817 --> 19:45.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S POTENTIAL

19:45.918 --> 19:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLUTION.

19:46.652 --> 19:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S REALLY VAGUE, YOU KNOW,

19:47.653 --> 19:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAYS, "I'M GOING TO SEND THE

19:48.654 --> 19:49.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEDS IN."

19:49.655 --> 19:50.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THAT MEAN I'M GOING TO

19:50.990 --> 19:52.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORDER NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS IN

19:52.158 --> 19:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STREETS?

19:53.159 --> 19:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THAT MEAN I'M GOING TO RUSH

19:56.162 --> 19:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A BUNCH OF FEDERAL MONEY TO YOUR

19:57.997 --> 19:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY?

19:59.165 --> 20:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES IT MEAN SOMETHING ELSE?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT

20:02.835 --> 20:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEWILDERMENT AND CONFUSION.

20:04.670 --> 20:05.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: THE MURDER RATE

20:05.671 --> 20:07.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW IS NOT AS HIGH AS IT WAS IN

20:07.506 --> 20:10.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE '90s, BUT THERE WAS A DIP,

20:10.342 --> 20:13.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SORT OF AROUND 2005-ISH TO 2013,

20:13.012 --> 20:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE IT WENT DOWN QUITE A BIT.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS GOING ON THERE, AND CAN

20:17.016 --> 20:19.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT BE REPLICATED?

20:19.185 --> 20:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THE DIP REPLICATED

20:20.352 --> 20:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT YOU SAW IN A LOT OF CITIES.

20:24.023 --> 20:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A DYNAMIC IN CHICAGO

20:25.357 --> 20:26.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH A DEMOLITION OF HOUSING

20:26.692 --> 20:29.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROJECTS AND HOW THAT HAS SORT

20:29.195 --> 20:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DISJOINTED GANGS IN THE CITY,

20:32.364 --> 20:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S BEEN MUCH MORE

20:33.199 --> 20:35.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT TO GET A HANDLE ON.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER ASPECT IN CHICAGO AS

20:37.369 --> 20:39.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL HAS BEEN THE RELEASE OF THE

20:39.638 --> 20:41.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAQUAN McDONALD VIDEOS.

20:41.207 --> 20:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY

20:45.377 --> 20:47.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE POLICE, BUT THAT TENSION

20:47.379 --> 20:49.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS EXACERBATED AFTER THAT.

20:49.648 --> 20:50.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OTHER ASPECT THAT

20:50.883 --> 20:52.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICIANS HERE WOULD ALSO TALK

20:52.218 --> 20:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT IS THAT THE GUN LAWS, THEY

20:55.054 --> 20:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:05.731 --> 21:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS THAT WISE, GIVEN THE

FINANCIAL PREDICAMENT CHICAGO IS

FIGHT.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, THEY THINK THIS IS A

STARTING POINT.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, ALSO, I THINK THERE'S THIS

21:23.415 --> 21:26.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELEMENT THAT THIS CAN'T BE DONE

21:26.085 --> 21:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
