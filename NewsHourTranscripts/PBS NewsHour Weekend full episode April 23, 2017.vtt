PARTY IN PARLIAMENT.

05:06.133 --> 05:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONLY MEANS TO HAVE A CHECK

05:08.966 --> 05:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE PRESIDENT IS TO FORM A

MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT IN TURKEY

05:15.833 --> 05:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ABLE TO SHOW THERE WAS A VERY

05:31.066 --> 05:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:41.833 --> 05:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED TO CREATE A STABILITY AND

05:44.033 --> 05:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

FOR THIS CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGE

05:48.966 --> 05:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD CENTRALIZE POWER OF

05:50.366 --> 05:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENT.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
