WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:08.075
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.075 --> 00:14.214
On tonight's "NewsHour": a major
shakeup in the Republican Party
in Congress. The speaker

00:14.214 --> 00:21.455
of the House, John Boehner,
resigns. We explore what it
means for politics and policy.

00:21.455 --> 00:26.760
Also ahead: Pope Francis at the
United Nations calls for peace,
justice and protecting the

00:26.760 --> 00:28.662
environment.

00:28.662 --> 00:33.600
Then, with climate change and
cyber-security at the forefront,
China's president visits

00:33.600 --> 00:36.770
the White House.

00:36.770 --> 00:42.442
And it's Friday. Mark Shields
and David Brooks are here to
analyze a full week of news.

00:42.442 --> 00:48.949
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:48.949 --> 00:53.587
(BREAK)

00:53.587 --> 01:03.530
JUDY WOODRUFF: On this day, when
a pope and two presidents were
already making headlines,

01:03.530 --> 01:08.302
a surprise resignation came
along to stun Washington.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.337
We begin with the announcement
that the speaker of the United
States House of Representatives

01:10.337 --> 01:12.539
is stepping down.

01:12.539 --> 01:15.776
"NewsHour" political director
Lisa Desjardins reports.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.979
REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH),
Speaker of the House (singing):
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, my, oh, my,

01:18.979 --> 01:22.349
what a wonderful day.

01:22.349 --> 01:25.819
LISA DESJARDINS: With his
decision, House Speaker John
Boehner, the happy warrior,
projected

01:25.819 --> 01:29.356
a kind of personal relief and
institutional sacrifice.

01:29.356 --> 01:35.629
REP. JOHN BOEHNER: It's become
clear to me that this prolonged
leadership turmoil would

01:35.629 --> 01:42.135
do irreparable harm to the
institution. So, this morning, I
informed my colleagues that

01:42.135 --> 01:46.740
I would resign from the
speakership and resign from
Congress at the end of October.
Now,

01:46.740 --> 01:51.445
as you have often heard me
say, this isn't about me.

01:51.445 --> 01:56.383
LISA DESJARDINS: In fact, it had
become about him, at least in
part. Boehner was again under

01:56.383 --> 02:01.788
fire from Tea Party Republicans
pushing to defund Planned
Parenthood, even if it means

02:01.788 --> 02:06.226
closing the government. They'd
threatened a floor vote to try
to strip him of the speakership.

02:06.226 --> 02:08.695
REP. JOHN BOEHNER: There was
never any doubt about whether I
could survive the vote, but

02:08.695 --> 02:12.099
I don't want my members to
have to go through this.

02:12.099 --> 02:16.470
LISA DESJARDINS: The Ohio
Republican said he'd planned to
resign at the end of this

02:16.470 --> 02:20.774
year anyway, after five years as
speaker and midway through his
13th term.

02:20.774 --> 02:24.144
But his bombshell left House
supporters lamenting their loss.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.413
REP. STEVE STIVERS (R), Ohio: I
think he has always been the
adult in the room and tried

02:26.413 --> 02:30.650
to do what he thinks is right,
even if it is not in his best
political interest.

02:30.650 --> 02:33.387
LISA DESJARDINS: Boehner's
counterpart in the Senate,
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,

02:33.387 --> 02:35.822
praised the speaker's legacy.

02:35.822 --> 02:41.061
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: He is an ally;
he's a friend. And he took

02:41.061 --> 02:46.500
over as Republican leader at a
very difficult time for his
party.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.570
LISA DESJARDINS: At the White
House, the nation's top Democrat
offered his own measured praise

02:50.570 --> 02:54.241
for a man who'd opposed
most of his agenda.

02:54.241 --> 02:59.780
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: He is somebody
who has been gracious, and

02:59.780 --> 03:06.420
I think, maybe most importantly,
he's somebody who understands
that, in government, in
governance,

03:06.420 --> 03:09.156
you don't always get 100
percent of what you want.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.458
LISA DESJARDINS: But at a
conservative summit in
Washington, when Senator Marco
Rubio brought

03:11.458 --> 03:13.960
up the speaker:

03:13.960 --> 03:15.195
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate: Just a
few minutes ago, Speaker Boehner
announced

03:15.195 --> 03:16.096
that he will be resigning.

03:16.096 --> 03:17.664
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:17.664 --> 03:21.401
LISA DESJARDINS:
The crowd cheered.

03:21.401 --> 03:25.405
Back at the Capitol, House
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi
called the resignation seismic

03:25.405 --> 03:28.708
and symbolic of problems
in Boehner's party.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.144
REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader: That
resignation of the speaker is a
stark

03:31.144 --> 03:37.217
indication of the disarray of
the House Republicans, a
demonstration of their obsession
with shutting

03:37.217 --> 03:41.655
down government at the
expense of women's health.

03:41.655 --> 03:46.526
LISA DESJARDINS: Now, the focus
turns to the new Republican
leadership races, with Boehner's

03:46.526 --> 03:51.798
number two, Kevin McCarthy of
California, an early candidate
to replace him as speaker.

03:51.798 --> 03:55.902
Many, like Georgia's Lynn
Westmoreland, are contemplating
whether to run for other
leadership

03:55.902 --> 03:59.673
spots, but are unsure what
the changes will mean.

03:59.673 --> 04:03.810
Do you think a different speaker
would produce a different
outcome for House Republicans?

04:03.810 --> 04:06.513
REP. LYNN WESTMORELAND (R),
Georgia: No, I think the outcome
is going to be the same.

04:06.513 --> 04:11.151
LISA DESJARDINS: The leadership
elections are expected to take
place November 1.

04:11.151 --> 04:15.522
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will get more
insight into what drove
Boehner's decision and how it's

04:15.522 --> 04:18.859
being received in just a moment.

04:18.859 --> 04:25.632
Meanwhile, in other news,
recriminations set in after the
deadly stampede in Saudi Arabia

04:25.632 --> 04:32.305
that left at least 719 Muslim
pilgrims crushed to death. It
happened yesterday at Mina, just

04:32.305 --> 04:36.510
outside Mecca, where more than
two million people are taking
part in the annual Islamic

04:36.510 --> 04:39.813
pilgrimage known as the hajj.

04:39.813 --> 04:43.483
Lindsey Hilsum of Independent
Television News has our report.

04:43.483 --> 04:47.354
LINDSEY HILSUM: King Salman of
Saudi Arabia received pilgrims'
representatives at his

04:47.354 --> 04:52.659
palace in Mina today.

04:52.659 --> 04:58.932
He talked of Arab and Islamic
unity and of preventing hidden
hands from causing mischief

04:58.932 --> 05:06.339
in Muslim lands. Not all the
faithful will accept that.
Amateur video shot yesterday

05:06.339 --> 05:13.313
shows emergency workers amongst
piles of bodies. Other footage
shows people waiting to enter

05:13.313 --> 05:23.356
the Jamarat yesterday. One gate
is opened, the crowd presses in
the danger is obvious.

05:23.356 --> 05:28.428
Dissident voices say there's
little chance of a transparent
investigation. That's just

05:28.428 --> 05:36.436
not the Saudi government's
priority. In Tehran, they were
protesting about the 131
Iranians

05:36.436 --> 05:44.844
who were killed in Mina. "Death
to the Saudi monarchy," she
shouted, but this grief is

05:44.844 --> 05:50.417
orchestrated, not spontaneous.
Shiite Iran is Sunni Saudi
Arabia's sectarian and regional

05:50.417 --> 05:53.353
rival.

05:53.353 --> 05:59.392
The governments sponsor opposing
forces in Syria and Yemen.
Yesterday's tragedy will

05:59.392 --> 06:07.634
fuel antagonism and political
strife. Today, a official
pictures showed a calm scene a

06:07.634 --> 06:13.373
that Jamarat, while pilgrims
carried out the ritual stoning
of the devil. Some two million

06:13.373 --> 06:18.645
Muslims are staying in the
massive city of air-conditioned
tents in Mina.

06:18.645 --> 06:24.417
The Saudis have talked of
increasing the number next year.
Now the pilgrims will move
towards

06:24.417 --> 06:30.957
Mecca, despite the danger, the
acrimony and the grief for those
who lost their lives.

06:30.957 --> 06:34.995
JUDY WOODRUFF: Saudi officials
say they expect the death toll
to rise, as they continue
counting

06:34.995 --> 06:37.931
bodies.

06:37.931 --> 06:44.204
The head of soccer's world body,
FIFA, President Sepp Blatter,
now faces a criminal
investigation

06:44.204 --> 06:49.709
for alleged corruption.
Authorities in Switzerland
interrogated Blatter today and
searched his

06:49.709 --> 06:54.547
office. U.S. and Swiss officials
announced in May they're looking
into corruption at

06:54.547 --> 07:00.654
the sport's highest levels.
After that, Blatter said he will
step down early next year.

07:00.654 --> 07:05.959
In Europe's migrant crisis, the
prime minister of Hungary
promised today to consult with

07:05.959 --> 07:12.332
neighboring states before
closing his border with Croatia.
But Hungary also neared
completion

07:12.332 --> 07:18.104
of a fence on that border, where
thousands have crossed in recent
days. Thousands more

07:18.104 --> 07:23.543
are crossing Serbia to get to
Croatia. A top European official
was there today to witness

07:23.543 --> 07:25.945
the influx firsthand.

07:25.945 --> 07:30.884
JOHANNES HAHN, European
Commission: It's a global
problem, and we can only give a
European

07:30.884 --> 07:40.660
answer. It's not something where
we can leave only one country
with itself to resolve the

07:40.660 --> 07:48.668
problem. This problem can only
be managed if we are all working
together.

07:48.668 --> 07:54.107
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, there
was trouble in Finland, where
dozens of protesters threw

07:54.107 --> 07:59.446
stones and set off fireworks at
a bus carrying foreign asylum
seekers. The government
condemned

07:59.446 --> 08:02.782
the violence.

08:02.782 --> 08:07.420
Back in the U.S., the
Environmental Protection Agency
announced auto emissions testing
is

08:07.420 --> 08:12.559
going to get more stringent.
EPA's head of air quality said
the agency wants to know

08:12.559 --> 08:18.998
if other automakers also cheated
on the tests, as Volkswagen has
admitted doing. The head

08:18.998 --> 08:24.738
of V.W. has resigned, and today,
Matthias Mueller, who now runs
V.W.'s Porsche unit,

08:24.738 --> 08:29.109
was named the company's new CEO.

08:29.109 --> 08:35.048
California today reimposed the
United States' toughest carbon
emission standard. It mandates

08:35.048 --> 08:40.720
cutting transportation fuel
emissions by 10 percent within
five years. And it counts the

08:40.720 --> 08:45.625
pollution generated by producing
the fuel, as well as by driving.
The issue's been on

08:45.625 --> 08:50.864
hold since 2009 because
of legal challenges.

08:50.864 --> 08:55.802
And on Wall Street, stocks had
an up and down day. The Dow
Jones industrial average gained

08:55.802 --> 09:05.745
113 points to close near 16315.
The Nasdaq fell 48 points, and
the S&P 500 slipped one

09:05.745 --> 09:10.417
point. For the week, the Dow
lost a fraction of a percent,
the Nasdaq fell nearly 3
percent,

09:10.417 --> 09:14.754
and the S&P shed 1.5 percent.

09:14.754 --> 09:18.925
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what Speaker Boehner's
resignation means for the future

09:18.925 --> 09:26.699
of Congress; Pope Francis' call
for peace and justice at the
U.N.; climate and cyber-security

09:26.699 --> 09:30.904
top China's president's visit to
the White House; Shields and
Brooks analyze the week's

09:30.904 --> 09:43.683
news, and much more.

09:43.683 --> 09:47.487
We return now to the resignation
of House Speaker John Boehner
and how it's seen by

09:47.487 --> 09:50.790
the most conservative
members of the House.

09:50.790 --> 09:56.596
A short time ago, I spoke with
Republican Congressman Reid
Ribble of Wisconsin.

09:56.596 --> 10:00.099
Representative Ribble,
welcome to the "NewsHour."

10:00.099 --> 10:05.138
You were part of a small group
of conservative House members
who met with Speaker Boehner

10:05.138 --> 10:07.907
yesterday. Was his resignation
a result of that meeting?

10:07.907 --> 10:10.210
REP. REID RIBBLE (R),
Wisconsin: Oh, not at all.

10:10.210 --> 10:15.949
In fact, that whole idea didn't
even come up in the meeting. All
of us were quite surprised

10:15.949 --> 10:21.654
this morning. Even Kevin
McCarthy mentioned that he was
told only moments before. And

10:21.654 --> 10:28.428
so, it caught us all off-guard.
The resignation or the speaker's
position wasn't part of our

10:28.428 --> 10:30.597
discussion with the
speaker yesterday.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.333
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think this
is a good thing for the House of
Representatives?

10:33.333 --> 10:36.569
REP. REID RIBBLE: Certainly,
there has been a lot of concern
about maintaining the status

10:36.569 --> 10:38.938
quo here.

10:38.938 --> 10:44.878
I personally thought the speaker
was doing a pretty good job
trying to manage the very

10:44.878 --> 10:51.184
diverse opinions within this
conference. There's 247
Republicans, and they span the
political

10:51.184 --> 10:54.854
breadth of Republicanism in this
country. And it's difficult to
get them all to agree

10:54.854 --> 10:58.358
on a particular
tactic or strategy.

10:58.358 --> 11:03.496
And so I felt pretty good about
how the speaker was trying to
advance our principles, but,

11:03.496 --> 11:06.299
clearly, there was
some dissatisfaction.

11:06.299 --> 11:12.205
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there has
been rejoicing among many
conservatives. We know there was

11:12.205 --> 11:17.510
a standing ovation at the Values
Voters Summit gathering. We know
a number of the conservative

11:17.510 --> 11:20.813
House members have said they
think this is a good thing.

11:20.813 --> 11:27.120
I guess my question is, you're
still dealing with a Democratic
president. The Senate is

11:27.120 --> 11:34.160
a different place from the
House. How do conservatives in
the Republican Caucus get what
they want

11:34.160 --> 11:36.362
now? How is it going to be
any different or any better?

11:36.362 --> 11:39.499
REP. REID RIBBLE: You know, I
think the one thing that
conservatives are going to ask

11:39.499 --> 11:43.269
for is a more strict
adherence to regular order.

11:43.269 --> 11:48.107
I think we often accept not
getting our perfect solution
when we feel we have been part
of

11:48.107 --> 11:52.612
the process, that the process
itself has been followed
correctly, that members have a
chance

11:52.612 --> 11:55.315
to offer amendments to bills
that come to the floor. I think
those were some of the

11:55.315 --> 11:58.851
things that were
creating some anxiety.

11:58.851 --> 12:03.389
But the reality is, as you just
mentioned, we do have a
Democratic president, we don't

12:03.389 --> 12:08.795
have a supermajority in the
Senate, and so we're going to
try to advance a conservative

12:08.795 --> 12:11.731
agenda forward through the
House, and we will just see what
Mitch McConnell can do over

12:11.731 --> 12:13.700
in the Senate.

12:13.700 --> 12:17.904
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this a win,
though, right now for House
conservatives?

12:17.904 --> 12:20.807
REP. REID RIBBLE: Well, I don't
know that -- I don't know that
any of us -- I suppose

12:20.807 --> 12:24.811
there are some that would say
it's a win. I'm not necessarily
looking at it as a win.

12:24.811 --> 12:29.282
But I do know this, that every
single time that you change
somebody in leadership -- I

12:29.282 --> 12:33.353
know this happened in my company
before I came to Congress and
now -- when you have

12:33.353 --> 12:39.258
a chance to change some people,
you shake up the status quo, you
force us to look at

12:39.258 --> 12:42.462
things through maybe a little
different lens and different
prism. And so we might end up

12:42.462 --> 12:45.031
with a different result.

12:45.031 --> 12:50.236
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is our
understanding, though, that,
right now, the thing that
conservatives

12:50.236 --> 12:55.842
wanted most, and that is for
Planned Parenthood not to be
funded, is not going to happen,

12:55.842 --> 12:59.178
that there apparently is going
to be an agreement that it will
be funded for the time being.

12:59.178 --> 13:01.981
So how is that a positive in
the mind of conservatives?

13:01.981 --> 13:04.017
REP. REID RIBBLE: Yes.

13:04.017 --> 13:07.220
Well, I think there's a couple
things -- I think there's a
couple of very fluid dynamics

13:07.220 --> 13:13.192
going on. First of all, a couple
of the major national
right-to-life organizations have

13:13.192 --> 13:16.996
asked members of Congress like
myself not to shut down the
government over the funding

13:16.996 --> 13:20.767
of Planned Parenthood, but to
continue to try to make the case
for the American people,

13:20.767 --> 13:24.137
so that you can win the hearts
and minds of the American
people.

13:24.137 --> 13:30.910
I thought the pope spoke out
forcibly yesterday and
forcefully on the issue of
pro-life, where

13:30.910 --> 13:35.348
he said that we should respect
life at every stage of
development. And so I think
there's

13:35.348 --> 13:39.919
still some seizing that goes on.
We have another bite at this
apple in December, when we do

13:39.919 --> 13:43.189
the full funding for the year.

13:43.189 --> 13:47.593
We have some opportunity to --
again to expose the practices of
Planned Parenthood in the

13:47.593 --> 13:50.063
next 60 days. So, we will see
what happens from there.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.932
JUDY WOODRUFF: Representative
Reid Ribble of Wisconsin, we
thank you.

13:52.932 --> 13:55.501
REP. REID RIBBLE: You're very
welcome. It's good to be with
you.

13:55.501 --> 13:59.338
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, for more,
let's turn to our political
director, Lisa Desjardins, whom

13:59.338 --> 14:03.409
we have heard from just a moment
ago. She is now on Capitol Hill.

14:03.409 --> 14:06.412
So, Lisa, is there anything more
we need to understand about why
Boehner did this right

14:06.412 --> 14:08.347
now?

14:08.347 --> 14:13.319
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, I think
that one major factor, Judy, was
the meeting that Representative

14:13.319 --> 14:17.690
Ribble was in yesterday with
some of the most conservative
members of the House.

14:17.690 --> 14:21.427
My understanding is that they
let the speaker know that they
were going to make their move

14:21.427 --> 14:26.332
against him, they were going to
call a vote basically
questioning his speakership on
the

14:26.332 --> 14:32.205
floor of the House, and that
that essentially sparked
Boehner's decision to resign,
rather

14:32.205 --> 14:34.774
than force that vote. He
mentioned that today, and I
think that's exactly why this is
happening

14:34.774 --> 14:36.609
now.

14:36.609 --> 14:41.214
JUDY WOODRUFF: You gave us a
sense in your report of what the
reaction is. I mean, overall,

14:41.214 --> 14:45.184
shock, surprise, disappointment,
a mixture? What?

14:45.184 --> 14:48.254
LISA DESJARDINS: Very surprised
from all corners, even from
those conservatives who were
trying

14:48.254 --> 14:51.424
to push back at Boehner.

14:51.424 --> 14:56.295
But I think there is certainly a
very stark difference in
reaction between Boehner
supporters,

14:56.295 --> 15:01.100
which may even be the majority
of his conference. Some of them
are frankly outraged, Judy. You

15:01.100 --> 15:04.570
could hear even just asking
questions about other things on
the phone to some of their

15:04.570 --> 15:08.508
supporters today how mad
and bitter they are.

15:08.508 --> 15:15.281
They're worried that a minority
of their conference is using
these hard tactics to push out,
they

15:15.281 --> 15:19.585
think, strong leadership. But
then, from conservatives, there
is more of a sense of relief and
a sense

15:19.585 --> 15:24.190
of hope. But what there is not,
I don't think, from anyone, Judy
-- and it's notable -- is

15:24.190 --> 15:29.362
a sense of exactly what the
long-term plan is here, how this
caucus that remains divided

15:29.362 --> 15:34.100
governs, especially, as you
asked Representative Ribble,
with a Democratic president and
a

15:34.100 --> 15:37.303
Senate that doesn't have enough
votes to pass controversial
legislation.

15:37.303 --> 15:41.340
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, do you --
what's your understanding that
conservatives think is

15:41.340 --> 15:43.142
going to change, is going to be
better? You heard Representative
Ribble say, well, there's

15:43.142 --> 15:45.945
going to be more
following regular order.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.113
I think most people don't
understand what that means.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.282
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

15:49.282 --> 15:53.519
What that means is that most --
that they're hoping that
conservatives will be able to

15:53.519 --> 15:58.991
put more amendments on the floor
and at least get up-or-down
votes on their ideas. They

15:58.991 --> 16:03.362
think that there perhaps weren't
enough votes recently on
different versions of defunding

16:03.362 --> 16:07.700
Obamacare. Obviously, we know,
in years past, there were many
votes on defunding Obamacare.

16:07.700 --> 16:12.305
But conservatives want to put
more issues on the floor. They
want more amendments. They

16:12.305 --> 16:14.440
don't seem to believe that
they're going to win out in the
end, but they seem to just

16:14.440 --> 16:18.077
want at least a chance to vent.

16:18.077 --> 16:25.017
Now, as to the endgame, I asked
Speaker Boehner today how he
thought his stepping down would

16:25.017 --> 16:29.222
lead away from turmoil, would
lead to a more stable House
Republican Party, and his answer

16:29.222 --> 16:32.525
at the end was, hope
springs eternal.

16:32.525 --> 16:36.863
I think that speaks again, Judy,
to the fact that this is just a
place that is frustrated

16:36.863 --> 16:40.333
and these are House Republicans
trying something different.

16:40.333 --> 16:45.071
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, just
quickly, it looks like Kevin
McCarthy, the majority leader,

16:45.071 --> 16:47.473
front-runner for the
speakership, but the rest of it
is up in the air.

16:47.473 --> 16:49.675
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

16:49.675 --> 16:54.280
I think Kevin McCarthy is
clearly the man to beat right
now. There is -- there was an

16:54.280 --> 16:57.016
announcement I just got in the
past few minutes from Florida
Representative Daniel Webster.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.685
He's thrown his hat in the ring.

16:59.685 --> 17:04.790
But I don't think he is right
now going to beat out Kevin
McCarthy. The other races are

17:04.790 --> 17:09.962
going to be rather close, and
especially to see this
conservative vs. more moderate
wing.

17:09.962 --> 17:14.267
And I think, Judy, it's
interesting that, in the past
four years, all three of the top

17:14.267 --> 17:17.203
three positions in the top
Republican Party will have had
new faces. That's a big deal.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.705
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, a
wild day at the Capitol.

17:19.705 --> 17:23.075
Lisa Desjardins, thanks.

17:23.075 --> 17:30.783
LISA DESJARDINS: Thank you.

17:30.783 --> 17:38.291
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pope Francis
delivered a strong and sweeping
call today for action to address

17:38.291 --> 17:43.496
climate change, making the case
before a global summit in Paris
this November.

17:43.496 --> 17:48.267
It was part of a wide-ranging
speech that took sharp aim at
materialism and warned of

17:48.267 --> 17:50.903
further suffering for
the poorest citizens.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.740
Hari Sreenivasan has the
story from New York City.

17:54.740 --> 18:02.148
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fresh from two
days in Washington, the pope
moved to a global audience, the
193

18:02.148 --> 18:05.518
member states of the United
Nations General Assembly.

18:05.518 --> 18:10.256
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through translator): We
cannot permit ourselves to

18:10.256 --> 18:14.593
postpone certain agendas for the
future. The future demands of us
critical and global decisions

18:14.593 --> 18:17.863
in the face of
worldwide conflicts.

18:17.863 --> 18:22.535
HARI SREENIVASAN: In his native
Spanish, Francis called again
for a unified response to
crises,

18:22.535 --> 18:26.038
especially threats
to the Earth itself.

18:26.038 --> 18:34.113
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): A true right of the
environment does exist. Any harm

18:34.113 --> 18:37.550
done to the environment,
therefore, is a harm done to
humanity.

18:37.550 --> 18:41.754
HARI SREENIVASAN: Climate change
has been a recurring theme in
the pontiff's first U.S.

18:41.754 --> 18:46.359
visit. And, today, he tied it to
another issue that's central to
his papacy, social and economic

18:46.359 --> 18:48.761
injustice.

18:48.761 --> 18:55.301
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): The misuse and
destruction of the environment
are also

18:55.301 --> 19:01.340
accompanied by a relentless
process of exclusion. In effect,
a selfish and boundless thirst

19:01.340 --> 19:05.778
for power and material
prosperity leads both to the
misuse of available natural
resources

19:05.778 --> 19:09.548
and to the exclusion of the
weak and disadvantaged.

19:09.548 --> 19:14.653
HARI SREENIVASAN: Instead, he
insisted, the less fortunate
must become -- quote --
"dignified

19:14.653 --> 19:20.292
agents of their own destiny,"
with basic rights to lodging,
labor and land and to education

19:20.292 --> 19:25.765
for all. The pope also appealed
for a safer world for all
humanity, free of nuclear
weapons,

19:25.765 --> 19:29.368
and he praised the nuclear
agreement with Iran.

19:29.368 --> 19:32.905
But he lamented the failure to
stop the wars in the Middle East
and Eastern Europe, and

19:32.905 --> 19:36.609
the resulting
floods of refugees.

19:36.609 --> 19:44.717
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): In wars and
conflicts, there are individual
persons,

19:44.717 --> 19:50.189
our brothers and sisters, men
and women, young and old, boys
and girls who weep, suffer and

19:50.189 --> 19:54.393
die, human beings who are easily
discarded when our only response
is to draw up lists

19:54.393 --> 19:57.830
of problems, strategies
and disagreements.

19:57.830 --> 20:03.402
HARI SREENIVASAN: From the U.N.,
Francis traveled to Ground Zero,
where he led a moment of silence

20:03.402 --> 20:07.673
for those killed in the
September 11 attacks. He left a
white rose on the memorial's
reflecting

20:07.673 --> 20:12.745
pool that's etched with
the names of those lost.

20:12.745 --> 20:17.917
And in the site's underground
museum, he shared the stage with
clerics of various faiths.

20:17.917 --> 20:22.388
POPE FRANCIS (through
translator): For all our
differences and disagreements,
we can

20:22.388 --> 20:28.327
live in a world of peace. In
opposing every attempt to create
a rigid uniformity, we can

20:28.327 --> 20:33.499
and must build unity on the
basis of our diversity of
languages, cultures and
religions.

20:33.499 --> 20:38.237
HARI SREENIVASAN: The pope also
visited a Catholic school in
East Harlem this afternoon,

20:38.237 --> 20:44.844
then motorcaded through Central
Park, where up to 80,000 people
looked on.

20:44.844 --> 20:48.814
The final stop of the day is
just a couple of blocks behind
me at Madison Square Garden,

20:48.814 --> 20:53.919
where the pope will celebrate
mass with about 18,000 people.
Tomorrow, he heads to
Philadelphia

20:53.919 --> 20:58.324
to lead a summit with thousands
of families and wrap up his U.S.
tour.

20:58.324 --> 21:00.392
In New York City, I'm Hari
Sreenivasan for the "PBS
NewsHour" -- Judy.

21:00.392 --> 21:03.262
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks, Hari.

21:03.262 --> 21:09.401
And you can explore all of our
coverage of Pope Francis' visit
online at PBS.org/NewsHour.

21:09.401 --> 21:15.241
You can also download our new
app for iPhone or Android.

21:15.241 --> 21:27.753
Stay with us.

21:27.753 --> 21:32.992
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
unique mentorship to make
beautiful music; plus the
analysis

21:32.992 --> 21:36.695
of Mark Shields
and David Brooks.

21:36.695 --> 21:42.902
But, first, climate change was
also a top priority at the White
House today, when President

21:42.902 --> 21:47.940
Obama and Chinese President Xi
Jinping found common ground. But
important issues still

21:47.940 --> 21:53.045
divide them.

21:53.045 --> 21:57.650
It was President Xi's first
state visit to Washington, and
it began with all the pageantry

21:57.650 --> 21:59.919
the White House can muster.

21:59.919 --> 22:01.420
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: On behalf of the
American people, welcome

22:01.420 --> 22:03.622
to the United States.

22:03.622 --> 22:07.426
JUDY WOODRUFF: The leaders of
the world's two largest
economies headlined cooperation

22:07.426 --> 22:09.862
on climate change.

22:09.862 --> 22:14.300
BARACK OBAMA: Today, I want to
commend China for announcing
that it will begin a national

22:14.300 --> 22:19.538
market-based cap-and-trade
system to limit emissions from
some of its largest sectors.

22:19.538 --> 22:24.243
JUDY WOODRUFF: There was also
formal agreement to clamp down
on cyber-attacks. President

22:24.243 --> 22:29.114
Xi said confrontation on the
issue is not the right choice.

22:29.114 --> 22:33.152
XI JINPING, Chinese President
(through translator): China and
the United States should
strengthen

22:33.152 --> 22:37.423
dialogue and cooperation. And
both governments will not engage
in or knowingly support online

22:37.423 --> 22:40.025
theft of intellectual
properties.

22:40.025 --> 22:44.663
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Mr. Obama
said China must make good on its
promises, or the U.S. could

22:44.663 --> 22:47.566
consider new sanctions.

22:47.566 --> 22:53.272
BARACK OBAMA: What I have said
to President Xi and what I say
to the American people is,

22:53.272 --> 22:57.810
the question now is, are
words followed by actions?

22:57.810 --> 23:04.016
JUDY WOODRUFF: Beijing's
aggressive territorial claims in
the South China Sea also loomed

23:04.016 --> 23:09.355
large in today's discussions.
President Xi called again for
cooperation, even as he defended

23:09.355 --> 23:11.824
his nation's actions.

23:11.824 --> 23:17.630
XI JINPING (through translator):
China is committed to the path
of peaceful development

23:17.630 --> 23:22.034
and a foreign policy
characterized by good
neighborliness and partnership
with our neighbors.

23:22.034 --> 23:26.839
Islands in the South China Sea
since ancient times are China's
territory. We have the right

23:26.839 --> 23:29.975
to uphold our territorial
sovereignty and lawful and
legitimate maritime rights and

23:29.975 --> 23:31.777
interests.

23:31.777 --> 23:37.283
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Chinese
leader likewise gave no ground
on his nation's human rights

23:37.283 --> 23:43.889
policies, saying, countries have
different historical processes
and realities.

23:43.889 --> 23:47.426
President Xi's visit to
Washington culminates tonight
with a formal state dinner at
the

23:47.426 --> 23:51.063
White House.

23:51.063 --> 23:56.068
For more on what they might and
might not be discussing at that
dinner, I'm joined by

23:56.068 --> 24:02.241
John Mearsheimer, a professor at
the University of Chicago and
former Air Force officer. Susan

24:02.241 --> 24:07.846
Shirk, she was a deputy
assistant secretary of state for
China in the Clinton
administration.

24:07.846 --> 24:13.886
She now chairs the 21st Century
China Program at the University
of California, San Diego.

24:13.886 --> 24:17.756
And Christopher Johnson, a
senior adviser who closely
watches China at the Center for

24:17.756 --> 24:19.925
Strategic and
International Studies.

24:19.925 --> 24:23.862
Welcome, all three,
to the program.

24:23.862 --> 24:29.401
Let's talk first about what was
accomplished, China signing on
to this climate change
agreement,

24:29.401 --> 24:33.138
so-called cap-and-trade system,
Susan Shirk, wherein they limit
how much an industry can

24:33.138 --> 24:35.908
pollute. How
significant is this?

24:35.908 --> 24:38.277
SUSAN SHIRK, University of
California, San Diego: Well,
it's very significant because

24:38.277 --> 24:44.483
air pollution has become a
domestic political problem in
China.

24:44.483 --> 24:48.721
And the Chinese leadership has,
therefore, gotten very serious
about its commitments

24:48.721 --> 24:55.194
on climate change, because these
two issues are very much
related. And to see China and

24:55.194 --> 25:00.999
the United States both making
strong commitments on climate
change going into the U.N.
climate

25:00.999 --> 25:01.333
summit...

25:01.333 --> 25:03.001
JUDY WOODRUFF: In...

25:03.001 --> 25:08.340
SUSAN SHIRK: ... in December is
-- sends a message that the two
countries can cooperate

25:08.340 --> 25:12.211
when their interests are
as aligned as this one.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.146
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christopher
Johnson, you see it as
important?

25:14.146 --> 25:13.946
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON, Center for
Strategic and International
Studies: Absolutely. I think

25:13.946 --> 25:15.814
so.

25:15.814 --> 25:19.451
And, as Susan pointed out, the
sort of message it sends for the
Paris conference is really

25:19.451 --> 25:20.986
the important piece here.

25:20.986 --> 25:23.288
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Mearsheimer,
what would you add on that?

25:23.288 --> 25:25.858
JOHN MEARSHEIMER, University of
Chicago: I agree, but this was
the easy one.

25:25.858 --> 25:29.828
The problem is that there are a
number of different issues here
that really matter,

25:29.828 --> 25:33.198
some more than this, and on a
lot of those issues, not much
progress was expected or

25:33.198 --> 25:34.099
made.

25:34.099 --> 25:36.468
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we
want to get to those.

25:36.468 --> 25:42.107
But I do want to ask you about
cyber-spying, John Mearsheimer.
The agreement they said

25:42.107 --> 25:46.945
they have made to clamp down on
cyber-spying, an agreement on
the theft of intellectual

25:46.945 --> 25:50.816
property, how important
is all that?

25:50.816 --> 25:54.753
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Well, it's
very important to emphasize that
there was no agreement on

25:54.753 --> 26:00.559
what one might call traditional
spying via cyber, so we can
continue to spy on them in

26:00.559 --> 26:04.663
the national security realm, and
they can continue to spy on us.

26:04.663 --> 26:09.668
But where there was an agreement
is on the economic front, and
they were obviously stealing

26:09.668 --> 26:14.206
lots of our economic secrets,
and we were not stealing hardly
any of theirs, and the

26:14.206 --> 26:17.643
end result is that the agreement
they came up with, if they can
enforce it, will be a

26:17.643 --> 26:20.045
good agreement for
the United States.

26:20.045 --> 26:20.979
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christopher
Johnson, how do you see that?

26:20.979 --> 26:23.148
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON: I agree.

26:23.148 --> 26:27.286
I think that the main value in
the agreement really is that it
starts to put some parameters

26:27.286 --> 26:30.856
around the discussion. And I
think what will see next, From
the U.S. point of view, is

26:30.856 --> 26:35.694
that when we have evidence --
and we will have evidence -- of
this economic espionage,

26:35.694 --> 26:39.731
we will then go to the Chinese
and say, under your commitments
of this new agreement, we

26:39.731 --> 26:43.202
expect to see prosecutions on
your side. And if those don't
happen, then we will move to

26:43.202 --> 26:46.271
sanction those firms or
individuals that have been
involved.

26:46.271 --> 26:51.610
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Shirk, what
about the areas now where they
didn't make much headway,

26:51.610 --> 26:57.149
China's territorial ambitions,
human rights? Was much expected
was going to happen in those

26:57.149 --> 26:59.084
areas anyway?

26:59.084 --> 27:05.023
SUSAN SHIRK: No, I don't think
we expected much to happen, and
not much did.

27:05.023 --> 27:13.031
On the -- China's maritime
claims in the South China Sea,
Xi Jinping has become so
strongly

27:13.031 --> 27:19.638
invested in those issues as a
focal point of domestic
nationalism, and it's a great

27:19.638 --> 27:25.777
way for him to get people to
rally around the flag and rally
around him at a time when

27:25.777 --> 27:30.449
the economy is growing more
slowly, there are potential
domestic discontents.

27:30.449 --> 27:39.091
So, it's just too attractive a
kind of -- it leads to tension
with your neighbors and tension

27:39.091 --> 27:41.827
with the U.S., but it
works for Him at home.

27:41.827 --> 27:46.765
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Mearsheimer,
so how much of a problem is it
for the United States,

27:46.765 --> 27:53.305
for U.S. allies like Japan,
Vietnam, that they didn't get
much done in that area?

27:53.305 --> 27:57.876
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Well, the
South China Sea is a huge
problem for the United States,
because

27:57.876 --> 28:04.082
our credibility in the region
really matters, and it's at
stake in this particular case.

28:04.082 --> 28:09.721
The Japanese are watching us
very carefully, because the
Japanese depend on us for
security,

28:09.721 --> 28:13.892
and it's our nuclear umbrella
that's over their heads, so they
want to know how tough

28:13.892 --> 28:16.862
we're going to be with the
Chinese if the Chinese begin to
push. And the Chinese are

28:16.862 --> 28:21.266
pushing in the South China Sea.

28:21.266 --> 28:26.038
They have very ambitious goals,
and the United States has really
not drawn any lines in the

28:26.038 --> 28:30.342
sand up to this point. And I
think at some point, we're going
to have to do that, and

28:30.342 --> 28:33.045
I think it's going to get
very messy at that time.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.114
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christopher
Johnson, is the U.S. any closer
to drawing a line?

28:36.114 --> 28:38.150
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON: I think
we're getting there. I think
we're getting there.

28:38.150 --> 28:41.253
But it's important that when we
think about what China is doing
in the South China Sea,

28:41.253 --> 28:44.289
as John was suggesting, we have
to think about it in the broader
context of China's broader

28:44.289 --> 28:47.559
maritime strategy
that is emerging.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.496
And the message they're sending
to the region and to the United
States is, effectively,

28:51.496 --> 28:56.935
our forces will operate at times
of our choosing, perhaps even
with impunity, in this area out

28:56.935 --> 29:00.739
to the so-called Second Island
Chain of Guam, and the rest of
you have to accept it. And

29:00.739 --> 29:04.042
if you don't want to accept it,
we care more about this space
than you do.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.411
And the Chinese are trying to
get, for the first time in their
history, some maritime

29:06.411 --> 29:10.015
strategic depth
around their country.

29:10.015 --> 29:15.053
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's --
let's broaden this out, Susan
Shirk. the relationship between

29:15.053 --> 29:20.158
the two men, let's -- overall
China-U.S. relations, are they
any better coming out of these
two

29:20.158 --> 29:22.027
days of meetings,
do you believe?

29:22.027 --> 29:23.161
(CROSSTALK)

29:23.161 --> 29:26.765
SUSAN SHIRK: They're
not any worse.

29:26.765 --> 29:34.940
I wouldn't say this was a home
run kind of summit, as -- last
November, we had a summit

29:34.940 --> 29:42.280
in Beijing where the two leaders
made some -- three sets of very
substantive agreements.

29:42.280 --> 29:48.120
And Xi Jinping, because he was
the host then, he really bent
over backwards to make that

29:48.120 --> 29:52.391
a successful summit. Here, he
was coming, he was getting the
state visit. He already

29:52.391 --> 29:57.929
had it, and he didn't have --
he didn't want to give as much.

29:57.929 --> 30:05.103
And these issues are tough for
him. So, I don't say this was
great. And the relationship

30:05.103 --> 30:10.909
has become a lot more
competitive since I served in
government at the end of the
Clinton

30:10.909 --> 30:14.713
administration. So -- and I
think this is not going to turn
that around.

30:14.713 --> 30:19.918
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Mearsheimer,
a lot of reporting about the
efforts by President Xi

30:19.918 --> 30:27.726
to consolidate his power in
China. What do you see in the
months to come in the overall

30:27.726 --> 30:30.295
U.S.-China relationship?

30:30.295 --> 30:35.067
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Well, I think
that he has a significant
domestic problem at home, for

30:35.067 --> 30:37.869
two reasons.

30:37.869 --> 30:41.873
One is that he doesn't have a
lot of legitimacy, in the sense
that communism, which is the

30:41.873 --> 30:47.479
ruling ideology, doesn't have
much power these days. And,
furthermore...

30:47.479 --> 30:49.548
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean even
with the Chinese people?

30:49.548 --> 30:51.817
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Even
with the Chinese people.

30:51.817 --> 30:57.322
And, as a result, he's been
playing the nationalism card.
And that causes all sorts of
problems,

30:57.322 --> 31:01.927
because it forces him to be more
aggressive in foreign policy. At
the same time, he's

31:01.927 --> 31:06.031
having significant economic
problems at home. And it's very
hard to predict where this train

31:06.031 --> 31:11.002
is headed, but these economic
problems could get worse. And
that may force him to be more

31:11.002 --> 31:14.172
aggressive on the foreign policy
front, for the purposes of
trying to keep those centrifugal

31:14.172 --> 31:15.907
forces at home at bay.

31:15.907 --> 31:18.310
So, this could get messy.

31:18.310 --> 31:22.581
JUDY WOODRUFF: You know, John --
the point that John makes,
Christopher Johnson, reminding

31:22.581 --> 31:26.284
us about the Chinese economy,
the difficulty they have had
with their markets, the effect

31:26.284 --> 31:29.020
that has had on the rest of the
world, there really wasn't much
mention of that today.

31:29.020 --> 31:30.922
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON: Yes, and
that is what was surprising.

31:30.922 --> 31:34.059
I think it would have been much
more helpful. I think this was a
missed opportunity. If

31:34.059 --> 31:38.630
both presidents had taken the
opportunity they had to reassure
global equity markets

31:38.630 --> 31:41.700
that the two countries are
working together to stabilize
these markets, that would have

31:41.700 --> 31:44.002
been very, very useful, and I
think that was a missed
opportunity.

31:44.002 --> 31:47.639
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much is known
about how well the two men, the
two leaders get along

31:47.639 --> 31:50.375
with each other, and does that
really make a difference?

31:50.375 --> 31:54.146
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON: Not much is
known. I think it certainly
makes a difference.

31:54.146 --> 31:57.249
I think what we can say is, they
have worked hard on their
relationship. And that goes

31:57.249 --> 32:01.686
back to their first meeting at
Sunnylands in California, where
they had this shirtsleeve

32:01.686 --> 32:05.724
summit and so on. I think you
can characterize the
relationship as not close, but
respectful

32:05.724 --> 32:08.426
and candid.

32:08.426 --> 32:11.930
And my sense is that when they
have -- especially when they
have these more informal
settings

32:11.930 --> 32:14.332
-- like, last night, there was a
two-hour, almost three-hour
private dinner between the

32:14.332 --> 32:14.800
two.

32:14.800 --> 32:16.168
JUDY WOODRUFF: Small dinner.

32:16.168 --> 32:17.369
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON: Yes. Today
was just the formal mechanics.
Last night was where they

32:17.369 --> 32:20.305
really discussed these issues.

32:20.305 --> 32:23.508
And I think they have had
in-depth conversations about
each other's political systems,
about

32:23.508 --> 32:27.078
some of these regional
architectural regions that John
has referenced. So, they do have

32:27.078 --> 32:30.081
candid discussions, but the
relationship clearly is not
close.

32:30.081 --> 32:34.653
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's one
that we all will continue to
focus on.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.889
Christopher Johnson, Susan Shirk
and John Mearsheimer, thank you,
all three.

32:37.889 --> 32:41.193
JOHN MEARSHEIMER: Thank you.

32:41.193 --> 32:44.329
CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON: Thank you.

32:44.329 --> 32:49.034
SUSAN SHIRK: Thank you.

32:49.034 --> 32:54.573
JUDY WOODRUFF: Capitol Hill was
a historic place to be this
week, with a papal visit

32:54.573 --> 32:59.277
and the surprise resignation
of House Speaker Boehner.

32:59.277 --> 33:03.215
Of course, those are the main
topics for our turn to Shields
and brooks. That's syndicated

33:03.215 --> 33:06.117
columnist Mark Shields and New
York Times columnist David
Brooks.

33:06.117 --> 33:08.353
Welcome, gentlemen.

33:08.353 --> 33:10.355
So, Mark, surprised
about Boehner?

33:10.355 --> 33:11.223
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

33:11.223 --> 33:13.158
(LAUGHTER)

33:13.158 --> 33:21.700
MARK SHIELDS: But, as Lisa
reported to you from the Hill,
the speaker faced what is a

33:21.700 --> 33:25.303
vote of no confidence. He would
have prevailed. He would have
survived, but it would have

33:25.303 --> 33:30.642
showed him weakened within his
own caucus. This was among the
Republican members. So,

33:30.642 --> 33:34.279
I think he made the decision
to go out on his own terms.

33:34.279 --> 33:36.815
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, a
complete shock for you?

33:36.815 --> 33:38.116
DAVID BROOKS: No, saw it coming
months and months and months
ago.

33:38.116 --> 33:40.285
(LAUGHTER)

33:40.285 --> 33:45.190
DAVID BROOKS: No, obviously,
since the day he walked in the
door, he's had this challenge,

33:45.190 --> 33:48.326
and it's grown more, but I don't
think anybody saw it coming in
this way.

33:48.326 --> 33:52.497
Obviously, I think the papal
visit had -- on the timing, had
an effect. There is a beautiful

33:52.497 --> 33:56.334
piece by Robert Costa of The
Washington Post talking about
how, the night before, Costa,

33:56.334 --> 34:01.740
a reporter, was with him on the
balcony, and Boehner was saying
the pope stood right here,

34:01.740 --> 34:04.042
right here, and he asked me to
pray for him. And he was so
moved.

34:04.042 --> 34:08.280
And so there's an element of
uplift, and might as well do the
right thing. And this specific

34:08.280 --> 34:13.919
act was the right thing. Paul
Ryan called it a selfless act.
And I think it really is

34:13.919 --> 34:19.324
a selfless act. It spares us
from a potential government
shutdown. It helps the
institution.

34:19.324 --> 34:23.361
It helps his party from the
fallout from a government
shutdown.

34:23.361 --> 34:29.534
And so I think it's a beautiful
act. Now, over the long term,
the downside of Boehner

34:29.534 --> 34:32.971
was that he wasn't that
imaginative and the Republicans
weren't that aggressive in
putting

34:32.971 --> 34:39.110
together a lot of policies, an
alternative to Obamacare, a
health care, a tax plan,
whatever.

34:39.110 --> 34:44.816
But he did know reality. He
could see reality around him. He
knew the craft of politics

34:44.816 --> 34:49.220
and how you craft a deal,
especially these budget deals.
Some of his critics don't seem

34:49.220 --> 34:53.224
to see that reality, that they
don't control the White House or
the supermajority in the

34:53.224 --> 34:57.228
Senate. And they don't seem to
respect the craft of politics.
And if they ever get in

34:57.228 --> 35:01.266
actual power, they are going
to be introduced it to rudely.

35:01.266 --> 35:06.237
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, David is
saying it avoids turmoil, but,
in fact, Mark, there is going

35:06.237 --> 35:10.308
to be turmoil as they figure out
who their leadership is and they
sort -- because it

35:10.308 --> 35:15.013
seems to me the conservatives
still want the same things, even
with a bunch of new leaders.

35:15.013 --> 35:20.218
MARK SHIELDS: You're right,
Judy. It postpones turmoil,
instead of having it
immediately.

35:20.218 --> 35:26.524
John Boehner was never really a
good fit with this particular
caucus of fire-eaters. John

35:26.524 --> 35:33.565
Boehner was a legislator. He
liked politicians. He was good
at his craft. Perhaps they
became

35:33.565 --> 35:40.839
suspicious when John Boehner, in
2001, cooperated. He actually
practiced what the pope preached

35:40.839 --> 35:47.045
to the Congress. He cooperated
and compromised with Ted Kennedy
and George Miller, two ranking

35:47.045 --> 35:51.549
Democrats, on George Bush,
President George W. Bush's
signature proposal of Leave No
Child

35:51.549 --> 35:53.952
Behind.

35:53.952 --> 35:57.188
And there were questions about
him. He was willing to pass a
highway bill. He was willing

35:57.188 --> 36:00.892
to pass an immigration bill. He
was against closing down the
government. He was willing

36:00.892 --> 36:06.164
to raise the debt ceiling. This
raised suspicions within the
true believer caucus, and which

36:06.164 --> 36:11.202
may be two dozen, it may be four
dozen. And it's not enough to
pass anything.

36:11.202 --> 36:15.673
And they're just -- quite
frankly, all they did was -- I
think John Boehner -- I think

36:15.673 --> 36:19.344
David is right -- yesterday was
the day of his life. He had --
for 21 years...

36:19.344 --> 36:21.379
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pope there.

36:21.379 --> 36:25.183
MARK SHIELDS: ... he had made
the effort -- he began when Tom
Foley was speaker and John

36:25.183 --> 36:29.754
Paul II was pope -- to get the
Congress to invite him. And we
never would have heard

36:29.754 --> 36:35.193
this remarkable pastor yesterday
with the message of comfort the
afflicted and afflict

36:35.193 --> 36:39.898
the comfortable yesterday and a
national audience but for John
Boehner.

36:39.898 --> 36:45.303
JUDY WOODRUFF: David, so do
things change now? Does more get
done, does less get done,

36:45.303 --> 36:48.840
is it the same? What's going to
be different about the way
things work?

36:48.840 --> 36:53.778
DAVID BROOKS: I think a lot is
going to be the same, assuming
Kevin McCarthy takes over.

36:53.778 --> 36:57.816
He's not that totally different
than Boehner. He's happy. He's a
happy guy. He's a charming

36:57.816 --> 37:03.621
guy, right now a little more in
favor with the very
conservatives, but he's still
basically

37:03.621 --> 37:07.592
a reality-based politician. And
he will understand how to try to
do deals.

37:07.592 --> 37:12.797
So, I think he will get a little
bit of a breather. But the
people who believe that

37:12.797 --> 37:17.602
they're in office not to pass
legislation, but merely to
express their id are still
there.

37:17.602 --> 37:20.638
And so that conflict
will still be there.

37:20.638 --> 37:24.309
And then, more structurally --
Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings
Institution had a good piece

37:24.309 --> 37:29.948
today saying that the office of
the speaker is weaker because
there's less earmarks, so

37:29.948 --> 37:33.618
they can't give away pork
projects to control people. The
parties are weaker because of

37:33.618 --> 37:39.524
campaign finance. And there's
just a lot of free-spirited
individualism in the House now.

37:39.524 --> 37:44.529
And people can go off
freelancing off on their own.
And so the institutional power
is a little

37:44.529 --> 37:48.199
weaker. So, even when a Democrat
comes in, I think we're going to
see a lot more fractiousness.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.101
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even when a
Democrat comes in? You mean
even...

37:50.101 --> 37:53.071
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I
mean, it's different.

37:53.071 --> 37:57.609
I think both parties are
ideologically polarized. The
Republican -- some rump of the
Republican

37:57.609 --> 38:00.612
Party doesn't believe in
politics. I think most of the
Democratic Party does believe

38:00.612 --> 38:03.515
in politics. They're the party
of government. They believe in
government.

38:03.515 --> 38:08.786
And, so, in some sense, the
Republican Party can get a
little more extreme over
tactics,

38:08.786 --> 38:11.823
but I think it will be hard for
speakers in the future to
control people, just because,

38:11.823 --> 38:14.192
if you have got a super PAC, if
you got some independent
expenditures, it's hard to
impose

38:14.192 --> 38:17.295
discipline anymore on the body.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.997
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, does more
get done, does less get done?
How do you see it?

38:18.997 --> 38:20.765
MARK SHIELDS: Less gets
done, Judy, I believe.

38:20.765 --> 38:27.772
And could I be rude and just say
that there are probably four
dozen members of the House

38:27.772 --> 38:30.074
Republican Caucus who do not
believe in government? And they
are not -- they have never
accepted

38:30.074 --> 38:32.644
the responsibility of
the governing party.

38:32.644 --> 38:37.916
I mean, John Boehner accepted
the fact that the Republicans
are the majority party in

38:37.916 --> 38:42.720
the House and the Senate.
Therefore, we have a
responsibility to keep
government operating,

38:42.720 --> 38:49.627
not to close it down, to fund
it, to compromise, to get the
votes necessary to pass the
legislation

38:49.627 --> 38:54.866
required. And there are four
dozen who say, hell no, if it
does close down, great, that's

38:54.866 --> 38:57.969
good, that's what
we're here about.

38:57.969 --> 39:03.708
And I don't know how you govern
with that. David's absolutely
right. Kevin McCarthy is

39:03.708 --> 39:08.580
one of the most gregarious
members of the House. He knows
his colleagues on the House

39:08.580 --> 39:11.416
-- on the Republican side. He
knows their kids' names. He
knows their wives' names.

39:11.416 --> 39:14.686
He loves their company.

39:14.686 --> 39:21.726
It will give him a two-month
honeymoon, until the talk shows
start in, and the right-wing

39:21.726 --> 39:27.999
network starts up, and this four
dozen caucus who -- four dozen
of them, three dozen, or

39:27.999 --> 39:31.603
whatever they are, are just --
they are absolutely
nonnegotiable.

39:31.603 --> 39:34.973
JUDY WOODRUFF: Some have called
them the heck no -- stronger
word -- of this caucus.

39:34.973 --> 39:36.507
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

39:36.507 --> 39:40.979
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's interesting
that, David, this comes the day
after Pope Francis comes

39:40.979 --> 39:45.817
to speak to a joint session and
talks about, we need to end
polarization, we need to work

39:45.817 --> 39:50.488
together. What about the pope's
message at the White House in
Washington? What did you

39:50.488 --> 39:51.322
take away from it?

39:51.322 --> 39:53.558
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

39:53.558 --> 39:59.097
Well, I thought it's so clear
how countercultural he is. We
have ideological fights. He's
anti-ideological.

39:59.097 --> 40:02.800
He's personalist. Somebody once
said, souls are not saved in
bundles, and he's with each

40:02.800 --> 40:05.169
individual human being.

40:05.169 --> 40:09.674
I loved the moment, little girl
on the street, she came up to
his caravan, and he embraced

40:09.674 --> 40:15.446
her. That was a moment, the pope
and the individual. And so he
represents community an ethos of

40:15.446 --> 40:21.085
community and uplift, which is
just different than our
horizontal politics.

40:21.085 --> 40:24.956
It's a vertical axis he's on.
And so, whether you're
Republican or Democrat, I think
everybody

40:24.956 --> 40:33.031
felt uplifted, and both uplifted
by his example and his humility,
but also humbled by -- he

40:33.031 --> 40:39.237
believes that the church is a
hospital for the souls, and so
he offered that as well.

40:39.237 --> 40:43.875
And I would say, in general, we
can have scorecards of how
political he was. I thought the
political

40:43.875 --> 40:47.612
speeches were fine. The U.N., it
was fine, and one agrees with
it. But some of the religious

40:47.612 --> 40:50.081
statements he made at the homily
up at the Catholic Basilica here
in town in Washington

40:50.081 --> 40:51.082
were beautiful.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.785
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

40:53.785 --> 40:58.189
DAVID BROOKS: And the religious
statements were really
profoundly beautiful. And I
would

40:58.189 --> 41:02.794
hate to see them get drowned
out, as we weigh whether he was
a little more anti-gay marriage

41:02.794 --> 41:04.629
or pro-immigration, the
political stuff. The religious
stuff was really quite
beautiful,

41:04.629 --> 41:06.331
I thought.

41:06.331 --> 41:09.734
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did you
mainly take away from this pope
and this...

41:09.734 --> 41:10.535
(CROSSTALK)

41:10.535 --> 41:13.805
MARK SHIELDS: I
agree with David.

41:13.805 --> 41:17.475
There are a couple of things
that -- I was with somebody who
had been at John Kennedy's

41:17.475 --> 41:23.681
funeral, and said it was the
closest thing they had seen to a
Washington event since

41:23.681 --> 41:28.820
John Kennedy's funeral, in this
sense. Most events in
Washington, other than
inaugurals,

41:28.820 --> 41:33.658
which are a celebration, most of
them, people come in great
numbers to protest, for redress

41:33.658 --> 41:36.394
of grievances.

41:36.394 --> 41:42.400
This was a joyful crowd. They
waited for hours, literally
hours, to see him for four or
five,

41:42.400 --> 41:50.141
six seconds away, and walked
away satisfied. And it was a
joyful and very considerate
crowd.

41:50.141 --> 41:56.013
It lacked the usual Washington
elbows: Do you know who I am? I
should be up front.

41:56.013 --> 42:02.019
That was missing. I thought the
speech to Congress was magic, in
the sense that just

42:02.019 --> 42:08.993
watching the feeling in that
room. There was a sense of awe
about the man. But -- and I

42:08.993 --> 42:13.931
agree with the scorecard, as to
-- which he did. He walks where
he chooses to walk. He

42:13.931 --> 42:19.637
doesn't prim. He doesn't cockle.
He says the same whatever
audience he's speaking to.

42:19.637 --> 42:26.044
And the thing about the man that
just strikes me is, history is
written by winners, and

42:26.044 --> 42:31.249
it's written about winners. It's
written about victorious
generals and princes and
powerful

42:31.249 --> 42:33.651
presidents.

42:33.651 --> 42:38.289
And what -- as MDNM John Carr
said to you last MDNM -- John
Carr, Georgetown University

42:38.289 --> 42:44.395
-- this man's an outsider. He
looks at the world from the
bottom up and from the outside

42:44.395 --> 42:50.168
in. And after the speech,
instead of accepting the lunch
where all the power brokers of
Washington

42:50.168 --> 42:55.873
come to lionize you on Capitol
Hill and get all the toasts, he
went down with 300 homeless

42:55.873 --> 43:00.778
people, and he fed with
them and ate with them.

43:00.778 --> 43:05.082
And it was just -- it was
marvelous. And he compared -- he
pointed out that Jesus was

43:05.082 --> 43:10.588
born homeless. It was just a
marvelous -- so it's the
eloquence of his symbols, as
well

43:10.588 --> 43:12.557
as his language.

43:12.557 --> 43:19.197
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does it linger,
David? Does something last? Is
something now embedded

43:19.197 --> 43:23.935
in this city and anywhere else
as a result of this? Or is this
a fleeting moment?

43:23.935 --> 43:27.738
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well, the
lion won't lie down with the
lamb.

43:27.738 --> 43:32.210
But I think he leaves a residue
on people. I think it's a
profound memory with people,

43:32.210 --> 43:38.783
and it's a moment of uplift for
people. And so I think a lot of
nonbelievers were moved.

43:38.783 --> 43:42.620
A lot of lapsed Catholics were
moved. A lot of Jews and
Protestants were moved. Everyone

43:42.620 --> 43:45.289
was sort of moved.

43:45.289 --> 43:50.261
And that emotion leaves a
residue. But I think, also, for
a lot of people, I think the big

43:50.261 --> 43:54.732
effect -- and this is Mark's
church -- a lot of people, lives
will be changed. Some tens

43:54.732 --> 43:59.003
of thousands will go to a mass,
and their lives will be changed.

43:59.003 --> 44:04.141
And we emphasize the man so
much, but what he's saying is
the product of 2,000 years

44:04.141 --> 44:08.145
of teaching, of thought, of
prayer. And he's the current
exemplar. We sort of
overemphasize

44:08.145 --> 44:13.184
the individual and
underemphasize the institution,
I think, throughout this visit.

44:13.184 --> 44:17.855
But for some large number of
people, this will be a turning
point in their lives. And

44:17.855 --> 44:22.693
that's sort of worth
celebrating. In Philadelphia, or
in Madison Square Garden
tonight, some

44:22.693 --> 44:25.496
people, this will be the moment
something very fundamental
shifts in their lives. And

44:25.496 --> 44:27.765
politics rarely achieves that.

44:27.765 --> 44:30.968
JUDY WOODRUFF: It certainly
isn't something we see very
often.

44:30.968 --> 44:32.136
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

44:32.136 --> 44:37.775
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks,
Mark Shields, we thank you both.

44:37.775 --> 44:43.881
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you.

44:43.881 --> 44:50.187
JUDY WOODRUFF: We take a look
now at a very different
Chinese-American collaboration,

44:50.187 --> 44:53.658
this time in the
world of the arts.

44:53.658 --> 44:58.796
Ever since a ban on Western
music was lifted in China almost
40 years ago, the country

44:58.796 --> 45:05.069
has produced a number of artists
for elite music conservatories
in the West.

45:05.069 --> 45:10.708
Jeffrey Brown has the story of
one such pianist who's taken the
leap from prodigy to
international

45:10.708 --> 45:16.781
superstar with the help of an
American mentor and a former
prodigy himself.

45:16.781 --> 45:21.752
This story was produced in
collaboration with public TV
station KQED.

45:21.752 --> 45:31.262
JEFFREY BROWN: He is 70, the
grandson of Yiddish theater
stars, music director of the San
Francisco

45:31.262 --> 45:38.736
Symphony, and a major figure on
the classical music scene for
five decades. She is 28, a

45:38.736 --> 45:45.710
virtuoso from China and a
spectacular new presence on the
international circuit.

45:45.710 --> 45:49.413
Michael Tilson Thomas and Yuja
Wang have been collaborators, as
conductor and pianist, for

45:49.413 --> 45:51.716
11 years now.

45:51.716 --> 45:53.050
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS, Music
Director, San Francisco
Symphony: This is a little part

45:53.050 --> 45:58.456
of a Schubert Rondo, which is
subtitled, "Our Friendship is
Unchanging." It's forever.

45:58.456 --> 46:00.558
(LAUGHTER)

46:00.558 --> 46:05.863
JEFFREY BROWN: Up close, it's
clearly a relationship based on
musicianship and a sense of
humor.

46:05.863 --> 46:11.969
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: There is
an element of excitement and
danger to it, because it

46:11.969 --> 46:17.742
reminds me sometimes as if you
were watching the circus and
you're watching a trapeze act.

46:17.742 --> 46:22.146
Somebody is jumping and doing
flips in the air, but also
somebody is catching the person

46:22.146 --> 46:23.648
who is doing that.

46:23.648 --> 46:24.649
JEFFREY BROWN: And who
is who in this case?

46:24.649 --> 46:26.484
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: In
this case, I'm the catcher.

46:26.484 --> 46:28.019
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.
And you're the?

46:28.019 --> 46:28.452
YUJA WANG, Pianist:
I jump around.

46:28.452 --> 46:29.020
(LAUGHTER)

46:29.020 --> 46:31.922
JEFFREY BROWN: You jump around.

46:31.922 --> 46:37.361
Yuja Wang took her first piano
lesson at age 6. Soon after, she
was accepted at the Central

46:37.361 --> 46:44.335
Conservatory of Music in
Beijing. At 14, she left China
without her parents to study
classical

46:44.335 --> 46:48.906
music, first in Calgary and then
at the prestigious Curtis School
of Music in Philadelphia, from

46:48.906 --> 46:53.144
which she graduated at age 21.

46:53.144 --> 46:58.816
These days, when not on the
road, Wang lives in New York, as
addicted as the next
20-something

46:58.816 --> 47:01.252
to her digital devices.

47:01.252 --> 47:06.190
When you put on the headphones,
you're listening to?

47:06.190 --> 47:09.927
YUJA WANG: It really depends on
my mood, because, like -- today,
I feel like Brahms, or today

47:09.927 --> 47:11.696
I feel like Eminem.

47:11.696 --> 47:13.431
JEFFREY BROWN: Brahms
and Eminem, right?

47:13.431 --> 47:14.565
(LAUGHTER)

47:14.565 --> 47:19.303
JEFFREY BROWN: They go
together. Yes. Yes.

47:19.303 --> 47:24.975
Her fiery, youthful style and
sheer talent quickly attracted
attention in traditional

47:24.975 --> 47:31.682
classic music circles and
beyond. YouTube videos, like
this one of Rimsky-Korsakov's

47:31.682 --> 47:37.655
"Flight of the Bumblebee" on the
Medici TV site have gained
millions of views.

47:37.655 --> 47:44.462
For his part, Michael Tilson
Thomas was himself a classical
music prodigy. In Los Angeles,

47:44.462 --> 47:50.868
he played piano alongside
legends like Igor Stravinsky and
Aaron Copland. When he first

47:50.868 --> 47:56.273
heard then 17-year-old Yuja Wang
play, he recognized some
familiar traits.

47:56.273 --> 47:59.777
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: There's
that expression, it takes one to
know one. And there is that

47:59.777 --> 48:06.083
certain thing I spotted in her
from the beginning of, ah,
right. And it was remarkable,
because

48:06.083 --> 48:13.290
here was this very young woman
playing, and she was listening.
She was listening to the

48:13.290 --> 48:18.195
harmonies and she was playing in
a way that was following and
sympathetic, as well as

48:18.195 --> 48:21.232
asserting herself.

48:21.232 --> 48:26.771
JEFFREY BROWN: We watched the
two rehearse Beethoven's Piano
Concerto Number Four with

48:26.771 --> 48:29.106
the San Francisco Symphony.

48:29.106 --> 48:35.212
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: And then
kind of resolving in -- does
that sort of make sense for you?

48:35.212 --> 48:38.582
YUJA WANG: Yes, but it's
hard to control the sound.

48:38.582 --> 48:41.352
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: I know.
It's hard playing -- playing
slow and quiet is the hardest
thing,

48:41.352 --> 48:42.920
for a thoroughbred
like you, anyway.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.122
(LAUGHTER)

48:45.122 --> 48:48.993
JEFFREY BROWN: Hours later,
issues resolved, they performed
for a packed house in Davies

48:48.993 --> 48:52.029
Hall.

48:52.029 --> 48:58.969
YUJA WANG: We played it three
years ago, and now we're playing
it again. And I feel like

48:58.969 --> 49:05.776
it's more relaxed and more free.
And he caught up on that in the
rehearsal like after five

49:05.776 --> 49:08.712
pages. It was just so sensitive.

49:08.712 --> 49:14.118
And it just had this really
subtle adjustments right away.
And he will tell the orchestra,

49:14.118 --> 49:18.956
and they change the sounds, the
tone, the phrasing. Everything
just kind of takes care

49:18.956 --> 49:26.864
of itself, because the overall
mood and atmosphere is a little
different.

49:26.864 --> 49:36.340
JEFFREY BROWN: Mentoring, in
this case, takes many forms,
including, over the years,
teaching

49:36.340 --> 49:41.212
Wang, a young woman constantly
traveling the world, how to
prepare healthy meals.

49:41.212 --> 49:44.648
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: We're
going to make croutons. No, no,
no, wait. Don't put them

49:44.648 --> 49:45.316
in yet.

49:45.316 --> 49:47.351
YUJA WANG: No? Oh, OK.

49:47.351 --> 49:48.752
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: You're
not done with them. Take them
out.

49:48.752 --> 49:50.688
(LAUGHTER)

49:50.688 --> 49:54.058
JEFFREY BROWN: But, beyond the
salad-making, Tilson Thomas
says, there's the deeper
satisfaction

49:54.058 --> 49:56.760
to his mentoring role.

49:56.760 --> 50:02.333
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: It's
essential for me, the sense of
contact with a new brilliant

50:02.333 --> 50:06.103
spirit of another generation,
with whom I feel so much in
common.

50:06.103 --> 50:09.039
JEFFREY BROWN: But
why is it essential?

50:09.039 --> 50:14.378
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: Because
it reminds me, too, of the
relationship I had with mentors

50:14.378 --> 50:21.151
of mine who were 50 years older
than I. My major piano teacher
was a pupil of a guy called

50:21.151 --> 50:23.721
Moriz Rosenthal, who had been a
pupil of Liszt, who was a pupil
of Czerny, who was a pupil

50:23.721 --> 50:25.956
of Beethoven.

50:25.956 --> 50:32.029
JEFFREY BROWN: With Yuja Wang,
along with her musical prowess,
her style, very much

50:32.029 --> 50:36.600
including clothing, has also
gotten plenty of attention, and
sometimes raised eyebrows

50:36.600 --> 50:40.571
in the tradition-bound
world of classical music.

50:40.571 --> 50:46.043
Of an orange mini-dress she wore
for a performance at the
Hollywood Bowl, The Los Angeles
Times

50:46.043 --> 50:49.713
wrote -- quote -- "Had there
been any less of the dress, the
Bowl might have been forced

50:49.713 --> 50:53.384
to restrict admission to
any music lover under 18."

50:53.384 --> 50:58.222
Do you like to make a statement
with your clothes, as well as
with your music?

50:58.222 --> 51:01.492
YUJA WANG: Well, the clothes
goes with the music. Like,
tonight, it's Beethoven. It's

51:01.492 --> 51:07.331
something elegant. Tomorrow, I
will have something very jarring
and blatant for Bartok.

51:07.331 --> 51:12.903
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: I have
certain ideas of where that
borderline is of just how daring

51:12.903 --> 51:16.941
her fashion sense can be
relative to the piece that she's
playing.

51:16.941 --> 51:21.278
JEFFREY BROWN: But Tilson Thomas
also recognizes an added
benefit.

51:21.278 --> 51:24.748
MICHAEL TILSON THOMAS: She's
very appealing to young people,
of course, because she is

51:24.748 --> 51:30.521
so young, she's so attractive.
Her playing is so brilliant. All
the controversy concerning

51:30.521 --> 51:35.392
the way she appears,
fashion-wise, this is all part
of it, and yet there is no one
who

51:35.392 --> 51:40.364
remotely suggested that anything
about her music-making was less
than totally serious.

51:40.364 --> 51:46.270
JEFFREY BROWN: Soon after our
visit, Michael Tilson Thomas,
Yuja Wang, and the San Francisco

51:46.270 --> 51:52.009
Symphony took their show on the
road for an extended European
tour.

51:52.009 --> 51:59.249
After that, Tilson Thomas
returns to San Francisco to
launch a new season. And Wang
continues

51:59.249 --> 52:05.155
her peripatetic musical ways
with a new album of music by
Maurice Ravel out in October.

52:05.155 --> 52:10.928
From San Francisco, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the "PBS NewsHour"

52:10.928 --> 52:17.601
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

52:17.601 --> 52:23.407
And on the "NewsHour" online: A
young man's impassioned Facebook
post went viral last

52:23.407 --> 52:29.446
week after he described being
called a racial slur on his
college campus. Payton Head said

52:29.446 --> 52:34.451
he could remain silent, or he
could speak up. He chose the
latter, and he challenged

52:34.451 --> 52:38.856
his classmates at the University
of Missouri to do the same. The
political science major

52:38.856 --> 52:44.128
and student body president wrote
about what inspired his plea.

52:44.128 --> 52:48.098
Plus, chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner
reports after meeting with

52:48.098 --> 52:53.337
Iranian President Hassan
Rouhani. You can read her blog
on our home page.

52:53.337 --> 52:59.043
You can find that and more on
our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:59.043 --> 53:02.913
And a reminder about some
upcoming programs from our PBS
colleagues.

53:02.913 --> 53:08.052
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week," which airs
later this evening. Here's a
preview:

53:08.052 --> 53:14.291
GWEN IFILL: The pope takes the
world by storm. The U.S. and
Chinese presidents talk
cyber-crime

53:14.291 --> 53:20.531
and military maneuvering. And
House Speaker John Boehner's
resignation bombshell -- all

53:20.531 --> 53:24.802
that, plus an update on the
slippery world of 2016 politics
tonight on "Washington Week"

53:24.802 --> 53:27.071
-- Judy.

53:27.071 --> 53:33.177
JUDY WOODRUFF: On "PBS NewsHour
Weekend" Saturday: faith,
service, sacrifice. Meet the new
generation

53:33.177 --> 53:36.313
of those entering
the priesthood.

53:36.313 --> 53:42.386
NARRATOR: Eighteen-year-old Phil
Tran began his studies this
fall. The oldest of six children

53:42.386 --> 53:45.689
in a Vietnamese-American family,
Tran was immersed in Catholic
teachings from a young

53:45.689 --> 53:47.558
age.

53:47.558 --> 53:49.927
PHIL TRAN, Seminarian: I have
always had people going up to
me, telling me I would make a

53:49.927 --> 53:52.029
good priest.

53:52.029 --> 53:56.400
NARRATOR: Still, when he
finished high school, Tran
planned on studying mechanical
engineering

53:56.400 --> 54:00.404
at Philadelphia's Drexel
University, where he was offered
a partial scholarship.

54:00.404 --> 54:04.675
PHIL TRAN: I love math, I love
science, I love engineering, but
I couldn't see myself

54:04.675 --> 54:07.911
enjoying that for the rest of my
life, when I know that I could
be touching people's lives

54:07.911 --> 54:10.380
in a more direct way, in a way
that God might be calling me to
do.

54:10.380 --> 54:14.718
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's tomorrow
night on "PBS NewsHour Weekend."

54:14.718 --> 54:16.987
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:16.987 --> 54:18.422
Have a great weekend. Thank
you, and good night.
