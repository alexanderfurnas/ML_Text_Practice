HARI SREENIVASAN: It was a
tumultuous day in the Trump
administration, with a major

00:03.866 --> 00:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shakeup involving the public
faces of the Trump presidency.

00:07.466 --> 00:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this came among new reports
of conflict within Mr. Trump's
legal team, as they prepare

00:12.166 --> 00:15.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to respond to the
investigation by special
counsel Robert Mueller.

00:15.700 --> 00:20.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We break it down now
with Rosalind Helderman,
political enterprise and
investigations reporter

00:20.133 --> 00:21.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for The Washington Post.

00:21.300 --> 00:23.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

00:23.000 --> 00:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What's the Trump legal
team's strategy to deal
with this investigation?

00:26.166 --> 00:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN, The
Washington Post: Well, we
reported today that the
legal team is examining

00:30.400 --> 00:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a broad array of options that
would allow it -- or would
lead to the restraining or

00:36.866 --> 00:40.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restricting of the special
counsel's investigation.

00:40.266 --> 00:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At present, they say they are
cooperating with special counsel
Bob Mueller, but we understand

00:47.266 --> 00:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they are doing research
into possible conflicts by
Bob Mueller himself, conflicts

00:52.133 --> 00:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of interest or members of his
staff that he is assembling.

00:55.500 --> 00:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keep in mind that conflict of
interest is one of the only
things in the regulations

00:59.633 --> 01:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
establishing the special
counsel that can be used by
the attorney general or in this

01:06.633 --> 01:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case the acting attorney
general, Rod Rosenstein, to
dismiss the special counsel.

01:11.900 --> 01:14.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they are looking at that and
a number of other things that
would try to curb this sort

01:14.700 --> 01:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of scope of this
expanding investigation.

01:17.833 --> 01:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Did
any of these conflicts
of interests come up when
Mueller was originally

01:21.566 --> 01:23.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
assigned to the task?

01:23.066 --> 01:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Did Jeff Sessions or anyone
else give him a pass on these?

01:26.500 --> 01:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: Yes,
that's a good question that
we don't entirely know yet.

01:30.333 --> 01:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We do know that President
Trump himself has said that he
interviewed Bob Mueller to be

01:37.233 --> 01:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FBI director very shortly
before his appointment
as special counsel.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the conflict that we
reported today the White House
has been examining is, of

01:45.533 --> 01:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all things, Bob Mueller's
membership at the Trump
National Golf Course
in Northern Virginia.

01:52.566 --> 01:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Apparently, White House advisers
tell us there was some variety
of dispute over his membership

01:57.500 --> 01:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fees at that club.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, Mueller's office has
told us that's not true.

02:01.500 --> 02:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was no membership fee
dispute, so we're continuing to
try to learn more about that.

02:05.733 --> 02:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But whatever happened at
the golf club, President
Trump clearly didn't
see it as an impediment

02:12.800 --> 02:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to potentially appointing Bob
Mueller to be FBI director, so
it's interesting that they're

02:15.533 --> 02:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now returning to that topic.

02:17.533 --> 02:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Let's talk
a little bit about the legal
team that seems to be changing,

02:20.433 --> 02:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at least faces, in
the past few days.

02:22.233 --> 02:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN:
That's right.

02:24.333 --> 02:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw today the resignation
of Mark Corallo, who had been
sort of the spokesman for the

02:27.800 --> 02:29.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
team.

02:29.300 --> 02:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He had been officially the
spokesman for Marc Kasowitz.

02:32.066 --> 02:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a New York-based attorney
who had worked with Donald Trump
on various matters for many

02:38.433 --> 02:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years who has been until
today the leader of this team.

02:44.100 --> 02:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been some
reports that he is leaving
the team altogether.

02:46.566 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our reporting is that Kasowitz
is remaining aboard, but is
going to take a reduced role.

02:51.533 --> 02:56.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The leader now is John Dowd,
who was hired last month, a
veteran Washington litigator.

02:58.533 --> 03:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had been involved in
the investigation of Pete
Rose of baseball fame.

03:02.966 --> 03:05.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's leading the team.

03:05.000 --> 03:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jay Sekulow, familiar to
television viewers, remains on
the team as sort of its public

03:09.433 --> 03:11.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
face.

03:11.333 --> 03:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The individual
that you mentioned, Mr.
Dowd, actually came out in

03:13.333 --> 03:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal and kind
of questioned this reporting
that The Washington Post had

03:17.300 --> 03:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
done and said that it's not true
that President Trump and his
team were looking into the act

03:23.500 --> 03:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of possibly pardoning
his aides or himself.

03:27.033 --> 03:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are multiple lawyers.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it just the lawyers that
you spoke to vs. Mr. Dowd?

03:30.666 --> 03:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: So, we
feel very comfortable in
our sourcing for our story.

03:34.433 --> 03:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he said that this morning,
we did add those comments
-- they were on the record

03:38.800 --> 03:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - to our story to
reflect his denial.

03:42.600 --> 03:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We feel comfortable that
our story was accurate
and accurately reflected
conversations that

03:47.133 --> 03:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been going on amongst
this large legal team.

03:50.800 --> 03:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would note Mr. Dowd gave an
interview to The Wall Street
Journal in which he said that

03:57.833 --> 04:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in fact the legal team is not
at all interested in the topic
of conflicts of interest.

04:00.666 --> 04:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, Jay Sekulow was quoted in
that very same story as saying
they are looking at conflicts,

04:05.100 --> 04:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that any reasonable
lawyer would do so.

04:08.200 --> 04:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there was a conflict right
there in the same story from
two different lawyers for

04:13.033 --> 04:15.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the team.

04:15.533 --> 04:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If I'm
a lawyer representing
somebody like the
president, wouldn't it be

04:17.166 --> 04:20.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
normal for me to say
let's look at the tools
that my clients have?

04:20.900 --> 04:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If one of the tools includes a
presidential pardon, shouldn't
I just investigate what

04:25.733 --> 04:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the parameters of
that pardon are?

04:28.000 --> 04:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN:
Yes, absolutely.

04:30.033 --> 04:34.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And as we reported, we
do believe that this
was a conversation about
legal options, that

04:36.766 --> 04:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this wasn't the president saying
that he plans to pardon himself
or that he believes he is

04:41.333 --> 04:45.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ultimately going to
need a pardon, which
is to say he believes
he's going to be accused

04:45.266 --> 04:47.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a crime.

04:47.300 --> 04:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was a conversation
about legal options and the
powers of the presidency.

04:53.166 --> 04:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How does the president go about
or what's the breadth of his
authority to pardon staff,

04:58.433 --> 05:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pardon family members,
and indeed what does the
Constitution say and the law say

05:01.666 --> 05:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about a president pardoning
himself, which actually is a
question of rather distinct

05:06.333 --> 05:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dispute in the legal community?

05:08.400 --> 05:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
and, finally, briefly, in the
sources that you have spoken

05:11.000 --> 05:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with, is the shakeup or
at least the changeover
in the legal team, as
well in the communications

05:15.300 --> 05:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
department ,part of
something bigger?

05:17.366 --> 05:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN: I think
there's a sort of sense of a
White House on edge right now.

05:22.133 --> 05:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's a lot of turmoil.

05:24.066 --> 05:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I certainly wouldn't
guarantee that we have seen
the end of the changes.

05:28.400 --> 05:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, we will all note that
the president had those very
harsh words for Attorney General

05:32.833 --> 05:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff Sessions earlier
this week in an interview
with The New York Times.

05:37.200 --> 05:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're told that people in the
White House were quite surprised
that those comments didn't

05:41.400 --> 05:43.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
result in Jeff
Sessions resigning.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He instead came out and said
he planned to stay on the job.

05:45.766 --> 05:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, that's in the air.

05:48.200 --> 05:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The chief of staff, Reince
Priebus, there's been many,
many rumors that he's on his way

05:52.133 --> 05:53.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

05:53.600 --> 05:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I don't think that the
team is settled by any means.

05:57.333 --> 06:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All
right, Rosalind Helderman
at The Washington Post,
thanks so much for

06:00.166 --> 06:01.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
joining us tonight.

06:01.366 --> 06:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROSALIND HELDERMAN:
Thank you for having me.
