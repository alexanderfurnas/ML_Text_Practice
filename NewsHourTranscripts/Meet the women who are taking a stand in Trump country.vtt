JUDY WOODRUFF: But first: how
last year's election results
shook up one West Virginia

00:05.366 --> 00:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
town and how the reverberations
continue to sow division.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan
has more on that.

00:12.000 --> 00:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Buckhannon
is a town with a population
of less than 6,000.

00:15.833 --> 00:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a deeply conservative
place with a long
history tied to coal.

00:19.966 --> 00:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Its mayor calls it the most
Trumpian place in America.

00:23.433 --> 00:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But Buckhannon is also
where a growing group of
women are finding their
voice through protest

00:30.333 --> 00:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and where speaking up has
angered some people, including
the men in their lives.

00:32.533 --> 00:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our Elizabeth Flock has
published a deep look
at these divisions and
the women on the front

00:36.566 --> 00:38.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lines.

00:38.066 --> 00:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It sounds like a tough
climate to protest Trump.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Absolutely.

00:42.166 --> 00:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's very isolating for
a lot of the women in the town.

00:44.300 --> 00:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are just about 70 women
in a town of 6,000, and most
of the town doesn't agree

00:49.733 --> 00:51.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with them.

00:51.800 --> 00:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And so how
does the town respond when
they see these women picketing

00:54.833 --> 00:57.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
policies of the
Trump administration?

00:57.000 --> 00:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Not well.

00:59.066 --> 01:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have gotten a lot
of pushback from the
town, from everyone from
the local fraternity

01:05.166 --> 01:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brothers at the nearby college,
to their husbands, to their
neighbors, to people at the high

01:09.200 --> 01:10.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school,.

01:10.833 --> 01:15.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Some of their kids have
been made fun of for
the women protesting.

01:15.300 --> 01:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other women go home at night
and their husbands get after
them for appearing on the front

01:19.133 --> 01:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
page with a protest sign.

01:21.566 --> 01:26.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, for them, I think
it's a constant struggle
to keep protesting, in
light of the reaction

01:27.966 --> 01:30.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that they are getting.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As you point
out, a lot of these women
were not engaged in this way

01:32.700 --> 01:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before this election.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Absolutely not.

01:35.800 --> 01:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of them told me the only
political participation they had
up until this point was voting.

01:41.000 --> 01:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Most of them had never
held a protest sign.

01:41.966 --> 01:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was very new to them.

01:43.533 --> 01:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think what is interesting is,
this wasn't an organized thing.

01:46.133 --> 01:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of these women just
decided individually that after
the election they wanted to do

01:50.633 --> 01:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
something, they wanted
to go out and protest.

01:52.733 --> 01:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They went to the county -- in
front of the county Courthouse
and held a sign, and they

01:55.966 --> 01:58.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
found that there were
other women there
doing the same thing.

01:58.066 --> 02:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, as
you point out, their protests
are met with counterprotests.

02:02.066 --> 02:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is that like?

02:04.100 --> 02:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Well, the most
striking example was after the
announcement of the proposed

02:10.433 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
travel ban, when the
women did a march at
the county courthouse,
and a number of trucks

02:12.866 --> 02:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showed up in counterprotest,
mostly men, members of
the local fraternity
from the nearby college

02:19.333 --> 02:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other locals, and
basically spewed smoke at the
women as they were marching.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were enveloped in a
huge cloud of black smoke,
dropped firecrackers.

02:26.533 --> 02:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a scary scene in which
a lot of the women tried not
to run or scream and give

02:32.700 --> 02:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the men the reaction
that they wanted.

02:34.733 --> 02:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What are
the actions that these women
are taking that they hope have

02:37.433 --> 02:39.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
long-term consequences?

02:39.533 --> 02:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: So, obviously
showing up in the streets with
posters and sort of telling

02:45.900 --> 02:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the town of Buckhannon
that we are here and not
everyone agrees with you.

02:47.433 --> 02:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are lobbying
local representatives.

02:49.633 --> 02:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the women held a town
hall with the Republican --
for the Republican senator,

02:54.433 --> 02:55.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who didn't show up.

02:55.966 --> 02:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, she held this town hall
anyway to an empty chair.

02:59.100 --> 03:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of them are traveling
to meet with other -- they
are part of the Indivisible

03:02.333 --> 03:04.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're traveling to
meet other Indivisible
groups, which is a liberal
anti-Trump grassroots

03:07.000 --> 03:09.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
organization.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they are sort
of connecting the dots
with other grassroots
progressive organizations

03:12.766 --> 03:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that are fighting
against Trump's policies
around the country.

03:15.200 --> 03:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And speaking
of around the country, is
this a microcosm of something

03:17.833 --> 03:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is happening elsewhere?

03:20.433 --> 03:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: I do
think this -- Buckhannon
is -- it's one small town
where this is happening,

03:25.900 --> 03:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but there are a lot of
indications that there
are women who are doing
this across the country.

03:28.433 --> 03:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, 11,000 women are
considering running for office
for the first time, according to

03:33.233 --> 03:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EMILY's List, after
Trump's election.

03:35.766 --> 03:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, the women's march
was a huge show of interest
by women in participating.

03:42.633 --> 03:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Indivisible
groups have been spreading
across the country.

03:44.533 --> 03:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think there's
6,000 of them now.

03:46.533 --> 03:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And after the story came out,
a lot of women from rural
areas wrote and said that, this

03:53.333 --> 03:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really resonated with me and
this is what is going on in our
town as well, in Pennsylvania,

03:55.500 --> 03:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Ohio, across Appalachia,
and basically said
we're also protesting.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is really hard for us here.

04:01.833 --> 04:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is really isolating, because
people don't agree with us,
and we're doing it anyway.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Plenty to follow up on.

04:05.900 --> 04:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Liz Flock, thanks
for joining us.

04:06.900 --> 04:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Thank you.
