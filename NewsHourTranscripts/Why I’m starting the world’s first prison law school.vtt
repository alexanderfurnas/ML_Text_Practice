JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where we ask people

00:02.966 --> 00:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to describe their passions.

00:04.933 --> 00:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from
British activist and
attorney Alexander McLean.

00:07.000 --> 00:08.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is the founder of the
Ugandan-based African
Prisons Project, which
seeks to improve the

00:08.166 --> 00:10.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lives of people
imprisoned in Africa.

00:10.166 --> 00:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXANDER MCLEAN, Founder,
African Prisons Project: I
think that, with any of us, if

00:12.233 --> 00:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world knew the thing about
us we are most ashamed of,
and that's all that they knew,

00:14.300 --> 00:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's all that they were
interested in, society would
lose out, because each of us

00:15.800 --> 00:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has much more to offer than
the worst thing we have done.

00:17.866 --> 00:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been working in prisons
in Uganda since I was 18,
spending a lot of time on death

00:25.333 --> 00:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
row, growing up with many
of the death row inmates.

00:28.066 --> 00:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have become
like family to me.

00:30.433 --> 00:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have spent time in about 130
prisons all over the world.

00:34.600 --> 00:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen that they're filled
with people who are poor and
not educated, and not connected.

00:41.500 --> 00:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was 19, I first
visited the women's prison
in Kampala, Uganda's capital.

00:47.066 --> 00:50.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's where many women
were on death row.

00:50.266 --> 00:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Often, they were there
for killing a husband.

00:53.233 --> 00:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Uganda has some of the highest
rates of domestic violence in
the world, and, sometimes, when

00:56.633 --> 01:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a woman fights back, she will
find herself on death row.

01:00.666 --> 01:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That time I met Susan, she
was sentenced to death for
killing her husband when she was

01:04.600 --> 01:06.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
21.

01:06.266 --> 01:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She shared her cell
designed for one person
with three other women.

01:09.333 --> 01:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She started a
school on death row.

01:11.166 --> 01:12.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She established a choir.

01:12.966 --> 01:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She was a lead in
the prison church.

01:14.900 --> 01:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw that Susan was
transforming her community
from the inside out.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The African Prisons Project got
her admitted into the University
of London in 2011 to study

01:23.666 --> 01:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a law degree by
correspondence, as Nelson
Mandela had done from
prison in South Africa.

01:28.133 --> 01:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So,Susan was one of the
University of London's best
students in human rights law.

01:32.700 --> 01:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She established a legal aid
clinic in her prison, helping
scores of her fellow inmates

01:36.800 --> 01:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be released from prison.

01:38.800 --> 01:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She led a case, Susan Kigula
and 417 others, where all of
the death row inmates in Uganda

01:45.466 --> 01:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenged the mandatory
death sentence for
murder and armed robbery.

01:48.100 --> 01:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a result of this case,
Susan and hundreds of others
were released from death row.

01:54.266 --> 01:56.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's now completed
her law degree.

01:56.433 --> 01:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Uganda's most senior
judge invited her to apply
to join the judiciary.

01:59.200 --> 02:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said: I won't, and now I'm
going to train women in prison
in the law, so they can use

02:05.533 --> 02:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the law to protect their
families and their communities.

02:07.600 --> 02:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in the process of
establishing the world's first
prison-based law college.

02:12.533 --> 02:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're then going to establish a
prison-based law firm, through
which they provide services

02:16.833 --> 02:18.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to their peers.

02:18.833 --> 02:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen about 3,000 people
released from prison in Uganda
and Kenya, having accessed

02:21.900 --> 02:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
legal services from
prisoners and prison
staff we have trained.

02:25.133 --> 02:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The law is seen as
a profession for the
privileged, for the elite.

02:29.866 --> 02:31.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want to change that thinking.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We recognize that, actually, the
law is here to serve all of us.

02:35.233 --> 02:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to see people getting
out of prison, becoming lawyers
and judges, and politicians,

02:42.166 --> 02:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and legal academics, and
business leaders, going from the
margins of society to the center

02:45.833 --> 02:47.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

02:47.766 --> 02:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Alexander McLean.

02:49.800 --> 02:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is my Brief But Spectacular
take on the power of the law
in the hands of the poor.

02:57.266 --> 03:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
