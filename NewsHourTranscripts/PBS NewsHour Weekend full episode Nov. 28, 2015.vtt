WHY THIS BACK AND FORTH?

05:30.630 --> 05:32.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY THIS ESCALATION ON THE PART

05:32.165 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF RUSSIA AND REALLY

THE PART OF TURKEY?

05:35.869 --> 05:36.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, TURKEY ISN'T

05:36.903 --> 05:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DE-ESCALATING AS MUCH AS THEY

05:38.004 --> 05:38.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD.

05:38.738 --> 05:41.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY DID NOT FOLLOW STANDARD

05:41.141 --> 05:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRACTICE IN SHOOTING DOWN THE

05:42.642 --> 05:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIAN PLANE.

05:43.643 --> 05:44.611 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY MIGHT HAVE GIVEN SOME

05:44.611 --> 05:46.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERBAL WARNING BUT THEY COULD

05:46.079 --> 05:47.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ESCORTED THE PLANE TO GET

05:47.280 --> 05:49.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT OFF OF TURKISH TERRITORY.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY COULD HAVE FIRED WARNING

SHOTS.

05:51.218 --> 05:53.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, TURKEY IS NOT THE VICTIM

05:53.220 --> 05:53.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE.

05:53.987 --> 05:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT IT'S NOT

05:56.122 --> 05:57.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURPRISING THAT RUSSIA IS

05:57.958 --> 05:58.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY ANGRY ABOUT WHAT'S

05:58.792 --> 05:59.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT PUTIN IS SORT OF FOLLOWING

06:01.027 --> 06:02.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS NORMAL PATTERN OF BEING MORE

06:02.596 --> 06:03.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANGRY THAN HE NEEDS TO BE AND OF

06:03.997 --> 06:05.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKING MORE EXTREME ACTION THAN

06:05.732 --> 06:07.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE NEEDS TO TAKE IN RESPONSE.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: MOST IN THE

06:08.134 --> 06:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. DON'T REALIZE HOW CLOSE AND

06:11.004 --> 06:12.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW CONNECTED RUSSIA AND TURKEY

06:12.639 --> 06:13.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE.

06:13.840 --> 06:14.908 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS I WAS READING THIS, THIS IS

06:14.908 --> 06:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE BIGGEST DESTINATIONS

06:16.843 --> 06:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR RUSSIANS TO GET OUT OF

06:17.911 --> 06:18.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:18.712 --> 06:19.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, HUGE TOURIST

DESTINATION, A LOT OF TRADE.

06:21.948 --> 06:23.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT'S SURPRISING THAT PUTIN'S

06:23.450 --> 06:25.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REACTION IS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

06:25.018 --> 06:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THESE VERY STRONG ECONOMIC

06:26.519 --> 06:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

YOU WONDER WHO IS LEFT TO BE

TRADING WITH RUSSIA?

06:32.759 --> 06:33.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA HAS PUT SANCTIONS AGAINST

THE EUROPEAN UNION.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TURKEY.

06:37.063 --> 06:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE ARE THEIR FRIENDS,

EXACTLY?

06:38.798 --> 06:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT SEEMS THEIR ONLY FRIENDS AT

THIS POINT ARE SYRIA AND IRAN.

06:42.569 --> 06:43.403 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT ON THE

RUSSIAN ECONOMY, WHICH ISN'T

06:44.537 --> 06:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING TOO GREAT.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER OF

06:47.674 --> 06:50.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA MADE THAT POINT PUBLICLY,

06:50.143 --> 06:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE

06:51.578 --> 06:52.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOOD FOR THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY.

06:52.779 --> 06:53.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS GOING TO HURT THE RUSSIAN

06:53.680 --> 06:55.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY AS BADLY AS THE TURKISH

06:55.015 --> 06:56.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY.

06:56.516 --> 06:57.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY WAS ALREADY

06:57.550 --> 06:59.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN RECESSION PRIMARILY BECAUSE

06:59.386 --> 07:01.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF LOW OIL PRICES.

07:01.321 --> 07:02.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE PUTIN

07:02.989 --> 07:04.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPRESSES ANGER IN WAYS THAT

07:04.491 --> 07:06.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY SHOOT RUSSIA IN THE

07:06.059 --> 07:06.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LOT TO LOSE IN THIS.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY NEED ALL OF THE ENERGY THEY

07:10.497 --> 07:11.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET FROM RUSSIA.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY DO.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF

07:14.467 --> 07:15.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATURAL GAS THAT THEY ARE

07:15.935 --> 07:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTING FROM RUSSIA.

07:17.570 --> 07:18.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PIPELINE THAT WAS GOING TO GO

07:19.706 --> 07:21.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO EFFECT TO ALLOW RUSSIA TO

07:21.675 --> 07:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BYPASS UKRAINE IN ITS GAS

07:24.210 --> 07:25.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPORTS TO EUROPE THAT NOW SEEMS

07:25.745 --> 07:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE IT'S ON THE ROCKS,

07:26.980 --> 07:28.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH PEOPLE REALIZE THAT

07:28.148 --> 07:30.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASN'T VERY PROFITABLE ANYWAY.

07:30.016 --> 07:31.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THAT MAY HAVE BEEN AN EXCUSE

07:31.351 --> 07:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET AROUND IT.

07:32.585 --> 07:33.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT ALSO SEEMS LIKE THEY MIGHT

07:33.553 --> 07:34.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOSE GRAIN IMPORTS FROM

07:34.888 --> 07:36.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA, AND UKRAINE IS

07:36.289 --> 07:38.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEPPING IN SAYING, "TURKEY, IF

07:38.325 --> 07:39.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU NEED GRAIN, WE'RE HERE.
