GWEN IFILL: But, first, in
issuing guidelines
for how we should eat for the
first time in

00:04.371 --> 00:09.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
five years, the federal
government revises
some of its longstanding advice.

00:09.576 --> 00:11.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that.

00:11.345 --> 00:14.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Despite all
the warnings
over the years, you may be
surprised that,

00:14.514 --> 00:18.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the first time, the
government put a limit
on added sugar, saying it should
comprise

00:18.919 --> 00:22.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
no more than 10 percent of your
daily calories.

00:22.422 --> 00:27.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The guidelines also dropped
prior advice about
limiting or avoiding cholesterol
and eggs.

00:27.728 --> 00:32.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government warned about
eating too much
protein or red meat, but stopped
short of

00:32.099 --> 00:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what some experts wanted. And it
said moderate
drinking of alcohol or coffee is
OK.

00:37.738 --> 00:41.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help guide us through some of
these guidelines,
their impact and the
controversy, I'm joined

00:41.708 --> 00:45.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Allison Aubrey, food and
health correspondent
for NPR.

00:45.112 --> 00:47.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Allison, let's start with
sugar first.

00:47.848 --> 00:49.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY, NPR: Sure.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What is the
right amount
of sugar? And put it in terms I
can understand.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALLISON AUBREY: Sure.

00:53.587 --> 00:56.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, basically, the dietary
guidelines are
coming out and saying you should
get no more

00:56.924 --> 01:02.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than 10 percent of your calories
per day from
sugar, and that translates to
about 10 to

01:02.529 --> 01:09.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
12-teaspoons per day. Now, keep
in mind, this
adds up really, really quickly.
It translates

01:09.503 --> 01:13.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to about maybe 40 grams of
sugar. That's the
unit of measurement that people
are used to

01:13.941 --> 01:15.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
seeing on labels.

01:15.809 --> 01:21.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, this morning,
I had a yogurt
for breakfast that had about 20
grams of sugar.

01:21.181 --> 01:27.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You had one sort of sugary drink
or one muffin,
you're at your daily limit. And
basically,

01:27.187 --> 01:32.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now, Americans are eating
about twice
as much. We have reported on
studies that

01:32.759 --> 01:36.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
show that many Americans are
eating 22 teaspoons
a day.

01:36.396 --> 01:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if people are going to start
following
these recommendations, it really
means cutting

01:40.634 --> 01:42.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consumption of sugar in half.

01:42.436 --> 01:45.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
maybe that will
help keep my New Year's
resolution going.

01:45.105 --> 01:50.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's also talk about the
change, it seems,
about eggs and cholesterol. Why
the change?

01:50.077 --> 01:55.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Well, it's been
sort of evolving
nutrition science, I would say.

01:55.048 --> 02:01.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There used to be a belief that
if you were
to eat a lot of cholesterol-rich
foods, so

02:01.788 --> 02:07.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
animal-based foods with
cholesterol, think
of eggs or shrimp, that that
high cholesterol

02:07.694 --> 02:12.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
would lead to high LDL
cholesterol in your
bloodstream.

02:12.432 --> 02:16.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is still clearly a
concern about
elevated cholesterol in
bloodstream. That's

02:16.670 --> 02:21.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why many, many Americans are on
statins. But
it's now recognized that
high-cholesterol

02:21.975 --> 02:26.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
foods don't necessarily
translate into higher
cholesterol in our blood.

02:26.880 --> 02:32.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So the
guidelines didn't
say eat less red meat. It said
go ahead and

02:32.152 --> 02:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supplement with more seafood and
other things.
Why?

02:35.188 --> 02:40.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Well, I think
what the goal
is that one of the committee
members told

02:40.794 --> 02:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me that Americans don't want to
be told what
not to eat, what to avoid. They
want to be

02:46.333 --> 02:50.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
told what they -- how to expand
their diet
or add more variety.

02:50.904 --> 02:56.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the words of the dietary
guidelines
and the people supporting
communication about

02:56.943 --> 03:03.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the new guidelines, the word
they're using
is shift. The idea is to shift
away from meat

03:03.817 --> 03:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and try alternative sources of
protein, so
anything from seafood to nuts to
beans.

03:08.722 --> 03:13.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, implicitly, that might mean
eating less
red meat, if you're eating more
of these other

03:13.827 --> 03:21.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sources of protein. It's a
little bit controversial.
The committee that helped advise
the administration

03:21.835 --> 03:26.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on what should be in these
guidelines came
out last year and said, hey, we
think you

03:26.339 --> 03:31.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should tell Americans to eat
less red meat.
But, in the end, that's not
what's in their

03:31.812 --> 03:33.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dietary guidelines.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And what are
nutritionists
or experts in this think as
well?

03:36.083 --> 03:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Well, there is
some criticism,
I have to say, today.

03:38.785 --> 03:46.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have spoken to several top
nutrition researchers
who say a limit on red meat
really should

03:46.693 --> 03:51.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have been put into the
guidelines. Otherwise,
Americans might just be confused
by this message

03:51.598 --> 03:57.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about shifting. And I think the
range of opinion
goes something like this.

03:57.437 --> 04:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people say, well, if you
are nudging
Americans to eat a little bit
less, that's

04:01.408 --> 04:08.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough. The other point of view
is Americans
need to be told like, hey, there
is too much

04:08.115 --> 04:13.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
red meat in your diet. They need
a specific
limit, but, again, that's not
there.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The fact that
these guidelines
come out only once every five
years, it almost

04:18.024 --> 04:24.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
makes it a political document.
It's a statement
by an administration on what
they think the

04:24.331 --> 04:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government thinks people should
or shouldn't
eat, right?

04:26.766 --> 04:32.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Well, I don't
see it so much
as a political document, as I
see it as kind

04:32.906 --> 04:34.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a consensus report.

04:34.674 --> 04:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a lag factor here. You
pointed out
in the beginning that just now
do we have

04:38.879 --> 04:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a recommendation to limit sugar.
Your grandmother
could have told you that too
much sugar is

04:42.782 --> 04:47.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bad for you. And what you have
to understand
is that the way this process
works is that,

04:47.254 --> 04:51.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every five years, the Department
of Health
and Human Services and the U.S.
Department

04:51.758 --> 04:57.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Agriculture assign this
expert committee
to review all the new evidence.

04:57.297 --> 05:02.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They pore over all of the
nutrition science
and they try to come up with a
consensus.

05:02.402 --> 05:07.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for instance, five years
ago, we knew
that sugar would rot your teeth,
but we didn't

05:07.174 --> 05:11.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that 22 teaspoons of sugar
a day would
lead to an increased risk of
heart disease

05:11.845 --> 05:13.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or diabetes.

05:13.647 --> 05:20.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it takes a while for a
body of evidence
to lead scientists to say, aha,
we need a

05:20.220 --> 05:23.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clear recommendation here, so a
bit of a lag
time.

05:23.623 --> 05:26.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Allison Aubrey
of NPR, thanks so much for
joining us.

05:26.793 --> 05:27.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Thanks for
having me.
