JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.
I'm Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is

00:06.740 --> 00:11.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away. On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Five people were shot in

00:11.111 --> 00:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Minneapolis protesting a police
shooting. This comes as a

00:14.548 --> 00:19.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chicago officer is charged with
murder for firing 16 times at a

00:19.186 --> 00:23.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
black teen last year. Then,
Turkey shoots down a Russian

00:23.757 --> 00:26.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
warplane that was on the
Syrian-Turkey border,

00:26.727 --> 00:30.264 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
complicating talks between
President Obama and French

00:30.297 --> 00:36.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Hollande over strategy
against ISIS. And how pesticides

00:36.236 --> 00:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are killing bee colonies.
CHRISTIAN KRUPKE, Purdue

00:38.572 --> 00:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University: We collected some of
those bees and analyzed them,

00:42.209 --> 00:45.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and found neonicotinoids on them
and in them, so there is an

00:45.979 --> 00:50.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intersection between planting
these crops and killing foraging

00:50.250 --> 00:53.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
honey bees. JUDY WOODRUFF: All
that and more on tonight's "PBS

00:53.754 --> 00:58.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NewsHour." (BREAK) JUDY
WOODRUFF: There is breaking news

01:08.335 --> 01:11.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of Chicago tonight. The
mayor and the chief of police

01:11.505 --> 01:14.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are holding a press conference
at this hour about the shooting

01:14.641 --> 01:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald.
They're expected to release a

01:18.612 --> 01:22.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
video of the shooting. The
teenager was fatally shot last

01:22.115 --> 01:26.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year by police officer Jason Van
Dyke, who emptied all 16 rounds

01:26.853 --> 01:30.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of his firearm. Earlier today,
Van Dyke was charged with

01:30.857 --> 01:34.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first-degree murder. Tonight,
the Chicago Police Department

01:34.394 --> 01:37.731 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has ordered most of the police
force into uniform in

01:37.764 --> 01:41.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anticipation of possible
protests. The family of the

01:41.034 --> 01:44.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
victim has urged people to stay
calm. We will have more on this

01:44.371 --> 01:49.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
story later in the program. The
air war over Syria saw a

01:49.676 --> 01:54.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
long-feared escalation today, as
a Russian warplane was shot down

01:54.681 --> 01:58.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by the Turks in disputed
circumstances, while, in

01:58.685 --> 02:02.155 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Washington, President Obama
pledged American solidarity to

02:02.189 --> 02:06.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
French President Hollande, as
the two leaders discussed

02:06.193 --> 02:11.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
efforts to unite a global
coalition to fight the Islamic

02:11.198 --> 02:16.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State 10 days after the attacks
in Paris. This fiery streak

02:16.737 --> 02:21.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hurtling earthward is a Russian
Sukhoi fighter jet, shot down by

02:21.508 --> 02:26.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkish warplanes. Turkey said
the jet entered its airspace and

02:26.279 --> 02:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ignored multiple calls to leave.
But Russia rejected those

02:30.584 --> 02:34.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
claims, and said the jet was
operating over Syrian airspace

02:34.755 --> 02:39.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amid its bombing campaign. The
incident occurred near Turkey's

02:39.126 --> 02:42.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
southernmost border. Rebel
groups on the ground said the

02:42.896 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plane crashed close to the
Syrian town of Yamadi. Russia's

02:47.234 --> 02:53.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military said that both pilots
ejected, and confirmed one was

02:53.774 --> 02:58.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killed. The fate of the second
pilot remained unclear. Russian

02:58.211 --> 03:02.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officials said he was still
missing, but a commander of a

03:02.416 --> 03:07.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rebel group in Syria said they
killed both pilots. MAN (through

03:07.687 --> 03:11.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
translator): Our comrades opened
fire into the air. We all did.

03:11.525 --> 03:15.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They died in the air. JUDY
WOODRUFF: A Russian soldier

03:15.595 --> 03:18.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aboard a helicopter was also
killed during a

03:18.665 --> 03:23.103 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
search-and-rescue operation. One
Russian chopper was brought down

03:23.136 --> 03:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by Syrian rebel fire. This video
apparently shows its

03:28.642 --> 03:33.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
destruction, using an anti-tank
missile supplied to some Syrian

03:33.647 --> 03:36.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rebel groups by the United
States. The shoot-down led to

03:36.616 --> 03:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
immediate and harsh words.
Russian President Vladimir Putin

03:41.822 --> 03:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warned of serious consequences
in denouncing the Turks.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):

03:48.228 --> 03:50.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today's loss is a stab in the
back delivered to us by

03:50.897 --> 03:53.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accomplices of terrorists. I
cannot qualify what happened

03:53.967 --> 03:56.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today as anything else. Our
pilots and our plane in no way

03:56.970 --> 03:59.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threatened the Turkish republic.
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, Russia's

03:59.573 --> 04:03.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov
canceled a scheduled visit to

04:03.443 --> 04:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkey and said Russian citizens
should avoid travelling to the

04:07.047 --> 04:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country. But, in Ankara, Turkish
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan

04:12.219 --> 04:16.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said his country's actions were
justified. RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN,

04:16.123 --> 04:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkish President (through
translator): We are feeling

04:18.125 --> 04:20.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
distressed, but the actions were
fully in line with Turkey's

04:20.293 --> 04:23.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rules for engagement that have
been declared before. Turkey

04:23.196 --> 04:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't harbor enmity towards
its neighbors. JUDY WOODRUFF: In

04:26.299 --> 04:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brussels, NATO convened an
emergency meeting at the request

04:29.803 --> 04:33.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Turkey, a NATO member-state.
Secretary-General Jens

04:33.874 --> 04:37.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Stoltenberg said he supports
Turkey, but the facts must

04:37.711 --> 04:40.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emerge. JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO
Secretary-General: This is a

04:40.914 --> 04:46.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
situation which calls on that we
all are prudent and that we call

04:46.486 --> 04:51.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contribute to de-escalating the
situation. JUDY WOODRUFF: At the

04:51.625 --> 04:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House, President Obama
spoke after meeting with French

04:55.262 --> 05:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Francois Hollande on
efforts to ramp up the U.S.-led

05:00.333 --> 05:04.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coalition's campaign against
Islamic State. He said Turkey

05:04.237 --> 05:06.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had a right to defend its
airspace. BARACK OBAMA,

05:06.540 --> 05:11.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President of the United States:
I do think that this points to a

05:11.178 --> 05:16.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ongoing problem with the Russian
operations, in the sense that

05:16.416 --> 05:20.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are operating very close to
a Turkish border and they are

05:20.520 --> 05:24.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going after moderate opposition
that are supported not only

05:24.858 --> 05:27.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkey, but a wide range of
countries. JUDY WOODRUFF: The

05:27.594 --> 05:31.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president again said Russia
could work with the coalition if

05:31.331 --> 05:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it decides only to target the
Islamic State. But as it stands,

05:35.835 --> 05:39.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Obama said Russia had made a
more limited choice. BARACK

05:39.439 --> 05:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OBAMA: Russia right now is a
coalition of two, Iran and

05:44.778 --> 05:48.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia, supporting Assad. JUDY
WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, Hollande

05:48.415 --> 05:52.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said France would redouble its
efforts to fight ISIS, but he

05:52.385 --> 05:56.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said that effort will go only so
far. FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French

05:56.790 --> 05:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President (through translator):
France will not intervene

05:59.926 --> 06:03.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
militarily on the ground. It is
for the local forces to do so.

06:03.463 --> 06:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hollande will be
in Moscow Thursday to meet with

06:07.601 --> 06:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Putin. We will come back to look
at the consequences of the

06:11.171 --> 06:14.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shoot-down of the Russian plane
after the news summary. French

06:14.941 --> 06:18.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecutors announced today the
alleged mastermind of the Paris

06:18.378 --> 06:22.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks likely had plans for
another suicide bombing in the

06:22.482 --> 06:26.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city's business district.
Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who died in

06:26.553 --> 06:31.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a police raid last week, also
moved actively from crime scene

06:31.057 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to crime scene in Paris just
hours after the carnage.

06:34.494 --> 06:36.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRANCOIS MOLINS, Paris
Prosecutor (through translator):

06:36.496 --> 06:39.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The geolocation of the suspected
phone line of Abdelhamid Abaaoud

06:39.566 --> 06:43.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shows that he was present and
notably near the attacks sites

06:43.036 --> 06:46.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, notably, near the Bataclan
concert hall. This makes us

06:46.206 --> 06:49.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
think that he returned to the
crime scenes after the attacks

06:49.676 --> 06:52.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the cafes and restaurants and
while the anti-terror brigade

06:52.846 --> 06:56.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was still working at the
Bataclan. JUDY WOODRUFF: Jawad

06:56.182 --> 06:59.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bendaoud, the man who allegedly
housed the ringleader and at

06:59.753 --> 07:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
least two others, was charged
today in connection with the

07:02.922 --> 07:06.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attacks. He claims he didn't
know that they were terrorists.

07:06.459 --> 07:10.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Brussels, Belgium,
a terror alert extended into a

07:10.163 --> 07:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fourth day. Soldiers patrolled
the streets and the subway

07:13.833 --> 07:17.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
remained closed. Tunisia is
under a state of emergency

07:17.937 --> 07:21.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tonight after a terrorist attack
on a bus filled with

07:21.408 --> 07:25.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presidential guards killed at
least 12 people. The explosion

07:25.712 --> 07:29.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened along a main avenue in
the capital city, Tunis. There

07:29.582 --> 07:32.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were reports that it was caused
by a bomber who detonated an

07:32.919 --> 07:36.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explosive device inside the bus.
Ten days ago, authorities

07:36.823 --> 07:40.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
increased security levels and
deployed extra forces across the

07:40.727 --> 07:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capital. U.S. Secretary of State
John Kerry visited Israel and

07:45.165 --> 07:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the West Bank today as sporadic
violence flared in the area. A

07:48.768 --> 07:53.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Palestinian drove his vehicle
into a group of Israeli soldiers

07:53.106 --> 07:56.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a checkpoint. Elsewhere,
Palestinians hurled stones at

07:56.576 --> 08:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israeli troops in Ramallah, who
fired back with tear gas and

08:00.180 --> 08:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rubber bullets. Hours later,
Kerry was in that city to meet

08:04.284 --> 08:07.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas. Earlier, he met

08:07.721 --> 08:11.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: No people anywhere should

08:13.526 --> 08:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
live with daily violence, with
attacks in the streets, with

08:19.632 --> 08:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knifes or scissors or cars. And
it is very clear to us that

08:30.377 --> 08:33.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
terrorism, these acts of
terrorism which are taking

08:33.179 --> 08:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place, deserve the condemnation
that they are receiving. JUDY

08:38.752 --> 08:42.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Kerry made no mention
of reviving peace talks. This

08:42.222 --> 08:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been the deadliest week
since the current wave of

08:44.924 --> 08:48.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
violence broke out in
mid-September. Liberia has

08:49.028 --> 08:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recorded its first Ebola death
since July, a 15-year-old boy.

08:53.666 --> 08:57.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He died in an eastern district
of the West African country on

08:57.670 --> 09:01.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Monday night. Both his father
and brother have also been

09:01.074 --> 09:04.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diagnosed with Ebola. Health
workers have identified about

09:04.577 --> 09:08.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
160 other people who might be at
risk because they came in direct

09:08.915 --> 09:13.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contact with the boy. Liberia's
Ebola outbreak began in March

09:13.720 --> 09:18.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2014 and killed more than 4,800
people. The American Civil

09:18.691 --> 09:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Liberties Union has filed a
lawsuit against the governor of

09:21.795 --> 09:25.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Indiana for suspending programs
that help resettle Syrian

09:25.932 --> 09:29.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
refugees in his state.
Republican Mike Pence stopped

09:29.335 --> 09:33.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
accepting Syrians in the wake of
the Paris attacks. The federal

09:33.273 --> 09:37.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lawsuit was filed on behalf of
the non-profit group Exodus

09:37.510 --> 09:41.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Refugee Immigration. In
Indianapolis, its executive

09:41.114 --> 09:45.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
director argued it's illegal for
states to ban refugees based on

09:45.518 --> 09:47.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their nationality. CARLEEN
MILLER, Executive Director,

09:47.520 --> 09:49.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Exodus Refugee Immigration: I
really think it is completely

09:49.856 --> 09:53.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
misguided, because refugees are
admitted into the U.S. They are

09:53.793 --> 09:58.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
legal persons here, and they
have the freedom of movement,

09:58.932 --> 10:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just like anyone else. So they
can go to any state in the union

10:02.101 --> 10:05.138 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they choose. JUDY WOODRUFF:
At the same time, the Canadian

10:05.171 --> 10:09.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government today unveiled a plan
to accept 25,000 Syrian refugees

10:09.976 --> 10:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the end of February. The
country's new president, Justin

10:13.813 --> 10:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trudeau, hasn't backed down from
the pledge he made before the

10:17.550 --> 10:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paris attacks, and he promised
the screening process would be

10:21.221 --> 10:25.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vigorous. The state of Kentucky
has restored voting rights to

10:25.558 --> 10:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thousands of nonviolent felons
who have already served out

10:29.162 --> 10:32.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their sentences. Outgoing
Democratic Governor Steve

10:32.332 --> 10:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beshear signed the executive
order today. He leaves office

10:36.336 --> 10:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
next month. About 180,000 former
prisoners are affected. In

10:40.974 --> 10:45.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Florida, Virginia and Iowa,
felons and ex-felons still

10:45.211 --> 10:48.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
permanently lose their right to
vote, without a pardon from the

10:48.581 --> 10:52.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
governor. The U.S. economy did
better than expected over the

10:52.252 --> 10:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
summer, expanding by more than 2
percent. The Commerce Department

10:56.322 --> 10:59.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revised its initial figures,
mainly because businesses

10:59.926 --> 11:04.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
restocked their shelves faster
than estimated. Stocks on Wall

11:04.163 --> 11:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Street today gained ground on
rising crude oil prices. The Dow

11:08.301 --> 11:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jones industrial average added
19 points to close at 17812. The

11:14.274 --> 11:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nasdaq rose less than a point,
and the S&amp;P 500 gained two

11:18.344 --> 11:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points. And late this afternoon
at the White House, President

11:22.115 --> 11:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama awarded the nation's
highest civilian award to 17 new

11:26.953 --> 11:30.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
honorees. During a ceremony in
the East Room, the president

11:30.857 --> 11:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
presented the Medal of Freedom
to this year's recipients, among

11:34.494 --> 11:38.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them, actress and singer Barbra
Streisand, movie director Steven

11:38.431 --> 11:43.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Spielberg, and NASA
mathematician Katherine Johnson.

11:43.403 --> 11:47.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
competing interests and a common

11:47.073 --> 11:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enemy forming a coalition
against ISIS; fatal shootings by

11:51.878 --> 11:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police spark protests in the
Midwest; the double-edged sword

11:56.516 --> 12:01.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of social media, a tool for
democracy and terrorism; and

12:04.991 --> 12:09.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much more. We return now to the
fight against the Islamic State

12:16.903 --> 12:20.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group and how those efforts
might be hindered by Turkey's

12:20.740 --> 12:24.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
downing of a Russian warplane.
I'm joined by Nicholas Burns, a

12:24.577 --> 12:28.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
career diplomat and former U.S.
ambassador to NATO. He's now a

12:28.748 --> 12:32.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
professor at Harvard University.
And Angela Stent, author of "The

12:32.885 --> 12:36.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Limits of Partnership:
U.S.-Russian Relations in the

12:36.289 --> 12:39.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
21st Century." She's a senior
fellow at the Transatlantic

12:39.792 --> 12:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Academy. And we welcome you
both. So, just based on what we

12:44.497 --> 12:47.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know, Angela Stent, who do we
think was at fault here? Was it

12:47.767 --> 12:50.937 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Turks for allegedly
violating Russian airspace or

12:50.970 --> 12:55.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was it the Russians for -- I'm
sorry -- the Russians for going

12:55.074 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into Turkish airspace, or the
other way around? ANGELA STENT,

12:58.144 --> 13:00.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Author, "The Limits of
Partnership": Well, apparently,

13:00.446 --> 13:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russians were only in
Turkish airspace for less than a

13:02.982 --> 13:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
minute. But this isn't the first
time apparently that Russian

13:05.418 --> 13:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
planes have violated Turkish
airspace. The Turks claim that

13:08.588 --> 13:12.091 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they gave the Russians 10
warnings. The Russians claim

13:12.125 --> 13:15.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that that's not true. But it
does appear that they were

13:15.194 --> 13:18.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
briefly in Turkish airspace. The
question is, could this have

13:18.564 --> 13:21.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been de-escalated? Could the
Turks maybe have offered to

13:21.801 --> 13:25.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
escort them out of Turkish
airspace? JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,

13:25.505 --> 13:27.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nicholas Burns, if they were in
Turkish -- over Turkish

13:27.507 --> 13:29.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airspace, even for less than
half-a-minute, was that

13:29.509 --> 13:31.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something that warranted being
shot down by the Turkish

13:31.511 --> 13:33.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
military? NICHOLAS BURNS, Former
U.S. Undersecretary of State for

13:33.513 --> 13:39.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Political Affairs: Well, the
history and circumstances are

13:39.652 --> 13:43.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important here. They did violate
Turkish airspace. And, as

13:43.489 --> 13:46.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama said, every
country has a right, Turkey has

13:46.492 --> 13:49.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a right to defend that airspace.
But the Russians have violated

13:49.962 --> 13:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkish airspace on several
occasions over the last two

13:53.099 --> 13:56.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
months. Russian drones have gone
across the border. And the Turks

13:56.569 --> 14:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have warned the Russians both
publicly and privately. The

14:00.073 --> 14:04.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russians have also been bombing
Syrian Turkmen, ethnic Turkmen

14:04.177 --> 14:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
villages very close to that
border, and the Turks warned the

14:07.814 --> 14:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russians about that. It seems to
be the last straw for the Turks.

14:12.085 --> 14:15.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are some people who are
saying the Turks should have

14:15.154 --> 14:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
acted differently, as Angela
said, that they might have

14:17.657 --> 14:20.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
escorted the fighters out, but
there was fair warning to the

14:20.693 --> 14:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russians. And as a NATO ally,
it's very important that the

14:24.397 --> 14:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United States defend this right
that every country's border are

14:27.200 --> 14:30.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sacrosanct. And what the
Russians did is clearly illegal

14:30.837 --> 14:32.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
under international law. JUDY
WOODRUFF: So, Angela Stent, if

14:32.839 --> 14:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russians were repeatedly
invading Turkish airspace, even

14:37.110 --> 14:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a brief time, the Turks then
thought ahead about what they

14:41.314 --> 14:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were doing. And what did they
accomplish by having done this?

14:44.817 --> 14:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGELA STENT: Well, I think the
Turks, they disagree with the

14:47.420 --> 14:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russians on what they're doing
in Syria. The Turks of course

14:50.490 --> 14:53.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are taking all these refugees
from President Assad. The

14:53.860 --> 14:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russians are supporting Assad.
And as Nick said, they have been

14:57.163 --> 15:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bombing and killing Turkmen
groups in Syria that are

15:01.100 --> 15:04.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protected really by Turkey. So I
think this is something that's

15:04.036 --> 15:07.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been brewing for some time. And
I think, on a broader point,

15:07.406 --> 15:10.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ever since the Russians began
the bombing campaign in Syria

15:10.276 --> 15:14.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and gave the U.S., for instance,
one hour's notice to get out of

15:14.347 --> 15:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the sky, there has been this
brinkmanship and there has been

15:17.016 --> 15:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the danger that something like
this would happen. And so I'm

15:19.685 --> 15:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sure that the Turks in some
senses were just waiting for

15:22.355 --> 15:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something like this to happen
and felt that they had to take a

15:25.525 --> 15:27.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stance on this. JUDY WOODRUFF:
Nicholas Burns, if that's the

15:27.960 --> 15:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
case, if the Turks thought in
advance and in essence planned

15:32.298 --> 15:34.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do this the next time a
Russian plane crossed their

15:34.967 --> 15:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border, what does that say about
what the Turks are -- what their

15:38.137 --> 15:42.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
posture is at this point?
NICHOLAS BURNS: Well, I think

15:42.775 --> 15:45.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Obama got the balance
right today. He clearly backed

15:45.745 --> 15:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Turks on the legal issue of
protection of borders, but he

15:48.781 --> 15:52.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also said that he would spend
all of his time trying now to

15:52.285 --> 15:55.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
de-escalate this conflict. And I
think what that means, Judy, is

15:55.188 --> 15:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the United States is going
to be very active both in Moscow

15:58.591 --> 16:02.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Ankara to counsel both to
stand down from any further

16:02.461 --> 16:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
altercation. What really needs
to happen -- and Angela is

16:05.832 --> 16:08.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
absolutely correct about this --
is, it's a crowded airspace in a

16:09.001 --> 16:12.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very small country. You have
American, French, sometimes

16:12.905 --> 16:16.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Arab, Russian aircraft and
Turkish aircraft patrolling in a

16:16.909 --> 16:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very small geographical area.
And so deconflicting those air

16:21.514 --> 16:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
operations, having channels
among the militaries to let each

16:25.718 --> 16:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other know when they're going to
be conducting combat operations

16:28.254 --> 16:31.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is critical. The U.S. and Russia
have begun to do that under

16:31.824 --> 16:34.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Secretary Ash Carter's
leadership. The Turks and

16:34.260 --> 16:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russians clearly have not. And I
think it's the role of the

16:36.762 --> 16:39.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
United States to try to promote
that kind of transparency,

16:39.765 --> 16:43.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because we don't want to see a
further incident like. Very

16:43.402 --> 16:46.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dangerous. We haven't had
anything like this in nearly 60

16:46.772 --> 16:50.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years in the NATO relationship
with both the Soviet Union and

16:50.443 --> 16:52.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Russia. JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
before I ask you both about how

16:52.678 --> 16:56.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it gets calmed down, let me just
ask you the question the other

16:56.182 --> 17:00.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way, Angela Stent. Why are the
Russians repeatedly crossing the

17:00.453 --> 17:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
border into Turkey? Do they not
see that as a provocative

17:03.256 --> 17:05.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
offense? ANGELA STENT: Well, I
think the Russians, they are

17:05.458 --> 17:08.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stating that they're back in
Syria, that they want to be a

17:08.961 --> 17:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leader, if you like, in this
coalition and that the Turks

17:13.799 --> 17:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't have the right to do this
to them. And they really want to

17:17.803 --> 17:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be -- they want the U.S. to come
to them and they want this broad

17:21.107 --> 17:23.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coalition. They want to be the
leader. And so they're really

17:23.876 --> 17:26.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being -- I mean, there is some
reckless behavior here,

17:26.145 --> 17:29.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obviously, even though they have
been deconflicting, as Nick

17:29.482 --> 17:32.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
said, with the U.S. on a
bilateral basis, and, by the

17:32.251 --> 17:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way, the Israelis, too. But
they're rather selective in the

17:35.922 --> 17:38.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
countries with which they have
so far being willing to

17:38.424 --> 17:41.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deconflict. JUDY WOODRUFF: What
does this say -- to both of you,

17:41.360 --> 17:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nick, to you first. What does
this say about the efforts? And

17:44.463 --> 17:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have just mentioned them
going along to try to put a

17:46.899 --> 17:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coalition together to find some
resolution in Syria. NICHOLAS

17:52.305 --> 17:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BURNS: Well, it's tragically
ironic that the two countries

17:56.008 --> 17:58.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that France and the United
States need to join this

17:58.544 --> 18:01.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
coalition against the Islamic
State are Turkey and Russia.

18:01.414 --> 18:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Turkey, as you know, has been --
has bombed in the recent weeks

18:06.519 --> 18:08.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Syrian Kurdish groups that
have been the most effective

18:08.988 --> 18:11.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fighting force against the
Islamic State. The Russians have

18:11.724 --> 18:14.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made a great rhetorical show of
saying they're against the

18:14.360 --> 18:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic State, but 95 percent of
airstrikes are not against the

18:17.763 --> 18:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Islamic State, but against some
of the Syrian groups, the Sunni

18:21.167 --> 18:24.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Turkmen groups opposing
President Assad. So, the

18:24.170 --> 18:27.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
challenge here is to make the
coalition bigger and stronger,

18:27.840 --> 18:31.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find a way to bring the
Russians and Turks in, but also,

18:31.544 --> 18:34.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Judy, to bring the Europeans in.
Most of the Europeans are

18:34.613 --> 18:37.984 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
missing in action. Britain is
not involved in the air campaign

18:38.017 --> 18:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Syria. And the Arab states
that made a big show of joining

18:41.320 --> 18:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this coalition several months
ago are mainly focused on Yemen,

18:45.458 --> 18:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not here. And so I think that's
the challenge for President

18:48.627 --> 18:51.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama and President Hollande as
they met at the White House this

18:51.564 --> 18:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
morning. JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
Angela Stent, do you see any

18:53.966 --> 18:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prospects for putting this
coalition together, getting it

18:57.403 --> 19:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stronger, getting it broader,
when, as Nicholas has just said,

19:02.641 --> 19:06.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russians are going after the
anti-Assad rebels? They're not

19:06.712 --> 19:10.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
primarily going after ISIS.
ANGELA STENT: I think it's going

19:10.082 --> 19:12.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to be very difficult. We
fundamentally -- we disagree

19:12.852 --> 19:16.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the Russians on the fate of
President Assad, and then we

19:16.555 --> 19:19.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disagree who the enemy is. We
can agree that it's Islamic

19:19.925 --> 19:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
State, but, as has been said,
the Russians have been bombing

19:23.329 --> 19:26.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mainly groups that are not part
of the Islamic State. I think

19:27.033 --> 19:30.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's going to be extremely
difficult. And it would take a

19:30.436 --> 19:33.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
resolution on Russia's part to
understand that they have to be

19:33.806 --> 19:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
willing to make compromises on
the issue of, you know, which

19:37.076 --> 19:39.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
groups you, in fact, are
targeting. And so far, we

19:39.645 --> 19:41.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
haven't seen very much
willingness on their part to do

19:42.014 --> 19:44.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that. JUDY WOODRUFF: Nicholas
Burns, is -- do you sense,

19:44.850 --> 19:48.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
though, that there are still
efforts to bring the Russians

19:48.587 --> 19:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around? I mean, I keep reading
reports that the administration

19:51.991 --> 19:54.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
continues to work on that, but
we just haven't seen any sign of

19:54.894 --> 19:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it yet. NICHOLAS BURNS: Well, we
need to work with the Russians,

19:58.397 --> 20:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mainly because they need the
Russians at the negotiating

20:00.966 --> 20:03.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
table in Vienna. And Secretary
Kerry, I think, clearly

20:03.436 --> 20:07.139 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
understands there won't be any
progress on these negotiations

20:07.173 --> 20:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- and these are going to be
tough, complex negotiations --

20:09.842 --> 20:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unless the Russians and Iran and
Hezbollah are there. That's

20:13.145 --> 20:15.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another problem for the
Russians. They have a mainly

20:15.714 --> 20:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sunni Muslim population in their
own North Caucasus region, but

20:19.985 --> 20:22.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Russians have aligned
themselves with the Shia powers,

20:22.521 --> 20:25.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Iran, with Hezbollah, and
with the Alawite regime in

20:25.958 --> 20:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria. And I think if the
Russians don't restrain the

20:29.195 --> 20:32.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian government from firing
barrel bombs into civilian

20:32.798 --> 20:36.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neighborhoods, the United States
ought to consider a no-flight

20:36.068 --> 20:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
zone with Turkey and other
countries to shut down the

20:38.971 --> 20:42.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syrian air force. That's what
Secretary -- former Secretary

20:42.108 --> 20:44.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hillary Clinton has been
advocating. And I think she's

20:44.376 --> 20:47.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right that the way to save
civilian lives and reduce the

20:47.546 --> 20:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
number of refugees is shut down
air traffic in the northern part

20:51.650 --> 20:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Syrian. I think, Judy, that's
an idea that the administration

20:54.954 --> 20:58.491 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has to consider now, given these
events. JUDY WOODRUFF: And we

20:58.524 --> 21:02.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
know a number of candidates in
fact are talking about that.

21:02.194 --> 21:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, the situation only got
more complicated today. Nicholas

21:04.196 --> 21:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Burns, Angela Stent, we thank
you. NICHOLAS BURNS: Thank you.

21:07.633 --> 21:12.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.
Coming up on the "NewsHour":

21:22.047 --> 21:26.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threats to the world's most
prolific pollinator. But, first,

21:26.919 --> 21:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we take a look at the latest
wave of violence in Israel and

21:30.189 --> 21:34.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Palestinian territories, and
how it connects to a new lawsuit

21:34.160 --> 21:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against social media giant
Facebook. Chief foreign affairs

21:37.696 --> 21:42.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
correspondent Margaret Warner.
MARGARET WARNER: Last month on

21:42.835 --> 21:46.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this Jerusalem bus, three
Israeli Jews were killed by two

21:46.739 --> 21:51.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young Palestinians wielding guns
and knives, among them,

21:51.477 --> 21:56.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
76-year-old Richard Lakin. The
American-Israeli teacher, a

21:56.348 --> 21:59.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
longtime U.S. civil rights
activist and educator, brought

21:59.952 --> 22:05.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his family to Israel in 1984.
His son Micah Avni recounts the

22:05.591 --> 22:09.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
horror of his death. MICAH AVNI,
Son of Victim: One of the

22:09.128 --> 22:11.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
terrorists, he shot my father in
the head. My father fell to the

22:11.497 --> 22:13.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ground. The other terrorist took
out a knife and started stabbing

22:13.999 --> 22:16.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him. He stabbed him multiple
times in the head, in the face,

22:16.802 --> 22:19.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slit his stomach wide open,
cutting most of his vital

22:19.605 --> 22:22.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
organs. MARGARET WARNER: Richard
Lakin was among more than 70

22:22.675 --> 22:26.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
targets of a new wave of attacks
this fall on Jewish individuals

22:26.512 --> 22:31.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by Palestinians. Since October
1, the Israeli Foreign Ministry

22:31.217 --> 22:35.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says, at least 21 Israelis have
been killed, and more than 184

22:35.988 --> 22:39.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wounded. What's different, the
vast majority of the attacks

22:39.892 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were by stabbing. Also notable,
the assailants seem to be

22:43.862 --> 22:48.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting younger, as young as 12
or 13. Since the uptick in

22:48.968 --> 22:52.771 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence began, at least 86
Palestinians have been killed as

22:52.805 --> 22:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well, shot during or after
carrying out an attack, or in

22:57.509 --> 23:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
clashes with Israeli forces.
After Lakin was stabbed, his son

23:02.214 --> 23:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struggled to understand. MICAH
AVNI: I asked myself, what would

23:05.884 --> 23:11.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bring two 20-, 22-year-olds to
board a bus and do something so

23:11.056 --> 23:14.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
brutal as to shoot three
70-year-olds and then to take a

23:14.593 --> 23:18.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knife and start to cut them up?
MARGARET WARNER: Then, online,

23:18.697 --> 23:21.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he discovered hundreds of
Facebook, Twitter and YouTube

23:21.800 --> 23:25.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
postings encouraging
Palestinians to stab Israeli

23:25.504 --> 23:29.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jews, and instructing them how
to do it. MICAH AVNI: Here's the

23:29.675 --> 23:34.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
instructional video showing how
to most effectively slice

23:34.079 --> 23:37.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
somebody open with a knife in a
way that my father was sliced

23:37.883 --> 23:42.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
open. They have a terrorist
encouraging people to go out and

23:42.621 --> 23:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stab Jews and showing how to
best prepare a knife and sharpen

23:45.858 --> 23:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. MARGARET WARNER: Avni
believes such postings spurred

23:48.694 --> 23:51.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the attacks on his father and
others. He's now the lead

23:51.997 --> 23:54.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plaintiff in a New York
class-action lawsuit against

23:54.900 --> 23:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Facebook. It was filed by the
Tel Aviv-based Israel Law

23:58.671 --> 24:02.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Center, which takes legal action
on behalf of terror victims and

24:02.875 --> 24:07.446 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against what it calls Israel's
enemies; 20,000 Israelis have

24:07.479 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
joined the suit. First, it asks
the court to order Facebook to

24:11.583 --> 24:15.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stop allowing Palestinian
terrorists to incite violent

24:15.521 --> 24:19.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
attacks against Israeli
citizens. It also charges that

24:19.525 --> 24:23.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Facebook's computers use
algorithms to connect terrorists

24:23.295 --> 24:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to users who've expressed
interest in violent acts against

24:26.498 --> 24:28.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jews. NOURA ERAKAT, George Mason
University: It's not Facebook

24:28.967 --> 24:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and YouTube and Twitter that is
inspiring youth to take up

24:33.339 --> 24:37.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
knives against civilians. The
root cause of this is the

24:37.810 --> 24:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ongoing occupation and the
violence, the military violence

24:41.380 --> 24:44.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that's meted out against
Palestinian bodies every day.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Noura Erakat is
assistant professor at George

24:46.819 --> 24:50.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mason University outside
Washington. Are you saying you

24:50.489 --> 24:53.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think these videos are
insignificant? NOURA ERAKAT: I

24:53.125 --> 24:56.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think that they are
insignificant relative to what

24:56.161 --> 24:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Palestinians are actually
producing. MARGARET WARNER: And,

24:59.531 --> 25:02.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she adds, there are plenty of
hateful postings from the

25:02.167 --> 25:06.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israeli side too. NOURA ERAKAT:
Facebook was also the site of a

25:06.338 --> 25:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
page in the summer of 2014, that
the page was, Israel demands

25:12.544 --> 25:17.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
revenge. Within less than a day,
there were 37,000 likes on that

25:18.016 --> 25:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
page. MARGARET WARNER: Facebook
declined to grant us an

25:20.452 --> 25:24.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on-camera interview, sending a
statement that said in part:

25:24.990 --> 25:28.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"There is no place for content
encouraging violence, direct

25:28.627 --> 25:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threats, terrorism or hate
speech on Facebook. We urge

25:32.097 --> 25:35.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people to use our reporting
tools if they find content that

25:36.001 --> 25:39.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they believe violates our
standards, so we can investigate

25:39.538 --> 25:43.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and take swift action." The
lawsuit, however, wants the

25:43.375 --> 25:47.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court to order Facebook to
remove content on its own. Noura

25:47.679 --> 25:51.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Erakat fears more vigorous
policing by Facebook will be

25:51.250 --> 25:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unfairly applied. NOURA ERAKAT:
What we can be assured is that

25:54.820 --> 25:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Facebook will take a much more
stringent approach to

25:58.090 --> 26:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Palestinian speech in ways that
they won't also apply to Israeli

26:02.227 --> 26:05.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speech. So we will see the
chilling of speech amongst

26:05.063 --> 26:07.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Palestinians. MARGARET WARNER:
That prospect concerns First

26:07.633 --> 26:11.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amendment lawyer and national
security expert Jonathan Turley

26:11.303 --> 26:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of George Washington University.
JONATHAN TURLEY, Constitutional

26:13.305 --> 26:15.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Attorney, George Washington
University: Unfortunately, this

26:15.307 --> 26:18.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is part of a trend that we have
been watching occur in Europe

26:18.510 --> 26:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
largely, particularly France and
England, where free speech is

26:23.081 --> 26:26.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being eroded. It's being eroded
with the criminalization of

26:26.518 --> 26:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speech that may be insulting or
viewed as threatening to any

26:31.089 --> 26:34.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
group or individual. At the same
time, we have seen civil

26:34.593 --> 26:37.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
litigation like this case where
people are going to the courts

26:37.696 --> 26:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to try to get injunctions. It's
an effort to use the court to

26:42.234 --> 26:45.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
punish or chill speech. MARGARET
WARNER: Turley is just as

26:45.637 --> 26:49.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
critical of efforts to shut down
Facebook's algorithms connecting

26:49.641 --> 26:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence-minded Palestinians
with one another. JONATHAN

26:52.544 --> 26:54.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TURLEY: It's not just free
speech that people want to

26:54.947 --> 26:58.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
limit. Once you limit free
speech, they seek to limit free

26:58.083 --> 27:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
association. There's no question
that -- that companies like

27:01.620 --> 27:05.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Facebook allow for dangerous
associations to be made. The

27:05.824 --> 27:08.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
question is, are we comfortable
with having the government or a

27:08.527 --> 27:11.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court sit there and choose what
are beneficial associations and

27:11.930 --> 27:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what are not? MARGARET WARNER:
Most radical groups use social

27:15.601 --> 27:20.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
media for recruitment and
propaganda. So says J.M. Berger,

27:20.772 --> 27:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
author of a book on ISIS and a
scholar at the Brookings

27:24.109 --> 27:26.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Institution. J.M. BERGER,
Brookings Institution: What

27:26.812 --> 27:29.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're seeing is, there's a
growing trend toward them using

27:29.781 --> 27:33.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it. WOLF BLITZER, CNN: Federal
authorities arrested an Ohio man

27:33.352 --> 27:35.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, accusing him of spreading
ISIS propaganda. MARGARET

27:35.354 --> 27:37.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WARNER: In the U.S., general
incitement has rarely been

27:37.523 --> 27:39.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecuted. But, lately, some
people are being charged, he

27:39.725 --> 27:41.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says. J.M. BERGER: Well, the
question of incitement to

27:41.894 --> 27:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence is a pretty complicated
one. We had a recent case, an

27:45.631 --> 27:49.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arrest of an ISIS supporter who
had posted names and addresses

27:49.101 --> 27:53.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of U.S. military personnel with
an injunction to go kill those

27:53.105 --> 27:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people. And that person was
charged with incitement to

27:56.375 --> 28:00.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violence, which we had not seen
previously as a counterterrorism

28:01.013 --> 28:04.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charge. MARGARET WARNER: Global
social media companies must walk

28:04.416 --> 28:08.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a balancing act between
protected speech and illegal

28:08.220 --> 28:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
content. J.M. BERGER: Companies
have to tailor their response to

28:11.623 --> 28:14.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
each country's rules and
regulations. Turkey and Russia

28:14.626 --> 28:18.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been the source of a very
large number of take-down

28:18.630 --> 28:22.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
requests to remove content,
based on claims that the content

28:22.768 --> 28:25.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is terrorist. But their
definitions of terrorism are not

28:25.537 --> 28:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
necessarily the same as ours.
MARGARET WARNER: Turley believes

28:29.441 --> 28:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Paris attacks prove Europe's
cracking down on violent content

28:32.277 --> 28:34.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been ineffective. JONATHAN
TURLEY: If you look at Germany,

28:34.680 --> 28:37.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which has the longest experience
on this in prohibiting even

28:37.583 --> 28:42.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
symbols like the swastika or
people who deny the Holocaust,

28:42.454 --> 28:46.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it hasn't made a bit of
difference. The neo-Nazi

28:46.224 --> 28:50.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
movement has continued to grow.
By forcing these groups

28:50.829 --> 28:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
underground, you lose track, not
only of them, but their views

28:56.401 --> 28:59.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and how they're changing. Much
of our actionable intelligence

28:59.705 --> 29:03.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
comes from being on these sites.
MARGARET WARNER: So your view

29:03.075 --> 29:06.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is, on the Internet, just let
1,000 poisonous flowers bloom,

29:06.511 --> 29:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatever the effect? JONATHAN
TURLEY: No. You know, these

29:08.780 --> 29:12.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies have the right to pull
material. There's a big

29:12.150 --> 29:17.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difference between asking a
government entity like a court

29:17.155 --> 29:21.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to censor or strip speech.
MARGARET WARNER: In the U.S.,

29:21.093 --> 29:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
policing of sites generally
falls to the companies

29:23.895 --> 29:26.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themselves, says Brookings'
Berger: J.M. BERGER: These

29:26.999 --> 29:31.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
companies suspend thousands of
users every day for a variety of

29:31.503 --> 29:34.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reasons, for instance, child
pornography, other kinds of

29:34.640 --> 29:38.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
content and harassment. And what
we don't have is any kind of

29:38.610 --> 29:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disclosure of who they suspend
and why. MARGARET WARNER: One

29:41.713 --> 29:44.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
thing that can prompt them to
act, he says, is negative

29:44.916 --> 29:47.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
publicity. J.M. BERGER: The
companies are extremely

29:47.619 --> 29:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sensitive to bad press. Those
stories will eventually have an

29:50.956 --> 29:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
effect, even on companies that
claim to have a very high-minded

29:54.960 --> 29:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mandate about free speech.
MARGARET WARNER: Facebook's

29:57.596 --> 30:00.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
response is expected in the New
York State Supreme Court in

30:00.165 --> 30:04.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
January. For Micah Anvi and his
lawyers, even if their lawsuit

30:04.670 --> 30:09.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fails, a publicity-driven change
in Facebook policing policies

30:09.474 --> 30:13.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would be a victory. I'm Margaret
Warner for the "PBS NewsHour."

30:13.879 --> 30:18.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now back to the
news out of Chicago. Within the

30:26.425 --> 30:29.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
past hour, the mayor and chief
of police held a press

30:29.795 --> 30:32.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conference about the police
officer's killing of a

30:32.497 --> 30:35.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
17-year-old last year. RAHM
EMANUEL (D), Mayor of Chicago:

30:35.500 --> 30:40.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need, as a city, to get to a
point where young men in our

30:40.806 --> 30:45.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community and in parts of our
city see an officer and don't

30:45.811 --> 30:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just see an officer with a
uniform and a badge, but they

30:49.347 --> 30:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see him as a partner in helping
them reach their full potential,

30:53.118 --> 30:57.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they see in that officer a
mentor, a little league coach, a

30:57.456 --> 31:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leader in their church and in
their community, which they are.

31:01.593 --> 31:05.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we also have to get to a
place in the city where officers

31:05.897 --> 31:10.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who patrol communities in our
city see a young man not as a

31:10.402 --> 31:15.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
potential problem and a risk,
but they also are seeing that

31:15.640 --> 31:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
young man as an individual who
is worthy of their protection

31:20.078 --> 31:23.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and their potential. JUDY
WOODRUFF: This has been one

31:23.248 --> 31:25.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
incident in a number of
shootings recently of

31:25.884 --> 31:29.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-American men by police
officers that have sparked

31:29.554 --> 31:33.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outrage. Protests in Minneapolis
continued today over the

31:33.425 --> 31:37.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shooting death of Jamar Clark
there nine days ago. Today, two

31:37.829 --> 31:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people were arrested after five
people were shot last night in

31:41.700 --> 31:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protests there. Jeffrey Brown
has more on both of these

31:45.003 --> 31:50.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stories. JEFFREY BROWN: Chicago
police officer Jason Van Dyke is

31:50.275 --> 31:54.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being held without bail after he
was charged Tuesday morning with

31:54.045 --> 31:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the first-degree murder of
Laquan McDonald. The 17-year-old

31:58.183 --> 32:03.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
black teenager was shot sixteen
times in October 2014, after Van

32:03.989 --> 32:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dyke, who is white, confronted
the teen for allegedly

32:07.092 --> 32:11.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
puncturing a police cruiser's
tire. Cook County state's

32:11.296 --> 32:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attorney Anita Alvarez discussed
the charge this afternoon. ANITA

32:14.800 --> 32:17.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALVAREZ, Cook County State's
Attorney: It is my determination

32:17.435 --> 32:21.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this defendant's actions,
of shooting Laquan McDonald when

32:21.573 --> 32:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he didn't pose an immediate
threat of great bodily harm or

32:24.576 --> 32:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
death, and his subsequent
actions of shooting Laquan

32:28.180 --> 32:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
McDonald while he lay on the
ground after previously being

32:31.483 --> 32:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struck by gunfire, were not
justified, and they were not a

32:35.387 --> 32:39.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proper use of deadly force by
this police officer. JEFFREY

32:39.691 --> 32:43.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: Yesterday, Chicago Mayor
Rahm Emanuel condemned the

32:43.395 --> 32:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shooting. RAHM EMANUEL: This
officer didn't uphold the law.

32:47.332 --> 32:51.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He took the law into this own
hand. Didn't build the trust

32:51.570 --> 32:54.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we want to see and wasn't
about providing the safety and

32:55.006 --> 32:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security. So, at every point, he
violated what we entrust him.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But after today's
indictment, Van Dyke's attorney

33:01.313 --> 33:03.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
responded forcefully. DANIEL
HERBERT, Attorney for Jason Van

33:03.949 --> 33:07.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dyke: This is a case that can't
be tried in the streets, it

33:07.118 --> 33:11.857 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can't be tried in the media, it
can't be tried on Facebook. With

33:11.890 --> 33:17.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
respect to certain comments that
have been made by politicians,

33:17.395 --> 33:21.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
politicians who have not seen
the video, where I believe my

33:21.132 --> 33:24.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
client's conduct has been
described as hideous, I would

33:24.970 --> 33:29.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state that those comments --
they are irresponsible, and

33:29.074 --> 33:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're certainly unfair and
prejudicial to my client.

33:32.744 --> 33:37.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thankfully, politicians will not
be deciding the fate of my

33:37.349 --> 33:41.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
client in this case. JEFFREY
BROWN: The city was under a

33:41.286 --> 33:44.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court order to release, by
tomorrow, the video recorded by

33:44.689 --> 33:48.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Van Dyke's police cruiser
dashboard camera. Mayor Emanuel,

33:48.760 --> 33:52.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who has resisted publicizing the
video for months, met with

33:52.264 --> 33:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pastors and other community
leaders Monday to prepare them

33:55.600 --> 33:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for what could be an intense
reaction to its release. Late

33:59.437 --> 34:02.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this afternoon, after word came
out that the video would be

34:02.707 --> 34:05.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
released, I spoke to Reverend
Jedidiah Brown, head of Young

34:05.710 --> 34:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Leaders Alliance, and asked him
what he expected to happen. REV.

34:08.980 --> 34:11.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEDIDIAH BROWN, Young Leaders
Alliance: We can't predict the

34:12.017 --> 34:16.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
reaction, because even listening
to the reading of, it was

34:16.454 --> 34:19.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
painful. I can't imagine the
pain that will be felt when they

34:19.190 --> 34:23.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see the video. There is a lot of
anger, but the video is a

34:23.461 --> 34:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vehicle that is unearthing a lot
of the discontent that citizens

34:28.366 --> 34:31.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the South and the West Side
of Chicago have had from police

34:31.770 --> 34:34.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
brutality, the lack of
representation, lack of

34:34.539 --> 34:37.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
investment. JEFFREY BROWN:
Meanwhile, in Minneapolis, late

34:37.943 --> 34:40.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last night, five protesters
outside a police precinct were

34:40.745 --> 34:44.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shot by three unidentified
attackers. PROTESTERS: We want

34:44.416 --> 34:47.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
justice! We want justice!
JEFFREY BROWN: The protesters

34:47.452 --> 34:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had been demonstrating outside
the precinct since the fatal

34:50.522 --> 34:53.525 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shooting of a young black man by
a police officer more than a

34:53.558 --> 34:58.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week ago. Some witnesses claimed
24-year-old Jamar Clark was

34:58.129 --> 35:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
either handcuffed or restrained
at the time of the shooting. But

35:01.566 --> 35:04.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the police union representing
the officers involved denied

35:04.703 --> 35:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that allegation and said Clark
had gained control of an

35:07.739 --> 35:11.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer's gun. Today, police
arrested two male suspects, one

35:11.977 --> 35:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
white, one Hispanic. And the
brother of Jamar Clark has

35:15.313 --> 35:17.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
called for an end to the
demonstration in light of the

35:17.816 --> 35:22.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shootings. But members of the
Black Lives Matter movement, who

35:22.087 --> 35:25.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been credited with keeping
the Minneapolis demonstrations

35:25.056 --> 35:28.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
peaceful, say they will continue
to protest. MISKI NOOR, Black

35:28.193 --> 35:31.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lives Matter: We will not bow to
fear or intimidation. Black

35:31.329 --> 35:33.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lives Matter exists to fight
against this type of violent

35:34.032 --> 35:37.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
white supremacy, dangerous
anti-black rhetoric, and

35:37.702 --> 35:41.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criminalization of black people.
Because of that, we are

35:41.806 --> 35:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recommitting our occupation of
the Fourth Precinct until we get

35:44.609 --> 35:47.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
justice. JEFFREY BROWN: Police
say there were no

35:47.212 --> 35:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
life-threatening injuries among
the five people shot Monday

35:50.615 --> 35:52.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
night. However, one victim
underwent surgery for a gunshot

35:52.884 --> 35:55.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wound to the stomach. And
joining us now for more

35:55.754 --> 35:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
perspective on both of these
cases is Georgetown University

35:58.456 --> 36:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Law Center Professor Paul
Butler. He is also a former

36:02.093 --> 36:04.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
federal prosecutor. Welcome to
you. Clearly, things moved

36:04.996 --> 36:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quickly after the order to
release the video, right? Did

36:08.833 --> 36:10.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that surprise you? PAUL BUTLER,
Professor, George Washington

36:10.835 --> 36:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
University School of Law: It
did, in the sense that this

36:12.837 --> 36:15.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shooting happened a year ago. If
the evidence is that compelling

36:15.974 --> 36:19.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to sustain murder charges, you
have to wonder why it took the

36:19.811 --> 36:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecutor so long to bring the
charges and why until today

36:24.382 --> 36:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer Van Dyke was a working
Chicago police officer. JEFFREY

36:28.086 --> 36:30.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BROWN: So, what does that tell
you? What role did the video

36:30.088 --> 36:33.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
play, then? PAUL BUTLER: You
know, it doesn't denigrate the

36:33.191 --> 36:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecutor to say that, in this
case, politics played a role, as

36:37.429 --> 36:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in every high-profile decision
by a prosecutor. This is an area

36:41.933 --> 36:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in which the politics over the
last year has changed. So, this

36:45.403 --> 36:51.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a prosecutor who is involved
in a tough reelection battle. In

36:51.242 --> 36:54.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this day and age, in some cities
with big minority populations

36:54.979 --> 36:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like Chicago, it's advantageous
to a prosecutor to say that she

36:59.117 --> 37:02.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes after cops when they cross
the line. JEFFREY BROWN: Now, a

37:02.053 --> 37:04.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
murder charge, first-degree
murder is very unusual,

37:04.956 --> 37:08.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extremely unusual, I understand,
in the case of Chicago with the

37:08.526 --> 37:12.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police force. What does that say
to you about the case that the

37:12.597 --> 37:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecutors think they have?
PAUL BUTLER: You know, Jeffrey,

37:14.866 --> 37:18.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Chicago police officer hasn't
been charged with murder in 50

37:18.870 --> 37:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years at least. So, again, the
prosecutor seems to think she's

37:22.874 --> 37:26.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
got compelling evidence. It's
hard to get jurors to convict

37:26.744 --> 37:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officers. Even when they think
that they made a mistake, jurors

37:29.914 --> 37:32.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are usually forgiving, because
they think they're just trying

37:32.350 --> 37:36.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do their job. So, normally,
what happens in any criminal

37:36.421 --> 37:40.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
prosecution is that the
defendant pleads guilty to a

37:40.125 --> 37:43.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lesser charge. So, maybe the
prosecutor is kind of throwing

37:43.194 --> 37:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the book at this defendant, in
order to get him to plead

37:46.631 --> 37:50.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guilty. Usually, in these cases,
when officers are charged -- and

37:50.034 --> 37:52.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's rare, even when they kill
in the line of duty -- but when

37:52.904 --> 37:56.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are charged, we usually see
manslaughter or negligent

37:56.040 --> 37:58.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
homicide. JEFFREY BROWN: So you
think they might be leaving some

37:58.810 --> 38:01.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
room here for a lesser charge,
possibly? PAUL BUTLER: I would

38:01.746 --> 38:04.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have to say, frankly, I wouldn't
want to take this case to trial.

38:04.716 --> 38:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's sensational apparently
about the video is the number of

38:08.453 --> 38:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shots, 16. But we believe that's
not all that probative. If an

38:13.057 --> 38:16.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer reasonably believes that
his life is in danger, he's

38:16.361 --> 38:19.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entitled to use deadly force,
that is, to do whatever it takes

38:19.864 --> 38:23.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to kill the assailant. I think
what's more probative is the

38:23.902 --> 38:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fact that none of the other six
officers on the scene fired at

38:28.039 --> 38:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all, and that officer Van Dyke
fired within 15, 30 seconds of

38:32.810 --> 38:35.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arriving at the scene. JEFFREY
BROWN: Now, come back to what

38:35.213 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you were talking about earlier,
the larger context in both

38:38.049 --> 38:41.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chicago, Minneapolis, other
cities, but especially Chicago

38:41.419 --> 38:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
here, the mistrust, historic
mistrust between the

38:44.255 --> 38:48.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-American community and
the police force and officials.

38:48.693 --> 38:51.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL BUTLER: You know, Jeffrey,
I am from Chicago. And I have to

38:51.429 --> 38:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, growing up, the police were
kind of notorious in my South

38:55.200 --> 38:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Side community for not treating
African-Americans fairly. The

38:59.103 --> 39:03.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city has paid over $500 million
just in the last 10 years to

39:03.942 --> 39:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
settle police brutality cases.
Now, hopefully, this is the

39:07.745 --> 39:11.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moment that, regardless of what
happens in the criminal

39:11.316 --> 39:14.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prosecution, the city will use
this as an opportunity to

39:14.719 --> 39:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assess. Clearly, the victim in
this case was having some kind

39:18.189 --> 39:21.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of mental health crisis. So the
police need to be better trained

39:21.826 --> 39:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how to address those situations.
This also clearly makes the case

39:25.630 --> 39:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for dashboards, for body cams
for police officers. We have to

39:29.200 --> 39:32.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wonder, if there wasn't this
video of this case, whether

39:32.804 --> 39:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there would be this sustained
attention to this issue in

39:35.573 --> 39:37.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Chicago. JEFFREY BROWN: You
heard probably in our setup

39:37.809 --> 39:40.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
piece just now my talk with
Reverend Jedidiah Brown, talking

39:40.979 --> 39:43.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about that -- those very issues,
what he hoped might come out of

39:43.815 --> 39:46.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it, even though no one quite
knows what happens next. In the

39:46.751 --> 39:50.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
press conference, we also heard
the mayor, Rahm Emanuel, calling

39:50.822 --> 39:54.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for a kind of moment, a testing
moment for all of Chicago. PAUL

39:54.826 --> 39:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BUTLER: Yes. So, you know, the
reason that these issues are

39:57.495 --> 40:00.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting a lot of attention is
because of this extraordinary

40:00.632 --> 40:04.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activism that's come under the
rubric of the Black Lives Matter

40:04.402 --> 40:08.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
social movement. So they're
savvy. They're strategic. And

40:08.039 --> 40:11.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they understand, I think, that
if there is a violent response

40:11.442 --> 40:14.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to this video, that that's not
going to be in the best interest

40:14.212 --> 40:17.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of this important social
movement. So we haven't really

40:17.482 --> 40:19.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
seen a lot of violence,
especially, again, when these

40:19.984 --> 40:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protests have been organized by
Black Lives Matters. So, again,

40:22.854 --> 40:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the citizens of Chicago
will respond responsibly,

40:25.990 --> 40:29.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially because, in this
case, the prosecutor is being

40:29.694 --> 40:32.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
proactive. JEFFREY BROWN: And
just very briefly, you do see a

40:32.664 --> 40:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- from a legal standpoint, you
see a progression in these cases

40:37.068 --> 40:40.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in how quickly they have been
brought and how -- the stronger

40:40.505 --> 40:43.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cases being brought? PAUL
BUTLER: Yes. Again, it's

40:43.875 --> 40:47.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
important not to underestimate
the impact of all this activism.

40:47.545 --> 40:51.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's changing the politics, so
that now police officers are in

40:51.115 --> 40:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some ways being treated like
other suspects when they're

40:54.352 --> 40:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being investigated for crimes.
If there is evidence that

40:56.654 --> 40:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're guilty, then now they're
being prosecuted, not all the

40:59.924 --> 41:02.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, not even most of the time,
but some of the time. And from

41:02.760 --> 41:06.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the perspective of activists,
that's progress. JEFFREY BROWN:

41:06.197 --> 41:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul Butler of the Georgetown
Law Center, thank you very much.

41:08.199 --> 41:13.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL BUTLER: It's great to be
here. JUDY WOODRUFF: In this

41:22.080 --> 41:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
week when we think about food,
we take a look now at the vital

41:26.017 --> 41:29.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
role bees play in getting some
of your favorite dishes to the

41:29.654 --> 41:33.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
table, and the way commercial
beekeepers in the U.S. are

41:33.791 --> 41:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
struggling to keep their bees
healthy. Allison Aubrey of

41:37.161 --> 41:40.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Public Radio has our
report. The story is part of the

41:40.698 --> 41:47.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"NewsHour"'s ongoing
collaboration with NPR. ALLISON

41:47.605 --> 41:52.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUBREY: It's harvest time at
Adee Honey Farms in Bruce, South

41:55.113 --> 41:59.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dakota. Bret Adee's the third
generation to manage the 80,000

41:59.851 --> 42:03.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hives the Adees have scattered
across five Midwestern states.

42:03.755 --> 42:07.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says beekeeping these days is
much harder than it's ever been.

42:07.992 --> 42:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRET ADEE, Adee Honey Farms: In
2010, our bees were just

42:12.296 --> 42:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
destroyed in a couple of weeks.
Most of our bees died. ALLISON

42:16.567 --> 42:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUBREY: Bret says things really
haven't improved much. BRET

42:20.805 --> 42:23.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADEE: I would to see about twice
to three times as many bees in

42:23.841 --> 42:26.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most of the hives right now. It
will be a real challenge to keep

42:26.711 --> 42:30.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them alive through the winter.
ALLISON AUBREY: The Adees are

42:30.448 --> 42:33.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not alone. According to a
preliminary survey from the U.S.

42:33.284 --> 42:36.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Department of Agriculture,
commercial beekeepers lost 42

42:37.021 --> 42:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent of their colonies last
year. Bees are a critical part

42:41.959 --> 42:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of agriculture. Adee trucks his
bees out to pollinate

42:45.830 --> 42:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
California's almond groves every
year. And it's not just almonds.

42:49.600 --> 42:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bees pollinate everything from
apples to cherries and squash.

42:53.271 --> 42:57.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To figure out what's plaguing
the bees, the Obama

42:57.241 --> 43:01.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration assembled a task
force last year. Scientists at

43:01.045 --> 43:05.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the EPA, USDA and researchers
across the country who have been

43:05.049 --> 43:09.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
studying the problem are finding
there are multiple issues. Bees

43:09.520 --> 43:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have fewer wildflowers to forage
on due to a loss of habitat.

43:14.091 --> 43:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's viruses that pests pass
on to the bees. Climate change

43:17.528 --> 43:21.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is thought to play a role too.
Another issue is pesticides.

43:21.766 --> 43:24.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some studies suggest that a
class of pesticides known as

43:24.669 --> 43:28.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neonicotinoid, or neonics for
short, are harming the bees.

43:28.973 --> 43:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These pesticides are coated onto
the seed of about 80 percent of

43:32.944 --> 43:35.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the corn that's grown in the
United States and about half the

43:35.646 --> 43:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soybeans too. To get a sense of
that scale, imagine a cornfield

43:39.817 --> 43:43.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like this taking up the entire
state of California. That's how

43:43.921 --> 43:47.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
much of this pre-treated seed is
being planted. CHRISTIAN KRUPKE,

43:47.692 --> 43:50.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Purdue University: This is what
corn seeds look like after they

43:50.728 --> 43:54.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been treated. ALLISON
AUBREY: The pesticide is put

43:54.565 --> 43:56.534 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
onto the corn before it's ever
planted? CHRISTIAN KRUPKE:

43:56.567 --> 43:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's right. ALLISON AUBREY:
Christian Krupke is an

43:58.569 --> 44:01.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
entomologist at Purdue
University who studies bees. His

44:01.072 --> 44:04.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
research shows that
neonicotinoids can harm bees.

44:04.675 --> 44:07.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is a neonicotinoid?
CHRISTIAN KRUPKE: A

44:07.678 --> 44:10.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neonicotinoid is -- as the name
would suggest, it's based on

44:10.915 --> 44:13.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nicotine. They're less toxic to
mammals, which is a big feature

44:13.751 --> 44:17.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in their wide adoption. But they
are more toxic to honey bees and

44:17.755 --> 44:21.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to other insects. ALLISON
AUBREY: Neonics are a relatively

44:21.626 --> 44:24.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new class of pesticide. They
have been around since the early

44:24.695 --> 44:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
1990s. They are easier for
farmers to use than the

44:28.299 --> 44:31.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
traditional method of spraying
crops. And according to

44:31.469 --> 44:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
researchers at Penn State
University, their use has

44:34.805 --> 44:39.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
increased more than 11-fold
since 2003. Companies that sell

44:39.677 --> 44:42.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them are making billions of
dollars. CHRISTIAN KRUPKE:

44:42.346 --> 44:46.951 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Virtually all of these large
acre plants are being treated.

44:46.984 --> 44:50.421 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the level of use is way out
of step with the level of the

44:50.454 --> 44:53.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
threat. In most fields, and
where we have worked, we just

44:53.624 --> 44:57.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
haven't been able to find levels
of pests that would justify the

44:57.762 --> 45:01.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
level of use. ALLISON AUBREY:
Krupke published a study that

45:01.165 --> 45:05.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
linked bee deaths with the
pesticide-laden dust that flies

45:05.202 --> 45:08.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up during the planting of the
pre-treated corn seeds.

45:08.306 --> 45:10.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTIAN KRUPKE: We collected
some of those bees and analyzed

45:11.008 --> 45:15.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them and found neonicotinoids on
them and in them, so there is an

45:15.246 --> 45:20.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intersection between planting
these crops and killing foraging

45:20.751 --> 45:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
honey bees. ALLISON AUBREY:
Bayer CropScience is one of the

45:23.187 --> 45:26.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leading manufacturers of
neonicotinoids. Bayer's chief

45:26.123 --> 45:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scientist, David Fischer,
acknowledges Krupke's findings,

45:29.360 --> 45:33.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but he says Bayer has a seed
lubricant that reduces the dust.

45:33.497 --> 45:37.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says that, outside these
acute exposures, neonicotinoids

45:37.201 --> 45:39.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are not harmful to bees. DAVID
FISCHER, Bayer CropScience: We

45:39.203 --> 45:41.572 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have done those studies. And
those studies basically show, if

45:41.606 --> 45:45.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you spray the product, it's not
safe for the bees. If you apply

45:45.776 --> 45:48.813 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the product to the soil or as a
seed treatment, the level of

45:48.846 --> 45:52.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
residues that gets up into the
plant is in a safe range.

45:52.116 --> 45:57.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALLISON AUBREY: Christian Krupke
is not convinced. CHRISTIAN

45:57.922 --> 46:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRUPKE: We find these pesticides
in the water. Bees drink water.

46:00.825 --> 46:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Plants use water. We find that
wildflowers that grow near these

46:05.396 --> 46:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
areas also have some of these
pesticides in them. You add that

46:09.200 --> 46:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up over the course of a season,
and, yes, we do find concerning

46:13.037 --> 46:17.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
levels. ALLISON AUBREY: Krupke
says those levels do not kill

46:17.241 --> 46:21.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bees, but may leave them
more vulnerable. Bayer's chief

46:21.412 --> 46:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scientist says the major threat
to bees is a mite that punctures

46:24.715 --> 46:27.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the honey bees body and feeds on
its blood. It's known as the

46:27.718 --> 46:31.122 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Varroa mite. And a recent report
issued by President Obama's task

46:31.155 --> 46:34.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
force also points to the mite as
one issue. DAVID FISCHER: Eighty

46:34.492 --> 46:39.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent of the problem is Varroa
mites and the viruses and the

46:39.163 --> 46:42.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diseases those viruses cause.
ALLISON AUBREY: But some

46:42.299 --> 46:45.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beekeepers suspect the increased
use of the newer pesticides is

46:45.803 --> 46:49.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
making their bees more
vulnerable to the mite. BRET

46:49.306 --> 46:53.344 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADEE: For 15 years, we managed
that Varroa mite and kept our

46:53.377 --> 46:58.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
losses under 5 to 8 percent. Now
we're losing 50 percent of the

46:58.849 --> 47:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bees every year. ALLISON AUBREY:
Pesticide manufacturers,

47:02.820 --> 47:07.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
including Bayer and Syngenta
have launched campaigns of their

47:08.025 --> 47:13.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own to boost bee health. Both
companies are planting millions

47:13.731 --> 47:19.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of flowers in the U.S. to
increase bee forage. And in

47:20.004 --> 47:25.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2014, Bayer CropScience opened
this $2 million bee care center

47:25.443 --> 47:29.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in North Carolina, where they
conduct workshops and tours.

47:29.080 --> 47:32.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Environmentalists say these
initiatives are a diversion from

47:32.516 --> 47:35.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the real problem, the pesticides
these companies manufacture,

47:35.853 --> 47:39.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
something Fischer rejects. DAVID
FISCHER: Bayer has actually been

47:39.623 --> 47:43.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the business of providing
products to beekeepers for more

47:43.461 --> 47:46.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than 20 years. It's not
something that we just started

47:46.297 --> 47:50.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
doing. ALLISON AUBREY:
Beekeepers in Europe came out in

47:50.101 --> 47:54.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
force a few years ago in support
of the European Union's partial

47:54.238 --> 47:58.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ban on the use of some of these
neonics. And here in the U.S.,

47:58.476 --> 48:01.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Environmental Protection
Agency says it will speed up a

48:01.445 --> 48:05.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
safety review and likely not
allow any new uses of the

48:05.249 --> 48:08.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pesticide. Environmental groups
are locked in several court

48:08.919 --> 48:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
battles challenging the EPA over
the registration of these

48:12.723 --> 48:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pesticides. Manufacturers
maintain that neonics are vital

48:17.194 --> 48:21.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for increasing crop production
and safer than spraying. DAVID

48:21.198 --> 48:24.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FISCHER: They're extremely
valuable. They increase crop

48:24.435 --> 48:31.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yields often by 20 percent vs.
the other competitors. So, they

48:31.142 --> 48:37.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contribute billions of dollars
to the ag economy in the United

48:37.047 --> 48:39.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
States. CHRISTIAN KRUPKE: That
would be true if these products,

48:39.517 --> 48:42.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these neonicotinoids, were
indispensable to these crops, to

48:42.887 --> 48:46.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agriculture, but they're not.
Some of our own work in corn and

48:46.957 --> 48:49.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the work of others in the United
States has shown that it's very

48:49.994 --> 48:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
difficult to consistently show a
yield benefit. ALLISON AUBREY:

48:56.801 --> 49:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lucas Criswell farms close to
2,000 acres of corn, soybeans,

49:01.305 --> 49:03.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wheat and rye in Pennsylvania's
Susquehanna Valley. He has

49:03.307 --> 49:05.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stopped using treated seed
because he found it wasn't only

49:05.376 --> 49:09.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
killing the bad pests, but the
pests he needed to ward off the

49:09.313 --> 49:11.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slugs that were eating his
soybean crops. LUCAS CRISWELL,

49:12.016 --> 49:16.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Farmer: The soil in our fields
are a huge ecology of different

49:16.754 --> 49:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
critters and insects. And
they're all there. We need good

49:20.591 --> 49:24.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and bad. It takes a balance of
them all, and that's what we

49:24.128 --> 49:27.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have seen. ALLISON AUBREY:
Criswell now keeps pests at bay

49:27.131 --> 49:30.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in his fields by planting crops
that encourage beneficial

49:30.301 --> 49:34.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insects. The treated seeds cost
more, so this method ends up

49:34.205 --> 49:37.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being cheaper for him. Is it too
soon enough to say whether

49:37.775 --> 49:40.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're getting the same yields?
LUCAS CRISWELL: Is there corn

49:40.177 --> 49:43.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
growing on that hill? It grew.
ALLISON AUBREY: It looks like a

49:43.814 --> 49:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of corn. Earlier this year,
President Obama's task force

49:46.650 --> 49:50.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called for a reevaluation of the
pesticides. And, consistent with

49:50.688 --> 49:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president's requirements,
the EPA has expedited its

49:54.091 --> 49:59.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
review. I'm Allison Aubrey of
NPR News for the "PBS NewsHour"

50:05.569 --> 50:10.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Bruce, South Dakota. JUDY
WOODRUFF: Tonight, on most of

50:15.012 --> 50:18.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these PBS stations, "American
Experience" presents "The

50:18.682 --> 50:21.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pilgrims," a documentary that
explores the religious

50:21.886 --> 50:25.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
motivations of America's
earliest settlers. In this

50:25.456 --> 50:28.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
excerpt, we learn about the
first Thanksgiving, a harvest

50:28.893 --> 50:33.163 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made possible by the generosity
of the native Tisquantum tribe

50:33.197 --> 50:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who joined the celebration.
LINDA COOMBS, Aquinnah Cultural

50:35.666 --> 50:38.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Center: They stayed for three
days. They went out and got five

50:38.636 --> 50:44.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deer to add to what the English
were cooking. They played games

50:44.441 --> 50:50.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together. There's like four
little facts of what happened,

50:50.114 --> 50:53.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then the rest of it is fluff
that's been added over the

50:53.250 --> 50:58.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
centuries. NARRATOR:
Two-and-a-half centuries later,

50:58.989 --> 51:03.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at another American moment of
great trial and suffering, the

51:03.694 --> 51:07.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
humble event, all but
disregarded by the Pilgrims

51:07.398 --> 51:10.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
themselves, would be recast as
one of the most important and

51:10.868 --> 51:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defining moments in American
history. We love the story of

51:18.842 --> 51:24.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thanksgiving, because it's about
alliance and abundance, and

51:24.915 --> 51:31.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
envisioning a future where
Native Americans and colonial

51:31.055 --> 51:36.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Americans can come together and
celebrate the providence of a

51:36.827 --> 51:39.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
single God. KATHLEEN DONEGAN,
University of California,

51:39.296 --> 51:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Berkeley: But part of the reason
that they were grateful was that

51:43.634 --> 51:47.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they had been in such misery,
that they had lost so many

51:47.771 --> 51:52.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people on both sides. So, in
some way, that day of

51:55.212 --> 52:00.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thanksgiving is also coming out
of mourning. It's also coming

52:00.851 --> 52:05.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of grief, and this abundance
that is a relief from that loss.

52:10.461 --> 52:12.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we don't think about the
loss. We think about the

52:13.030 --> 52:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
abundance. JUDY WOODRUFF: You
can learn more about the

52:16.266 --> 52:18.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

52:23.374 --> 52:27.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And tomorrow on the "NewsHour,"
we bring you a special

52:27.678 --> 52:31.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation Gwen recently had
with Aretha Franklin, the queen

52:31.849 --> 52:38.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of soul. GWEN IFILL: Will you
ever... (CROSSTALK) ARETHA

52:38.355 --> 52:43.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRANKLIN, Musician: No, I'm not
ever going to retire. That's --

52:46.764 --> 52:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that wouldn't be good, for one,
just to go somewhere and sit

52:49.466 --> 52:54.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down and do nothing. Please. No,
that's not moi. JUDY WOODRUFF:

The full interview tomorrow on
the "NewsHour." On the

52:58.675 --> 53:02.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"NewsHour" online: Millions of
Americans will travel by air

53:02.379 --> 53:05.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this week to spend Thanksgiving
with loved ones, but those

53:05.482 --> 53:09.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
flights come with a consequence:
air pollution. A new study

53:09.420 --> 53:13.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
published in the journal "Nature
Climate Change" outlines 14 ways

53:13.991 --> 53:18.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
passenger jets can cut carbon
emissions, at little cost. We

53:18.829 --> 53:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the list on our home page.
And imagine a ham on your

53:23.367 --> 53:26.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thanksgiving table in place of
the traditional turkey. It's a

53:26.904 --> 53:31.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
scenario that got economists
talking, as turkey prices rise

53:31.175 --> 53:36.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and pork prices fall. Read
what's behind the shift on our

new travel warning needs to be

53:48.158 --> 53:52.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
taken seriously. And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight. I'm Judy
