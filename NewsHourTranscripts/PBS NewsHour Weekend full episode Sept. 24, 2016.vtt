THOSE PEOPLE.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AND NOW WE HAVE VIDEO THAT IN

02:16.269 --> 02:18.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME CASES SHOWS US THE

02:18.338 --> 02:20.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OUR REVIEW FOUND WHILE MANY MORE

RELEASED.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, IT'S MORE LIKELY THAN

02:59.079 --> 03:00.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT THAT WHEN A FATAL SHOOTING

03:00.280 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS CAPTURED ON CAMERA, IT WILL

03:01.581 --> 03:03.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT BE RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC.

03:03.283 --> 03:04.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATHER, IT WILL BE SOMETHING THE

OPINION.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE DON'T STACK ALL THE PIECES OF

EVIDENCE OUT THERE AS WE GET IT.

03:14.594 --> 03:17.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SOMETIMES, THIS RELEASE OF

03:17.397 --> 03:18.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE VIDEOS COULD ACTUALLY

03:18.665 --> 03:20.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEOPARDIZE THE INVESTIGATION.

03:20.167 --> 03:21.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK WE VERY

03:21.034 --> 03:21.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFTEN HEAR THAT.

03:21.802 --> 03:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT WOULD BE REALLY

03:22.769 --> 03:23.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING TO INTERROGATE THAT

03:23.637 --> 03:24.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FURTHER, RIGHT?

03:24.504 --> 03:26.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THE MAN'S NAME IS A

03:26.273 --> 03:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IDEA THAT HE WAS ARMED IS A

03:28.675 --> 03:29.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PIECE OF EVIDENCE.

03:29.643 --> 03:30.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN SAYING THAT IS A PIECE OF

03:30.777 --> 03:32.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVIDENCE THAT THEORETICALLY

03:32.345 --> 03:34.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD HELP COLOR THE PERCEPTION

03:34.848 --> 03:36.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WITNESSES, RIGHT, BECAUSE NOW

03:36.049 --> 03:37.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE HEARD FROM THE POLICE HE

03:37.417 --> 03:37.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS ARMED.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO NOW MAYBE THEY REMEMBER A

03:39.553 --> 03:40.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEAPON IN HIS HAND.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE OTHER THING THAT'S

03:41.555 --> 03:42.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING HERE-- AND THIS

03:42.756 --> 03:43.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMES FROM OUR REPORTING AS

SHADOW OF THE WASHINGTON

MONUMENT.

22:15.868 --> 22:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY OF THE BUILDINGS ON THE

22:16.835 --> 22:19.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MALL ARE MARBLE, GRANITE,

22:19.705 --> 22:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCRETE, LIGHTER IN COLOR.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS BUILDING HAS A VARIATION IN

22:24.777 --> 22:25.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW IT APPEARS.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, ON CERTAIN DAYS, ON CERTAIN

22:27.413 --> 22:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIGHTING CONDITIONS, IT CAN BE

22:29.148 --> 22:31.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY VIBRANT AND BRIGHT.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OTHER TIMES OF THE DAY OR

22:33.052 --> 22:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE EVENING, IT IS DARKER.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WE WANT TO BRING NATURAL

22:36.121 --> 22:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIGHT INTO THE PUBLIC'S AREAS,

22:37.990 --> 22:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT, AT THE SAME TIME, WE WANT

22:38.791 --> 22:41.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SHADE THAT HEAT GAIN AND

22:41.894 --> 22:43.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLARE.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THE CORONA SERVES THE

22:44.663 --> 22:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNCTION OF VARIEGATING THE

22:46.465 --> 22:49.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIGHT, OF CREATING SHADE ON THE

22:49.001 --> 22:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MALL, AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

22:56.642 --> 22:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE WANT THIS BUILDING

22:58.210 --> 23:00.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ONLY TO BE HERE FOR A

23:00.079 --> 23:02.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUNDRED YEARS PLUS, BUT NOT BE A

23:02.948 --> 23:05.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BURDEN ON THE ENVIRONMENT.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS MUSEUM IS FOR EVERYONE.

23:06.919 --> 23:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WANT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR STORY, THE STORY OF AFRICAN-

23:11.123 --> 23:13.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS IN THIS COUNTRY, IS

23:13.092 --> 23:14.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE THAT THE DIRECTOR, LONNIE

23:14.893 --> 23:16.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUNCH, OFTEN SAYS IS THE

23:16.295 --> 23:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUINTESSENTIAL AMERICAN STORY,

23:18.063 --> 23:18.731 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT?

23:18.731 --> 23:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S SOME STRUGGLE, BUT

23:19.999 --> 23:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S ALSO TRIUMPH.

23:21.667 --> 23:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, WE TELL THE TRUTH.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE ARE SOME DIFFICULT

23:24.203 --> 23:25.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOMENTS THAT WE ALL KNOW ABOUT,

23:25.671 --> 23:27.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY CONTINUE EVEN FORWARD

23:27.539 --> 23:30.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO 2016 AND BEYOND.

23:30.142 --> 23:31.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE

23:31.343 --> 23:32.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE STORIES THERE, BUT THERE'S

23:32.444 --> 23:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
