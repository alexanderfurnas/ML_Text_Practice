GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.541 --> 00:12.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Deadly flooding
from the Mississippi River
forces evacuations

00:12.646 --> 00:14.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Missouri and Illinois.

00:14.948 --> 00:20.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: After decades' worth
of sexual
assault accusations, Bill Cosby
faces criminal

00:20.821 --> 00:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
charges for the first time.

00:22.823 --> 00:29.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did the U.S. spy on Israeli
government officials
as they lobbied Congress on the
Iran nuclear

00:29.296 --> 00:31.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal?

00:31.098 --> 00:35.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, Michael Pollan comes to
the defense
of food. The bestselling author
proposes an

00:35.669 --> 00:37.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
alternative way to eat.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN, Author, "In
Defense of Food":
We need to kind of take back
control of our

00:40.974 --> 00:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diet from industry, which is
really trying
to get us at every stage to eat
more and drink

00:46.480 --> 00:48.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than we even really want
to.

00:48.782 --> 00:56.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:56.857 --> 00:59.593 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:59.626 --> 01:09.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The water keeps
rising along the
Mississippi River and its
tributaries, and,

01:09.536 --> 01:12.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with it, the toll in death and
damage.

01:12.406 --> 01:17.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several small towns have been
overwhelmed
across parts of Missouri and
Illinois, and

01:17.044 --> 01:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least 20 people have been
killed in the
region. With the disaster still
building,

01:21.615 --> 01:27.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one local official said today,
"Nobody that
is living has ever seen anything
like this."

01:27.955 --> 01:33.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's already bad in places like
Valley Park,
Missouri, outside Saint Louis.
Dozens of homes

01:33.927 --> 01:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and businesses are underwater,
and the Meramec
River isn't due to crest until
tomorrow at

01:39.366 --> 01:46.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a record 43 feet. The
floodwaters have also
closed a stretch of Interstate
44, and hundreds

01:46.506 --> 01:50.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of other roads and highways in
the region
are now submerged.

01:50.677 --> 01:56.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Missouri Governor Jay
Nixon visited
the nearby town of Pacific,
where the flood

01:56.416 --> 01:58.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tide is also expected to set a
record.

01:58.385 --> 02:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. JAY NIXON (D), Missouri:
Wind fights
upstream means water moves
downstream, and

02:02.923 --> 02:07.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so we are putting a pretty
significant concentration
down in those areas. We fully
expect to see

02:07.861 --> 02:16.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a continual rise in those areas
over the next
six to eight hours and then all
the way into

02:16.370 --> 02:18.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

02:18.205 --> 02:21.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Farther south, in
High Ridge,
this water treatment plant has
been inundated,

02:21.141 --> 02:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and is spewing raw sewage into
nearby streams
and rivers. It could get even
worse if levees

02:28.015 --> 02:34.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give way. The Army Corps of
Engineers is watching
19 of the earthen barriers along
the swollen

02:34.187 --> 02:37.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mississippi River and its
tributaries.

02:37.491 --> 02:44.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, sandbagging
operations are in full
force in Saint Louis, as
volunteers race against

02:44.231 --> 02:49.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time. Forecasters predict the
Mississippi
River will crest there tomorrow
evening at

02:49.102 --> 02:50.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nearly record levels.

02:50.871 --> 02:56.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We want to be very cautious
and sandbag
the low areas in case it would
come over.

02:56.610 --> 03:04.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other areas, as you come up for
repair, are
in better shape with the pumping
stations

03:04.284 --> 03:06.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and everything else.

03:06.153 --> 03:09.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The rising
Mississippi has already
spilled over its banks near the
city's iconic

03:09.923 --> 03:11.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Gateway Arch.

03:11.391 --> 03:13.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOM KERR, Missouri: All our
friends and family
are losing everything.

03:13.760 --> 03:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Across the region in
places, like
Uniontown, south of Saint Louis,
people insist

03:18.899 --> 03:23.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they will piece their lives back
together
once the water recedes.

03:23.070 --> 03:29.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM KERR: It's a very close, if
you say, family
around here. So, once it gets
down, everybody

03:29.943 --> 03:34.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will come out, friends, family,
everything.
We will help everybody get it
cleaned up and

03:34.581 --> 03:37.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see if we can rebuild and get
their lives
going back again.

03:37.217 --> 03:41.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Flooding is also a
threat on the
other side of the Mississippi in
Illinois.

03:41.755 --> 03:48.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Crews in Alton worked through
the night to
shore up sandbag walls, hoping
to hold back

03:48.161 --> 03:54.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the deluge. This flooding now
rivals the great
flood disaster of 1993 along the
Mississippi.

03:54.901 --> 04:00.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, after
four years
of extreme drought, California
may be getting

04:00.607 --> 04:05.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least a little relief. State
officials
reported today that snowfall has
deepened

04:05.612 --> 04:11.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Sierra Nevada snowpack to
136 percent
of normal levels. That's three
times what

04:11.818 --> 04:17.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was this time a year ago.
Come spring,
the melting snow could provide
nearly a third

04:17.190 --> 04:19.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the state's water supply.

04:19.226 --> 04:25.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel
announced a major
overhaul of police training
today, amid a

04:25.065 --> 04:30.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
storm of criticism over a fatal
shooting.
He said the city will put Tasers
in every

04:30.036 --> 04:35.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
squad car and focus on getting
officers to
take a less confrontational
approach.

04:35.175 --> 04:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, he acknowledged at an
afternoon briefing,
it is going to take much more to
improve relations

04:40.814 --> 04:42.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between police and the public.

04:42.616 --> 04:47.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAHM EMANUEL (D), Mayor of
Chicago: We have
a long history in this city.
That trust has

04:47.187 --> 04:51.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been frayed to the point that
it's broken.
And part of what we're doing
here, and I believe

04:51.258 --> 04:56.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we will be better off at the end
of the process,
is build a police department
that has the

04:56.263 --> 05:01.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trust of the community, that is
essential
for the safety that those
residents rely on.

05:01.568 --> 05:06.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The mayor returned
early from
a vacation in Cuba, after police
killed two

05:06.072 --> 05:11.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
black residents over the
weekend, one of them
accidentally. That added to the
protests over

05:11.244 --> 05:16.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a white officer who's now
charged with murder
for killing a black teenager
last year.

05:16.783 --> 05:21.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word of another terror
plot foiled,
this time in Turkey. Police in
Ankara say

05:21.321 --> 05:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have arrested two Islamic
State suspects
accused of planning to attack
New Year's celebrations.

05:27.093 --> 05:32.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were taken during a raid
today, and police
also recovered explosive devices
and suicide

05:32.532 --> 05:38.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vests. The suspects allegedly
planned to target
crowded bars and shops on New
Year's Eve.

05:38.772 --> 05:42.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just yesterday, police in
Brussels, Belgium,
said they broke up a similar
plot. Today,

05:42.742 --> 05:48.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the city canceled its New Year's
Eve fireworks
and other festivities.

05:48.348 --> 05:53.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the tech front, consumer
demands for streaming
video have fueled a surge in
Internet connection

05:53.286 --> 05:58.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speeds in the United States. The
federal government
-- the Federal Communications
Commission reports

05:58.658 --> 06:04.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they nearly tripled between 2011
and 2014.
But the U.S. still lags behind a
number of

06:04.631 --> 06:10.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other countries. Among the
states, New Jersey
has the fastest average download
time. Idaho

06:10.804 --> 06:12.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is slowest.

06:12.672 --> 06:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Wall Street slowed down
today. The broader
market followed energy stocks
lower after

06:17.077 --> 06:23.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oil prices tumbled again. In the
end, the
Dow Jones industrial average
lost 117 points

06:23.350 --> 06:31.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to close back near 17600. The
Nasdaq fell
42 points, and the S&amp;P 500 was
down 15.

06:31.791 --> 06:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Bill Cosby
charged with sexual assault; has
the NSA been

06:37.464 --> 06:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spying on Israel?; how Congress
managed to
get more done in 2015; and much
more.

06:47.507 --> 06:57.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spying on Israel?; how Congress
managed to
get more done in 2015; and much
more.

06:57.117 --> 07:03.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After dozens of allegations that
stretch back
decades, comedian Bill Cosby was
charged today,

07:03.156 --> 07:05.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for the first time, with sexual
assault.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

07:07.927 --> 07:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The legendary
entertainer
exited a black SUV outside a
courthouse in

07:13.533 --> 07:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

07:16.036 --> 07:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cosby stands accused of drugging
and sexually
assaulting a woman named Andrea
Constand back

07:20.507 --> 07:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2004. Prosecutors back then
didn't seek
charges, citing a lack of
evidence. But, since

07:26.012 --> 07:31.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then, scores of other women have
accused Cosby
of similar assaults, all of
which he has steadfastly

07:31.418 --> 07:33.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
denied.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a press conference earlier
today, prosecutor
Kevin Steele said Ms. Constand
has rejected

07:37.157 --> 07:41.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
several earlier sexual advances
from Cosby
before the alleged attack.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN STEELE, Montgomery County,
Pennsylvania,
District Attorney: On the
evening in question,

07:43.863 --> 07:51.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Cosby urged her to take
pills that he
provided to her and to drink
wine, the effect

07:51.871 --> 07:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of which rendered her unable to
move or to
respond to his advances, and he
committed

07:59.446 --> 08:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aggravated indecent assault upon
her.

08:02.182 --> 08:06.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more on
the case and
the Cosby story, we are joined
by Maryclaire

08:06.553 --> 08:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dale of the Associated Press.
She's been covering
Cosby's legal battles in
Pennsylvania.

08:10.924 --> 08:15.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Maryclaire Dale, you were in
that tiny
courtroom in Pennsylvania today.
What was

08:15.595 --> 08:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it like? What did you see?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARYCLAIRE DALE, Associated
Press: Yes, I
was.

08:18.898 --> 08:23.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a very brief hearing. It
was an arraignment,
in which a district justice,
basically a magistrate,

08:23.603 --> 08:28.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told Cosby what the charges
were. He didn't
have the opportunity to enter a
plea. In Pennsylvania,

08:28.942 --> 08:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's typically done later.

08:30.844 --> 08:36.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cosby seemed fairly relaxed,
given the situation.
He was smiling occasionally with
his lawyer.

08:36.883 --> 08:41.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did seem a bit unsteady
walking. He had
some serious vision problems and
needed help

08:41.621 --> 08:44.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
signing the court papers, the
bail papers
and such.

08:44.991 --> 08:49.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had arranged -- he -- the
bail was set
at a million dollars and he has
posted that

08:49.162 --> 08:54.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he is free tonight. But it
was a brief
hearing, again, quite a lot of
media there,

08:54.567 --> 08:57.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of course, although the charges
were not announced
until this morning at 10:00 a.m.

08:57.971 --> 09:02.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, help us
understand how
we got here. There have been so
many allegations

09:02.442 --> 09:09.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against Mr. Cosby over the
years. This current
complainant, Ms. Constand, had
previously

09:09.382 --> 09:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made a complaint back in 2004
against Cosby,
but the then prosecutor said
there wasn't

09:14.721 --> 09:15.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enough evidence to bring a case.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So how did we get to today?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARYCLAIRE DALE: Right.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was one of the first, if not
the first
accuser to go to the police, and
it ended

09:23.263 --> 09:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up with a decision by the then
Montgomery
County prosecutor that he didn't
have enough

09:27.500 --> 09:29.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
evidence to move forward to
trial.

09:29.903 --> 09:38.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, she then filed a civil
lawsuit that
was settled a year later in
2006, and the

09:38.244 --> 09:42.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- Cosby had to give a
deposition in that
case. It was quite a lengthy
deposition given

09:42.682 --> 09:52.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over four days in 2005 and 2006,
and, of course,
it wasn't known to the public
what he said

09:52.358 --> 09:54.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the time.

09:54.294 --> 09:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But after that, after he gave
his deposition,
the case settled, and, this
year, the Associated

09:59.933 --> 10:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Press went to court and tried to
unseal some
of the sealed documents in the
case. And we

10:03.937 --> 10:09.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were successful in getting some
filings that
had parts of his deposition. And
they included

10:09.976 --> 10:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his acknowledgment that, in the
'70s, he had
obtained quaaludes with the hope
of giving

10:14.447 --> 10:17.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them to women that he had hoped
to seduce.

10:17.150 --> 10:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that, in addition to a
number of other
women who had started to come
forward, I think

10:22.956 --> 10:31.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that encouraged even more women
to come forward.
And with that deposition, the
prosecutors

10:31.197 --> 10:36.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Montgomery County today went
and took another
look at the case and decided
today, with the

10:36.536 --> 10:41.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announcement, that they did now
have enough
to build a case, a criminal case
against Cosby.

10:41.474 --> 10:46.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, it was
Cosby's own words
from 10 years ago that got him
in the trouble

10:47.013 --> 10:47.814 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today?

10:47.847 --> 10:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARYCLAIRE DALE: That was in
part.

10:50.149 --> 10:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were running up against a
12-year statute
of limitations on the filing of
felony sexual

10:55.989 --> 11:00.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assault cases. Certainly, they
do believe
that his acknowledgment that he
has in the

11:00.627 --> 11:05.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past obtained drugs to use with
women, they
said that was part of it.

11:05.999 --> 11:10.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another part is, they now
believe they can
prove that the woman was
impaired and could

11:10.169 --> 11:16.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not give consent. In the
deposition, Cosby
says that he acknowledges that
he had a sexual

11:16.209 --> 11:21.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation with this woman that
night in his
home near Philadelphia, but he
says it was

11:21.414 --> 11:23.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
consensual.

11:23.249 --> 11:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But prosecutors now believe
that, with this
evidence and his statement in
the deposition

11:27.453 --> 11:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he gave her three pills, he
says they
were Benadryl. The lawyer for
Ms. Constand

11:33.526 --> 11:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
believes they were probably
stronger. So,
prosecutors feel sure that they
can prove

11:38.998 --> 11:43.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in court that she was too
impaired that night
by both wine and whatever pills
he gave her

11:43.503 --> 11:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to give any type of consent.

11:45.371 --> 11:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, the
prosecutor is arguing
that she was basically
intoxicated at Mr.

11:50.910 --> 11:56.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cosby's hand, it seems, and that
she couldn't
say yes or no; she could not
consent to sexual

11:56.316 --> 11:56.916 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
activity?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARYCLAIRE DALE: Exactly.

11:58.818 --> 12:03.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, in the affidavit, the
20-page police
affidavit filed today in support
of the charges,

12:03.990 --> 12:09.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it says that she was -- quote,
unquote -- "frozen"
and semi-paralyzed, moving in
and out of consciousness,

12:09.696 --> 12:15.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and unable to shout or
articulate her, you
know, lack of consent, in fact.

12:15.034 --> 12:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is it clear
whether or not
that deposition from 10 years
ago can be used

12:20.540 --> 12:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this current case against
Cosby?

12:22.475 --> 12:25.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARYCLAIRE DALE: Well,
certainly, that's one
of the many defense motions that
we would

12:25.912 --> 12:31.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expect to come during -- before
the trial
plays out at the preliminary --
at the pretrial

12:31.851 --> 12:33.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stage.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sure they will try to have
that deposition,
which was, again, from a civil
lawsuit, you

12:36.723 --> 12:41.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, not -- ruled inadmissible.
Prosecutors,
of course, will try to use it.
They're building

12:41.060 --> 12:44.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their case somewhat upon his
very own words.

12:44.797 --> 12:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing that could be of
interest
is -- in the trial is whether or
not the subject

12:49.936 --> 12:56.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allows any or many of the other
accusers to
come forward and tell their
story as sort

12:56.242 --> 13:02.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of similar-act evidence,
evidence of Cosby's
M.O., for instance. There are
times when that

13:02.982 --> 13:09.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is permissible under
Pennsylvania law. It
can't be -- it has to be a
fairly substantial

13:09.222 --> 13:12.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship to the crime that
is charged.

13:12.258 --> 13:16.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it will be up to the judge
to determine
whether the facts of other
accusations or

13:16.629 --> 13:22.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other cases are close enough to
be used by
prosecutors to show an alleged
pattern of

13:22.468 --> 13:25.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behavior. Certainly, that's
something the
defense will try to throw out.

13:25.538 --> 13:28.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Maryclaire Dale
of the Associated Press, thank
you very much.

13:28.841 --> 13:40.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARYCLAIRE DALE: Thank you.

13:40.486 --> 13:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The rift between the
U.S. and
Israel over the Iran deal was no
secret, but

13:47.093 --> 13:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The rift between the
U.S. and
Israel over the Iran deal was no
secret, but

14:07.146 --> 14:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we now learn the dispute was fed
by high-stakes
political espionage carried out
by both countries

14:13.019 --> 14:15.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and ensnaring members of
Congress.

14:15.288 --> 14:18.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The details were laid out on the
front page
of today's Wall Street Journal.

14:18.925 --> 14:23.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reporter Adam Entous has been
piecing together
the story for months, and he
joins me now.

14:23.196 --> 14:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adam, what is more surprising to
you after
all the reporting that you have
done, that

14:27.433 --> 14:32.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was spying going on, or
that we are
-- or who we were spying on?

14:32.672 --> 14:37.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM ENTOUS, The Wall Street
Journal: I think,
for me, it was the unintended
consequence,

14:37.710 --> 14:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the president of the
United States decides
that he doesn't know what Bibi
Netanyahu,

14:42.982 --> 14:45.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his counterpart, intends on
doing.

14:45.585 --> 14:52.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he tells his spy agencies
to prioritize
going and collecting information
about what

14:52.191 --> 14:58.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his intentions are. And then
what happened,
when Bibi Netanyahu came to
Congress and launched

14:58.631 --> 15:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what was probably the largest
lobbying campaign
by a foreign government in our
Congress, and

15:05.304 --> 15:10.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the NSA, the National Security
Agency, is
listening very closely to what
the Israelis

15:10.143 --> 15:11.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are doing.

15:11.911 --> 15:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, suddenly, they're talking
every day to
members of Congress. And this is
a dilemma.

15:16.582 --> 15:21.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the proper use of that
information?
And the White House thought
about it. They

15:21.788 --> 15:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
knew that this was tantalizing.
They also
knew, if they asked for it, they
would get

15:26.426 --> 15:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in a lot of trouble, so they
decided not to
do -- to not to decide.

15:29.829 --> 15:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They decided to tell the NSA,
you decide.
You figure it out. We will take
what you send

15:34.000 --> 15:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us. And we're not going to ask
for more.

15:35.668 --> 15:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which is more
troubling in the
end, the fact that the president
had said

15:39.639 --> 15:43.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at some point, you know, we're
not going to
spy on our friends, with a
couple of exceptions

15:43.910 --> 15:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- they didn't say who the
exceptions were
-- or the fact that Israel was
so intricately

15:48.648 --> 15:50.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
involved in U.S. foreign
policy-making?

15:50.783 --> 15:52.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADAM ENTOUS: Right. Right.

15:52.685 --> 15:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the president said in 2014
that he would
stop spying on our closest
friends and allies,

15:57.824 --> 16:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the heads of state, he also had
a carve-out
which he did mention in his
speech, if that

16:02.695 --> 16:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information that could be
gleaned from those
leaders was of significant
national intelligence,

16:08.367 --> 16:13.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
national security purpose, or
was important
for national security, so he
gave himself

16:13.139 --> 16:14.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wiggle room.

16:14.941 --> 16:18.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he didn't define what that
process would
be, who would be those leaders
that would

16:19.011 --> 16:23.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be protected and who wouldn't be
protected.
And what we discovered when we
looked at this

16:23.482 --> 16:30.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
closely was, they created a
list. It's called
the protected list. And the
chancellor of

16:30.423 --> 16:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany, Merkel, was put on that
list. It
was sort of seen as a no-brainer
you would

16:34.493 --> 16:36.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
put her on that list.

16:36.295 --> 16:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was very vocal in her
criticism. Also,
Hollande of France was put on
the list. When

16:40.666 --> 16:47.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they went to other NATO --
another NATO leader,
Erdogan of Turkey, they
realized, wait a minute,

16:47.240 --> 16:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we don't really understand his
policy in Syria,
so they decided they wouldn't
put him on the

16:51.244 --> 16:53.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last, which basically meant that
the NSA could
target him.

16:53.980 --> 16:58.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Bibi Netanyahu, there was
no debate.
Of course they weren't going to,
as they say,

16:58.351 --> 17:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go dark on Bibi. They weren't
going to stop
collecting against him.

17:01.220 --> 17:06.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How involved was --
well, first
of all, is Israel also spying on
the U.S.,

17:06.158 --> 17:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how much of a problem was
it, as the U.S.
was collecting this information,
that they

17:10.563 --> 17:13.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
swept up U.S. lawmakers in some
of their eavesdropping?

17:13.165 --> 17:14.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM ENTOUS: Yes.

17:15.001 --> 17:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the Israeli government
has -- they
say publicly that they do not
commit espionage

17:19.305 --> 17:23.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the United States.
That's their policy.
That's what they say their
policy is. If you

17:23.776 --> 17:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talk to U.S. counterintelligence
officials,
they will tell you that Israel
is probably

17:29.148 --> 17:33.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the number one ally that spies
on the United
States.

17:33.686 --> 17:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have a he said/she said
here. You're
not really sure. With regard to
collection

17:40.126 --> 17:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that happened incidentally to
capture communications
or the contents of
communications about lawmakers,

17:47.667 --> 17:52.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it definitely was something
that, within the
White House, they knew they
faced a very awkward

17:52.838 --> 17:54.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situation.

17:54.607 --> 17:56.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wasn't that exactly
what some
lawmakers had been worried about
and had been

17:56.275 --> 17:57.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
criticizing the administration
on?

17:57.777 --> 17:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM ENTOUS: Yes, to a certain
degree.

17:59.612 --> 18:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the thing to keep in mind
here is that
there's things that we don't
know yet. There

18:04.083 --> 18:09.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are different types of
communications that
are collected by the NSA, where
the prime

18:09.555 --> 18:15.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minister of Israel speaks to a
senator on
the phone. Is the NSA listening
to that?

18:15.261 --> 18:21.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or if the ambassador to Israel
goes and meets
with 20 lawmakers during this
debate and writes

18:21.834 --> 18:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a report that he then sends back
to his Foreign
Ministry detailing the
conversations he had

18:26.973 --> 18:31.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Hill, what type of
communications were
they collecting, and which of
those were they

18:31.911 --> 18:36.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
passing onto the White House,
and what were
the rules?

18:36.182 --> 18:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know what they told -- we
know what administration
officials told us, which is
that, no matter

18:40.186 --> 18:45.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what, they minimized -- the term
is minimized.
That means they didn't identify
the name of

18:45.725 --> 18:50.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lawmaker, so it would just
appear in the
report that the NSA sent that it
was a...

18:50.796 --> 18:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: To stay on this side
of the law.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM ENTOUS: The rule is to not
identify.

18:56.002 --> 18:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the White House wants to
know, they can
ask. But if they ask and the NSA
agrees to

18:59.972 --> 19:02.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
provide it, then they have to
notify the Intelligence
Committees.

19:02.108 --> 19:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Briefly, was there
any blowback
today on this from either Israel
or, say,

19:06.245 --> 19:07.179 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Turkey?

19:07.213 --> 19:09.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM ENTOUS: I haven't seen much
from Turkey.

19:09.548 --> 19:13.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Israel, basically, they
said that they
were appalled that this would be
happening,

19:13.953 --> 19:19.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president would be
spying on his
close ally Netanyahu, and they
basically said

19:19.892 --> 19:23.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they would consider a
complaint, some
sort of complaint that they
would file to

19:23.829 --> 19:25.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
try to get the U.S. to stop the
surveillance.

19:25.698 --> 19:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's an interesting
peek behind
the curtain, Adam Entous. You
have been doing

19:29.869 --> 19:34.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it all year. Thank you very
much.

19:34.807 --> 19:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM ENTOUS: Oh, pleasure.
Pleasure. Thank
you.

19:41.180 --> 19:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

19:45.751 --> 19:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Should scientists
be allowed to edit human genes?;
tracing the

19:51.757 --> 19:57.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
path our ancestors walked two
million years
ago; and why we should get back
to the basics

19:57.930 --> 19:59.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when it comes to food.

19:59.765 --> 20:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, Congress ended the
year on an
unusually productive note,
despite partisanship

20:06.238 --> 20:08.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and divided government.

20:08.107 --> 20:11.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins explains
how that happened.

20:11.410 --> 20:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In what has
been the Capitol
of gridlock, 2015 brought signs
of legislative

20:17.583 --> 20:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
life and a measure of pride.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader:
As we end the year, I think, by
any objective

20:22.388 --> 20:28.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standard, it's been a year of
significant
accomplishment. And I want to
thank the Democrats

20:28.994 --> 20:30.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who did cooperate.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I also want to give Speaker Ryan
credit. I

20:33.032 --> 20:42.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called both him and Mitch
McConnell, as well
as Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid,
for the orderly

20:42.842 --> 20:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way in which they actually
negotiated a budget.

20:44.877 --> 20:48.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker
of the House:
I look forward to, in 2016, just
like we have

20:48.280 --> 20:52.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the last six weeks, getting
Congress working
back on the way it should be
working.

20:52.551 --> 20:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The bipartisan
lovefest came
after congressional leaders and
the White

20:56.889 --> 21:02.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House agreed to a rare full-year
bill to fund
the government. A
trillion-dollar compromise

21:02.228 --> 21:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passed with a majority of both
Democrats and
Republicans capped off a wild,
but productive

21:08.067 --> 21:09.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last month.

21:09.935 --> 21:15.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, some things on the
congressional
done list were political feats.
For the first

21:15.074 --> 21:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, Republicans passed a
repeal of Obamacare
through both houses, forcing a
presidential

21:19.945 --> 21:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
veto. But what stood out was the
long-term
legislation that made it into
law. Call it

21:25.718 --> 21:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the punt list: problems that
Congress had
kicked down the road year after
year, including

21:31.257 --> 21:36.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pay for Medicare doctors, who
had faced potential
pay cuts for more than a decade.

21:36.162 --> 21:42.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This time, Congress passed a
five-year fix
that bases pay on quality of
care. Also, tax

21:42.067 --> 21:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cuts, a series of technically
temporary, but,
in fact, every year of tax cuts
were made

21:47.773 --> 21:54.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
permanent. And a big one,
highway funding
-- after 34 short-term patches,
Congress passed

21:54.079 --> 22:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a five-year long-term plan. That
was a breakthrough
for every state in America.

22:00.486 --> 22:05.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pete Ruane is a lobbyist of the
American Road
and Transportation Builders
Association and

22:05.958 --> 22:08.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says lawmakers found a way to
agree.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE RUANE, American Road and
Transportation
Builders Association: Frankly,
there was a

22:09.862 --> 22:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fatigue factor on Capitol Hill.
They have
been dealing with this so long.
And I think

22:15.401 --> 22:21.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they were looking for
substantive, tangible
accomplishments, ones that did
have bipartisan

22:21.707 --> 22:23.509 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
support.

22:23.542 --> 22:27.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the transportation
legislation was ideal
for that. So, there was serious
interest in

22:27.213 --> 22:32.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually doing something this
year, and that
worked in its favor to getting
it done in

22:32.184 --> 22:33.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2015.

22:33.986 --> 22:38.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another factor?
Years of
building tension among house
Republicans finally

22:38.224 --> 22:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
burst, forcing out House Speaker
John Boehner.
But, on his way out, Boehner
pushed through

22:43.562 --> 22:48.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tough bills, like raising the
debt ceiling.

22:48.367 --> 22:53.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the end, Republicans
compromised with themselves,
boosting the military and other
priorities,

22:53.906 --> 22:59.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but at the cost of raising the
deficit. That
said, if you think all of this
means a productive

22:59.211 --> 23:01.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
2016, think again.

23:01.914 --> 23:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress typically doesn't pass
major legislation
in an election year.

23:06.518 --> 23:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

23:12.191 --> 23:24.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's been called the
scientific
breakthrough of the year, and a
development

23:24.036 --> 23:30.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that could revolutionize
medicine. It's all
about a way of editing genes,
known as CRISPR.

23:30.175 --> 23:35.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new method allows scientists
to snip out
a faulty section of DNA and
replace specific

23:35.981 --> 23:42.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
genes in living cells.
Researchers have long
edited genes in the lab, but
CRISPR is cheaper,

23:42.121 --> 23:47.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
far more precise, and could even
be used in
DNA found in eggs and sperm.

23:47.226 --> 23:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has lots of promise, but it
has raised
many concerns too.

23:50.863 --> 23:55.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore those questions with
Jennifer Doudna,
a professor at the University of
California,

23:55.734 --> 24:00.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Berkeley, who helped develop
this breakthrough,
and Paul Knoepfler, a biologist
and writer

24:00.339 --> 24:02.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from at University of
California, Davis.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

24:04.777 --> 24:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jennifer Doudna, I'm going to
start by just
asking you to define in
laywoman's language

24:09.815 --> 24:11.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gene editing and CRISPR.

24:11.583 --> 24:14.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER DOUDNA, University of
California,
Berkeley: Well, I would say gene
editing is

24:14.853 --> 24:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a method of making very precise
changes to
the DNA in a cell, and the
CRISPR methodology

24:21.593 --> 24:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allows scientists to do that
with just really
unprecedented precision.

24:26.398 --> 24:30.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, there is a
targeted, practical
use for this?

24:30.135 --> 24:33.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JENNIFER DOUDNA: Indeed,
actually many.

24:33.072 --> 24:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a technology that operates
in basically
all types of cells and allows
very precise

24:38.177 --> 24:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changes to be made to the
genetic code that
allows scientists to do things
like explore

24:43.315 --> 24:47.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the function of genes and also,
in principle,
correct mutations that cause
disease.

24:47.920 --> 24:53.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, give me an
example of how
this would be applied
practically. Blood diseases,

24:53.092 --> 24:55.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for instance? Eyes? What kind of
uses?

24:55.527 --> 25:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER DOUDNA: Well, I think,
in the future,
there are very exciting
applications to cure

25:00.766 --> 25:04.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diseases in the blood and
potentially in the
eye and potentially in other
kinds of tissues

25:04.937 --> 25:06.672 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

25:06.705 --> 25:09.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think a lot of people are
excited about
the blood, because it's a tissue
where, in

25:09.942 --> 25:15.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
principle, at least, we can
deliver this kind
of technology to cells outside
the body, and

25:15.347 --> 25:18.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then put those corrected cells
back into a
patient.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Paul Knoepfler, I
know this is
already in use in some labs
around the country.

25:21.887 --> 25:26.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you find it exciting or do
you see it a
little bit troubling?

25:26.091 --> 25:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL KNOEPFLER, University of
California,
Davis: It's actually very
exciting. I have

25:29.795 --> 25:35.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been working on gene editing in
the lab, in
test tubes and in rodents for 15
or 20 years.

25:35.534 --> 25:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And CRISPR really represents,
you know, a
transformative technology. I
would say it

25:40.973 --> 25:44.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- you know, if you put a number
on it, it's
probably, you know, 10 times
better than what

25:44.943 --> 25:46.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we used to do.

25:46.678 --> 25:51.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in a sense, this allows us
to do all
kinds of new research, but it's
almost too

25:51.683 --> 25:57.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
good, because I think it's also
kind of opening
the door to a new frontier of
gene editing

25:57.122 --> 25:58.957 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in human beings.

25:58.991 --> 26:02.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about
that new frontier
for a moment, Mr. Knoepfler,
because it seems

26:02.861 --> 26:07.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me that, when I think of gene
editing,
I think of being able to go in
and actually

26:07.232 --> 26:13.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change outcomes, change what a
baby looks
like, change who the baby is,
for instance,

26:13.305 --> 26:14.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the womb.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this something that CRISPR
would allow,
not right now, but at some
point?

26:17.543 --> 26:20.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL KNOEPFLER: You know, it is
possible in
the future.

26:20.345 --> 26:24.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, right now, the vast
majority of us
who are working on CRISPR, you
know, we really

26:24.483 --> 26:30.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have no interest in making
designer babies.
We want to advance science
through research.

26:30.289 --> 26:35.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, I think our top
priority, if
we do go into humans, it's going
to be preventing

26:35.761 --> 26:38.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
specific genetic diseases.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think where we run into
trouble is,
there is sort of a spectrum of
what could

26:41.467 --> 26:47.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be done with this, and there is
certainly
some proponents of actually
enhancing people

26:47.206 --> 26:52.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and going the designer baby
route. And that's
something that I find very
concerning.

26:52.311 --> 26:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I have been speaking out on
that. And I
actually just came out with a
new book called

26:56.548 --> 27:00.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"GMO Sapiens" where I address
some of the
concerns here.

27:00.385 --> 27:05.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Jennifer Doudna,
you're nodding
in agreement, but you're also
aware that the

27:05.457 --> 27:11.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Institutes of Health
have put a moratorium
on funding this kind of
research. Does that

27:11.096 --> 27:13.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean that there are widespread
concerns about
its uses?

27:13.732 --> 27:18.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER DOUDNA: Well, I think
there is widespread
awareness that this is powerful
technology

27:18.971 --> 27:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that needs to be employed in a
prudent fashion.

27:22.608 --> 27:26.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you may know, I have been
quite involved
in the ethical discussions
around this technology.

27:26.945 --> 27:31.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, in fact, earlier in
December of this
year, we had a meeting in
Washington, D.C.,

27:31.917 --> 27:37.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was sponsored by three
different national
academies in China, the U.K. and
the U.S.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to discuss this very issue.

27:39.558 --> 27:44.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is an area where
many scientists
and clinicians and obviously
other stakeholders

27:44.696 --> 27:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are getting involved in the
discussion.

27:46.598 --> 27:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And also another
stakeholder in
this are private companies. Even
if the government

27:52.304 --> 27:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
won't fund the research, what's
to stop a
private company from forging
ahead on this?

27:56.775 --> 27:59.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER DOUDNA: Exactly. I
mean, right now,
nothing.

27:59.545 --> 28:04.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is something where, I
think, again,
the scientific community needs
to step forward

28:04.216 --> 28:08.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and really point out what the
issues are with
the technology that can be
employed for the

28:08.854 --> 28:11.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of genome editing that
could affect human
evolution.

28:11.657 --> 28:16.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Paul Knoepfler,
could we be sacrificing
accuracy for speed?

28:16.228 --> 28:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL KNOEPFLER: I think so.

28:18.096 --> 28:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, you know, CRISPR is
much more accurate
than the kinds of technology we
used in the

28:22.601 --> 28:28.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past, but I think it's not
accurate enough
right now to actually use it
either in humans

28:28.974 --> 28:34.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or for the creation of a new
human being,
say, with a corrected genetic
mutation.

28:34.046 --> 28:38.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, so, one of the exciting
things about
CRISPR is that it's evolving so
fast that

28:38.984 --> 28:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think even by, say, the middle
of 2016,
it's going to be more accurate,
it's going

28:44.523 --> 28:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be more powerful than it is
today. So,
you know, perhaps one of the
challenges is

28:48.961 --> 28:53.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be, where do we stop
and say, you
know, it's good enough, it's
accurate enough,

28:53.665 --> 28:56.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where we could, say, use it for
gene therapy
or something like that?

28:56.735 --> 29:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When we're talking
about clinical
trials to use it for something
like that,

29:00.572 --> 29:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are we anticipating that could
happen relatively
soon, Jennifer Doudna?

29:05.410 --> 29:06.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:06.278 --> 29:08.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL KNOEPFLER: Oh, sorry. Go
ahead.

29:08.046 --> 29:10.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER DOUDNA: Well, my guess
would be,
within a couple of years, we
will see initial

29:10.449 --> 29:14.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clinical trials. That's what I'm
guessing,
based on the pace of the field
right now.

29:14.820 --> 29:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, Paul Knoepfler,
you agree
with that, obviously?

29:17.489 --> 29:19.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL KNOEPFLER: Yes, I think so.

29:19.424 --> 29:25.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, for gene therapy work,
it would be
appropriate to go ahead with it
in the next

29:25.330 --> 29:32.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
few years. Where I'm more
concerned is, there
is fertility clinics, some
philosophers and

29:32.170 --> 29:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
others who are saying, let's not
stop there,
let's go ahead and let's try to
make better

29:37.242 --> 29:39.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human beings.

29:39.177 --> 29:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we can kind of put
better in quotation
marks, but who decides what's
better? And,

29:45.050 --> 29:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, if they were trying to
make a child
who has dodged a bone disease,
you know, what

29:51.590 --> 29:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if that child is not just
healthy, their bones
are better than anyone else's in
the world,

29:56.695 --> 29:58.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know?

29:58.664 --> 30:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you know, would you
resist the temptation
perhaps to get stronger bones,
bigger muscles?

30:04.536 --> 30:09.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess I feel like it's a tough
thing to
draw the line between medical
application

30:09.875 --> 30:11.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and human enhancement.

30:11.710 --> 30:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, then, how do
you draw that
line? Say you want to be able to
find a cure

30:15.881 --> 30:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for sickle cell anemia and this
gets you a
lot closer to it faster.

30:20.318 --> 30:25.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jennifer Doudna, what happens
if, say, that
makes for a better person who
has to say to

30:25.190 --> 30:29.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their mate 10 years down the
road, 20 years
down the road, by the way, I am
genetically

30:29.194 --> 30:30.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
altered, before we have
children?

30:30.862 --> 30:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER DOUDNA: Well, yes, I
think that's
still a bit in the future.

30:35.000 --> 30:40.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think that the CRISPR
technology offers
a way to discover the function
of genes. And

30:40.706 --> 30:46.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the things that currently
limits the
field is just the lack of
knowledge about

30:46.645 --> 30:50.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the genetic basis for all sorts
of traits,
including disease, but other
things as well.

30:50.315 --> 30:54.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think this is where we
will see a
lot of active work in the
immediate future,

30:54.186 --> 30:55.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is really on the research front.

30:55.987 --> 30:58.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let me assume
for a moment
that we figure out where these
lines should

30:58.724 --> 31:02.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
be drawn and this is an
unalloyed good in
the long run.

31:02.260 --> 31:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to ask each of you,
finally, Paul Knoepfler,
starting with you, how big a
leap forward

31:08.400 --> 31:09.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is this?

31:09.434 --> 31:12.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL KNOEPFLER: I think it's
transformative.

31:12.370 --> 31:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's as big as nuclear
physics or
something like that. I think,
you know, one

31:18.210 --> 31:23.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the most exciting and also
frightening
aspects of it is that it's going
to enable

31:23.582 --> 31:29.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
us to literally change
ourselves, you know,
and kind of hack into the human
code.

31:29.421 --> 31:34.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, you know, that's
unprecedented
in history. And so, as we're
doing that, as

31:34.860 --> 31:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're changing ourselves, I
think, you know,
whether that's in five years, 10
years, I

31:40.165 --> 31:46.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do think someone's going to do
that. And so,
you know, that's very exciting
again, but

31:46.104 --> 31:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrifically scary, because, you
know, what
will we become? What will we
become in the

31:52.410 --> 31:54.112 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future?

31:54.146 --> 31:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, Jennifer
Doudna, how do
we balance that out? This
hacking into the

31:55.814 --> 32:00.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
human code sounds exciting to a
scientist,
but might sound scary to a
layperson.

32:00.352 --> 32:02.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JENNIFER DOUDNA: Right.

32:02.187 --> 32:07.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, again, my feeling all
along is has been
that I feel, as Paul just said,
very, very

32:07.192 --> 32:12.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
excited about the potential for
this technology
to affect human societies in the
future in

32:12.264 --> 32:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
positive ways. But I do think
that it's a
powerful technology. There's no
question.

32:16.968 --> 32:19.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it needs to be handled with
appropriate
caution.

32:19.404 --> 32:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Jennifer Doudna,
Paul Knoepfler,
thank you both very much.

32:23.475 --> 32:26.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL KNOEPFLER: Thank you.

32:26.578 --> 32:31.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JENNIFER DOUDNA: Thank you.

32:31.416 --> 32:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Since January 2013,
journalist
Paul Salopek has tracked ancient
man's path

32:41.593 --> 32:45.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of Africa, what he calls the
Out of Eden
Walk.

32:45.197 --> 32:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we take another look at
Hari Sreenivasan's
visit and walk with Paul, as
they trace the

32:50.602 --> 32:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
footsteps of early man on his
global trek.

32:54.072 --> 32:58.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
fog-shrouded fields
and rolling hills of Southern
Georgia are

32:58.510 --> 33:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much more than a waypoint for
Paul Salopek.
We were nearing the ancient city
and archaeological

33:04.282 --> 33:06.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
site of Dmanisi.

33:06.084 --> 33:08.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK, Fellow, National
Geographic:
So, Dmanisi is finally in sight
and this is

33:08.386 --> 33:13.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
probably one of the most
important human migration
sites outside of Africa proper.

33:13.959 --> 33:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Salopek is
following the
path humans took after the Ice
Age, 70,000

33:18.563 --> 33:23.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to 100,000 years ago. But here
in Dmanisi,
that path is much older.

33:24.002 --> 33:28.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Along these green and jagged
river gorges,
we have walked in one form or
another for

33:29.007 --> 33:34.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly two million years. The
history here
is stacked high, part of what
Salopek calls

33:34.746 --> 33:40.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the layer cake effect of the
Caucasus. With
a happy dog welcoming us, we
passed what was

33:40.318 --> 33:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely an outer defensive tower
of the 1,400-year-old
city of Dmanisi.

33:45.223 --> 33:47.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This has been a crossroads for a
long time.

33:47.359 --> 33:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: From day one. And
pretty much
everybody invaded it.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And was this a
trading route?

33:52.664 --> 33:56.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: This was a silk
road trading
route city, a big shining city
on the hill,

33:56.635 --> 34:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very rich, until the Mongols
came and plundered
it. And then they were here a
few hundred

34:02.407 --> 34:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years until the Georgians and
Armenians pushed
them out.

34:05.210 --> 34:10.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's an
archaeological gold
mine. With the summer digging
season finished,

34:10.415 --> 34:14.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we arrived at a sort of bunk
house for archaeologists
to rest for the night.

34:14.452 --> 34:18.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: If we did, by some
miracle,
get a clear sky, it really will
change everything

34:18.189 --> 34:19.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
completely.

34:20.025 --> 34:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The next
morning, a miracle
had indeed swept away the fog.
Within what

34:26.831 --> 34:31.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're seeing is nearly two
million years
of history, the medieval city,
whose walls

34:31.836 --> 34:37.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
still stand, built on top of a
Bronze Age
settlement that's 5,000 years
old, and still

34:37.776 --> 34:44.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
beneath that, the 1.8
million-year-old remains
of one of modern human's
earliest ancestors.

34:44.349 --> 34:49.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Salopek, Dima Bit-Suleiman, his
walking partner
in Georgia, and I were joined by
the director

34:49.921 --> 34:55.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Georgia's National Museum,
David Lordkipanidze,
for the walk up to the hilltop
dig site.

34:55.994 --> 34:58.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE, Director,
Georgia National
Museum: What we found here, it
changed our

34:58.530 --> 35:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understanding about early traces
of human
evolution, about first dispersal
of our ancestors.

35:07.739 --> 35:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, it's completely
changed our views
about who, when left Africa and
how they were

35:15.914 --> 35:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
looking and what they were doing
also.

35:18.283 --> 35:20.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What were
these guys doing?

35:20.151 --> 35:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: These guys
were enjoying
life here.

35:23.455 --> 35:25.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:25.256 --> 35:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Enjoying life
in a place
much more lush and temperate 1.8
million years

35:29.294 --> 35:34.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago. Thanks to bones discovered
here at the
same latitude as Boston, we know
this was

35:34.632 --> 35:40.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a land with game-like elephant,
giraffe, and
rhinoceros, but also large
predators like

35:40.438 --> 35:42.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
saber-toothed cats.

35:42.207 --> 35:45.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, when they
come here,
are they the predator or are
they the prey?

35:45.610 --> 35:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: I think
they were both.
On the bones of the humans, you
can sometimes

35:50.015 --> 35:56.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see cut marks, so it shows that
they were
prey. But, you see, it's lucky
for archaeology,

35:56.221 --> 35:56.554 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

35:56.588 --> 35:57.722 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

35:57.756 --> 36:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Bad day for
them, good day
for you.

36:00.058 --> 36:03.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: Yes. We are
very lucky.

36:03.061 --> 36:07.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And that lucky
day came
10 years ago, with the discovery
of a skull,

36:07.399 --> 36:14.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last of five found that is
the remarkably
complete skull of an ancient
ancestor of modern

36:14.272 --> 36:16.875 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
man.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.110 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So this is it?

36:19.144 --> 36:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David took us to the National
Museum in the
capital city of Tbilisi to see
the actual

36:23.848 --> 36:30.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skulls kept in a vault and
handled with kid
gloves, because they are indeed
national treasures.

36:30.555 --> 36:31.656 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is how old?

36:31.689 --> 36:34.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: This is 1.8
million years
old.

36:34.092 --> 36:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The brain
capacity was about
40 percent of ours, and they
stood about 5

36:39.431 --> 36:44.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
feet tall. The skull has
features of three
different species, a possible
snapshot in

36:44.836 --> 36:51.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time of evolution. An older
adult, probably
a male, was among those found.
And the toothless,

36:51.776 --> 36:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worn jawbone might tell us more
than just
size and age.

36:55.313 --> 37:00.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: It means it
was weak
individual who could survive
only with help

37:00.885 --> 37:08.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of others. And I think that
Dmanisi shows
also the first traces of
compassions and solidarity

37:08.526 --> 37:10.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Homo erectus.

37:10.395 --> 37:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Homo
erectus, even though
they had a brain that was a
third our size,

37:14.999 --> 37:17.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they still cared for somebody
other than themselves.

37:17.235 --> 37:22.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: One of the
human characters
could be taking on others.

37:22.173 --> 37:24.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Taking care of
others.

37:24.042 --> 37:26.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did these guys get to
Dmanisi? Why did
they leave?

37:26.377 --> 37:31.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: See, I
don't think there
was just one reason of it. They
were able

37:31.316 --> 37:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do it. They wanted to do it.
I think main
human character is the
curiosity.

37:36.821 --> 37:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So this is the
same instinct
that we have today, to look
around the next

37:41.292 --> 37:42.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
corner, over the next hill.

37:42.827 --> 37:44.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: Paul is
doing the same.

37:44.429 --> 37:46.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As these guys
did.

37:46.131 --> 37:50.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: As these
guys did. Paul
is follower of Homo erectus.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

37:51.870 --> 37:55.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, in a
sense, so are
we all. But for Salopek, their
ancient journey

37:55.206 --> 37:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to this point has particular
meaning.

37:57.442 --> 38:00.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: These are the
first pioneer
wanderers. These are kind of
like the dawn

38:00.879 --> 38:06.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who first left our
collective home
in Africa. So being here is a
terrific echo

38:06.684 --> 38:11.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of my own project. I'm following
people who
came much later, but these were
the trailblazers.

38:11.523 --> 38:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Only 10
percent of this
sprawling site has been
excavated. That layered

38:17.028 --> 38:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
effect was evident everywhere.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, where are you taking me?

38:20.765 --> 38:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a deep pit, David showed us
where an ancient
wine maker had sunk his vat.

38:25.503 --> 38:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: You can see
1.8 million
years old.

38:28.273 --> 38:30.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The bone is
1.8 million
years old.

38:30.642 --> 38:36.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in the process, that person
had tossed
aside some of the much older
bones.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This wine jar is how old?

38:37.081 --> 38:39.050 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: It's a
1,000 years old.

38:39.083 --> 38:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
finding a 1,000-year
wine jar would be kind of a big
deal for anybody

38:43.421 --> 38:44.389 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
else.

38:44.422 --> 38:44.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID LORDKIPANIDZE: Not for a
paleontologist.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:46.824 --> 38:50.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But there are
few better
places for a writer gauging the
crosscurrents

38:50.662 --> 38:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of history. So, with sunset not
far off, Paul
and I walked to the top of the
citadel that

38:56.134 --> 39:01.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has stood here for 1,000 years,
a relative
blink of an eye geologically
speaking, the

39:01.606 --> 39:07.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
majesty of this place clear,
spread out before
us, and perhaps a key to its
fraught and important

39:07.712 --> 39:08.746 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
past.

39:08.780 --> 39:11.182 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, why is this place such a
crossroads?

39:11.216 --> 39:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: Well, it's an
antique bridge
between Asia and Europe and has
been for millennia.

39:16.754 --> 39:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there has been migration
routes through
here going back before memory.

39:23.328 --> 39:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The silk road passes through
here. But it
also is the epicenter where
three major empires

39:29.133 --> 39:35.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meet. And they have always
contested this
area. From the south, the
Persians, from the

39:35.740 --> 39:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
West, the Ottoman Empire, which
is today Turkey,
and from the north, more
recently, Russia.

39:41.179 --> 39:45.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have overlapped and
contested and fought
over this corner of the world
for centuries.

39:45.883 --> 39:48.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, if they
have lived here,
they have also died here.

39:48.286 --> 39:51.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SALOPEK: A lot of people
have died here
over the years. I think we're
standing on

39:51.389 --> 39:53.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the oldest boneyards in
the world.

39:53.258 --> 39:57.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Atop the
boneyard in Dmanisi,
Georgia, I'm Hari Sreenivasan

39:57.895 --> 39:59.631 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

39:59.664 --> 40:00.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Paul Salopek has
continued walking
since Hari caught up with him in
Georgia.

40:00.498 --> 40:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's now crossed into
Azerbaijan.

40:02.267 --> 40:03.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Salopek's work is supported in

Now: a call to arms for making
real, instead
of processed food a bigger part
of Americans'

40:36.000 --> 40:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diets, a push for more sensible
nutritional
policies, and the influence of
marketing.

40:41.406 --> 40:45.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the focus of Michael
Pollan bestselling
book "In Defense of Food."

40:45.610 --> 40:50.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new film with the same title
prepares to
-- premieres tonight on PBS.
Here's a preview.

40:50.281 --> 40:54.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN, Author, "In
Defense of Food":
I have been writing about the
food system

40:54.752 --> 41:00.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a very long time, but what I
kept hearing
from readers was, yes, yes, yes,
you have

41:00.158 --> 41:03.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told me where the food comes
from and how
the animals live and everything,
but what

41:03.361 --> 41:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I really want to know is, what
should I eat?

41:07.332 --> 41:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We make over 200 decisions about
food a day,
and the majority of these
decisions are basically

41:13.738 --> 41:15.940 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unconscious to us.

41:15.973 --> 41:20.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The food industry has gotten
incredibly food
at manipulating the properties
of food, so

41:20.178 --> 41:26.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has just the right texture,
just the right
color, just the right smell.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have been paying a heavy
price.

41:28.786 --> 41:35.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four of the top 10 things that
will kill you
are chronic diseases linked to
diet.

41:35.193 --> 41:41.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We're dealing with a crisis
that's at
an emergency level. Their lives
are at stake.

41:41.466 --> 41:43.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think all of our lives are at
stake.

41:43.968 --> 41:48.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We are looking for answers.
We are looking
for dietary salvation.

41:48.439 --> 41:57.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: So I studied the
science from
Tanzania to Peru, from Paris to
the Bronx.

41:57.749 --> 42:00.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Let's walk our way through
this.

42:00.118 --> 42:02.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: And what I
discovered will
surprise you.

42:02.987 --> 42:06.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: You don't have to be a
scientist to
know how to eat.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: It was just like
a light had
gone off.

42:09.527 --> 42:14.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very rare in our lives when
the answer
to a complicated question is so
simple. But

42:14.198 --> 42:16.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when it comes to eating, it is.

42:16.534 --> 42:20.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Michael Pollan
joined Jeffrey
Brown recently for a
conversation about the

42:20.104 --> 42:21.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
book and the documentary.

42:21.773 --> 42:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Michael, welcome
to you.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: Thank you,
Jeffrey.

42:25.843 --> 42:27.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let's start with
the title
of the film, "In Defense of
Food."

42:27.912 --> 42:32.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're arguing that food needs
defending,
in part because we just don't --
we're confused

42:32.884 --> 42:34.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about we mean by the term.

42:34.218 --> 42:35.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL POLLAN: Yes.

42:35.987 --> 42:40.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The word is up for grabs,
because food has
changed more in the last 75
years than it

42:40.425 --> 42:45.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has in the previous 10,000. We
have learned
how to process foods in whole
new ways. And

42:45.696 --> 42:50.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I would argue that we're
creating things that
don't deserve to be called by
that beautiful

42:50.768 --> 42:53.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
word. And so I call them edible
food-like
substances.

42:53.738 --> 42:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You talk about
how we're all
caught up in the grips of
something you call

42:58.643 --> 43:01.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nutritionism. Now, define that
and explain
the problem.

43:01.479 --> 43:03.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL POLLAN: Sure.

43:03.347 --> 43:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, nutritionism, it's not a
science, although
it's supposedly based on
nutrition science.

43:07.785 --> 43:12.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an ideology. It's a way of
thinking about
food that I think is at the root
of our national

43:12.590 --> 43:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
eating disorder. It's why we're
so anxious
and confused about food.

43:16.994 --> 43:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nutritionism basically argues
that foods,
the important things about foods
are the nutrients

43:21.866 --> 43:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they contain. It's not the whole
food itself.
We don't look at a piece of
meat. We should

43:25.837 --> 43:31.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be thinking about saturated fat
and heme iron
and things like that.

43:31.175 --> 43:36.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It also, by extension, argues,
if the nutrient
is what is important in food,
and nutrients

43:36.681 --> 43:41.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are invisible to most people, we
need experts
to tell us how to eat. And I
think that's

43:41.085 --> 43:42.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a very dangerous idea.

43:42.753 --> 43:46.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And therefore
being led by
the advertising in some cases,
right?

43:46.290 --> 43:48.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: Well, exactly.

43:48.059 --> 43:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The expert message we hear the
most is the
message of industry, which
spends more than

43:52.897 --> 43:59.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$30 billion a year to market
food to us. By
comparison, the government's
voice, the doctor's

43:59.136 --> 44:05.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voice, the voice of sanity gets
drowned out.
And so we walk into a
treacherous landscape

44:05.910 --> 44:10.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the supermarket, where we're
bombarded
with health claims that are very
often deceptive.

44:10.882 --> 44:16.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, these are
added nutrients.
This is fat, low fat, nonfat.
And give me

44:16.454 --> 44:17.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
-- give us a good example.

44:17.889 --> 44:20.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: Well, I mean,
the cereal aisle
is a wonderful example.

44:20.758 --> 44:24.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You walk down there and you find
cereals that
are going to prevent heart
attacks and extend

44:24.629 --> 44:30.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your life span, I mean, just
outrageous claims
that are made. And the
government has been

44:30.067 --> 44:34.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to tone them down, but
every time they
have a new rule, industry comes
up with another

44:34.171 --> 44:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way to make the same claims.

44:36.741 --> 44:41.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, keep in mind that, when
you're looking
at the really healthy food and
you're over

44:41.112 --> 44:47.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in produce, notice how quiet it
is. The broccoli
is not screaming about its whole
grain goodness

44:47.852 --> 44:49.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or the fact that it has no fat.

44:49.754 --> 44:54.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's an important rule of
thumb, that
the healthiest foods in the
supermarket are

44:54.158 --> 44:55.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the quietest.

44:55.459 --> 44:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The quieter the
food, the better
for you, huh?

44:57.028 --> 44:59.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: The silence of
the yams, we
should listen to.

44:59.997 --> 45:01.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:01.766 --> 45:05.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, the
film looks at
different ways of changing
behavior. And if

45:05.403 --> 45:09.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a core message that came
through to
me, is that there really are a
lot of things

45:09.707 --> 45:14.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that one can do individually and
community-wise.
You look at a lot of examples.

45:14.745 --> 45:18.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: Well, this is a
very solvable
problem.

45:18.716 --> 45:23.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's true that the food
landscape has gotten
treacherous. On the other hand,
we still know

45:23.854 --> 45:28.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what to do. And a lot of the
science in the
film ends up being really a
confirmation of

45:28.726 --> 45:34.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
common sense, that if you eat
lots of plants,
you're better off than eating
lots of meat.

45:34.065 --> 45:38.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not to say meat is evil or
it's bad for
you. It's not. It's very
nutritious food,

45:38.502 --> 45:42.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we eat way too much of it,
both for our
health and for the health of the
environment.

45:42.306 --> 45:46.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of interesting
things about
how the environment shapes our
eating. So,

45:46.510 --> 45:51.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, the size of the
plates you use
at home, merely by reducing the
diameter of

45:51.816 --> 45:56.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the plates by an inch or two,
you can reduce
your food consumption by 20
percent or 30

45:56.454 --> 45:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
percent without even thinking
about it.

45:58.589 --> 46:04.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're being -- getting all
these messages
about that's -- that 16 ounces
is the proper

46:04.161 --> 46:11.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
size for a soda, or that, you
know, a burrito
should be two pounds. And we
tend to do what

46:11.168 --> 46:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're told. We have a thing
called a unit
bias. If that's how much you
pour in the glass,

46:15.906 --> 46:17.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's a proper portion.

46:17.708 --> 46:22.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's crazy. So, we need to
kind of take
back control of our diet from
industry, which

46:22.713 --> 46:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really trying to get us at
every stage
to eat more and drink more than
we really

46:27.585 --> 46:29.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
even want to.

46:29.387 --> 46:32.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what about at
the policy
level? Because we are at another
moment, right,

46:32.423 --> 46:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the government -- new
dietary guidelines
are in the works, coming out
pretty soon.

46:37.428 --> 46:39.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL POLLAN: Yes.

46:39.230 --> 46:43.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every five years, the government
endeavors
to tell us what to eat. We don't
really listen,

46:43.467 --> 46:47.204 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but it's an interesting
conversation. And
they will be coming out in a few
weeks, a

46:47.238 --> 46:52.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new set of dietary guidelines.
And, you know,
hopefully, they will be more
progressive than

46:52.043 --> 46:53.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the past.

46:53.844 --> 46:57.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the past, they have
really fallen
into that nutritionism frame of
saying, you

46:57.214 --> 47:01.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, eat more of this nutrient,
eat less
of that nutrient, this is evil,
this is good.

47:01.619 --> 47:05.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Need to remember that those
guidelines have
been wrong in the past. They
were telling

47:05.723 --> 47:10.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us for many years to eat less
fat, that fat
was what was going to make us
fat and give

47:10.961 --> 47:15.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us heart disease. Well, in fact,
that consensus
-- this is something we cover in
detail in

47:15.266 --> 47:20.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the film -- the consensus around
the low-fat
campaign has completely
collapsed, even though

47:20.905 --> 47:23.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your cardiologist probably
hasn't told you.

47:23.908 --> 47:29.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The links between fat and heart
disease or
the links between fat and
obesity are actually

47:29.146 --> 47:30.915 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very slender.

47:30.948 --> 47:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And I have to ask
you, Michael,
finally, to the extent that this
is sort of

47:34.085 --> 47:40.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a personal quest for you in the
film and in
your books, where do you break
the rules?

47:40.291 --> 47:44.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's your worst eating habit?
What's the
Michael Pollan bad eating?

47:44.729 --> 47:51.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: Well, like
everybody, I struggle
with quantity, when to stop. I
love to eat.

47:51.302 --> 47:55.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I love food. I have my junk food
favorites.
I have kind of a weakness for
Cracker Jacks.

47:56.006 --> 47:57.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will admit that.

47:57.842 --> 48:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my point in the film is, we
shouldn't
stress so much about that, and
the issue is

48:03.447 --> 48:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not the special occasion food.
It's the everyday
default practice. It's not
having a soda.

48:09.787 --> 48:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's having a soda every day.

48:11.822 --> 48:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, if you get the basic
default down,
you can indulge. I mean, one of
my food rules

48:16.994 --> 48:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is from -- borrowed from Oscar
Wilde, all
things in moderation, including
moderation.

48:22.933 --> 48:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, "In
Defense of Food."

48:25.836 --> 48:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Michael Pollan, thanks so much.

48:27.171 --> 48:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL POLLAN: Thank you,
Jeffrey.

48:31.642 --> 48:42.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Kind of staying with
that theme,
finally tonight, the holidays
seemed a good

48:42.253 --> 48:48.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time for an encore look at
author Ylonda Gault's
take on another particularly
challenging family

48:48.425 --> 48:51.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
issue: the personality of the
bragging parent.

48:51.328 --> 48:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YLONDA GAULT, Author: It will
start innocently,
a chance run-in.

48:56.000 --> 49:02.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will see a fellow mom at the
grocery store
or the park, maybe a coffee
shop. I will say,

49:02.439 --> 49:05.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hey, girl. We will hug. At least
I will, because
I'm a hugger.

49:05.810 --> 49:11.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will compliment her outfit.
She may notice
my new highlights. We will trade
innocent

49:11.115 --> 49:18.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gossip. I will ask about her
work, then the
family, to which she will
respond with a sigh,

49:18.722 --> 49:24.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as though fatigued, because, for
moms, every
season touts tired as the new
black.

49:24.461 --> 49:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thus begins the humble brag,
feigning exasperation.
Said mom will half-giggle and
wax self-mocking.

49:32.903 --> 49:40.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Sophie scored 2,200 on her
®MDNM/SATs,
despite this slacker mom, who
forgot to get

49:40.544 --> 49:45.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new calculator batteries. And
Zach's fourth
grade teacher recommended him
for advanced

49:45.950 --> 49:47.751 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
calculus.

49:47.785 --> 49:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, his dad and I don't
still get new
math, old math, or even everyday
math. These

49:53.557 --> 49:56.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kids, I tell you.

49:56.760 --> 50:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A wan smile will wash over my
face. It's the
expression I usually reserve for
my 8-year-old

50:02.733 --> 50:08.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when he's regaling with my
intricate details
of obscure superheroes and their
powers.

50:08.772 --> 50:15.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When she laughs and throws her
head back,
I do the same thing on the
outside. Inside,

50:15.045 --> 50:21.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wince, and whisper to myself,
bless her
heart, as momma would say.

50:21.552 --> 50:27.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For black people, those sweet
little words
are a nice way of saying, how
pitiful.

50:27.191 --> 50:33.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a gracious phrase, and I
mean it in the
best possible way, because a
part of me truly

50:33.063 --> 50:39.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aches to see a grown woman,
smart and accomplished
in her own right, boasting about
her children

50:39.737 --> 50:42.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as though they were prized
heifers at the
county fair.

50:42.740 --> 50:49.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's odd to me, because,
growing up, momma
always played down what my
siblings and I

50:49.213 --> 50:56.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did. It may be a black thing,
but I think
it's also an old-school thing.
No one wanted

50:56.921 --> 51:00.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their kids to get too
big-headed, I suppose.

51:00.724 --> 51:06.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Importantly, parenting wasn't an
extreme sport
back in the day. And, remember,
there was

51:06.263 --> 51:12.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no Facebook. Social media posts
are the lifeblood
of the humble braggart.

51:12.603 --> 51:18.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I get it. They feel less secure
in their own
worth, so tethered are the
kiddos to their

51:18.275 --> 51:23.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own self-image, the offsprings'
accomplishments
become their own.

51:23.047 --> 51:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Intellectually, I know most
studies will show
that mothers and fathers
hell-bent on this

51:29.753 --> 51:35.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
image of perfection desperately
need the world
to take note of their kids'
awesomeness. It's

51:35.859 --> 51:44.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way of saying, see, my kids
are great. Therefore,
I am great. Look at me. See? I'm
a great parent.

51:44.635 --> 51:46.403 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Really, I am.

51:46.437 --> 51:54.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do they believe it? Sadly, I
don't think so.
It's not that these parents
don't have good

51:54.044 --> 52:00.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids. I mean, all kids are good,
right, just
like all babies are -- ahem --
cute.

52:00.884 --> 52:08.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
See, all moms lie. As the humble
braggart
prattles on, I pretend to
listen. And when

52:08.258 --> 52:18.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's done, I put on my best
girlfriend face
and try to sound super
astonished. I say,

52:18.669 --> 52:24.408 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wow. Go, you.

52:24.441 --> 52:33.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight -- online,
