JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.472 --> 00:06.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.208 --> 00:09.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
The issue, plain and simple,
came down to

00:09.910 --> 00:10.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a matter of trust.

00:10.911 --> 00:13.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turnover at the
White House.

00:13.580 --> 00:18.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have the latest on the
resignation of President
Trump's national security
adviser.

00:18.886 --> 00:24.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: Ahead of Israeli Prime
Minister Netanyahu's
visit to the White House, a look
at possible

00:24.691 --> 00:28.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
changes in Middle East policy
under the Trump
administration.

00:28.695 --> 00:35.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, a story of hope -- how one
Kansas school
is helping homeless students
overcome the

00:35.636 --> 00:38.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
challenges they face outside the
classroom.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALIK CUSHON, Student: I got to
think about
what I'm eating for the night.

00:40.507 --> 00:43.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got to think about how bills
are going to
get paid.

00:43.176 --> 00:45.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I got to think about all this
extra stuff.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:49.449 --> 00:52.185 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.219 --> 01:02.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He served just 24
days, the
shortest tenure ever for a
president's national

01:02.329 --> 01:07.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He served just 24
days, the
shortest tenure ever for a
president's national

01:07.734 --> 01:09.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security adviser.

01:09.503 --> 01:14.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Michael Flynn has been
forced out, but
the firestorm over his
resignation has just

01:14.708 --> 01:15.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
begun.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang reports on this day of
turmoil.

01:18.111 --> 01:22.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump knew
since late
last month that his Michael
Flynn had misled

01:22.983 --> 01:26.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the White House about his
telephone conversation
with the Russian ambassador.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
We have been reviewing and
evaluating this

01:28.922 --> 01:33.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue, with respect to General
Flynn, on a
daily basis for a few weeks,
trying to ascertain

01:33.927 --> 01:35.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the truth.

01:35.729 --> 01:38.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Press Secretary Sean
Spicer said
the warning came from acting
Attorney General

01:38.832 --> 01:41.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sally Yates, based on an NSA
phone intercept.

01:41.835 --> 01:45.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: The White House
counsel informed
the president immediately.

01:45.205 --> 01:49.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president asked them to
conduct a review
of whether there was a legal
situation there.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was immediately determined
that there
wasn't.

01:51.211 --> 01:55.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was what the president
believed at the
time, what he had been told, and
he was proved

01:55.082 --> 01:56.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be correct.

01:56.850 --> 02:00.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The issue, pure and simple, came
down to a
matter of trust, and the
president concluded

02:00.954 --> 02:03.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he no longer had the trust
of his national
security adviser.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Flynn had denied
publicly, and
to vice president-elect Pence
directly, that

02:07.928 --> 02:12.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had discussed U.S. sanctions
with the Russian
ambassador to the United States
during the

02:12.733 --> 02:13.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transition.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It came out last week that he
had.

02:16.069 --> 02:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Spicer argued Flynn
didn't break the
law against private citizens
conducting diplomacy.

02:21.675 --> 02:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: There is nothing
that the general
did that was a violation of any
sort.

02:26.713 --> 02:32.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was well within his duties to
discuss issues
of common concern between the
two countries.

02:32.619 --> 02:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will say it again: What this
came down to
is a matter of trust.

02:35.956 --> 02:41.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: By last night, Spicer
said, the
president asked for Flynn's
resignation.

02:41.361 --> 02:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Mr. Trump ignored shouted
questions
about Flynn.

02:47.401 --> 02:53.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, he tweeted: "The real
story here
is, why are there so many
illegal leaks coming

02:53.407 --> 02:55.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
out of Washington?"

02:55.142 --> 02:58.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: It's not just
something that
is plaguing the current
situation, but it

02:58.578 --> 03:02.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
goes back to the Obama
administration, the
Bush administration, the Clinton
administration.

03:02.516 --> 03:07.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
When we have government
employees that are
entrusted with this and then
leak it out,

03:07.888 --> 03:09.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that undermines our national
security, frankly.

03:09.623 --> 03:13.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At the Capitol, House
Speaker Paul
Ryan agreed that Flynn had to
go.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:15.729 --> 03:16.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: I
think the president made the
right decision

03:16.396 --> 03:18.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to ask for his resignation.

03:18.165 --> 03:22.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You cannot have a national
security adviser
misleading the vice president
and others.

03:22.202 --> 03:26.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ryan wouldn't say if
he thinks
an investigation is needed.

03:26.339 --> 03:32.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House Oversight Committee
Chairman Jason Chaffetz
said: "The situation has taken
care of itself."

03:32.512 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell said
it's highly likely that the
Senate will investigate.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.553 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:39.586 --> 03:40.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: The
Intelligence Committee is
already looking

03:40.520 --> 03:44.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Russian involvement in our
election.

03:44.991 --> 03:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they have broad jurisdiction
over the
intel community writ large.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they can look at whatever
they choose
to.

03:53.967 --> 03:57.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Top Democrats
demanded an independent
probe.

03:57.337 --> 03:58.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIJAH CUMMINGS (D), Maryland:
Do you hear
the silence?

04:01.942 --> 04:10.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the sound of House
Republicans conducting
no oversight of President Trump.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Zero.

04:11.852 --> 04:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is what it sounds like when
they abdicate
their duty under the
Constitution.

04:17.591 --> 04:19.426 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: There
are potential violations of law
here by General

04:21.828 --> 04:23.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Flynn and potentially others.

04:23.830 --> 04:30.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I am calling for is an
independent investigation
with executive authority to
pursue potential

04:30.537 --> 04:32.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
criminal actions.

04:32.339 --> 04:36.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Moscow, the
Kremlin called it
an internal matter for the
United States.

04:36.710 --> 04:42.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But hard-line lawmakers like
Alexei Pushkov
said Flynn was the victim of a
witch-hunt.

04:42.382 --> 04:47.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump named retired Army
Lieutenant General
Keith Kellogg as his acting
national security

04:47.554 --> 04:49.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
adviser.

04:49.389 --> 04:53.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's served as chief of staff
for the National
Security Council and advised Mr.
Trump during

04:53.527 --> 04:55.428 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his campaign.

04:55.462 --> 04:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leading contenders for a
permanent replacement
are widely reported to include
former Vice

04:59.900 --> 05:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Admiral Robert Harward, a
retired Navy SEAL,
and former CIA Director and
retired Army General

05:06.339 --> 05:08.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
David Petraeus.

05:08.141 --> 05:13.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Petraeus is currently on
probation for revealing
classified intelligence to his
mistress.

05:13.880 --> 05:18.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spicer said the president did
not know that
Flynn had discussed U.S.
sanctions with the

05:18.185 --> 05:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ambassador until acting Attorney
General Yates
contacted the White House on
January 26.

05:24.391 --> 05:30.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spicer stressed that Flynn's
firing had nothing
to do with the phone call itself
-- Judy.

05:30.297 --> 05:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, there
are so many
threads to this story.

05:33.333 --> 05:37.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among other things, we're
learning that the
FBI interviewed General Flynn
very shortly

05:37.871 --> 05:40.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after the new administration
took office.

05:40.407 --> 05:44.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are the questions at the
White House
about -- how are they answering
these questions

05:44.444 --> 05:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about why it took so long, from
then until
now, for this to unfold, to come
out?

05:50.517 --> 05:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What they say is that
this had
been reviewed for weeks and that
it only was

05:55.522 --> 05:59.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the last night that Mr. Trump
decided to
ask for his resignation.

05:59.226 --> 06:05.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was also last night that The
Washington
Post reported this contact from
the acting

06:05.165 --> 06:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attorney general with the White
House.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The interview story you
mentioned is from
The New York Times.

06:10.370 --> 06:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They quote current and former
officials, unnamed,
saying that they found Mr. Flynn
to be less

06:17.777 --> 06:23.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than forthcoming in these FBI
interviews immediately
after the inauguration.

06:23.383 --> 06:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If officials conclude that he
deliberately
lied to the FBI, that could lead
to a felony

06:29.823 --> 06:31.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
charge.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
John, how
is the White House dealing with
this overall?

06:33.693 --> 06:35.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They are -- they came
out today.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They made a clean breast of it.

06:37.330 --> 06:43.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They tried to be as forthcoming
as they could
in the briefing.

06:43.036 --> 06:49.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sean Spicer stressed over and
over again this
was a matter of trust, that
Flynn was doing

06:49.142 --> 06:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his job as preparing to be
national security
adviser by talking to the
ambassador.

06:54.547 --> 06:59.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said it should be no
surprise that he
was talking about issues of
concern to both

06:59.686 --> 07:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them, but they are hoping
that they can
put this to rest.

07:03.089 --> 07:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Yang at the
White House,
we thank you.

07:06.926 --> 07:11.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And at the other end of
Pennsylvania Avenue,
our Lisa Desjardins joins us for
the latest

07:11.197 --> 07:12.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Capitol Hill.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lisa, we heard a little
about this already
in John's report.

07:15.769 --> 07:17.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what are you picking up
there?

07:17.570 --> 07:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How are -- especially the
leadership in both
parties, how are they reacting?

07:21.975 --> 07:25.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The White House
may want
to put this to rest, but there's
no signs

07:25.245 --> 07:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of that happening at the Capitol
yet, Judy.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are two camps, especially
among Senate
Republicans.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the place to watch.

07:32.152 --> 07:36.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some, like Senate Leader Mitch
McConnell,
say this should all be folded
into an ongoing

07:36.189 --> 07:40.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigation already under way
by the Senate
Intelligence Committee.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's over Russian hacking and
Russian manipulation
of the elections.

07:43.763 --> 07:47.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that will include now
questions about
General Flynn.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.669 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that's only in private,
Judy.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other Senate Republicans say
this needs to
have more light of day.

07:53.006 --> 07:56.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want public hearings,
including a public
hearing with General Flynn.

07:56.676 --> 07:59.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a divide for Senate
Republicans right
now.

07:59.346 --> 08:03.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, some other
Republicans say the
real investigation up here
should be into

08:03.316 --> 08:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the leaks, not into Mr. Flynn.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are all issues swirling
right now.

08:07.754 --> 08:09.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, what
about the Democrats?

08:09.789 --> 08:10.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Democrats came out strong
today, as John
reported.

08:13.293 --> 08:18.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chuck Schumer, asking for this
independent
investigation, his folks told me
that could

08:18.231 --> 08:24.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
include the FBI investigation
under way, but
only if new Attorney General
Jeff Sessions

08:24.237 --> 08:25.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recuses himself.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is a critical point for
Democrats.

08:28.074 --> 08:32.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, at the same time, they're
asking questions
about House Intelligence
Chairman Devin Nunes.

08:32.746 --> 08:38.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has generally been supportive
of General
Flynn, said he made a decision
to resign.

08:38.718 --> 08:40.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But he's not investigating.

08:40.420 --> 08:44.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some point out that Mr. Nunes
was himself
on the Trump transition team.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I asked him about that, asked
his office about
that.

08:46.926 --> 08:49.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They said he will follow all the
leads that
he can.

08:49.729 --> 08:55.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Democrats also eager
to point out
that another national security
issue arose

08:55.368 --> 09:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Republicans in the past
couple of years
when they investigated Hillary
Clinton, a

09:00.073 --> 09:02.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrat, and they see this as
somewhat hypocritical.

09:02.909 --> 09:06.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
so much to
follow.

09:06.579 --> 09:09.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

09:09.382 --> 09:13.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the day's other news:
Tensions with Russia
are rising on another front.

09:13.520 --> 09:19.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reports that
Moscow has
deployed a new ground-launched
cruise missile,

09:19.058 --> 09:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ignoring U.S. complaints that it
violates
a 1987 treaty.

09:23.763 --> 09:31.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Obama administration
objected to the missile
during its testing phase in 2014
and 2015.

09:31.438 --> 09:36.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five hundred U.S. troops arrived
in Romania
today as part of a mission to
shore up NATO

09:36.676 --> 09:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
allies in Eastern Europe.

09:38.878 --> 09:44.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shipments of American tanks were
taken by
train to an air base after being
unloaded

09:44.284 --> 09:46.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at a Black Sea port.

09:46.152 --> 09:49.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The troops will be stationed
there on a rotating
basis.

09:49.522 --> 09:55.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO has beefed up defenses in
Eastern Europe
in the wake of Russia's actions
in Ukraine.

09:55.862 --> 10:01.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea has rejected the
U.N. Security
Council's criticism of its
weekend missile

10:01.901 --> 10:03.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
launch.

10:03.803 --> 10:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva today, the North's
ambassador to
the United Nations said -- quote
-- "The successful

10:08.041 --> 10:15.381 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
test-launch of a
medium-to-long-range missile
on February 12 is a part of
self-defense measures."

10:15.415 --> 10:20.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the same conference, U.S.
Ambassador
Robert Wood called for
international action

10:20.920 --> 10:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to stop the North's missile and
nuclear tests.

10:23.723 --> 10:25.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT WOOD, U.S. Special
Representative to
the U.N. Conference on
Disarmament: The United

10:25.258 --> 10:29.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States is committed to holding
North Korea
accountable for its behavior.

10:29.729 --> 10:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We call on all states to use
every available
channel and means of influence
to make clear

10:34.334 --> 10:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the North Korean regime, and
its enablers,
that these launches are
unacceptable.

10:39.005 --> 10:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: North Korea's
missile test
was its first since President
Trump took office.

10:44.744 --> 10:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, there is word that
Kim Jong-nam,
half-brother to North Korea's
supreme leader,

10:50.550 --> 10:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was assassinated today in
Malaysia.

10:53.152 --> 10:57.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A South Korean news channel
reports that the
attackers were two women.

10:57.624 --> 11:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A senior Malaysian government
official says
that Kim claimed he was hit with
a chemical

11:02.228 --> 11:04.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spray at the Kuala Lumpur
Airport.

11:04.864 --> 11:09.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He died en route to a hospital,
where an autopsy
will now be performed.

11:09.869 --> 11:16.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kim Jong-un has carried out a
brutal purge
since taking power in North
Korea in 2011.

11:17.010 --> 11:23.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the Democratic Republic of
Congo, violence
surged again in an escalating
power struggle.

11:23.082 --> 11:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police raided the home of a
religious cult
leader who's called for
President Joseph Kabila

11:28.421 --> 11:30.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to step down.

11:30.089 --> 11:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Four people died in the raid.

11:32.091 --> 11:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kabila's mandate in office ran
out in December,
but he has refused to resign.

11:38.197 --> 11:44.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, nearly
200,000 people
got the all-clear to return to
their homes

11:44.270 --> 11:47.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
below a dam in Northern
California.

11:47.040 --> 11:53.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Helicopters had been bringing in
massive white
sandbags and cement blocks to
plug a 30-foot-deep

11:53.813 --> 11:55.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hole in the spillway.

11:55.682 --> 12:00.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon, the local
sheriff said the
danger near the Oroville Dam has
eased.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KORY HONEA, Butte County
Sheriff: Evacuation
order issued, which resulted in
people leaving

12:03.957 --> 12:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the area, and we have been
keeping them out.

12:06.492 --> 12:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this reduces that to an
evacuation warning,
and does exactly what you said,
allows people

12:11.998 --> 12:16.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to return to their homes, allows
people to
resume their businesses.

12:16.769 --> 12:20.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we are telling them that
they have to
be vigilant.

12:20.873 --> 12:26.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The forecast is
calling for
new storms in the Oroville area
on Thursday,

12:26.613 --> 12:30.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but officials say they think the
dam and spillway
can handle it.

12:30.683 --> 12:34.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two more members of the Trump
Cabinet have
taken their seats.

12:34.420 --> 12:39.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Shulkin was sworn in today
as the new
secretary of Veterans Affairs.

12:39.125 --> 12:42.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He easily won Senate
confirmation last night.

12:42.795 --> 12:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Linda McMahon was sworn in
to lead the
Small Business Administration
shortly after

12:47.166 --> 12:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Senate confirmed her today
81-19.

12:51.270 --> 12:55.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
McMahon was previously head of
World Wrestling
Entertainment.

12:55.842 --> 13:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal Reserve Chair Janet
Yellen says the
Central Bank still means to
raise interest

13:01.381 --> 13:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates this year, but it wants to
see what
the Trump administration does.

13:05.652 --> 13:10.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a Senate hearing today,
Yellen acknowledged
uncertainty surrounding the
president's tax

13:10.456 --> 13:12.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and spending plans.

13:12.325 --> 13:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: Changes
in fiscal policy or other
economic policies

13:16.829 --> 13:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could potentially affect the
economic outlook.

13:20.500 --> 13:26.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, it is too early to
know what policy
changes will be put in place or
how their

13:26.639 --> 13:28.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economic effects will unfold.

13:28.708 --> 13:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
has said that
his goal is to double economic
growth.

13:34.213 --> 13:39.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, bank stocks
rallied after
Yellen's remarks, in hopes that
higher interest

13:39.218 --> 13:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rates will help profits, and
that led the
broader market higher.

13:43.022 --> 13:49.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 92
points to close at 20504,
another record.

13:49.495 --> 13:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 18, and the S&amp;P
500 added
nine.

13:54.467 --> 13:59.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the questions
left unanswered by General
Flynn's resignation

13:59.672 --> 14:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I speak to senators on the
Intelligence
Committee; a view from Israel
ahead of Benjamin

14:05.545 --> 14:14.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Netanyahu's meeting with
President Trump;
and much more.

14:15.021 --> 14:25.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, for what we know about what
is happening
inside the White House at this
tumultuous

14:25.398 --> 14:30.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moment, and the real-world
effect of this
upheaval, we turn to two veteran
national

14:30.036 --> 14:31.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
security reporters.

14:32.004 --> 14:34.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Greg Miller writes for The
Washington Post.

14:34.307 --> 14:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Michael Gordon of The New
York Times,
he wrote the story about Russian
missile moves

14:38.978 --> 14:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we reported earlier.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Welcome, both of you, welcome
you back to
the program.

14:43.649 --> 14:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me start with you, Greg
Miller.

14:45.718 --> 14:51.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have gotten, I think, two
different versions
over the last 24 hours of what
happened to

14:51.157 --> 14:56.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
General Flynn since yesterday,
was that he
was asked to resign.

14:56.929 --> 15:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the White House seems to
be saying
he was forced to resign.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the truth?

15:02.468 --> 15:04.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER, National Security
Correspondent,
The Washington Post: I think
there is really

15:04.237 --> 15:10.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not much doubt that he was
forced and that
a number of things forced the
White House

15:10.143 --> 15:11.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make this decision.

15:11.978 --> 15:18.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They might not have wanted to do
it at that
particular moment, but the
cumulative total

15:18.284 --> 15:23.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the headlines day after day
on Flynn and
what was happening was, I think,
too much.

15:23.256 --> 15:28.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it really came down
to two basic
things, one, what he did, and
just what he

15:28.528 --> 15:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discussed with the Russian
ambassador, but,
more significantly, how he
misled senior officials

15:34.500 --> 15:38.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the White House, including
Vice President
Pence, about the nature of those
communications.

15:38.037 --> 15:43.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Greg Miller,
staying with you,
what's your understanding of why
this was

15:43.242 --> 15:49.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allowed to spiral on, this was
allowed to
run out as long as it did, three
weeks?

15:49.615 --> 15:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That from the time General Flynn
came into
the White House, there were
questions about

15:54.353 --> 15:58.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these conversations with the
Russian ambassador,
and here we are over three weeks
later.

15:58.224 --> 16:00.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why did it take so long?

16:00.059 --> 16:02.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER: I mean, we're still
waiting for
really clear answers to these
questions, but

16:02.962 --> 16:05.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the questions are really piling
up at this
point.

16:05.865 --> 16:10.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, we are reporting and
others are reporting
this afternoon that Flynn was
interviewed

16:10.369 --> 16:17.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the FBI within his initial
days of his
arrival as national security
adviser in the

16:17.109 --> 16:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump administration, which
means that the
FBI was already looking at this
and putting

16:21.314 --> 16:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him -- sworn questions to him
about his communications
with Kislyak.

16:26.385 --> 16:31.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we know, as we reported
last night
at The Washington Post, that the
acting attorney

16:31.057 --> 16:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
general warned the White House
weeks ago that
Flynn had misled Pence and
others.

16:38.030 --> 16:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it took until yesterday for
the White
House to even appear to
acknowledge this discrepancy,

16:44.470 --> 16:46.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
let alone attempt to clear any
of it up.

16:46.472 --> 16:50.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Michael
Gordon, as somebody
who watches the entire foreign
policy establishment

16:50.810 --> 16:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this city, what effect is
this having?

16:53.079 --> 16:55.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON, Diplomatic
Correspondent,
The New York Times: Well, it
doesn't help

16:55.982 --> 16:59.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
when your American
administration is in a
state of turmoil.

16:59.652 --> 17:04.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, today, the head of the
Special Operations
Command, General Tony Thomas,
said something

17:04.957 --> 17:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that was really incredible.

17:06.893 --> 17:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that -- in a conference,
he said that
the -- our own government, our
American government,

17:11.697 --> 17:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was in a state of turmoil, and
this was very
disconcerting for the military,
because they

17:17.303 --> 17:20.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
needed stability at home in
order to deal
with wars abroad.

17:20.606 --> 17:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when your own generals are
talking about
it, you know it's having an
effect.

17:24.610 --> 17:28.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Michael
Gordon, as we
said, you reported today about
the Russians

17:28.447 --> 17:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deploying a missile, violating a
treaty.

17:32.685 --> 17:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Obama administration had
protested, as
we know, over a number of years.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What does that represent?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: This is a very
big deal.

17:44.497 --> 17:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is -- there was a treaty,
the INF Treaty,
signed by President Reagan and
Mikhail Gorbachev,

17:50.703 --> 17:57.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which led to the elimination of
all intermediate-range
American and Russian missiles
based on land.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it really sealed the end of
the Cold War.

17:59.946 --> 18:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what the Russians have now
done is developed
a missile that -- and deployed
it.

18:06.886 --> 18:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is -- really flies in
the face of
the agreement.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is not a technical
violation.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is a violation at the heart
of the agreement.

18:14.827 --> 18:18.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, it has more political
significance
than military significance,.

18:18.531 --> 18:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if they continue deploying
these systems,
it's something that the NATO
alliance and

18:23.803 --> 18:27.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General -- Secretary Mattis is
going to be
there tomorrow -- is really
going to have

18:27.807 --> 18:29.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to address.

18:29.608 --> 18:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, Greg
Miller, if the
National Security Council were
functioning

18:33.612 --> 18:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under normal circumstances,
wouldn't there
have been some reaction to this,
some anticipation

18:39.585 --> 18:41.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it?

18:41.320 --> 18:43.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER: I mean, that's the
job of the
National Security Council is to
try to be

18:43.222 --> 18:49.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a disciplined clearinghouse,
gathering the
views from across multiple
agencies, teeing

18:49.395 --> 18:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up decisions that make sense for
the president.

18:54.934 --> 19:00.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was told that all members of
the National
Security Council were summoned
for an all-hands

19:00.439 --> 19:04.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting at 10:00 a.m. this
morning, and that
it went for five minutes and it
was basically

19:04.577 --> 19:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a plea for people to stay in
place and not
head for the exits yet.

19:09.348 --> 19:13.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's just a state of acute
turmoil right
now.

19:13.119 --> 19:17.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Does that
compare, Greg Miller,
to anything you have seen
before?

19:17.523 --> 19:19.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GREG MILLER: Oh, none
whatsoever.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Gordon,
what about
you?

19:21.994 --> 19:26.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, when you look at the
picture of what's
going on at the National
Security Council,

19:26.499 --> 19:30.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that -- and I think you
were telling
us today, reminding us there is
only one person

19:31.003 --> 19:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who has been confirmed at the
State Department,
Secretary Tillerson.

19:38.477 --> 19:41.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the state of American
national security
right now, decision-making?

19:42.014 --> 19:47.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, you can't
make a decision
about how to approach Russia if
you have no

19:47.319 --> 19:53.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deputy secretary of state, you
have no assistant
secretary for European affairs,
you have no

19:53.092 --> 19:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undersecretary of defense for
policy, and
you have no permanent national
security adviser.

19:59.398 --> 20:04.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an important issue, and
they simply
don't have the people in place
to begin to

20:04.904 --> 20:08.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make intelligent decisions about
what policy
course they want to steer.

20:08.707 --> 20:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Greg Miller,
I think the
White House would say, well, we
have appointed

20:12.611 --> 20:14.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
someone as an interim.

20:14.313 --> 20:20.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are working hard to name a
permanent replacement
as national security adviser.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why aren't they correct to say,
well, this
is just a momentary blip, we're
going to get

20:23.622 --> 20:25.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on with business?

20:25.424 --> 20:29.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREG MILLER: I mean, it's a --
if this were
in isolation, perhaps you could
accept that

20:29.595 --> 20:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this were an ordinary blip.

20:31.864 --> 20:37.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other problems that
Michael Gordon
just outlined, in addition to
just sort of

20:37.203 --> 20:44.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the -- just the appearance of
chaos that you
see, the images from the
Mar-a-Lago resort

20:44.510 --> 20:49.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Florida this weekend, where
the Trump officials
and Trump himself appeared to be
reacting

20:49.915 --> 20:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to North Korean missile launch
with -- by
pulling out their cell phones,
in view of

20:57.156 --> 20:58.891 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other guests at the restaurant.

20:58.924 --> 21:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, across the board, it
just looks like
a lack of discipline and
organization.

21:05.898 --> 21:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
Michael Gordon,
so, what are you keeping your
eye on right

21:09.568 --> 21:11.403 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now?

21:11.437 --> 21:16.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GORDON: Well, I think
Secretary Mattis
is going to be in Brussels
tomorrow with the

21:16.408 --> 21:18.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
NATO allies.

21:18.210 --> 21:22.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's clearly got to deal with
this missile
threat, because this is a --
strikes at the

21:22.781 --> 21:28.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heart of an agreement that is
very much valued,
not by the -- not only by the
NATO allies,

21:28.354 --> 21:31.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but by our Asian allies.

21:31.557 --> 21:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, tomorrow, we
should at least
see at least a glimmer of an
American response

21:37.062 --> 21:38.197 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on this.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that's the near-term
thing to
keep an eye on.

21:39.999 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The longer-term thing is that
Mr. Flynn was
-- seemed to be cozying up to
Putin.

21:45.905 --> 21:50.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now that he's gone, that
might affect
our broader policy toward
Russia.

21:50.109 --> 22:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Gordon,
Greg Miller,
thank you both.

22:04.590 --> 22:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get reaction now from Capitol
Hill to General
Flynn's resignation from two
senators who

22:09.295 --> 22:11.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sit on the Intelligence
Committee.

22:11.363 --> 22:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We start with James Risch from
Idaho.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spoke with him a short time
ago.

22:15.467 --> 22:20.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I started by asking if the
Senate Intelligence
Committee, with its Republican
majority, will

22:20.472 --> 22:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
investigate General Flynn.

22:21.907 --> 22:23.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:23.742 --> 22:27.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES RISCH (R), Idaho: Well,
Judy, on the
Senate Intelligence Committee,
our jurisdiction

22:27.079 --> 22:33.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is and our charge is to oversee
all intelligence
and counterintelligence
activities.

22:33.619 --> 22:39.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As such, there's already been an
investigation
started on the Russian
situation.

22:39.091 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, obviously, with what's
happened, that
net, I think, is wide enough --
not I think

22:43.862 --> 22:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that net is wide enough that
it will include
the most recent events of the
last 48 hours

22:48.934 --> 22:50.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
or so.

22:50.970 --> 22:54.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, that means
that investigation
will definitely be expanded to
include specifically

22:54.807 --> 22:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what General Flynn talked to the
Russian ambassador
about?

22:58.177 --> 22:59.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:59.411 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: You know, I don't
know where
it will lead.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, we're going to lead
it -- we're
going to take it as far as we
can take it.

23:04.350 --> 23:08.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's important for national
security that
we know.

23:08.420 --> 23:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those of us that are in the
first branch of
government that actually fund
these operations

23:12.024 --> 23:17.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and oversee these operations,
it's really
important that these kinds of
matters be on

23:17.229 --> 23:20.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the table before us when we make
the policy
decisions that we have to make.

23:20.366 --> 23:24.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Can you say
whether or not
the investigation is going to
also look in

23:24.270 --> 23:28.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or that part of it will be
looking into
the president's handling of
this, the fact

23:28.941 --> 23:34.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he was informed about
General Flynn's
conversations with the Russian
ambassador

23:34.113 --> 23:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks before he asked General
Flynn to step
down?

23:38.017 --> 23:39.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: You know, that's a
fact that
I have seen reported today.

23:41.453 --> 23:45.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't have any independent
knowledge that
that actually occurred.

23:45.324 --> 23:50.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One thing I will tell you is,
the White House
and the second branch of
government is an

23:50.829 --> 23:57.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
independent branch of
government, and there
are certain areas we don't go
into.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a person that's very
close to the
president.

23:59.838 --> 24:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not subject to Senate
confirmation.

24:02.808 --> 24:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when the president is
getting information,
when he's being advised by these
people, it's

24:08.380 --> 24:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important that all those parties
that are
acting in the White House have
an understanding

24:14.253 --> 24:15.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of confidentiality.

24:15.587 --> 24:18.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My point is, I don't know where
this will
go in that regard.

24:18.691 --> 24:22.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know what our sideboards are,
and we will
stay within those sideboards.

24:22.428 --> 24:25.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the White
House press
secretary said today that the
president was

24:25.964 --> 24:27.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
informed.

24:27.833 --> 24:33.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has now been announced that
the president
was informed weeks before Mr.
Flynn, General

24:33.872 --> 24:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Flynn, was asked to step down.

24:35.107 --> 24:36.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:36.575 --> 24:39.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Well, if that fact
has been confirmed,
then it is a fact.

24:39.645 --> 24:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the -- it
sounds like you're
not saying whether or not the
committee is

24:44.583 --> 24:46.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
going to look into the
president's handling
of this.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.520 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

24:48.554 --> 24:52.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES RISCH: Well, the
president's handling
of this, I think, is a matter
that is a very

24:52.725 --> 24:55.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
delicate situation between two
branches of
government.

24:55.527 --> 24:59.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess what you're asking
is, what was
-- how was he motivated?

24:59.365 --> 25:00.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

25:00.366 --> 25:01.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Why was this done
and what have
you?

25:03.369 --> 25:08.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boy, that's an area that I think
you would
have a very difficult time
getting that information

25:08.907 --> 25:10.075 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to begin with.

25:10.109 --> 25:12.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Certainly, the president
wouldn't be asked
about that.

25:12.878 --> 25:17.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as a result of that, it
would be very
difficult to dig into that.

25:17.049 --> 25:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if we know the facts,
that's what's
going to help us as we do our
job and move

25:22.955 --> 25:24.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the reason
I'm asking
is because, as you know, there
are serious

25:26.458 --> 25:33.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
questions about whether
President Trump at
the time before he was president
knew about

25:33.932 --> 25:37.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what General Flynn was talking
to the Russian
ambassador about and whether he
condoned those

25:37.903 --> 25:38.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conversations.

25:38.904 --> 25:40.672 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

25:40.706 --> 25:44.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Well, I think
that's a different
inquiry, as to whether
conversations were

25:44.510 --> 25:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condoned, depending upon what
the content
of the conversation was.

25:48.447 --> 25:53.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm very reluctant to talk about
a collision
between the two branches of
government on

25:53.685 --> 25:55.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something like this.

25:55.521 --> 25:58.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, you
started out by
pointing out the committee is
already looking

25:58.123 --> 26:02.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into the Russian government's
involvement
in the elections last year.

26:02.261 --> 26:05.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you tell us anything about
the state of
that investigation?

26:05.564 --> 26:06.532 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

26:06.565 --> 26:07.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES RISCH: I can.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just starting.

26:09.201 --> 26:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have identified a number of
things that
we do want to look at.

26:13.539 --> 26:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done the things that you
do as you
prepare and start into an
investigation.

26:20.446 --> 26:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have been involved in lots
of these
on the committee, whether it was
Benghazi,

26:25.350 --> 26:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether it was the torture
investigation,
others that we have done that
have not become

26:29.621 --> 26:30.589 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
public.

26:30.622 --> 26:34.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we're good at what we do.

26:34.426 --> 26:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do have excellent cooperation
from the
intelligence community
generally, from the

26:41.066 --> 26:43.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
16 intelligence agencies.

26:43.168 --> 26:47.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They give us good information
and particularly
when you know exactly what
you're after.

26:47.773 --> 26:51.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we feel comfortable about
moving forward
with these.

26:51.543 --> 26:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just finally,
quickly, Senator,
the White House, the president
and his spokesmen

26:56.114 --> 27:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are saying what's most important
right now
are the leaks that are coming
out about discussions,

27:02.554 --> 27:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaks to the news media, and
that that's more
important than anything the
national security

27:06.191 --> 27:07.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
adviser did.

27:07.192 --> 27:08.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you agree with that?

27:08.193 --> 27:09.661 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:09.695 --> 27:12.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Well, it depends on
the actual
leak that you're talking about.

27:12.097 --> 27:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When leaks are political, they
probably don't
do much harm.

27:16.201 --> 27:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When they are involved with
national security,
it is a big problem.

27:19.137 --> 27:23.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the many years I have been
on the Intelligence
Committee, I have been concerned
about leaks.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So have other people.

27:24.877 --> 27:29.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can tell you that, with the
great body of
intelligence information that is
out there,

27:29.715 --> 27:34.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not much of it has leaked out,
but even a
little bit of it being leaked
out is way too

27:34.286 --> 27:35.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is very dangerous.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is un-American to leak.

27:38.023 --> 27:43.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It puts people's lives in
jeopardy, and it
really endangers the United
States.

27:43.095 --> 27:47.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone who would leak national
security issues
should be ashamed of themselves,
and they

27:47.733 --> 27:49.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are not a credit to America.

27:49.167 --> 27:52.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you
pointed out, very
little of it is leaked.

27:52.471 --> 27:54.206 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

27:54.239 --> 27:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Very little of it
is leaked,
but any can be important and can
put people's

27:56.675 --> 27:58.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lives at risk.

27:58.510 --> 28:02.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator James
Risch with the
Senate Intelligence Committee,
thank you very

28:02.080 --> 28:03.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much, Senator.

28:03.081 --> 28:04.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:04.082 --> 28:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES RISCH: Thank you, Judy.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Good to be with you.

28:06.952 --> 28:09.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now for a
Democrat's perspective,
and for that, the vice chairman
of the Senate

28:09.288 --> 28:11.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Intelligence Committee, Mark
Warner of Virginia.

28:11.690 --> 28:16.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I began by asking what he
thought the Senate
should be doing about General
Flynn's discussions

28:16.361 --> 28:17.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the Russian ambassador.

28:17.362 --> 28:18.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:18.830 --> 28:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia: Well,
these discussions
are very troubling.

28:22.334 --> 28:26.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the first thing we need to
do is get to
the facts.

28:26.638 --> 28:31.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard reports that he
may have been
making certain statements that
were inappropriate

28:31.743 --> 28:33.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to the Russian ambassador.

28:33.845 --> 28:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have not yet seen those
transcripts.

28:36.848 --> 28:41.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once we see the transcripts,
then, if they
prove as the media has
indicated, they would

28:41.820 --> 28:47.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fall into part of the area that
the investigation
that we are putting forward by
the Senate

28:47.492 --> 28:54.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Intelligence Committee that's
looking at contacts
between former campaign
officials and the

28:54.700 --> 29:00.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian government, looking at
Russian interference
into the election in terms of
spreading fake

29:00.238 --> 29:06.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
news, and obviously the
selective hacking
and leaking of information that
favored Mr.

29:06.945 --> 29:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump over Hillary Clinton.

29:08.947 --> 29:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This -- General Flynn's actions
would fall
within this investigation.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we would need to get to the
bottom of
it.

29:15.921 --> 29:19.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the facts are as reported,
then I think
the committee needs to interview
him.

29:19.291 --> 29:22.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you
determine if the
facts are as reported?

29:22.828 --> 29:23.862 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Well, we understand
basic tradecraft.

29:26.832 --> 29:33.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would -- this is one of
the things that
just amazes me, that someone
with General

29:33.138 --> 29:38.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flynn's security clearances
should know that,
if he's talking to a Russian
ambassador, chances

29:38.810 --> 29:41.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are those conversations are
monitored.

29:41.980 --> 29:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they had been monitored,
at some point,
we need to see the transcript.

29:46.718 --> 29:52.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obviously, something has
happened so that
-- because General Flynn relayed
one set of

29:52.991 --> 29:57.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facts, and then, as it became
evident that
it appeared that there were
transcripts, he

29:57.262 --> 30:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
changed and changed his story
and then ended
up resigning.

30:01.767 --> 30:08.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the transcripts reveal what
the press has
said, this raises very, very
serious concerns

30:08.173 --> 30:14.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about potentially an American
who was not
part of an administration at
that point actually

30:14.846 --> 30:20.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trying to undermine then
President Obama's
sanctions against Russia, those
very sanctions

30:20.852 --> 30:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which were caused by the Russian
interference
in our electoral process.

30:24.189 --> 30:28.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are also
questions, Senator
Warner, being raised, as you
know, about whether

30:28.627 --> 30:34.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president knew about the
conversations
that General Flynn was having at
that time,

30:34.132 --> 30:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whether he condoned them.

30:35.701 --> 30:38.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do you find the answer to
that?

30:38.603 --> 30:39.671 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

30:39.705 --> 30:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Well, that's
further down the
path.

30:41.473 --> 30:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have to start with what
Flynn said
to the Russian ambassador.

30:46.511 --> 30:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it would be extraordinarily
troubling
-- and I hope and pray that it's
not the case

30:52.184 --> 30:56.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president was somehow
aware of these
conversations, the
president-elect at that

30:56.621 --> 31:02.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point, because what you, in
effect, would
be happening would be, you would
have someone

31:02.561 --> 31:10.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that wasn't at that point
actually the president
trying to undermine the policies
of then President

31:10.402 --> 31:17.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama, who had put these
sanctions in place
because, quite honestly, it was
the unprecedented

31:17.209 --> 31:20.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
action of Russians interfering
in our elections.

31:20.712 --> 31:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still will always remember the
head of the
NSA, the head of the CIA, the
head of the

31:25.751 --> 31:31.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FBI, the head -- the director of
national
intelligence, all four those
individuals testifying

31:31.556 --> 31:37.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in public and private that
they'd never seen
a foreign government, an
adversary, in the

31:37.596 --> 31:42.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
case of Russia, try to interfere
in such a
major way in our elections.

31:42.167 --> 31:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if somehow someone was
trying to undermine
then President Obama's sanctions
against that

31:48.106 --> 31:50.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
nation, that would be
extraordinarily troubling.

31:50.142 --> 31:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I just talked to
Senator James
Risch, who is a Republican
member of the Intelligence

31:54.813 --> 31:56.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

31:56.648 --> 32:01.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he's confident that this
investigation
can be carried out by the Senate
Intelligence

32:01.119 --> 32:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee, that you don't need
an outside
independent body, a commission
of some sort.

32:06.191 --> 32:07.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you equally confident?

32:07.459 --> 32:08.426 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

32:08.460 --> 32:10.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Well, that's my
hope.

32:10.395 --> 32:13.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, I believe that this
-- the Intelligence
Committee, which has
jurisdiction -- we're

32:13.565 --> 32:15.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doing this bipartisan.

32:15.567 --> 32:20.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the American public
expect us to work
on this kind of activity in a
bipartisan fashion.

32:20.839 --> 32:21.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We have access.

32:22.007 --> 32:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will get access to most this
intelligence.

32:24.576 --> 32:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have said -- and the
chairman, Richard
Burr, has said the same -- we're
going to

32:28.814 --> 32:31.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
follow this to where the
intelligence leads.

32:31.416 --> 32:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are going to follow the
facts, no matter
where they lead.

32:34.553 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If at any moment in time,
though, that there
is an effort to try to suppress
facts or suppress

32:41.193 --> 32:44.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intelligence, then I and I
believe other members
of the committee will call for a
different

32:44.729 --> 32:49.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of investigation, and we
might go the
route of an independent
commission.

32:49.301 --> 32:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But right at this moment in
time, I believe
the Senate Intelligence
Committee, bipartisan,

32:53.805 --> 32:55.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going after the facts is the
right venue.

32:55.674 --> 33:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are you satisfied
right now,
Senator, with the progress being
made on the

33:01.112 --> 33:05.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rest of this investigation
looking overall
at Russian influence on the
election?

33:05.250 --> 33:06.418 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

33:06.451 --> 33:08.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Remember, we're
looking at three
big areas.

33:08.887 --> 33:14.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're looking at contacts
between campaigns
and the Russians, both prior to
and after

33:14.459 --> 33:17.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the fact, as the case with Mr.
Flynn.

33:17.195 --> 33:23.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're looking at the
unprecedented amount
of fake news that flooded our
news coverage

33:24.002 --> 33:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
during the election cycle.

33:25.804 --> 33:31.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think most Americans
realize there
were literally 1,000 Russian
Internet trolls

33:31.776 --> 33:36.481 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working in a single location in
Russia trying
to interfere in our elections.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they, I think, had major
interference.

33:38.850 --> 33:44.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we're looking at the
selective hacking
of the DNC and John Podesta's
e-mails and

33:44.856 --> 33:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the leaking of that information.

33:46.658 --> 33:51.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have contacted all our major
intelligence
agencies and said, we need to
see all the

33:51.630 --> 33:53.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
raw intelligence.

33:53.398 --> 33:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're starting that process to
look through
that intelligence.

33:56.601 --> 33:58.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I wish it could move faster.

33:58.370 --> 34:01.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, the sooner we get to
the bottom of
this, the better.

34:01.640 --> 34:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would even think the
administration,
if it removes the cloud that is
hanging over

34:06.211 --> 34:10.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this administration, I think
they would want
us to do our job as
expeditiously as possible

34:10.882 --> 34:12.751 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
also.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Mark
Warner, the ranking
Democrat on the Intelligence
Committee, thank

34:15.887 --> 34:16.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you very much.

34:16.888 --> 34:17.856 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

34:17.889 --> 34:22.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Thank you so much.

34:22.761 --> 34:32.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Israel's Prime
Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu is in Washington ahead
of a meeting

34:32.570 --> 34:34.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tomorrow with President Trump.

34:34.940 --> 34:39.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Martin
Seemungal has
some background from Jerusalem.

34:39.344 --> 34:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Jerusalem's
Old City is
defined by divisions, four
quarters, Armenian,

34:45.583 --> 34:52.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christian, Muslim, and Jewish, a
legacy of
conquests and occupations dating
back thousands

34:52.290 --> 34:54.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of years.

34:54.559 --> 35:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israeli soldiers captured East
Jerusalem and
the Old City from Jordan in the
Six-Day War

35:02.667 --> 35:04.402 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of 1967.

35:04.436 --> 35:09.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Israeli soldiers still
control the
streets of the Old City and the
thousands

35:09.674 --> 35:11.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Palestinians who live here.

35:11.776 --> 35:13.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is a tense, often volatile
place.

35:13.845 --> 35:18.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
I love Israel.

35:18.516 --> 35:19.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love Israel.

35:19.517 --> 35:20.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

35:20.518 --> 35:21.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Enter Donald
Trump:

35:21.586 --> 35:23.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We will move the
American Embassy.

35:23.321 --> 35:25.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Promising to
move the U.S.
Embassy from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem during

35:25.724 --> 35:28.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his campaign.

35:28.760 --> 35:33.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jerusalem's mayor, Nir Barkat,
welcomes the
news with open enthusiasm.

35:33.231 --> 35:37.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His vice mayor, Yitzhak Pindrus,
says it is
long overdue.

35:37.202 --> 35:39.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YITZHAK PINDRUS, Vice Mayor of
Jerusalem:
Jerusalem is the capital,
capital of Israel,

35:39.771 --> 35:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the capital of the Jewish
nation.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was that for thousands of
years.

35:43.608 --> 35:45.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not something that's going
to change.

35:45.643 --> 35:49.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm comfortable with that,
and I would
be very happy if the embassy
will move here.

35:49.848 --> 35:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: No nation on
Earth officially
recognizes Jerusalem as the
capital of Israel.

35:55.854 --> 35:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To understand why, you have to
go back beyond
the '67 war.

36:00.025 --> 36:06.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The United Nations' 1947
partition created
Jewish and Arab states, putting
Jerusalem

36:06.331 --> 36:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
under international control.

36:09.234 --> 36:15.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel captured a large part of
Jerusalem
in 1948, and divided Israeli
West Jerusalem

36:15.473 --> 36:19.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
from a Palestinian East
Jerusalem with a Green
Line.

36:19.044 --> 36:25.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite declaring West Jerusalem
as its capital,
no country moved embassies
there.

36:25.750 --> 36:30.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the old Green Line that
split Jerusalem
in two.

36:30.522 --> 36:36.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Israel annexed the eastern side
of the city
in the 1980s, illegally,
according to international

36:36.661 --> 36:37.929 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

36:37.962 --> 36:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And ever since, it's been trying
to erase
that sense of division.

36:41.766 --> 36:47.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reality remains West
Jerusalem is
predominately Jewish, East
Jerusalem is predominantly

36:47.872 --> 36:49.774 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Muslim.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Palestinians want East Jerusalem
as the capital
of a Palestinian state.

36:53.812 --> 36:59.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump's promise to
move the embassy
to Jerusalem has angered
Palestinians.

36:59.384 --> 37:03.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hanan Ashrawi is a senior member
of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization.

37:03.521 --> 37:06.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HANAN ASHRAWI, Palestinian
Liberation Organization:
This is an irresponsible and
dangerous move.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Don't even think about it,
because you will
be inflaming feelings.

37:10.128 --> 37:13.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will be turning this into a
religious
conflict.

37:13.198 --> 37:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will be starting a whole new
cycle of
violence.

37:15.700 --> 37:17.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The U.S. will be seen as
complicit.

37:17.669 --> 37:21.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The Trump
administration
got the same message from other
Arab leaders

37:21.840 --> 37:24.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the region, and it may have
had an impact.

37:24.809 --> 37:29.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The embassy move doesn't seem so
imminent
anymore, and may have been
shelved for the

37:30.014 --> 37:31.716 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
time being.

37:31.749 --> 37:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, there is still a
feeling here that
the Trump administration favors
Israel.

37:36.121 --> 37:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just before the new year, the
incoming president
tweeted: "We cannot continue to
let Israel

37:41.593 --> 37:45.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be treated with such total
disdain and disrespect.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Stay strong, Israel.

37:47.398 --> 37:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
January 20 is fast approaching"

37:51.069 --> 37:56.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's tweet came just after
former Secretary
of State John Kerry lashed out
at Israel for

37:56.508 --> 38:02.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its settlement policy, the last
flash point
in a tense relationship between
Israeli Prime

38:02.280 --> 38:06.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
the Obama
White House.

38:06.518 --> 38:11.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The two leaders clashed
repeatedly, the deepest
division over Iran.

38:11.589 --> 38:18.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Netanyahu was openly and harshly
critical
of the nuclear deal that Obama
championed.

38:18.563 --> 38:23.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Netanyahu's right-wing
government was criticized
often by the Obama
administration, particularly

38:23.234 --> 38:27.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the issue of settlement
building in East
Jerusalem and the West Bank.

38:27.172 --> 38:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A clearly pleased Netanyahu
spoke the day
after Trump's victory.

38:31.876 --> 38:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, Israeli
Prime Minister:
You are a great friend of
Israel.

38:35.413 --> 38:40.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Over the years, you have
expressed your support
consistently, and I deeply
appreciate it.

38:40.752 --> 38:45.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: And within
days of Trump's
inauguration, Netanyahu
announced major settlement

38:45.223 --> 38:50.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expansion plans, 3,000 units in
total, the
biggest in years.

38:50.995 --> 38:52.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The White House stayed silent.

38:53.031 --> 38:58.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ayelet Shaked is the justice
minister and
member of the right-wing Jewish
Home Party

38:58.169 --> 39:03.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is pushing settlement
building in what
the government calls Judea and
Samaria, the

39:03.074 --> 39:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
biblical term for the West Bank.

39:04.876 --> 39:09.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She says Netanyahu's
announcements were made
because Donald Trump is in the
White House

39:09.981 --> 39:11.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYELET SHAKED, Jewish Home
Party: Of course
it's not a coincidence.

39:13.184 --> 39:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For eight years, the Obama
administration
refused to any extension in
Judea and Samaria.

39:20.358 --> 39:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, actually, in reality, the
main cities
there were frozen.

39:26.631 --> 39:33.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, of course we expect that, in
a Trump administration,
it will be different.

39:33.071 --> 39:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: And there are
other indicators
of the Trump strong pro-Israel
sentiment.

39:38.643 --> 39:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump's nominee for
ambassador to
Israel is David Friedman,
reportedly a U.S.

39:43.881 --> 39:49.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fund-raiser for a West Bank
settlement, who
believes Israel shouldn't be
forced into a

39:49.320 --> 39:51.556 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
two-state solution.

39:51.589 --> 39:56.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump seems likely to
appoint Jared
Kushner, his son-in-law, viewed
as extremely

39:56.227 --> 40:01.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sympathetic to Israel, to
negotiate a deal
between the Israelis and the
Palestinians.

40:01.733 --> 40:06.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HANAN ASHRAWI: Now you have
settlers and settler
supporters in the White House.

40:06.537 --> 40:07.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's unbelievable.

40:07.772 --> 40:09.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's incredible.

40:09.607 --> 40:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Dan Shapiro
understands
very well the complications of
trying to broker

40:13.478 --> 40:16.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
peace between Palestinians and
Israelis.

40:16.781 --> 40:22.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the American ambassador
here during
the Obama years and knows what
Kushner is

40:22.053 --> 40:23.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about to face.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN SHAPIRO, Former U.S.
Ambassador to Israel:
Well, the first thing I would
say to anybody

40:25.556 --> 40:27.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
given that assignment is, good
luck.

40:27.759 --> 40:31.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I don't mean that in a
joking way.

40:31.129 --> 40:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, anybody who's worked
on this issue
knows its frustrations and
pitfalls.

40:35.099 --> 40:39.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One advantage he will certainly
have is his
close relationship to the
president.

40:39.304 --> 40:43.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Negotiations
will be even
more difficult than usual if the
Palestinians

40:43.608 --> 40:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feel the new U.S. administration
has shifted
strongly towards Israel.

40:48.980 --> 40:54.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The early days of the Trump
administration
were not comforting to
Palestinians.

40:54.118 --> 40:59.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when Netanyahu announced
another set of
settlement building, the White
House did react.

40:59.924 --> 41:05.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first part of the statement
signaled a
shift in past policy, often
critical of Israel

41:05.697 --> 41:10.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the settlement building
issue, saying the
administration doesn't believe
the settlements

41:10.301 --> 41:13.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are "an impediment to peace."

41:13.738 --> 41:19.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then a change in tone: "The
construction
of new settlements or the
expansion of existing

41:20.011 --> 41:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
settlements beyond their current
borders may
not be helpful in achieving that
goal."

41:26.117 --> 41:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was interpreted in Israel as
a polite warning.

41:29.587 --> 41:32.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It raised some concern within
the Netanyahu
coalition.

41:32.957 --> 41:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dan Meridor served as a Cabinet
minister under
Netanyahu, but left politics
because of Netanyahu's

41:39.764 --> 41:41.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
shift to the right.

41:41.265 --> 41:44.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says, when it comes to Trump,
the government
shouldn't assume too much.

41:44.969 --> 41:49.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN MERIDOR, Former Israeli
Cabinet Minister:
Because he's so unpredictable in
a way, I

41:49.607 --> 41:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wouldn't bet anything on what
may develop.

41:53.678 --> 42:00.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I were the government, I
wouldn't base
any policies on any presumption
Trump will

42:00.618 --> 42:02.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
go in a set way.

42:02.487 --> 42:06.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: White House
statements and
Trump's recent comments do
appear to indicate

42:06.290 --> 42:12.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a change in direction from the
first days
of Trump's presidency, more in
line with longstanding

42:12.830 --> 42:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American policy based on two
states for two
peoples.

42:18.035 --> 42:23.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two-state solution is
critical to peace,
because Palestinian Authority
President Mahmoud

42:23.074 --> 42:25.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Abbas still believes it.

42:25.376 --> 42:29.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It remains the foundation of the
Palestinian
dream.

42:29.881 --> 42:34.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow's White House visit by
Netanyahu
will be watched very closely on
both sides

42:34.585 --> 42:41.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Jerusalem and on the West
Bank for any
hint of a change in the status
quo, one defined

42:41.426 --> 42:43.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for so long by division.

in Kansas is grappling with the
problems of

43:02.413 --> 43:03.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
homeless students.

PBS special correspondent Lisa
Stark of our

LISA STARK: It's varsity
basketball practice
at Schlagle High School in
Kansas City, Kansas,

43:20.765 --> 43:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and 6'6'' senior Malik Cushon is
the tallest
guy on the team, determined on
the court and

43:28.473 --> 43:30.274 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
off.

43:30.308 --> 43:33.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALIK CUSHON, Student: I just
had to set my
mind to it, had to be focused,
real focused

43:33.110 --> 43:34.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to get back where I needed to
be.

43:34.745 --> 43:38.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Back from a place he
never expected
to find himself.

43:38.483 --> 43:41.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A few months ago, Malik had
nowhere to live.

43:41.919 --> 43:47.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALIK CUSHON: Me and my mother
had a little
miscommunication, and one word
led to another.

43:47.758 --> 43:50.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't want to get too deep
into it, because
I still love my mother.

43:50.995 --> 43:55.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it just wasn't right at the
moment, so
she just kicked me out.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Did you realize he
was homeless?

43:57.969 --> 43:58.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PRENTES POTTS, Basketball Coach,
Schlagle
High School: I didn't know.

43:58.970 --> 43:59.937 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I didn't know.

43:59.971 --> 44:00.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: How did you find
out?

44:00.938 --> 44:01.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRENTES POTTS: He told me.

44:01.939 --> 44:05.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He told me, told me through a
text message.

44:05.042 --> 44:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: But by the time
Malik told coach
Prentes Potts what was going on,
he was sleeping

44:09.914 --> 44:15.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a friend's floor and had
missed nearly
a month of school, a common
problem for homeless

44:15.119 --> 44:18.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
students, who are more likely to
fall behind
and drop out.

44:18.923 --> 44:22.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALIK CUSHON: If I'm jumping
from place to
place, I'm not as focused on my
school work.

44:22.727 --> 44:24.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got to think about what I'm
eating for the
night.

44:24.462 --> 44:27.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got to think about how bills
are going to
get paid.

44:27.098 --> 44:28.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I got to think about all this
extra stuff.

44:28.466 --> 44:31.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PRENTES POTTS: It kind of -- it
blew me away.

44:31.536 --> 44:32.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Excuse me.

44:32.637 --> 44:34.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm getting choked up.

44:34.906 --> 44:39.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It blew me away, for the simple
fact is, he
never communicated anything like
that, and

44:39.844 --> 44:41.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his spirits are always so high.

44:41.612 --> 44:44.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You never could tell by looking
at him that
that is what he was going
through.

44:45.016 --> 44:48.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALIK CUSHON: My little sister
and my big
brother.

44:48.419 --> 44:52.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Malik now lives in
housing for
homeless youth, and gets
services from the

44:52.456 --> 44:54.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
school district.

44:54.292 --> 44:59.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Under federal law, districts
must identify
homeless students, those on the
streets, doubled

44:59.330 --> 45:03.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up in motels and shelters, or,
like Malik,
on their own.

45:03.434 --> 45:06.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KERRY WRENICK, Homeless Liaison:
Did you do
the intake with Ms. Marie?

45:06.070 --> 45:08.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Districts must also
have a homeless
liaison.

45:09.006 --> 45:10.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here, that's Kerry Wrenick.

45:10.741 --> 45:16.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her job is to make sure homeless
students
have the support they need to
stay in school.

45:16.280 --> 45:22.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERRY WRENICK: We provide
educational services
to make sure that kids get
enrolled in school,

45:22.153 --> 45:26.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get transportation back and
forth to school,
and then just kind of ensuring
that their

45:26.490 --> 45:28.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
everyday needs are met.

45:28.159 --> 45:31.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Student homelessness
is a widespread
problem.

45:31.295 --> 45:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nearly one in four school
districts in the
U.S. gets federal grant money to
help provide

45:36.267 --> 45:38.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
services for homeless students.

45:38.536 --> 45:40.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that money is stretched
thin.

45:40.738 --> 45:45.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It amounts to about an average
of about $50
per student.

45:45.209 --> 45:48.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the district also counts on
outside help.

45:48.546 --> 45:50.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KERRY WRENICK: Everything in
here is donated.

45:50.281 --> 45:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: This room overflows
with supplies
for homeless students and
families.

45:55.886 --> 45:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is one of the poorest
districts in Kansas.

45:58.856 --> 46:04.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, the school district
expects to
help more than 1,000 homeless
students, nearly

46:04.495 --> 46:07.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
5 percent of the student
population.

46:07.398 --> 46:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Over time, the solution became
clear.

46:09.800 --> 46:13.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To help homeless students, they
needed to
help homeless families.

46:13.804 --> 46:19.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERRY WRENICK: I had to come to
the realization
that I wasn't doing enough, that
although

46:19.744 --> 46:25.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything that I was doing was
well-intended,
I was putting a Band-Aid on
things.

46:25.416 --> 46:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: In 2015, Wrenick put
out a call
for help; 27 groups responded,
nonprofits,

46:32.456 --> 46:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
civic groups, state agencies.

46:34.158 --> 46:37.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESIREE MONIZE, Avenue of Life:
I think the
level of collaboration is very
unusual.

46:37.795 --> 46:43.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Desiree Monize runs
Avenue of
Life, a nonprofit that helps
low-income families

46:43.367 --> 46:45.069 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and oversees this collaboration.

46:45.102 --> 46:49.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: My oldest daughter, her
school had
referred me to here.

46:49.140 --> 46:51.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Here's how it works.

46:51.142 --> 46:55.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once a family is certified by
the school district
as homeless, they can get
assistance through

46:55.780 --> 46:57.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a program called Impact
Wednesday.

46:57.848 --> 47:03.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They meet with a case manager,
take classes
on employment, finance and
housing.

47:03.454 --> 47:08.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In return, there's help finding
a job and
a home.

47:08.092 --> 47:09.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Pay for transportation,
food and clothing.

47:09.894 --> 47:12.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: The program has
taken off.

47:12.296 --> 47:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESIREE MONIZE: We piloted last
year when
the school district opened in
August.

47:16.233 --> 47:22.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the close of year one, we
were able to
house 58 families, permanently
house, and

47:22.273 --> 47:26.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw a 19 percent reduction in
homelessness
within the district by the close
of year one.

47:26.977 --> 47:34.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: And already this
school year,
65 families settled in homes,
including the

47:34.652 --> 47:39.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family of second grader Daisy
Swift (ph),
her fifth grade sister, Cece
Tiebout (ph),

47:39.557 --> 47:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and their mom, Angela Jordan, a
hairdresser.

47:41.692 --> 47:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANGELA JORDAN, Mother: You guys
have everything
together?

47:43.427 --> 47:46.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: What if the school
district program
hadn't been there to help you?

47:46.864 --> 47:48.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGELA JORDAN: We wouldn't be
here right now.

47:48.399 --> 47:50.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't where we would be.

47:50.534 --> 47:54.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We'd probably be -- probably be
on the streets
or living in our car.

47:54.305 --> 47:58.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Avenue of Life found
them this
one-bedroom apartment, covered
the deposit

47:58.843 --> 48:00.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and one month's rent.

48:00.678 --> 48:05.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The girls attend their original
elementary
school, even though it's not
their neighborhood

48:05.182 --> 48:06.917 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

48:06.951 --> 48:10.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Federal law requires districts
to provide
transportation to the school
students started

48:10.387 --> 48:14.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the year in, even if they move
into permanent
housing during the school year.

48:14.425 --> 48:19.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERRY WRENICK: To keep one kid
at one school
for one year, we just have the
best outcome

48:20.030 --> 48:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for their learning and their
potential to
pass and go on to the next
grade.

48:24.301 --> 48:27.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGELA JORDAN: They knew that
that was their
safe zone, you know, that they
could go there

48:27.905 --> 48:31.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and be relaxed and know that
they were fine
there.

48:31.509 --> 48:35.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: These transportation
costs do
add up.

48:35.146 --> 48:38.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two years ago, the district
spent $450,000
to transport homeless students.

48:38.949 --> 48:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANGELA JORDAN: I will see you
guys after school.

48:42.486 --> 48:47.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: But they reduced
that by more
than 20 percent last year by
finding homes

48:47.858 --> 48:49.026 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for families.

48:49.059 --> 48:51.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Do you have cooking stuff
that's in
your hotel?

48:51.428 --> 48:53.164 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: No.

48:53.197 --> 48:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Kansas City's didn't
start out
to rescue homeless families, but
that's just

48:56.367 --> 49:00.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what happened when they focused
on saving
students.

49:00.404 --> 49:02.606 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is your goal for these
kids?

49:02.640 --> 49:06.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KERRY WRENICK: To see them
graduate and end
the cycle of homelessness.

49:06.110 --> 49:12.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, my greatest blessing
would be for
Malik to graduate and him never
enter the

49:12.516 --> 49:14.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
system again.

49:14.285 --> 49:18.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Malik is on track to
become the
first of his siblings to get a
traditional

49:18.155 --> 49:19.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
high school diploma.

49:19.890 --> 49:21.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then his plans include junior
college.

49:21.826 --> 49:25.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALIK CUSHON: Just me
graduating, walking
the stage is going to be a proud
moment for

49:25.329 --> 49:27.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

49:27.298 --> 49:34.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: And a proud moment
for the district,
which found that fighting
student homelessness

49:34.438 --> 49:36.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
takes a full-court press.

49:36.974 --> 49:45.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Kansas City, Kansas, I'm Lisa
Stark of
Education Week for the "PBS
NewsHour."

49:45.449 --> 49:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A remarkable
accomplishment
has taken place now in college
sports.

49:56.093 --> 50:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The women's basketball team at
the University
of Connecticut has now won 100
straight games.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has more.

50:04.869 --> 50:08.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: To put this
streak in context,
the UConn women haven't lost a
basketball

50:08.973 --> 50:11.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
game since 2014.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one has beaten them in over
800 days.

50:13.510 --> 50:18.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And inside that span, they also
won two of
their record four national
championships.

50:18.549 --> 50:22.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One analyst called the UConn
women -- quote
-- "the most dominant program in
the history

50:22.720 --> 50:25.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of college basketball, period."

50:25.289 --> 50:29.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on these amazing women
and their
legendary coach, Geno Auriemma,
I'm joined

50:29.193 --> 50:31.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by USA Today's Christine
Brennan.

50:31.295 --> 50:32.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to the "NewsHour."

50:32.563 --> 50:33.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today:
Great to be
here, William.

50:33.297 --> 50:34.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

50:34.698 --> 50:37.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, explain
this phenomenon
that is these women.

50:37.568 --> 50:39.403 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How do you explain their
dominance?

50:39.436 --> 50:43.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, no one
saw this coming,
if you consider, UConn had won
four national

50:43.440 --> 50:44.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
championships in a row.

50:44.842 --> 50:45.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

50:45.843 --> 50:46.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amazing, in
and of itself.

50:46.844 --> 50:48.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: That's right.

50:48.746 --> 50:53.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the top three players from
that, the seniors
who won all four years, all went
in the WNBA

50:53.684 --> 50:55.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
draft first, second and third.

50:55.319 --> 50:59.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, of all players coming out of
college,
they were the best three.

50:59.056 --> 51:00.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They all left.

51:00.457 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, everyone thought this was
going to be
a down year for UConn.

51:03.227 --> 51:04.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A rebuilding
year.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.331 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Exactly, and
expected a
loss or two early in the season.

51:07.364 --> 51:10.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of a sudden, UConn is
playing the
best teams in the country, and
they're not

51:10.768 --> 51:12.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
losing, and they're winning and
winning and
winning.

51:12.503 --> 51:19.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here we are with this
legendary 100th
victory for a team that is
synonymous with

51:19.143 --> 51:21.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
winning, but nothing like this.

51:21.211 --> 51:25.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think it's really
stunning, because
this was supposed to be, as you
said, the

51:25.282 --> 51:28.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rebuilding year, and they have
just reloaded.

51:28.452 --> 51:34.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, it's just a great
testament to
a program and a coach, Geno
Auriemma, that

51:34.992 --> 51:38.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not only just one of the
greatest in the
history of women's sports and
certainly the

51:38.095 --> 51:41.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
best in women's basketball, but
I think in
all sports, men's or women's.

51:41.765 --> 51:45.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, if you
take the top
three players out of your team
-- and those

51:45.235 --> 51:48.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the top three draft picks,
as you say
-- how do they do this?

51:48.639 --> 51:53.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this -- this obviously is a
testament to
something of the coaching ethos
at that school.

51:53.177 --> 51:54.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Exactly.

51:54.912 --> 51:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Geno Auriemma will always
get three
or four of the best basketball
players in

51:57.848 --> 52:01.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country every year, but you
only have
a team of 12.

52:01.318 --> 52:05.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not like he can pick 100
and have them,
stockpile them somewhere in a
gym in Storrs,

52:05.856 --> 52:08.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Connecticut, and pull them out
when he wants
to.

52:08.058 --> 52:11.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, this is the part, William,
that is just
so amazing to me.

52:11.695 --> 52:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today is the greatest day in
women's sports,
until tomorrow.

52:15.599 --> 52:17.401 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:17.434 --> 52:21.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: By that, I
mean Title IX
working its magic, coaching,
parents caring,

52:21.872 --> 52:25.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the salaries for coaches, the
training for
girls.

52:25.843 --> 52:29.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everyone knows the girl next
door, their niece,
their daughter.

52:29.079 --> 52:33.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see it every day in this
country now,
such a cultural phenomenon,
girls playing

52:33.417 --> 52:36.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sports, and then of course
women's sports
as well in college and onward.

52:36.954 --> 52:41.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to think that, at this most
competitive
time in the history of women's
sports and

52:41.425 --> 52:47.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women's basketball, that you
would have one
team dominating like this, it's
truly amazing

52:47.398 --> 52:51.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me, as a journalist who has
covered sports
all these years, that this is
happening now.

52:51.702 --> 52:54.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What it means is, Geno Auriemma
is such a
great coach.

52:54.505 --> 52:56.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He gets these great players.

52:56.106 --> 52:59.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he puts them into a
system where
he demands that they be
teammates.

52:59.943 --> 53:01.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They cannot be rock stars,
superstars.

53:01.745 --> 53:03.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Yes, they often -- in fact, some
of them become.

53:03.981 --> 53:08.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wants them to be cogs in a
system that
has worked now for several
decades.

53:08.052 --> 53:12.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They buy into it, and they have
championship
after championship to prove it.

53:12.389 --> 53:15.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Lastly, I know
this is an
oft-debated question, but is
this kind of

53:15.592 --> 53:17.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a dynasty good for the sport?

53:17.294 --> 53:18.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have heard it argued both
ways.

53:18.896 --> 53:22.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, these women blow their
teammates away
-- their opponents, largely.

53:22.733 --> 53:24.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It this good for women's
basketball?

53:24.101 --> 53:25.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: I think it's
both good
and bad.

53:25.536 --> 53:28.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One the one hand, dynasties are
fun.

53:28.405 --> 53:30.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We just went through the New
England Patriots.

53:30.507 --> 53:32.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People are hoping the Cubs will
become a dynasty.

53:32.176 --> 53:35.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, you talk to a Yankee
fan, they
love that over the years.

53:35.879 --> 53:38.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As much as people hate the
Yankees, people
love the Yankees.

53:38.082 --> 53:43.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think we're into dynasties
and winning,
Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, et
cetera.

53:43.087 --> 53:45.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's certainly a
headline always
in sports.

53:45.322 --> 53:47.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, from that aspect, I
think it's a good
thing.

53:47.758 --> 53:51.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bad part is, it's like, OK,
this is women's
basketball?

53:51.962 --> 53:53.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where is the rivalry?

53:53.430 --> 53:55.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where is the competition?

53:55.165 --> 53:59.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there is concern --
and I know
I have certainly mentioned it --
that, OK,

53:59.203 --> 54:03.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again, at this most competitive
time in the
history of women's sports, how
is it possible

54:03.207 --> 54:05.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that one team dominates like
this?

54:05.109 --> 54:06.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does it say about the
competition?

54:06.677 --> 54:08.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does it say about the other
coaches?

54:08.512 --> 54:13.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My sense is that UConn may have
a couple more
really great years, but the
history tells

54:13.750 --> 54:16.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us and our culture tells us they
can't keep
this up.

54:16.954 --> 54:20.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Marylands, and the
Baylors, and the
Notre Dames are going to come on
like gangbusters

54:20.858 --> 54:22.059 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a few years.

54:22.092 --> 54:23.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Christine
Brennan, thank
you so much.

54:23.694 --> 54:25.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Thank you,
William.

54:25.395 --> 54:28.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will take
it as a great
day for women athletes
everywhere.

54:28.432 --> 54:30.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

54:30.267 --> 54:31.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:31.435 --> 54:33.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow
evening.

54:34.004 --> 54:44.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.
