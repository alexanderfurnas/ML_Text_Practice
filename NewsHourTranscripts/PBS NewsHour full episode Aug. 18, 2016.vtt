01:17.844 --> 01:24.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some 1,500 firefighters are

01:29.489 --> 01:34.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's already charred more than

WOODRUFF: Nearly 18,000
detainees have died
in Syrian government prisons
since that country's

01:41.835 --> 01:44.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
uprising began back in 2011.

01:44.104 --> 01:48.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's according to a new report
out today
from Amnesty International.

01:48.575 --> 01:54.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The group interviewed abuse
survivors who
described rampant torture,
disease, and death

01:54.114 --> 01:58.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the detention centers run by
Syria's intelligence
agencies.

01:58.385 --> 02:03.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amnesty warned the actual death
toll is likely
much higher, since thousands of
detainees

02:03.890 --> 02:05.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disappeared while in custody.

SREENIVASAN: The United Nations
has admitted
for the first time to playing a
role in Haiti's

02:10.697 --> 02:12.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
initial choler outbreak.

02:12.733 --> 02:16.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some 10,000 people died, and
hundreds of thousands
more were sickened.

02:16.603 --> 02:21.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The disease is believed to have
spread in
2010 while U.N. peacekeeping
troops from Nepal,

02:21.708 --> 02:26.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where cholera is endemic, were
helping with
the relief effort after the
devastating earthquake.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke with
journalist
Jonathan Katz live on Facebook,
who broke

02:30.751 --> 02:32.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this story.

02:32.552 --> 02:35.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the author of the book "The
Big truck
That Went By: How the World Came
to Save Haiti

02:35.222 --> 02:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Left Behind a Disaster".

02:36.757 --> 02:40.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's also been covering the
cholera epidemic
in Haiti.

02:40.093 --> 02:44.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of our Facebook commentators
asked, "what
took the U.N. so long to admit
its role?"

02:44.164 --> 02:45.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

02:45.999 --> 02:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN KATZ, JOURNALIST: The
answer is that
nobody likes admitting when
they're wrong,

02:48.769 --> 02:52.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially when admitting that
you're wrong
can cost you billions of dollars
and your

02:52.939 --> 02:54.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

02:54.107 --> 02:58.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they were hoping that
this could go
away.

02:58.111 --> 03:02.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a perception at the
beginning when
cholera first broke out, again,
six years

03:02.449 --> 03:08.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, that sanitation was bad and
Haiti, Haiti's
a country that's had lots of
different kinds

03:08.422 --> 03:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of diseases in the past and
there was this
disaster that, of course, we now
know had

03:12.492 --> 03:16.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nothing to do with it but it was
the enormous
disaster that gotten the world's
attention

03:16.129 --> 03:17.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nine months before.

03:17.998 --> 03:21.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think the U.N. really felt
that it could
sort of skate by on these
expectations that

03:21.968 --> 03:27.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people that Haiti is just sort
of a dirty
disease place and diseases just
happened and

03:27.240 --> 03:28.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they thought they would get away
with it.

03:49.396 --> 03:55.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he also accused followers of

another yesterday.

04:35.842 --> 04:40.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

of course, sought to retain
maximum leverage

04:52.325 --> 04:54.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until after American citizens
were released.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was our top priority.

04:56.096 --> 04:57.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This wasn't a case of ransom.

04:57.864 --> 05:04.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Couple of hours, we probably had

09:07.046 --> 09:11.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANGHAM: In the most damaged
areas, only
about one out of every eight
homes is covered

09:11.918 --> 09:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by flood insurance, because
these areas weren't
considered likely to flood.

gotten from here at it's worst
to up here.

09:20.460 --> 09:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's why no one was
expecting it.

09:21.795 --> 09:23.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they're not going to have
flood insurance.

09:23.863 --> 09:25.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

I'm joined now by the state's
lieutenant governor,

09:33.640 --> 09:35.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Billy Nungesser.

09:35.542 --> 09:38.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He joins us from Louisiana
Public Broadcasting
in Baton Rouge, where many of
our colleagues

09:38.978 --> 09:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there have also been flooded out
of their
homes.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lieutenant Governor, welcome.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wonder if you would just tell
us, how are
things today in Louisiana?

09:45.718 --> 09:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLY NUNGESSER, LOUISIANA LT.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOVERNOR: Well, we're still
recovering.

09:49.088 --> 09:53.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We still got areas where the
water is flowing
south that will continue to have
water for

09:54.027 --> 09:59.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
several more days, and hopefully
we can get
a break in the weather and start
to dry out.

09:59.365 --> 10:01.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I heard you mention about
the flood insurance.

10:01.668 --> 10:07.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's going to be an ongoing
problem because
many areas, this is an
historical flood, outside

10:07.440 --> 10:11.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the flood areas, they didn't
have flood
insurance, and that's going to
be a problem

10:11.945 --> 10:13.146 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moving forward.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRANGHAM: Well, what is going to
happen to
those people?

10:15.148 --> 10:20.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you go back to your house and
it's severely
damaged or destroyed, and you
don't have insurance

10:20.186 --> 10:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cover that, what are those
people supposed
to do?

10:23.022 --> 10:29.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NUNGESSER: Well, FEMA will give
up to $33,000
if you weren't in a flood zone
and had no

10:29.295 --> 10:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurance, but the average --
that's the maximum
you can get.

10:32.665 --> 10:35.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The average is about $7,500.

10:35.869 --> 10:40.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to have to make up
that difference
with volunteers and the giving
of people from

10:40.273 --> 10:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all over the country working
with nonprofits
to help make those people back
in their house

10:45.879 --> 10:47.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and make them whole.

10:47.680 --> 10:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of elderly people that had
never flooded,
lived in a house 40 or 50 years,
didn't see

10:53.152 --> 10:55.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the need or couldn't afford the
flood insurance.

10:55.922 --> 10:59.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, those are -- those are the
ones that we're
really concerned about.

10:59.058 --> 11:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANGHAM: I mean, even if people
were to get
up to $30,000, do you think
that's enough

11:03.596 --> 11:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to cover people's rebuilding,
hotels, time
off work?

11:08.034 --> 11:10.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUNGESSER: Absolutely not.

11:10.803 --> 11:16.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why we're working through
volunteer
groups, United Way, Red Cross, a
lot of the

11:16.910 --> 11:22.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rebuilding groups that were here
after Katrina
will be coming back to help gut
those homes

11:22.415 --> 11:24.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and make them whole.

11:24.183 --> 11:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had groups from all over the
country that
are already starting in
Louisiana to help

11:28.755 --> 11:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out in the rebuilding effort.

11:30.757 --> 11:35.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANGHAM: A lot of people
acknowledged the
flood maps that we use to
determine where's

11:35.528 --> 11:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the risky place to build and
where isn't,
but those maps are really
outdated.

11:39.799 --> 11:42.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now, people have to start
rebuilding their
homes.

11:42.135 --> 11:46.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, what do you tell people
if they come
to you and they say, Lieutenant
Governor,

11:46.105 --> 11:47.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should I be building here?

11:47.340 --> 11:48.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Should I build it higher?

11:48.374 --> 11:49.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Should I build it differently?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you say to people?

11:51.044 --> 11:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NUNGESSER: Well, it absolutely
should be built
higher.

11:54.180 --> 11:59.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, we see a lot of
these rivers
have been silted in over the
years, so there

11:59.285 --> 12:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not as much storage capacity
in those rivers
and canals.

12:03.556 --> 12:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, with sea rise and with the
coastal erosion,
even the coastal Louisiana for
hurricanes,

12:10.830 --> 12:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to have to really
fast track our
coastal restoration.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you're right.

12:15.201 --> 12:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the same thing that makes
Louisiana special.

12:18.771 --> 12:21.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the people that pitch in to
help rebuild.

12:21.975 --> 12:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a special place to live,
and that's one
of the risks of living here.

12:25.345 --> 12:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But absolutely, every one that
rebuilds, as
they did along the coast, needs
to rebuild

12:30.516 --> 12:32.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at a high elevation.

12:32.285 --> 12:35.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANGHAM: More broadly, are you
getting the
help you need from the federal
government

12:35.555 --> 12:37.323 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now?

12:37.357 --> 12:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NUNGESSER: I'm really -- you
know, I have
been through five hurricanes and
the oil spill

12:41.494 --> 12:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a parish president, and we
worked through
a lot of challenging times with
FEMA.

12:46.899 --> 12:52.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the team on the ground here
in Louisiana
has been with us every day,
traveling with

12:52.639 --> 12:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the governor and addressing all
the needs,
and we've really got a great
team working

12:57.143 --> 13:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the ground with FEMA and I
have seen great
cooperation.

13:01.047 --> 13:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We still got some challenges
ahead, but I'm
very impressed with the way
things have been

13:05.585 --> 13:11.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
handled thus far with this
disaster, especially
being spread out over 20
parishes.

13:11.090 --> 13:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, a hurricane hits one
corner of our
state and we can concentrate all
our efforts

13:16.029 --> 13:17.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that area.

13:17.830 --> 13:22.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To deliver response with the
National Guard
and the police, volunteers,
firefighters,

13:22.502 --> 13:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at 20 parishes at one time has
really been
a massive undertaking and
they've done a great

13:28.307 --> 13:30.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

13:30.076 --> 13:32.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRANGHAM: You mentioned the
importance of
having local volunteer and
charity groups

13:32.679 --> 13:34.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
helping out.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If our viewers were interested
in trying to
lend a hand themselves, where
would you steer

13:37.950 --> 13:38.918 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them?

13:38.951 --> 13:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where would you direct them?

13:40.720 --> 13:46.392 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
NUNGESSER:
VolunteerLouisiana.gov is where
we're signing up all the
volunteers and it's

13:46.426 --> 13:52.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way to check on and have your
group come
in and help, or the Red Cross is
accepting

13:52.432 --> 13:54.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
donations.

13:54.233 --> 13:58.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are manning our shelters
and will take
them over from the volunteers
this week.

13:58.805 --> 14:04.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Red Cross has been a great
partner here
in Louisiana and continue to run
those shelters,

14:04.110 --> 14:07.013 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they're going to be feeding
a lot of people.

14:07.046 --> 14:12.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we are asking for all the
help you can
give, and the country has been
very gracious

14:12.285 --> 14:13.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the past.

14:13.286 --> 14:14.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRANGHAM: All right.

14:15.021 --> 14:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lieutenant Governor, thank you

14:57.630 --> 15:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENTIAL
NOMINEE: I
am the least racist person.

15:01.768 --> 15:03.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DESJARDINS: The turns.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HILLARY CLINTON (D),
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:
I never sent or received any
material marked

15:05.872 --> 15:07.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
classified.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESJARDINS: And the endless
speculation around
this strange campaign year.

15:11.210 --> 15:16.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the race is coming in focus
-- focus
on just a handful of states.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLINTON: We've had an incredible
week here
in Pennsylvania.

15:19.619 --> 15:22.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I think I'm going to win
Pennsylvania
easily.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLINTON: Thank you, Northern
Virginia!

15:24.557 --> 15:27.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: We're going to be back in
Virginia
a lot.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to win Virginia.

15:28.928 --> 15:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESJARDINS: And now, 2016
brought another
surprise, a fast-changing map.

15:34.233 --> 15:40.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These were the expected
battlegrounds earlier
this year, eleven key swing-ish
states.

15:40.206 --> 15:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in recent weeks, five of
those -- Colorado,
Wisconsin, Michigan,
Pennsylvania and Virginia

15:46.312 --> 15:51.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- have moved away from
contention in Democrats'
direction.

15:51.350 --> 15:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Polls show Hillary Clinton ahead
the by a
whopping 9 to 15 points in all
five.

15:56.889 --> 16:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's so confident in five
states, Colorado
and Virginia that she stopped
advertising

16:01.894 --> 16:03.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
there for now.

16:03.296 --> 16:07.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Instead, Team Clinton is
shifting plans, hoping
to expand their map.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.569 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), VICE
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:
We're not in North Carolina by
accident.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're here because we're going
to win North
Carolina.

16:13.606 --> 16:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESJARDINS: Clinton and Kaine
are going on
attack, after states that voted
for Romney

16:18.377 --> 16:24.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2012, like North Carolina and
even more
solid Republican territory like
Georgia and

16:24.450 --> 16:25.751 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Arizona.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton is expanding her staff
in both states.

16:28.988 --> 16:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those states have seen major
growth around
large cities and in their
Hispanic population,

16:34.260 --> 16:37.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trends that Democrats believe
favor them long
term.

16:37.396 --> 16:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one more new and eye-popping
state of
the battleground map, Utah.

16:42.735 --> 16:48.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Beehive State has voted
Republican for
almost 50 years but in a close
race, its six

16:48.841 --> 16:50.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
electoral votes could matter.

16:51.010 --> 16:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump said this just last
week.

16:53.312 --> 16:55.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRUMP: I'm having a tremendous
problem in
Utah.

16:55.948 --> 16:59.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Utah's a different place, and I
don't know
if -- is anybody here from Utah?

16:59.418 --> 17:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESJARDINS: You know who lives
in Utah, Mitt
Romney, former nominee and
outspoken Trump

17:04.924 --> 17:06.559 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
critic.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MITT ROMNEY (R), FORMER
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE:
Donald Trump is a phony, a
fraud.

17:08.327 --> 17:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESJARDINS: He reflects Mormons'
discomfort
with Trump's scrutiny of another
religious

17:11.297 --> 17:13.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
minority, Muslims.

17:13.532 --> 17:18.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is still competitive in
some key states
like Florida and Ohio and he's
far in front

17:18.337 --> 17:20.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Indiana.

17:20.206 --> 17:25.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he has two and a half months
until Election
Day to shift the rest of the map
his direction.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

17:26.879 --> 17:30.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins us now
as we dig
a little deeper into what's
going on in these

17:30.449 --> 17:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crucial battleground states.

17:32.718 --> 17:39.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also joining us: Karen Kasler,
she's statehouse
bureau chief with Ohio Public
Radio and TV.

17:39.859 --> 17:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Adam smith, he's political
editor for
Florida's "Tampa Bay Times".

17:44.630 --> 17:48.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He joins us from our PBS station
WEDU.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you.

17:50.870 --> 17:53.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Adam Smith, let me start with
you in Florida.

17:53.272 --> 17:57.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, Hillary Clinton has a
very slightly
-- slight lead there but it's
close.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does it feel like?

17:59.245 --> 18:03.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What do you see the two
candidates' strengths
and weaknesses right now?

18:03.249 --> 18:07.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ADAM SMITH, TAMPA BAY TIMES:
Well, Florida's
always a nail biter state.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it's -- the safe bet is it's
going to
be close.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It usually is.

18:11.657 --> 18:15.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Both candidates are here
virtually every week,
sometimes within a couple of
days of each

18:15.661 --> 18:17.396 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
other.

18:17.430 --> 18:22.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We've had a lot of pro-Hillary
ads and some
pro-Trump ads and now, Trump is
just about

18:22.702 --> 18:25.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to start advertising any day
now.

18:25.271 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Karen Kasler, what
about Ohio?

18:28.107 --> 18:31.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is another state where it's
very close,
as we just heard in Lisa's
report.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does it feel like to you
there?

18:33.779 --> 18:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN KASLER, OHIO PUBLIC RADIO
AND TV: Well,
the polls are showing between
four and five

18:37.683 --> 18:38.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
points.

18:38.684 --> 18:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is leading.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, we're seeing a lot of
advertising
for Clinton.

18:43.522 --> 18:47.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has been popular here in
Ohio and, in
fact, Democrats have won Ohio in
the last

18:47.626 --> 18:49.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
two presidential elections.

18:49.495 --> 18:51.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it depends on where you live
I think.

18:51.330 --> 18:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the cities, you're seeing a
lot of Hillary
Clinton ads and offices popping
up, whereas

18:55.801 --> 19:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump seems to be doing a lot of
campaigning
in other areas of the state
where there aren't

19:00.873 --> 19:02.742 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
urban areas.

19:02.775 --> 19:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, in Youngstown,
which is right
on the border with West Virginia
and Pennsylvania,

19:06.245 --> 19:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's done a lot of campaigning,
did his foreign
policy speech earlier this week
there.

19:09.982 --> 19:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's opened up 15 so-called
victory offices
in Ohio, whereas Clinton had a
leg up on that.

19:16.322 --> 19:18.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has close to two dozen
offices.

19:18.824 --> 19:23.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the organizations are out
there starting
to work, but Hillary Clinton I
think has an

19:23.596 --> 19:25.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
edge in terms of the
organization.

19:25.731 --> 19:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And right now, in the polls, she
has an edge
as well.

19:27.566 --> 19:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: And, Adam, let me come
back to you
on that.

19:30.302 --> 19:35.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you see in Florida in
terms of organization,
in terms of what these two
campaigns have

19:35.741 --> 19:37.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going for them on the ground?

19:37.443 --> 19:40.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SMITH: Considerably more
organization on Clinton's
side.

19:40.813 --> 19:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has about 20 offices -- 19
or 20 offices
open.

19:44.116 --> 19:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As of today, Donald Trump has
one headquarters
in Sarasota.

19:47.186 --> 19:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're talking about opening up
a couple
of dozen more within the next
couple of weeks,

19:51.657 --> 19:53.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but that hasn't happened yet.

19:53.492 --> 19:59.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think like in a lot of states,
the Trump
campaign is really all about
these big rallies.

19:59.231 --> 20:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's sort of what Trump
himself emphasizes.

20:01.067 --> 20:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, yes, it's true, they point
at rallies
where they draw 10,000, 15,000
people, and

20:07.773 --> 20:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suggest that shows that the
energy is on their
side.

20:10.776 --> 20:15.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the question a lot of
Republicans
and Democrats ask is, with those
people going

20:15.448 --> 20:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the rallies, they don't
need to be pushed
out, that a lot of people are
worried on the

20:20.786 --> 20:25.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican side that he needs to
do something
to bolster the ground game and
push people

20:25.357 --> 20:27.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to the polls that aren't
automatically likely
to go.

20:27.893 --> 20:32.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins, we're
talking about
two of the states where it's
competitive.

20:32.698 --> 20:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is ahead in some
of the other
battleground states.

20:35.301 --> 20:37.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You describe, what does Donald
Trump need
to do?

20:37.736 --> 20:39.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been talking to people
inside his
organization.

20:39.705 --> 20:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DESJARDINS: These are the two
juggernaut states
for sure, Florida and Ohio, he
absolutely

20:44.310 --> 20:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needs to win those two states
and also Pennsylvania
is considered the third leg on
that critical

20:50.749 --> 20:52.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stool for him.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, those are the three states
with the most
electoral votes.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All of them are key for that
reason.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he can technically lose one
of them.

20:59.191 --> 21:01.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's behind in Pennsylvania by
double digits
right now.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If he does (INAUDIBLE) though,
his path is
even harder.

21:04.730 --> 21:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he loses any of the three
states like Pennsylvania,
he has to win two others
somewhere else like

21:10.002 --> 21:11.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Virginia and Colorado.

21:12.004 --> 21:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, these three states have
twice the importance
as others and his path gets
smaller and smaller

21:16.642 --> 21:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as these particular states slip
away or come
toward him.

21:20.146 --> 21:25.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Karen Kasler, you were
saying you
see more evidence of Hillary
Clinton's organization

21:25.084 --> 21:26.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Ohio.

21:27.019 --> 21:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Donald Trump wants to catch
up in the next
80-some odd days, what does he
need to do

21:32.358 --> 21:35.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the perspective of the
Republicans you're
talking to right now?

21:35.461 --> 21:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KASLER: Well, it seems like he's
got to win
over the Republicans that I'm
talking to because

21:40.599 --> 21:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you may recall, Governor John
Kasich was
the last one man standing
against Donald Trump

21:45.804 --> 21:46.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the presidential contest.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was the last one to drop out.

21:48.541 --> 21:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has yet to endorse Donald
Trump and has
indicated he's not going to.

21:52.545 --> 21:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't go to the RNC in
Cleveland, his
home state, because of his
concerns about

21:57.483 --> 21:58.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

21:58.651 --> 22:01.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are other Republican
leaders who feel
similarly.

22:01.387 --> 22:05.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're concerned about the rest
of the ticket,
including Senator Rob Portman
who is up for

22:05.558 --> 22:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election, but they are really
very worried
about Donald Trump being at the
top of the

22:10.896 --> 22:12.731 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ticket.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, you hear a lot of
language about I'm
going to support the nominee but
not necessarily

22:15.768 --> 22:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm going to campaign with
Donald Trump.

22:17.536 --> 22:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for Donald Trump to win, he
certainly
would have to win over some of
those people

22:22.708 --> 22:27.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who may not be won over-able,
and also, he
needs to win a key area of the
state, and

22:28.013 --> 22:29.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's central Ohio.

22:29.315 --> 22:32.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Central Ohio is really the
battleground,
I think in Ohio.

22:32.384 --> 22:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Central Ohio, the area around
Columbus where
I am is Democratic, but then the
counties

22:36.488 --> 22:38.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
surrounding it are very
Republican.

22:38.624 --> 22:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, I think that's going to
be really
the area that is going to decide
the state

22:41.827 --> 22:43.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the election coming up.

22:43.662 --> 22:46.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Adam Smith, I saw you
nodding your
heard when Karen was speaking
about Republican

22:46.932 --> 22:48.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
officeholders in Ohio.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What about in Florida?

22:50.436 --> 22:53.405 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What kind of support does Donald
Trump have
going for him in Florida?

22:53.439 --> 22:57.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SMITH: Well, it just sounds so
similar to
what I hear from most Republican
officers

22:57.810 --> 23:02.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Florida where they will talk
about the
nominee, they'll talk about
beating Hillary

23:02.648 --> 23:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, but most of them don't
want to utter
those two words "Donald Trump"
for whatever

23:06.385 --> 23:08.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reason.

23:08.187 --> 23:12.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The exception is our governor,
Governor Rick
Scott, unlike Kasich is a big
Trump guy.

23:12.157 --> 23:13.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's leading his super PAC.

23:13.926 --> 23:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's enthusiastic and out there
for Trump,
but Rick Scott maybe doesn't
have quite the

23:21.066 --> 23:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
juice that some other people do.

23:23.435 --> 23:25.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not the most popular
governor.

23:25.437 --> 23:28.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
talking to the
Trump people, again, do you get
the sense

23:28.807 --> 23:32.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are looking to other
Republicans to climb
on board?

23:32.711 --> 23:35.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are they thinking they will have
to do this
on their own?

23:35.114 --> 23:38.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DESJARDINS: They admit they have
two very
big jobs right now.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One is to bring all the
Republicans on board.

23:40.286 --> 23:42.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they talk about is how
happy they are
with Mike Pence.

23:42.988 --> 23:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They think Mike Pence is the key
to doing
that.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we know that daily he has
been reaching
out to these --

23:48.093 --> 23:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Indiana governor.

23:49.528 --> 23:51.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DESJARDINS: The Indiana
governor, now the
vice presidential nominee.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other job they have is to
expand their
base.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not just a Donald Trump
question.

23:55.768 --> 23:59.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a bigger question fort
Republicans
in general, and we've seen
Donald Trump start

23:59.838 --> 24:03.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do that more seriously this
week as he
gave a speech talking about how
he believes

24:03.976 --> 24:05.644 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
he can appeal to
African-Americans.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to see if that actually
moves the
dial or not.

24:08.414 --> 24:12.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's got to grow past
Republicans and
he also has to grow within
Republicans.

24:12.785 --> 24:17.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: You and I were talking
earlier today
about the demographic challenges
the Republican

24:17.289 --> 24:18.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ticket faces in this election.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DESJARDINS: Right.

24:20.859 --> 24:23.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a key election to watch
not just this
year but perhaps for two or
three cycles down

24:23.929 --> 24:25.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the road.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's look at the states we talk
about that
are shifting a little bit.

24:27.199 --> 24:31.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arizona on the map, Georgia on
the map, what
do those states have in common?

24:31.437 --> 24:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the fastest growing
Hispanic populations
in this country.

24:35.341 --> 24:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another problem for Republicans,
people are
moving to the cities.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're moving away from small
towns.

24:39.978 --> 24:43.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's one of the great
uncovered stories
right now, our small towns are
dying.

24:43.615 --> 24:48.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a problem because that's
a big part
of the Republican base, as we
get more urban.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That so far has benefited
Democrats.

24:50.255 --> 24:55.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODRUFF: Pick up on that, Karen
Kasler, and
talk also about the kind of
enthusiasm you

24:55.227 --> 24:58.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see for these two candidates,
for Hillary
Clinton versus Donald Trump.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you read that?

25:00.566 --> 25:04.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KASLER: Well, the rallies that
have happened
here have been pretty
enthusiastic.

25:04.937 --> 25:09.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton was here in
Columbus just
a couple of days after accepting
the nomination

25:09.375 --> 25:11.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the Democratic National
Convention.

25:11.276 --> 25:14.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She brought out 5,000 people in
the middle
of the heat.

25:14.980 --> 25:20.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump have done several
rallies in
Ohio that have been
multi-thousand attendees.

25:20.285 --> 25:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I want to add one other
thing in terms
of demographics -- I think in
Ohio, the Trump

25:24.423 --> 25:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters -- the Trump campaign is
targeting
voters who are these
blue-collar, unemployed

25:32.364 --> 25:39.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or underemployed or frustrated
voters, people
who are in the Youngstown area,
in areas around

25:39.638 --> 25:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Toledo, in heavy manufacturing
areas, people
who are concerned about the
economy because

25:44.610 --> 25:46.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of trade.

25:46.445 --> 25:52.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We've seen the numbers of union
members who
have voted for Republicans
actually rise over

25:52.317 --> 25:55.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last 20 years because of
their concerns
about trade.

25:55.554 --> 25:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that's one area the
Trump campaign
targets, when he comes to Ohio,
he's been

25:59.858 --> 26:01.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to those areas.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And other than, he has been in
Columbus, but
he's going to Youngstown.

26:04.496 --> 26:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been going to that part of
the state
because I think he's very
interested in trying

26:07.800 --> 26:12.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to lure in those blue-collar and
possibly
union workers who are very
concerned.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOODRUFF: What about that, Adam
Smith, finally
to you?

26:14.840 --> 26:21.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is that -- is that a rich target
of -- an
area of opportunity for Donald
Trump in Florida?

26:21.647 --> 26:27.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SMITH: Well, yes, and just as
Columbus is
the swing area of Ohio, the I-4
corridor going

26:27.119 --> 26:32.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between Tampa Bay and Daytona
Beach, that's
our swing area here, and
particularly the

26:32.658 --> 26:37.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rule the rule of thumb in
Florida is whoever
wins Tampa Bay generally wins
statewide.

26:37.229 --> 26:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is very strong in a lot of
Tampa Bay
where there are a lot of
independent voters,

26:41.433 --> 26:46.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of voters that are fed up
with both
parties and we've seen some
polling for some

26:46.205 --> 26:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
congressional districts and
legislative districts
in swing districts where Donald
Trump is surprisingly

26:51.610 --> 26:57.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong, and he's not the drag on
the bottom
end of the ticket that in some
districts that

26:57.449 --> 26:59.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of people have thought he
would be at
all.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

Aleppo's daily cry of death.

31:35.227 --> 31:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: It's hard not tore
be moved by
images like that, but some
pictures capture

31:41.199 --> 31:43.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the world's attention more than
others.

31:43.568 --> 31:47.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin with an image that
emerged last night
from the frantic attempts to
rescue people

31:47.973 --> 31:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
caught in the aftermath of air
strikes.

31:51.510 --> 31:55.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And again, another warning: some
images in
this story may disturb some
viewers.

31:55.881 --> 31:57.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

31:57.082 --> 32:00.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Air strikes are
Aleppo's terrible
routine.

32:00.385 --> 32:03.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This one hit an apartment a
building in the
city's rebel-held area.

32:03.922 --> 32:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amateur video captured the
frantic scramble
to save lives amid horror.

32:08.126 --> 32:12.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, a boy, pulled from the
rubble, sits
in an ambulance.

32:12.330 --> 32:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's dazed, bloodied, covered in
dust.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He wipes his face.

32:17.302 --> 32:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His name: Omran Daqneesh.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Age five.

32:20.238 --> 32:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He survived without major
injuries.

32:21.673 --> 32:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So did his parents and three
young siblings.

32:24.209 --> 32:30.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost immediately, his image
swept across
social media worldwide, making
Omran the latest

32:30.048 --> 32:33.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
symbol of heartbreak in the
now-five year
old conflict.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But do such images spark action?

32:35.821 --> 32:37.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
If so, when?

32:37.989 --> 32:39.524 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And how?

32:39.558 --> 32:43.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, as the refugee crisis
swelled,
one photo came to embody the
tragedy.

32:43.962 --> 32:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A drowned, three-year-old Syrian
boy, pictured
lying face down on a Turkish
beach.

32:50.602 --> 32:56.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It galvanized European leaders
to review how
they take in refugees and
asylum-seekers.

32:56.741 --> 32:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Other instances had less impact.

32:58.143 --> 33:03.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2012, a documentary about
Ugandan war-lord
Joseph Kony went viral.

33:03.949 --> 33:09.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It detailed the brutal tactics
of his "Lord's
Resistance Army," and the
group's use of child

33:09.054 --> 33:10.755 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
soldiers.

33:10.789 --> 33:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the hashtags "Kony 2012"
and "Stop Kony,"
it sparked global calls for his
arrest.

33:16.061 --> 33:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But four years later, Kony
reportedly remains
at large.

33:20.198 --> 33:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in April 2014, the Islamist
group Boko
Haram seized more than 270 girls
from their

33:26.404 --> 33:29.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
school in northeast Nigeria.

33:29.908 --> 33:34.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It led to the "Bring Back Our
Girls" campaign,
repeated and circulated by
prominent figures

33:35.013 --> 33:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like first lady Michelle Obama.

33:37.048 --> 33:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this week, new video from
Boko Haram surfaced
showing dozens of the girls
still in captivity,

33:42.687 --> 33:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more than two years later.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

33:46.391 --> 33:49.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: We take a closer
look at the
power of these images with Anne
Barnard, "The

33:49.427 --> 33:53.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York Times" Beirut bureau
chief, and Susan
Moeller, she is a professor in
the Philip

33:53.765 --> 33:56.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Merrill College of Journalism at
the University
of Maryland.

33:56.268 --> 34:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's also author of "Compassion

How the Media Sell Disease,
Famine, War and

Death."

34:02.240 --> 34:04.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Anne, I want to start with you.

34:04.042 --> 34:08.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every day on social media, there
are more
graphic, more violent pictures
of little children

34:08.747 --> 34:10.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than this.

34:10.115 --> 34:11.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is it about this image of
the little
Omran that connected?

34:11.783 --> 34:17.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD, THE NEW YORK
TIMES: Well, you
know, speaking for myself, I see
pictures

34:17.589 --> 34:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are literally gruesome
beyond belief,
that are hard to process
mentally, and they

34:24.596 --> 34:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are painful and compelling in
one way.

34:27.799 --> 34:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this picture resonated in
some ways because
it's easier to connect to, it's
a child in

34:34.706 --> 34:36.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
distress.

34:36.708 --> 34:42.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So many of the -- it's almost
ineffortable
to explain why but some of the
gestures he

34:42.113 --> 34:45.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
made could easily remind you of
a child you've
known.

34:45.216 --> 34:51.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the -- you know, his
clothing, he
was wearing a shirt with a
Nickelodeon character

34:51.856 --> 34:53.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on it.

34:53.692 --> 35:00.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's like with Alan
Kurdi, who's body
was -- he was dead but his body
was intact

35:00.165 --> 35:05.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and it reminded people, you
know, of a child
sleeping on a beach.

35:05.537 --> 35:12.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think in a way that's more
shareable
in a social media age than a
really gruesome

35:12.544 --> 35:13.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
picture of death.

35:13.878 --> 35:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Susan, why did this
picture pop?

35:17.382 --> 35:19.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why did it get around the world
in 20 seconds?

35:19.484 --> 35:21.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN MOELLER, INTERNATIONAL
CENTER FOR MEDIA
AND THE PUBLIC AGENDA: I think
one of the

35:21.619 --> 35:24.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reasons is because the child is
looking at
us.

35:24.756 --> 35:34.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with a blank stare, where
often we see
on the news and we see in relief
aid agency

35:34.799 --> 35:39.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with a blank stare, where
often we see
on the news and we see in relief
aid agency

35:39.971 --> 35:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comment that, you know, help
this child, and
the child is looking at us, and
it almost

35:45.143 --> 35:47.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seems like the child is asking
us to do something.

35:47.512 --> 35:55.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Omran was also that same
pleading character.

35:55.520 --> 36:02.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: So, Anne, what
impacts do these
images have the potential to
yield?

36:02.560 --> 36:05.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARNARD: Well, you know, that's
a mixed bag.

36:05.964 --> 36:11.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We can certainly think of
examples in history
like the famous picture of the
girl burned

36:11.269 --> 36:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by napalm by the U.S. military
in Vietnam,
that arguably changed public
opinion and maybe

36:18.443 --> 36:21.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
moved policy ultimately.

36:21.279 --> 36:28.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, on the other hand, many
images go
viral or touch people for a
moment and then

36:28.553 --> 36:30.388 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
people move on.

36:30.422 --> 36:37.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, certainly, among
Syrians on all
sides of the conflict, there is
an increasing

36:37.195 --> 36:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mix of anger that comes up when
people express
sympathy about an image like
this because

36:41.766 --> 36:43.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's, like, well, really?

36:44.002 --> 36:47.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You only just notice now that
this is happening
after five years?

36:47.539 --> 36:53.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it happened enough times
without anything
changing that people's
expectations are really

36:53.078 --> 36:54.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
low.

36:54.846 --> 36:59.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Susan, is it a
potential for
a government policy shift or
people moved

36:59.717 --> 37:01.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a certain level?

37:01.619 --> 37:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOELLER: As Anne suggests that
normally government
policy doesn't shift with
images.

37:07.826 --> 37:12.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There may be rhetoric, there may
be a press
conference held, there maybe
sympathy expressed,

37:12.697 --> 37:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but you don't typically get
change.

37:15.366 --> 37:22.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you do get is attention,
and with enough
attention, then you may get
reaction that

37:22.707 --> 37:24.075 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has an effect.

37:24.109 --> 37:26.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Anne, are people
motivated to
take action?

37:27.011 --> 37:32.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are there cases where it might
not be a government
policy shift but individuals
mobilize to such

37:32.917 --> 37:35.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an extent that there is
impactful change?

37:35.453 --> 37:41.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNARD: Well, I certainly have
had many people
ask me, how can I help people
like this?

37:41.559 --> 37:47.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What organizations are doing
work that can
help civilians caught in this
conflict?

37:47.932 --> 37:52.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other advocacy groups are
jumping on this
to say, well, this is -- enough
is enough,

37:52.670 --> 37:59.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's time to take more robust
action to stop
these air strikes by the
Russians and the

37:59.744 --> 38:01.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syrian government.

38:01.146 --> 38:08.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others are, you know, saying,
well, there
is not an easy answer.

38:08.186 --> 38:12.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some people don't find this a
reason to change
U.S. policy.

38:12.190 --> 38:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it depends on the person.

38:14.058 --> 38:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some reactions are political,
some are more
humanitarian, but I do think a
lot of people

38:20.698 --> 38:25.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felt it like a punch in the gut,
even I did
after all this time covering the
conflict.

38:25.170 --> 38:28.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Susan, what are
people left to
do about it?

38:28.606 --> 38:30.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is writing a check the answer?

38:30.074 --> 38:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, there is a sense of
helplessness when
you see this image, too.

38:33.244 --> 38:39.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOELLER: Yes, I think Omran has
become, you
know, the current poster child
for Syria for

38:39.584 --> 38:46.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this moment in time, just like
Alan Kurdi
did a year ago, and we've had
other small

38:46.090 --> 38:48.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
children do in years' past.

38:48.426 --> 38:54.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think a poster child does
help us reach
into our wallets, reach into our
pockets,

38:55.033 --> 38:56.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and give.

38:56.968 --> 39:00.872 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I wrote a book called
"Compassion Fatigue",
and in that, I suggested that
one of the reasons

39:00.905 --> 39:06.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why people sometimes say enough
is when they
feel helpless, is when they feel
like they

39:06.945 --> 39:08.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can't make a difference.

39:08.880 --> 39:16.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, being able to
figure out how
to make a difference can be
something that

39:16.721 --> 39:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a photograph like Omran can do.

39:19.591 --> 39:23.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In other words, identifying an
aid agency.

39:23.328 --> 39:31.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alan Kurdi, for example, in the
24 hours after
that photograph appeared, just
one refugee

39:31.102 --> 39:35.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agency received almost a quarter
million dollars.

39:35.039 --> 39:42.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we can say that help is
given that wouldn't
have been given otherwise.

39:42.480 --> 39:49.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Anne, is there a
correlation
between things that we can do at
home, say

39:49.053 --> 39:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Confederate flag issue or an
LGBT issue
that people get fired up about
versus things

39:54.125 --> 40:00.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overseas that might require the
action of
different governments and armies
and tanks

40:00.131 --> 40:01.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to move into places?

40:01.933 --> 40:09.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARNARD: Well, I do think people
find it a
bit opaque how they can affect
foreign policy,

40:09.207 --> 40:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially nowadays in the era
of just wars
that are going on behind the
scenes and with

40:17.115 --> 40:18.916 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drones.

40:18.950 --> 40:23.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think, however, that,
you know, now
that there is a more active
protest movement

40:23.354 --> 40:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on in the United States,
anything can
happen.

40:26.324 --> 40:29.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But again the issues are very
complex and
multi-sided.

40:29.927 --> 40:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, people remember that
the war in
Iraq was a huge failure and
they're wary of

40:37.302 --> 40:39.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Middle East in general, they
don't know
much about it.

40:39.837 --> 40:45.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also think there is an
element that
we've seen, there is a fear of
Muslims and

40:45.476 --> 40:52.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an element of racism and there
is perhaps
a conflation of innocent Muslim
civilians

40:52.850 --> 40:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a fear of terrorism that is
an obstacle
to empathy for many people.

40:58.022 --> 41:03.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, pictures like this
hopefully, whatever
your political stripe remind you
that we're

41:03.628 --> 41:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
talking about just ordinary
human beings.

41:05.897 --> 41:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Anne Barnard of
"The New York
Times" joining us from Beirut,
Susan Moeller

41:08.866 --> 41:14.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the University of Maryland --
thanks for
being here.

41:14.572 --> 41:21.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MOELLER: Thank you.

41:21.379 --> 41:29.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOODRUFF: Now, economics
correspondent Paul
Solman spends a little time with
a former

41:29.320 --> 41:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hedge fund trader turned social
entrepreneur,
someone who wants to turn the
table on food

41:35.727 --> 41:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shortages in inner cities by
launching an
array of eateries in both
high-end and lower-income

41:42.934 --> 41:44.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
neighborhoods.

41:44.635 --> 41:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of our series "Making
Sense", which
airs Thursdays on the
"NewsHour".

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

41:49.006 --> 41:52.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN, PBS NEWSHOUR
ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT:
Sam Polk was formerly a top dog
at one of

41:52.877 --> 41:54.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the world's top hedge funds.

41:54.645 --> 41:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAM POLK, SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR:
My dad was
this sort of Willy Loman
character, this sort

41:57.849 --> 42:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of out-of-work salesman that
could never make
ends meet.

42:01.419 --> 42:08.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So when I was on Wall Street, my
entire life's
goal was to make more money than
the next

42:08.393 --> 42:10.161 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guy.

42:10.194 --> 42:11.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DORCIA WHITE-BRAKE, GROCERYSHIP
GRADUATE:
Just going to pour a little bit
of salsa inside.

42:11.396 --> 42:12.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like your own little bowl.

42:12.730 --> 42:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow, nice.

42:14.165 --> 42:17.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Dorcia White-Brake is a
teacher's
aid in Los Angeles.

42:17.835 --> 42:22.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three kids, no car, the nearest
supermarket
miles away.

42:22.540 --> 42:27.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WHITE-BRAKE: So I can have, you
know, good
healthy food that tastes good.

42:27.378 --> 42:29.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have to take a bus and a
train.

42:29.213 --> 42:35.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLK: When I was 27, I had been
on Wall Street
for five or six years and I was
at this club

42:35.353 --> 42:42.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Las Vegas, and it was this
super-exclusive
club and there was $1,000
bottles of champagne,

42:42.226 --> 42:44.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and beautiful women all around.

42:44.829 --> 42:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My life finally looked like I'd
always wanted
it to look.

42:50.001 --> 42:51.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I basically felt empty.

42:51.502 --> 42:55.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WHITE-BRAKE: So, basically, I
waited six months
for this application.

42:55.239 --> 42:56.974 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SOLMAN: Really.

42:57.008 --> 43:00.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WHITE-BRAKE: Yes, and I got it
and I turned
it in and then it seemed like an
eternity.

43:00.678 --> 43:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was waiting and waiting and
finally I got
a call.

43:04.248 --> 43:11.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Got a call to join the
Los Angeles
non-profit Groceryships Program,
started by

43:11.122 --> 43:12.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sam Polk.

43:12.890 --> 43:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLK: I started Groceryships
when I came to
understand that people are
living in food

43:18.930 --> 43:24.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deserts, where there's very
little produce
for sale and tons and tons of
fast food.

43:24.335 --> 43:30.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Groceryships is a
six-month scholarship
to buy healthy groceries, learn
to cook them,

43:30.975 --> 43:32.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and to share.

43:32.710 --> 43:36.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLK: And there's a box of
Kleenex in the
center because a lot of time is
devoted to

43:36.380 --> 43:43.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sharing about family, about body
issues, about
self-esteem and so, we have yet
to see a group

43:43.588 --> 43:47.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where you start talking about
those issues
and somebody doesn't burst into
tears.

43:47.492 --> 43:51.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WHITE-BRAKE: I need my box right
now, because,
I'm not kidding.

43:51.128 --> 43:52.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
SOLMAN: Really?

43:52.129 --> 43:53.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just talking about it.

43:53.831 --> 43:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WHITE-BRAKE: Yes, because just
to be able
to tell people about my food
disorder.

43:58.769 --> 44:03.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I let so much out in that so
circle.

44:03.407 --> 44:07.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yeah, you know we went through a
lot of stuff
together.

44:07.078 --> 44:12.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whatever, whatever I was going
through, my
Groceryships family went through
it with me.

44:12.283 --> 44:18.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: Groceryships is
expanding in L.A.,
but to Sam Polk it's only
prelude to his new

44:18.556 --> 44:20.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
venture, Everytable.

44:20.558 --> 44:25.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's just opened the first
outpost of what
he hopes will be a nationwide
chain of restaurants,

44:26.030 --> 44:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dishing out healthy food,
furiously fast,
and challengingly cheap.

44:31.035 --> 44:35.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WHITE-BRAKE: So that means in
this s neighborhood,
which is south Los Angeles where
the per capita

44:35.139 --> 44:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
income is $13,000 a year, and
life expectancy
is ten years lower than more
affluent areas.

44:41.779 --> 44:43.514 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We price the meals at $4.

44:43.548 --> 44:45.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID FOSTER, CO-FOUNDER,
EVERYTABLE: Four
bucks is a great price here
compared to fast

44:45.750 --> 44:47.652 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
food, which is the predominant
option.

44:47.685 --> 44:53.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: David Foster also left a
rich career
in finance to join Sam Polk.

44:53.558 --> 44:59.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're about to open a second
Everytable
in upscale downtown L.A., $8 a
meal.

44:59.764 --> 45:03.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOSTER: But eight bucks is also
a great price
compared to what's available in
the healthy

45:03.701 --> 45:05.269 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fast casual space downtown.

45:05.303 --> 45:09.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: So, it's $8 versus $4
for exactly
the same food?

45:09.874 --> 45:11.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
POLK: That's right.

45:11.242 --> 45:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's basically making sure that
everyone can
afford healthy food.

45:14.445 --> 45:20.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: The same healthy food,
prepared in
the same central kitchen to keep
costs low,

45:20.251 --> 45:25.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, here's the key innovation,
sold at higher
prices in wealthier
neighborhoods to make

45:25.957 --> 45:28.759 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up for the super-skinny margins
in poor ones.

45:28.793 --> 45:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
POLK: In a world where
inequality is clearly
growing and becoming seen as
structural, we

45:36.267 --> 45:40.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think that this is the time for
a new business
that questions that fundamental
assumption

45:40.638 --> 45:42.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that prices should be the same
for everyone.

45:42.974 --> 45:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: This is one of the
dreams of all sellers,
right?

45:46.243 --> 45:48.079 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's price discrimination.

45:48.112 --> 45:54.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to charge people what's
they're actually
willing to pay, as opposed to
just have one

45:54.051 --> 45:55.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
price across the board.

45:55.786 --> 45:59.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FOSTER: We're not price
discriminating in
the sense of trying to make as
much money

45:59.590 --> 46:01.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
off of each customer as
possible.

46:01.525 --> 46:03.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're actually kind of doing the
opposite.

46:03.361 --> 46:07.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're saying we don't need to
make much if
any money on a lot of our
customers, because

46:07.732 --> 46:13.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's driving us is not just
having a successful,
viable company, but more
importantly solving

46:13.571 --> 46:15.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this problem that afflicts a lot
of people.

46:15.606 --> 46:17.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Surprised that two guys
from Wall
Street are doing this?

46:17.908 --> 46:19.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEBRA DIXON: Yes.

46:19.644 --> 46:24.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Dedra Dixon's foundation
feeds the
homeless, getting leftovers from
Everytable

46:24.181 --> 46:25.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just one day old.

46:26.017 --> 46:29.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIXON: There's not too many
places t around
in our community unfortunately
where you can

46:29.387 --> 46:31.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get salads, you can get these
meals.

46:31.422 --> 46:36.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, yes, that two guys from
Wall Street
can come down into south L.A.
and say there's

46:36.260 --> 46:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a need here that needs to be met
by way of
food and meet that need, I am
very surprised.

46:42.733 --> 46:44.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But grateful.

46:44.535 --> 46:49.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: Like other entrepreneurs
we've covered,
trying to bring good food to the
desert, in

46:49.974 --> 46:52.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Philadelphia, in Boston, Polk
sees the need
everywhere.

46:52.977 --> 46:58.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLK: Eventually, we'd like to
see an Everytable
store in every neighborhood in
the country.

46:58.115 --> 46:59.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SOLMAN: Thousands?

46:59.116 --> 47:01.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
POLK: I would say tens of
thousands.

47:01.318 --> 47:05.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have over 50 investors,
including some
of the biggest venture capital
funds in the

47:05.956 --> 47:07.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

47:07.291 --> 47:10.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Including many of their
high-flying
former colleagues.

47:10.528 --> 47:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But despite the enthusiasm for
do-good ideas
like this, people aren't exactly
leaving Wall

47:16.300 --> 47:19.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Street in droves for more
meaningful careers.

47:19.437 --> 47:26.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLK: I think we all have inside
us both ambitions
which are things that we want
for ourself--

47:26.444 --> 47:29.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you know, money, power,
prestige.

47:29.380 --> 47:33.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we all have aspirations to
contribute
or make the world a better
place.

47:33.617 --> 47:38.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It just so happens that we live
in a culture
as a whole where ambitions are
celebrated

47:38.856 --> 47:42.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than aspirations and it's
almost like
Wall Street is the most
distilled part of

47:42.993 --> 47:44.595 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that culture.

47:44.628 --> 47:48.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: And like any culture, it
reinforces
its norms in casual
conversation.

47:48.566 --> 47:50.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, what is your net
worth?

47:50.735 --> 47:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How many sticks have you made
this year?

47:52.169 --> 47:53.370 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
POLK: How many sticks?

47:53.404 --> 47:55.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: You call a million
dollars a stick
on Wall Street.

47:55.806 --> 48:01.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLK: So, you say: I'm up ten
sticks to say
I have ten million in profits
this year.

48:01.078 --> 48:06.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My bonus in my last year on Wall
Street was
more than my mom, a nurse
practitioner midwife

48:06.684 --> 48:08.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had made for her entire life.

48:08.552 --> 48:10.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I was 30 years old.

48:10.488 --> 48:16.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: It had taken three years
after the
emptiness epiphany in the Vegas
nightclub,

48:16.093 --> 48:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but at 30, as he explained in
for "The Love
of Money", a "New York Times"
op-ed piece

48:21.265 --> 48:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that went viral and has now been
turned into
a book.

48:24.301 --> 48:30.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POLK: I came to understand that
even though
that billionaire siren song was
really attractive,

48:30.474 --> 48:35.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that in another way, that came
to seem like
a good way to waste your life.

48:35.146 --> 48:38.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You go to Wall Street and you
make all this
money and then you're 70 years
old and you're

48:38.649 --> 48:39.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on your deathbed and --

48:39.884 --> 48:42.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Hey, wait a second- -
not 70 on your
deathbed.

48:42.686 --> 48:45.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How about upping that number
just a bit?

48:45.055 --> 48:47.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLK: Ninety on your deathbed.

48:47.124 --> 48:52.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at the end of the day, I
felt like I wanted
to be truly proud of what I'd
done with my

48:52.263 --> 48:53.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

48:53.264 --> 48:55.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: As for David Foster --

48:55.099 --> 48:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FOSTER: There are a lot of smart
people working
in finance, and I'd go as far as
to say that

48:58.502 --> 49:04.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are too many smart people
working in
finance and that thee value I
was adding versus

49:04.074 --> 49:07.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a replacement player was kind of
negligible.

49:07.211 --> 49:13.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I thought that there was
something out there
in the world, a bigger problem
that needed

49:13.217 --> 49:16.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
solving, beyond being another
person working
in the private equity industry.

49:16.954 --> 49:20.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Or another chef cooking
for the one
percent.

49:20.157 --> 49:22.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CRAIG HOPSON, EXECUTIVE CHIEF,
LE CIRQUE IN
NEW YORK: Hi, I'm Craig Hopson.

49:22.293 --> 49:24.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm executive chef here at Le
Cirque in New
York.

49:24.094 --> 49:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: Hopson went from haute
cuisine to
Everytable.

49:26.964 --> 49:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPSON: It could be thousands of
people a
day that buy the Everytable
meals.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I mean the audience is
unlimited.

49:33.070 --> 49:35.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Le Cirque, not so much.

49:35.406 --> 49:40.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: And Hopson too speaks in
sound bites
that would sound hokey if they
weren't so

49:40.110 --> 49:41.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
obviously earnest.

49:41.779 --> 49:46.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOPSON: It's great to be able to
be proud
of what I'm doing and be able to
give back

49:46.217 --> 49:49.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the people that really need
it and to make
a difference in the world.

49:50.020 --> 49:54.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SOLMAN: And speaking of hokey
lines, make
a difference they do.

49:54.325 --> 49:56.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE-BRAKE: Bon appetit.

49:56.160 --> 50:01.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SOLMAN: This is economics
correspondent Paul
Solman, putting on the pounds,
healthfully,

50:01.699 --> 50:03.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in south Los Angeles.

50:03.467 --> 50:06.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's really nice.

50:06.303 --> 50:11.508 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

50:11.542 --> 50:16.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SREENIVASAN: Now to another of
our "Brief
But Spectacular" episodes.

50:16.614 --> 50:19.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from David
Remnick, editor
of "The New Yorker."

50:19.350 --> 50:21.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He describes how the magazine
has changed
over the years.

50:21.819 --> 50:23.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

50:23.687 --> 50:27.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID REMNICK, EDITOR, THE NEW
YORKER: I think
people's awareness has to begin
at some point,

50:27.625 --> 50:31.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some weird influence that gets
them going
that makes them enter the world.

50:31.128 --> 50:32.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For me, it was listening to Bob
Dylan.

50:32.830 --> 50:34.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I bought my first album.

50:34.565 --> 50:39.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was called "The Best of '66,"
and it had
a song called "I Want You" by
Bob Dylan.

50:39.270 --> 50:40.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was six years old.

50:40.604 --> 50:44.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I didn't know what he wanted
exactly but it
resonated with me.

50:44.341 --> 50:50.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You guys are fancy, I got to
tell you.

50:50.915 --> 50:56.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been the editor of "The
New Yorker"
magazine since 1998 and I've
been a writer

50:56.887 --> 50:58.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here since 1992.

50:58.822 --> 51:05.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's changed from being the
editor of a weekly
print magazine to now a web
site, radio show,

51:05.729 --> 51:10.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a television show, floor wax,
dessert topping,
we're everything.

51:10.601 --> 51:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The New Yorker Radio Hour" is a
program that's
both on terrestrial radio and a
podcast.

51:16.073 --> 51:21.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now podcast and radio is
renaissance, just
as television is in many ways.

51:21.378 --> 51:26.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if "The New Yorker Radio
Hour" is in the
thick of that renaissance, I'm
very happy.

51:26.617 --> 51:29.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Editing is a really complicated
process.

51:29.553 --> 51:34.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Get the writer to do the best
form of the
writer's version of the piece.

51:34.258 --> 51:40.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An editor who is obnoxious, in
my mind, is
the kind of editor that said
winkingly, that's

51:40.397 --> 51:41.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of my piece.

51:41.665 --> 51:44.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's just not what's done
here.

51:44.068 --> 51:50.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The greatest feeling of
satisfaction is to
run across somebody young who
has something

51:50.874 --> 51:56.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new to say and saying it in a
different way
and help that person in some
subtle way get

51:56.613 --> 51:59.016 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be himself or herself, that
is thrilling.

51:59.049 --> 52:02.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not everybody does everything at
the highest
level.

52:02.686 --> 52:07.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't expect an investigative
report to
necessarily be the next sense
and sensibility.

52:07.891 --> 52:11.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What you want is to be accurate
and deep and
clear.

52:11.528 --> 52:15.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My editor up in New York, when I
write, the
rare times that I write is a guy
named Henry

52:15.132 --> 52:16.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Fender (ph).

52:16.900 --> 52:22.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He might say something like this
-- very good
things here -- and if that
happens, I know

52:22.606 --> 52:24.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we're in for a long ride.

52:25.009 --> 52:27.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody does his or her job in
a moment
in time.

52:27.845 --> 52:33.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My moment in time is not only to
make the
magazine as great as it possibly
can be but

52:33.851 --> 52:39.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
help us cross this technological
and even
financial roaring river of
change.

52:39.723 --> 52:44.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Internet is at the center of
everybody's
attention and how we come into
people's households

52:44.995 --> 52:51.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or palms or field division has
changed radically
and I have to leave a "New
Yorker" that's

52:51.602 --> 52:56.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got its soul as well as its
technological
act together.

52:56.407 --> 53:01.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm David Remnick and this is my
"Brief but
Spectacular" view of "The New
Yorker."

53:01.545 --> 53:03.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

tonight.

53:09.053 --> 53:10.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
