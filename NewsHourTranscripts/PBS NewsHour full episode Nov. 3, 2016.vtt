JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.405 --> 00:06.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.406 --> 00:08.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:08.075 --> 00:11.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
The race for president tightens
with only

00:11.078 --> 00:12.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
five days left.

00:12.946 --> 00:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton invokes the
Chicago Cubs,
saying maybe she will make
history too, while

00:18.452 --> 00:20.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump says he will make
America proud.

00:20.487 --> 00:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Thursday,
we sit down with U.S. envoy to
the anti-terrorism

00:25.993 --> 00:30.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coalition, as U.S.-backed Iraqi
troops push
into ISIS-held Mosul for the
first time in

00:30.664 --> 00:32.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two years.

00:32.432 --> 00:36.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how the
campaign could
affect the Donald Trump brand,
Making Sense

00:36.937 --> 00:40.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what a presidential election
can do to
a business empire.

00:40.407 --> 00:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA GOTTLIEB, Film and TV
Producer: If you
think of Trump, and you think of
beautiful

00:44.378 --> 00:49.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lobbies and well-built
buildings, then of
course the brand is worth
something.

00:49.049 --> 00:54.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you think of Trump and
you think of
racist, misogynist, lying, then
the brand

00:54.788 --> 00:56.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is certainly worth a lot less.

00:56.490 --> 00:57.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Plus:

00:57.491 --> 00:59.760 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The Cubs win the World
Series!

00:59.793 --> 01:03.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One for the
ages: how the
Chicago Cubs went all the way in
one of the

01:03.630 --> 01:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most dramatic finishes in World
Series history.

01:06.333 --> 01:14.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:14.408 --> 01:17.377 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:17.411 --> 01:26.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Critical
states along the
Eastern Seaboard are echoing
with campaign

01:26.687 --> 01:28.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
appeals tonight.

01:28.488 --> 01:32.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The candidates, and top
supporters, have been
out in force today, as the days
before the

01:32.225 --> 01:35.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
election dwindle to a final few.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

01:37.364 --> 01:43.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is what
the scramble
for votes looks like five days
before Election

01:43.870 --> 01:49.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Day: Hillary Clinton in North
Carolina and
President Obama, campaigning for
her in Florida,

01:49.710 --> 01:54.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both holding college rallies,
both pitching
to younger voters, plus,
campaign manager

01:55.015 --> 02:00.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robby Mook on a TV talk show,
"The View,"
reaching out to women voters.

02:00.087 --> 02:05.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other side, Donald Trump
kept up his
Florida focus today, while V.P.
nominee Mike

02:05.892 --> 02:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pence spoke on a farm in Iowa,
going for the
rural vote and with him a
surprise companion,

02:12.399 --> 02:17.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ted Cruz, former sharp Trump
rival today campaigning
for his team for the first time.

02:17.504 --> 02:18.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TED CRUZ (R), Texas: If you care
about the
Constitution and Bill of Rights.

02:20.607 --> 02:23.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And aiming for
conservative
votes.

02:23.377 --> 02:29.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This as voting itself is well
under way, with
more than 31 million early and
absentee ballots

02:29.416 --> 02:30.684 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
already cast.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's about a quarter of all
the votes expected
this year.

02:33.887 --> 02:37.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In general, Democrats want and
usually need
a big lead in early votes.

02:38.025 --> 02:40.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something they had both
times President
Obama won.

02:40.994 --> 02:45.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not yet clear they will get
it this year.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump's latest strategy to win
votes?

02:47.167 --> 02:52.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part one, a sharply stepped-up
attack on Hillary
Clinton, not just talking about
current FBI

02:52.839 --> 02:57.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
questions, but going much
further than the
FBI about what may be next.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Here we go again with Clinton.

02:58.912 --> 03:03.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You remember the impeachment and
the problems.

03:03.717 --> 03:11.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is likely to be under
investigation for
many, many years, also likely to
conclude

03:11.258 --> 03:14.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a criminal trial.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is not what we need in this
country,
folks.

03:16.663 --> 03:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Top Democrats,
like V.P.
nominee Tim Kaine and House
Minority Leader

03:20.734 --> 03:27.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nancy Pelosi, are pushing back
strongly, saying
Republicans should stop talk of
possibly impeaching

03:27.507 --> 03:29.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

03:29.309 --> 03:33.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania,
Melania Trump
reached out in her first
campaign event since

03:33.447 --> 03:35.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the GOP Convention.

03:35.315 --> 03:39.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELANIA TRUMP, Wife of Donald
Trump: Do we
want a country that respects
woman and provides

03:39.152 --> 03:41.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them with equal opportunity?

03:41.588 --> 03:43.390 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AUDIENCE: Yes!

03:43.423 --> 03:47.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But in Miami,
President Obama
questioned whether Mrs. Trump's
her husband

03:47.994 --> 03:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
truly does respect women.

03:49.896 --> 03:59.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Who you are, what you are
doesn't change after

03:59.372 --> 04:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you occupy the Oval Office.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All it does is magnify who you
are.

04:03.477 --> 04:06.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All it does is shine a spotlight
on who you
are.

04:06.146 --> 04:14.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you disrespected women before
you were
in office, you will disrespect
women as president.

04:14.221 --> 04:18.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And Clinton
highlighted the
idea of character again in North
Carolina.

04:18.692 --> 04:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Someone who thinks the lives of
black people

04:22.229 --> 04:28.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are all crime and poverty and
despair, he
has no idea.

04:28.735 --> 04:33.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is, as it
has been, a
race about character and whose
character voters

04:33.907 --> 04:35.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
question more.

04:35.175 --> 04:37.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:37.644 --> 04:43.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: There's
word of a dispute inside the FBI
over claims

04:43.617 --> 04:46.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of corruption at the Clinton
Foundation.

04:46.286 --> 04:51.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal reports
that it stems
from secret recordings of an
unnamed suspect

04:51.591 --> 04:53.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talking about the foundation.

04:53.527 --> 04:58.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report says that some agents
believed
the recordings showed financial
misconduct.

04:59.032 --> 05:03.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But senior officials considered
the evidence
hearsay and too weak to pursue.

05:03.970 --> 05:07.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Two American
soldiers were
killed today in fierce fighting
in Northern

05:07.741 --> 05:08.708 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Afghanistan.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Four others were wounded.

05:10.644 --> 05:14.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They'd been aiding Afghan
special forces near
Kunduz on a raid that killed two
senior Taliban

05:14.347 --> 05:15.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commanders.

05:15.815 --> 05:19.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But 26 civilians also died,
sparking protests
against NATO airstrikes.

05:19.452 --> 05:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The strikes were called in to
aid the U.S.
and Afghan forces.

05:23.023 --> 05:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A British court
has thrown
a roadblock in the path to
Brexit, the move

05:27.494 --> 05:29.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to quit the European Union.

05:29.362 --> 05:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court ruled today that the
U.K. government
must first have Parliament's
approval before

05:34.501 --> 05:36.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
beginning the process.

05:36.303 --> 05:40.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaking outside the court, the
lead claimant
in the case implored the
government not to

05:40.740 --> 05:42.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
appeal the ruling.

05:42.108 --> 05:45.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GINA MILLER, Lead Claimant: It's
now to the
government what they do.

05:45.078 --> 05:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I hope that the M.P.s will
do their job
and actually debate this in a
sober, grown-up

05:50.350 --> 05:53.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, because leading up to the
vote, we didn't
have sober, honest, rational
debates.

05:53.320 --> 05:57.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So it's now over to the
politicians.

05:57.324 --> 06:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In response,
Prime Minister
Theresa May's government said
that it will

06:01.928 --> 06:03.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
appeal the ruling.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The country's Supreme Court
plans to take
it up in early December.

06:06.700 --> 06:11.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The world is
far from meeting
ambitious goals in the Paris
agreement on

06:11.404 --> 06:13.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
climate change.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Environment Program
said today in
London that only faster action
can limit global

06:17.077 --> 06:20.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
warming to 2 degrees Celsius by
2030.

06:20.347 --> 06:23.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means huge additional cuts
in greenhouse
gas emissions.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JACQUELINE MCGLADE, U.N.
Environment Program:
The gap between where we need to
be and where

06:26.019 --> 06:32.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are today is something
equivalent to what
we call gigatons of carbon; 15
of those are

06:32.392 --> 06:33.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what's required.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to reduce that every
year.

06:35.161 --> 06:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the same as saying we
have to take
all the cars off the roads of
Europe every

06:40.533 --> 06:42.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
year 15 times over.

06:42.636 --> 06:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Paris
climate pact formally
takes effect tomorrow, but it
lacks any enforcement

06:46.973 --> 06:48.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
measures.

06:48.975 --> 06:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, new evidence
today that progress made by
President Obama's

06:51.978 --> 06:55.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health care insurance overhaul
is stalling.

06:55.282 --> 07:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention
reports 28.4 million Americans
lacked health

07:01.588 --> 07:03.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
insurance as of July.

07:03.690 --> 07:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that was an improvement of
only 200,000
from one year earlier.

07:08.495 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's partly because fewer
private insurance
companies are choosing to take
part, and premium

07:13.667 --> 07:15.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
costs are rising sharply.

07:15.802 --> 07:19.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Prosecutors in
Charleston,
South Carolina, began calling
witnesses today

07:19.372 --> 07:23.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the killing of an unarmed
black motorist;
50-year-old Walter Scott was
shot in the back

07:23.810 --> 07:27.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
five times after running from a
traffic stop
in April 2015.

07:27.714 --> 07:30.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former police officer Michael
Slager is charged
with murder in the case.

07:30.984 --> 07:35.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the prosecutor argued
there's no justification
for what Slager did.

07:35.555 --> 07:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The defense said Scott bears the
blame for
resisting arrest and running
away.

07:39.859 --> 07:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, on Wall
Street, stocks
slipped for the eighth session
in a row, reacting

07:44.998 --> 07:47.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
partly to the presidential race
getting tighter.

07:47.734 --> 07:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average

HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
Democrats' efforts to boost the
minority vote

08:03.416 --> 08:09.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the GOP's struggle to keep
its suburban
stronghold; a view from
America's top diplomat

08:09.322 --> 08:18.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Donald Trump's brand; and much
more.

08:18.398 --> 08:30.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We begin tonight
with politics
and the final push in the race
for the White

08:30.944 --> 08:32.746 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
House.

08:32.779 --> 08:37.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Get-out-the-vote efforts are
crucial in these
last days of the campaign,
including outreach

08:37.250 --> 08:39.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to minority voters.

08:39.252 --> 08:42.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining us now to break it down
are Cornell
Belcher.

08:42.155 --> 08:47.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a Democratic strategist and
the author
of "A Black Man in the White
House."

08:47.293 --> 08:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael McDonald, an early
voting expert at
the University of Florida.

08:51.231 --> 08:58.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mark Hugo Lopez, he's
director of Hispanic
research at the Pew Research
Center.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.707 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all three of you
to the program.

09:00.740 --> 09:04.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. McDonald, we're waiting to
get our audio
issue straightened out with you.

09:04.110 --> 09:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I'm going to start with
Cornell Belcher
right here in Washington.

09:08.148 --> 09:14.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is the -- how well has the
Clinton campaign
done so far in terms of reaching
out to minorities

09:14.254 --> 09:16.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and especially to
African-Americans?

09:16.089 --> 09:17.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNELL BELCHER, Democratic
Strategist: Well,
you know, I talked to the
Clinton campaign

09:17.924 --> 09:23.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the last two days and one
of their minds
there that is taking a look at
the numbers.

09:23.563 --> 09:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What They're saying is, they
actually have
banked right now more raw votes
for African-Americans

09:28.334 --> 09:30.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Hispanics than we actually
did in 2012.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I worked on the Obama campaign
in 2012.

09:32.338 --> 09:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Judy, if you had told me
six months ago,
with the enthusiasm sort of
narrative that

09:36.876 --> 09:41.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have, that right now in
Florida the Clinton
campaign would be arguing that
they have 74

09:41.314 --> 09:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent more African-Americans
banked in early
vote right now than we did in
2012, I would

09:46.986 --> 09:48.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
laugh at you.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But looking at the numbers that
they have
right now, it looks like early
voting is up

09:51.224 --> 09:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the board in Florida, but
particularly
among Hispanics in Florida.

09:54.761 --> 09:59.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when you use
the word banked,
you mean people who have already
gone to the

09:59.566 --> 10:01.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
polls, have already voted, and
they can count
on it?

10:01.901 --> 10:06.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CORNELL BELCHER: And we think
from their past
performance, they are Democratic
voters.

10:06.372 --> 10:11.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so when they look at 74
percent of more
African-Americans in the polling
places right

10:11.511 --> 10:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now in the early vote, they're
banking that
as 90 percent of that being
their vote.

10:16.349 --> 10:20.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Hugo Lopez,
let me ask
you the same question with
regard to the Latino

10:20.053 --> 10:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
community across the country.

10:21.921 --> 10:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know it's different in every
state, but
how would you describe at this
point the outreach

10:26.793 --> 10:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that both campaigns have made
into the Latino
community in terms of getting
out the vote?

10:30.697 --> 10:32.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK HUGO LOPEZ, Director of
Hispanic Research,
Pew Research Center: There has
been a focus

10:32.298 --> 10:35.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on getting out the Latino vote
in states that
are battleground states.

10:35.401 --> 10:36.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's certainly the case in
Florida.

10:36.903 --> 10:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's been the case in Nevada
as well.

10:38.972 --> 10:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But also some polling has shown
that in places
like California and Texas,
which, by the way,

10:42.876 --> 10:46.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has half of Hispanic voters,
there has not
been as much outreach.

10:46.079 --> 10:50.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's really been a pattern
we have seen
over the course of the last few
election cycles.

10:50.450 --> 10:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nonetheless, when you look at a
place like
Florida, you see two million
Hispanics registered

10:54.721 --> 10:56.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to vote.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a record number, but it's
also up what
one would expect -- by the
amount one would

10:59.559 --> 11:02.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expect to see given population
growth in the
state.

11:02.762 --> 11:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So those early voter numbers for
Hispanics
are partly a reflection of just
the fact that

11:06.699 --> 11:09.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
there are more Hispanics
eligible to vote
and registered to vote.

11:09.269 --> 11:13.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you're saying
it's just
a natural outgrowth of the
change in demographics

11:13.106 --> 11:14.841 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to some extent?

11:14.874 --> 11:16.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK HUGO LOPEZ: That's a big
part of the
story for Hispanics, not all of
it, but a

11:16.676 --> 11:18.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
part of the story.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
Michael McDonald,
you're in Florida, but you take
a look at

11:20.713 --> 11:21.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the whole country.

11:21.814 --> 11:24.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does the picture look like
nationally?

11:24.050 --> 11:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard our Lisa Desjardins
report earlier
about 30 million Americans have
already voted.

11:29.188 --> 11:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who's turning out and where?

11:30.924 --> 11:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MCDONALD, University of
Florida: Yes,
we're up to 34 million at least.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will probably be up to 35
million, 36 million
by the end of the day.

11:36.496 --> 11:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we look across the country,
we're seeing
uneven levels of turnout, but on
most places,

11:42.902 --> 11:46.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're seeing record numbers of
people who
have voted early.

11:46.506 --> 11:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In six states now, we are above
the 2012 numbers
already.

11:51.778 --> 11:54.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have several days of
early voting left
to go.

11:54.347 --> 11:59.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in many places, places like
Texas is running
well ahead of their 2012
numbers.

11:59.919 --> 12:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Louisiana, Florida, where I'm
at, we're already
at our 2012 numbers.

12:03.823 --> 12:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there are some places
that have changed
their election law that have
expanded early

12:07.694 --> 12:09.362 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voting.

12:09.395 --> 12:14.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Places like Minnesota and
Massachusetts have
also reached their levels of
2012.

12:14.734 --> 12:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are -- while we see
lots of voting
going on in some places, other
places, we're

12:19.305 --> 12:24.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing not -- places where
they're not reaching
their 2012 levels.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's primarily in the Midwest.

12:26.412 --> 12:32.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Places like Iowa and Ohio seem
to be a little
bit running behind their 2012
levels.

12:32.418 --> 12:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, just quickly,
staying with
you, Michael McDonald, are you
saying that

12:36.689 --> 12:41.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this bodes well for one --
probably bodes
well for one campaign or
another, or is it

12:41.527 --> 12:43.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
possible to know?

12:43.363 --> 12:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCDONALD: Well, you have
to take them
on a state-by-state basis,
because each state

12:47.266 --> 12:49.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a snowflake.

12:49.135 --> 12:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, so, where I mentioned
earlier where turnout
is down, that's primarily among
Democrats.

12:54.040 --> 12:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen resistance in
the polls to
Clinton in places like Iowa and
Ohio.

12:58.144 --> 13:03.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is some recent movement
towards -- where
Democrats seem to be getting
more engaged,

13:03.383 --> 13:04.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
particularly in Ohio.

13:04.951 --> 13:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think both of those states are
going to
be razor-thin come election
night.

13:09.255 --> 13:13.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if we look at our
battleground states,
the battleground states and the
early vote

13:13.660 --> 13:15.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is reflecting that, by and
large.

13:15.695 --> 13:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, there are two states I
think that
are well worth watching prior to
Election

13:20.833 --> 13:23.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Day, Colorado and Nevada.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both of them are going to have a
large number
of early votes.

13:26.105 --> 13:29.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're already at half the total
turnout of
2012.

13:29.575 --> 13:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to go even higher on
the early
vote.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, both of those states
look pretty
good for the Democrats.

13:34.881 --> 13:39.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is some more time left,
but, right now,
if I were the Clinton campaign,
I would be

13:39.285 --> 13:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more pleased with those numbers
out of those
states than the Trump campaign.

13:42.055 --> 13:45.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Cornell Belcher,
we have heard
some criticism of the Clinton
campaign from

13:45.892 --> 13:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friendly Democrats who are
saying they should
have done more earlier to reach
out especially

13:51.497 --> 13:57.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the African-American
community, in Florida,
in particular, that there hasn't
been the

13:57.136 --> 13:58.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outreach that there could have
been.

13:58.871 --> 14:00.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you know about that?

14:00.239 --> 14:02.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CORNELL BELCHER: Well, listen, I
understand
some of the frustration.

14:02.875 --> 14:06.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from someone who has worked
on a campaign
that I thought was pretty good,
when we took

14:06.112 --> 14:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our fair criticism as well, I
hear the conversation
about -- particularly around
younger African-Americans

14:12.085 --> 14:14.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and sort of younger millennials
in general.

14:14.353 --> 14:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, the key number here for a
lot of these
places, quite frankly, are these
younger minorities,

14:18.725 --> 14:20.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right, the millennials.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at what we were
able to do in
2008 and 2012, we did that,
expand the electorate,

14:24.797 --> 14:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
largely by bringing in younger
voters.

14:27.166 --> 14:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been a conversation
that not enough
resources and time have gone to
chase those

14:32.171 --> 14:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
younger voters than what we have
seen in the
past.

14:34.373 --> 14:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I did focus groups about three
weeks ago in
Charlotte, really quickly, with
some younger

14:38.478 --> 14:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African-Americans, who their key
issue, Judy,
is racism and police brutality.

14:42.281 --> 14:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I showed them a policy
platform on
that, they didn't know it was
Hillary Clinton's

14:48.187 --> 14:49.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
policy platform at all.

14:49.655 --> 14:52.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're not getting the
information that's
critical to them.

14:52.959 --> 14:58.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Hugo Lopez,
what about
in looking at the Latino
community?

14:58.264 --> 15:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you see -- you know, whether
you look at
the raw turnout numbers or not,
but do you

15:03.703 --> 15:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see the enthusiasm in the
Hispanic and Latino
community and especially among
younger Latinos?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK HUGO LOPEZ: That's a really
good question.

15:10.443 --> 15:14.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you take a look at the
Hispanic electorate,
there's 27 million who are
eligible to vote

15:14.080 --> 15:17.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this year, but 44 percent of
those are millennials.

15:17.116 --> 15:20.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the youth vote is more
important for Latinos
than it is for others.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And here's where there has been
some real
interesting numbers.

15:22.955 --> 15:26.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many of those Latino millennials
are going
to be voting for the first time,
but also

15:26.359 --> 15:31.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many say that they're choosing
to support
Hillary Clinton in order to vote
against Donald

15:31.330 --> 15:32.899 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That suggests that perhaps they
aren't as
enthusiastic about Hillary
Clinton.

15:35.234 --> 15:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, all in all, with regards to
turnout this
year compared to the past, it
remains to be

15:39.138 --> 15:43.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen where we will be, whether
we will have
a record 13 million or perhaps
more, depending

15:44.010 --> 15:48.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on how much outreach there is
from the campaigns
and various get-out-the-vote
efforts.

15:48.714 --> 15:52.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that's still an
unknown question,
exactly where we will be with
Hispanic turnout.

15:52.118 --> 15:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean 13
million particularly
with regard to Latino vote?

15:56.222 --> 15:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK HUGO LOPEZ: That's correct,
13 million
Hispanic voters would be what --
is what one

15:59.792 --> 16:03.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would expect, given trends and
turnout over
the last few election cycles.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that would be a record
turnout.

16:05.598 --> 16:09.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's possible that we could
see more than
13 million, which would start to
make 2016

16:09.836 --> 16:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an unusual year for Hispanic
turnout, compared
to 2012, for example.

16:13.472 --> 16:17.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael McDonald,
we know you
have looked at early voting for
a long time.

16:17.210 --> 16:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot's been written this year
about how much
better organized -- and there's
evidence of

16:21.514 --> 16:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this -- the Clinton is than the
Trump camp
on the ground, the get-out --
the actual physical

16:26.385 --> 16:28.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get-out-the-vote effort.

16:28.120 --> 16:32.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this stage in a campaign, how
much difference
can an organization like that
make?

16:32.692 --> 16:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCDONALD: So, you have
to understand
what happens with the way in
which elections

16:36.762 --> 16:38.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are administered.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When someone votes, the election
officials
are of course recording that to
make sure

16:40.700 --> 16:42.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that someone doesn't vote more
than once.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the election officials
share that
with the campaigns.

16:45.872 --> 16:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, they're also sharing
it with the
public, which is how we collect
information.

16:49.542 --> 16:52.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the campaigns then look at
their support
lists.

16:52.278 --> 16:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have got -- they know who
they want to
turn out to vote.

16:56.249 --> 16:59.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if they see someone that has
already voted,
they scratch them off the list
and then they

16:59.719 --> 17:01.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
start moving down the list.

17:01.754 --> 17:07.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what early voting does for a
well-organized
campaign, it allows them to
extend their mobilization

17:07.994 --> 17:09.862 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
efforts over more days.

17:09.896 --> 17:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It allows them to go deeper down
into their
list and hit more people, some
of those low-

17:14.233 --> 17:18.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to moderate-propensity voters
who need that
extra nudge to get to the polls.

17:18.471 --> 17:24.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In other words,
if you do have
a good ground organization, you
can benefit?

17:24.777 --> 17:26.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can make a difference?

17:26.579 --> 17:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MCDONALD: Absolutely.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.248 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

17:29.282 --> 17:31.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you have to realize, this is
a bug, not
a feature, of the Democratic
coalition.

17:31.350 --> 17:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democratic coalition is more
likely made
up of young people, persons of
color, other

17:35.588 --> 17:39.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who have moderate -- more
often are
moderate- to low-propensity
voters than the

17:39.725 --> 17:41.494 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans.

17:41.527 --> 17:44.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the Democrats, by their very
nature of
their coalition, need to have a
much greater,

17:44.597 --> 17:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
larger mobilization organization
than the
Republicans.

17:47.667 --> 17:49.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We hear you.

17:49.268 --> 17:54.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael McDonald, Mark Hugo
Lopez and Cornell
Belcher, thank you, all three.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We appreciate it.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MICHAEL MCDONALD: You're
welcome.

17:57.176 --> 18:01.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn our
attention now to
another way demographic shifts
are shaping

18:01.514 --> 18:03.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this election.

18:03.282 --> 18:07.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The suburbs outside of cities
like Denver,
Colorado, and Richmond, Virginia
used to be

18:07.853 --> 18:12.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretty reliable Republican
strongholds, but
now they are trending more
Democratic.

18:12.925 --> 18:17.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a phenomenon showing up
across the country,
with clear implications for this
election.

18:17.630 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Daniel Bush has
spent time
looking into what is behind the
change, and

18:22.301 --> 18:23.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he's with me now.

18:24.003 --> 18:28.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Dan Bush, you have spent, I
know, a lot
of effort and time looking at
this.

18:28.207 --> 18:30.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First of all, define what we
mean by suburbs
here.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL BUSH: Sure, Judy.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's a broad category,
obviously, but
when demographers and others are
looking at

18:35.548 --> 18:40.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this issue, particularly in
political terms,
what they're talking about is
towns and communities

18:40.586 --> 18:45.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are clustered in greater
metropolitan
regions around cities like
Denver or Richmond,

18:45.791 --> 18:46.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as you mentioned.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so what did
you find?

18:48.894 --> 18:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: So, you know, as
you said, for
many decades after World War II,
suburbs were

18:53.899 --> 18:59.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
predominantly white,
predominantly middle
or upper middle class and also
conservative.

18:59.805 --> 19:05.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are communities where
people voted for
Ronald Reagan or Richard Nixon
by 30-plus

19:05.211 --> 19:06.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points in many counties around
the country.

19:06.912 --> 19:11.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we're seeing in the
last two decades
especially is a demographic
shift.

19:11.650 --> 19:18.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now suburban America is younger,
more diverse
and more liberal than it's ever
been before.

19:18.124 --> 19:20.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's having a clear impact
on the way
that these areas are voting.

19:20.960 --> 19:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, let's take
those one at
a time and start with younger.

19:24.363 --> 19:26.265 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How are the suburbs getting
younger?

19:26.298 --> 19:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: I was struck in
doing some of
this reporting by the amount of
people I met

19:30.569 --> 19:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who were millennials, people
that are age
18 to 35 who live in suburbs not
necessarily

19:37.043 --> 19:38.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because it's their first choice.

19:38.878 --> 19:42.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sure, there are some people who
move out there
for all the traditional reasons,
for a bigger

19:42.281 --> 19:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
home, for a better public school
district,
but a lot of younger people
would prefer to

19:46.485 --> 19:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
live in cities, but they can no
longer afford
to, because major cities like
D.C., like New

19:52.458 --> 19:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York City, like Denver and other
places, have
become so expensive, that it's
hard to afford

19:57.063 --> 20:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to live, to rent or even buy a
home there.

20:00.099 --> 20:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they're settling in
suburbs and they're
bringing sort of a different
culture and a

20:03.469 --> 20:05.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different political attitude
with them as
well.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're saying
at the same
time they're getting younger,
they're also

20:08.974 --> 20:10.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
getting more diverse.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How is that happening?

20:12.344 --> 20:17.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: So, as recently as
1990, census
data shows that 81 percent of
America's suburban

20:17.283 --> 20:19.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
population was white.

20:19.185 --> 20:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By 2010, that number has dropped
to 65 percent
and it has gone down even
further since then.

20:25.124 --> 20:30.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as a result, we see that
more and more
African-Americans, Hispanics and
Asians are

20:30.896 --> 20:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moving to the suburbs, to the
point that now
all three of those groups, a
majority of those

20:35.801 --> 20:39.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
groups live in suburban
communities, not in
urban areas.

20:39.138 --> 20:42.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this may go
hand in hand
with the other two when you talk
about getting

20:42.341 --> 20:43.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
younger and getting more
diverse.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're saying the suburbs
are also getting
more liberal.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL BUSH: Yes.

20:47.713 --> 20:51.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we heard in the last segment,
these communities
tend to vote more Democratic,
whether it's

20:51.617 --> 20:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-American voters or
Hispanics or millennials.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are groups that vote in
larger numbers
for Democrats.

20:58.324 --> 21:03.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're living in a place
where, in the
past, a majority of the voters
were Republican,

21:03.529 --> 21:04.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but now they're there.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're voting Democratic.

21:06.432 --> 21:09.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're seeing a really
interesting shift
play out all over the country.

21:09.735 --> 21:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, take a county, for example,
like Arapahoe
outside of Denver, where,
through the '50s,

21:15.774 --> 21:20.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
'60s, '70s, and '80s, the
Republican nominee
was getting more than 30 percent
of the vote

21:20.846 --> 21:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in presidential elections.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.517 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By the '90s, that had dropped
into the teens.

21:24.550 --> 21:28.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Barack Obama won Arapahoe County
for the first
time in 40 years.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.556 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is doing very
well there.

21:30.589 --> 21:34.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're seeing that same trend
play out
in key battleground states, from
Ohio, to

21:35.027 --> 21:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Virginia, to North Carolina, and
beyond.

21:36.929 --> 21:40.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Dan, if this
is what is
happening across the country,
what can Republicans

21:40.833 --> 21:42.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do about it?

21:42.201 --> 21:47.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do they put out an appealing
message with
these demographics?

21:47.473 --> 21:48.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DANIEL BUSH: It's a good
question, Judy.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is something that the
Republican Party
is really struggling with.

21:51.844 --> 21:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are people in the
party who see
the suburbs as a sort of key
battleground

21:56.949 --> 22:03.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they can maybe win back or
win over if
they make a sort of new appeal
to suburbanites,

22:03.622 --> 22:06.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially these younger, more
liberal suburbanites
that we're talking about.

22:06.625 --> 22:11.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, people I spoke with said
that if the Republican
Party can move to the middle on
some social

22:11.630 --> 22:18.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues, can focus more on taxes
and the economy
and so forth, instead of
same-sex marriage

22:18.437 --> 22:23.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or abortion, and other
hot-button topics,
they might be able to win over
this new class

22:23.475 --> 22:24.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of suburbanites.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And do you have a
sense of
whether that's already
happening?

22:26.645 --> 22:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL BUSH: Well, it's hard to
tell.

22:28.781 --> 22:30.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is happening in some places.

22:30.316 --> 22:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're seeing Republicans are
hanging on still
in some suburban areas.

22:34.086 --> 22:37.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was down in Henrico County in
Richmond,
and that was certainly the case.

22:37.823 --> 22:39.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, overall, it's a big problem
for them
right now.

22:40.025 --> 22:45.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Daniel Bush on
the suburbs,
thank you very much.

22:45.831 --> 22:52.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL BUSH: Thank you.

22:53.005 --> 23:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The battle to
retake Iraq's
second-largest city, Mosul, from
ISIS is nearing

23:00.713 --> 23:02.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the end of its third week.

23:02.514 --> 23:06.986 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For an update on how the
operation is proceeding
and the larger fight against the
extremists

23:07.019 --> 23:09.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Iraq and Syria, we turn to
Brett McGurk.

23:09.588 --> 23:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the special presidential
envoy for the
Global Coalition to Counter
ISIL.

23:13.259 --> 23:16.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke with him a short time
ago from the
State Department.

23:16.495 --> 23:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brett McGurk, thanks for joining
us.

23:18.664 --> 23:25.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past few weeks, we have
seen the images
of forces slowly moving into the
suburbs of

23:25.237 --> 23:26.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mosul.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How long is it going to take to
retake the
city?

23:28.173 --> 23:28.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRETT MCGURK, Special
Presidential Envoy for
the Global Coalition to Counter
ISIL: Well,

23:28.841 --> 23:29.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari, thanks for having me.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just got back from about a
week in Iraq.

23:31.043 --> 23:35.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're the third weekend of
this operation.

23:35.180 --> 23:40.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is really a multimonth
operation to clear
and hold and stabilize a city of
this size.

23:40.919 --> 23:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have always expected ISIL to
defend the
city.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have suicide bombers.

23:46.358 --> 23:48.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're quite literally a
suicidal movement.

23:48.861 --> 23:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have spent two years
digging tunnels
and defenses.

23:52.097 --> 23:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you saw over the last
couple of weeks
was really the Iraqi security
forces and the

23:55.801 --> 24:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peshmerga pushing through kind
of the outer
crust of the defense.

24:01.140 --> 24:04.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they broke through that
about a week ago.

24:04.043 --> 24:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we have a fairly rapid
advance, particularly
into the western area of the
city.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the other axes are also
catching up.

24:14.486 --> 24:16.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's really going ahead of
schedule right
now.

24:16.989 --> 24:20.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I would just caution your
viewers that
this will take some time.

24:20.559 --> 24:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK, you said
something.

24:22.728 --> 24:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Best-case scenario, let's say
you're able
to capture and hold.

24:25.097 --> 24:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That third word, stabilize, the
easy part
might be the capture and hold.

24:30.336 --> 24:34.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you balance all the
different ethnic
tensions that are already there?

24:34.873 --> 24:38.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have also seen images of
tanks coming
in waving Shia flags.

24:38.844 --> 24:41.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's flaring some of these
tensions back
up?

24:41.280 --> 24:44.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Well, so, we have
been at this
for two years now in Iran.

24:44.450 --> 24:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have taken back over 55
percent of territory
that ISIL used to hold in Iraq.

24:49.988 --> 24:54.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, so far, ISIL has not
retaken any territory.

24:54.426 --> 24:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And there is a reason for that.

24:56.228 --> 24:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're not only focused on the
operations to
win the military battle, but
also on what

24:59.431 --> 25:00.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
comes next.

25:00.432 --> 25:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So we call it stabilization.

25:02.301 --> 25:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's really about getting
people back into
their homes, returning the
internally displaced

25:05.571 --> 25:07.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people to their homes.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is extraordinarily
difficult.

25:09.007 --> 25:12.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look historically in a
context like
this of how long it's going to
take, it can

25:12.311 --> 25:14.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
take years, if ever.

25:14.646 --> 25:17.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you look at the situation
in Iraq,
I will just give you some
examples.

25:17.683 --> 25:22.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The city of Tikrit, that's a
Sunni Arab city
in a mixed province.

25:22.921 --> 25:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISIL cleared out the entire
population.

25:25.791 --> 25:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by working locally with
local leaders
-- and the central government
led by Prime

25:30.095 --> 25:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Minister Abadi has a policy of
decentralization,
of really trying to empower
people from the

25:34.566 --> 25:35.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bottom up.

25:35.834 --> 25:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The entire population of Tikrit
has returned
to their homes.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is extremely difficult.

25:41.340 --> 25:45.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will apply the same lessons
in Mosul that
we have applied as in other
areas of the country.

25:45.177 --> 25:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will work with the local
officials, the
local governor, the local
council and all

25:49.782 --> 25:54.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the local notables to ensure
that the stabilization
resources are in place, and the
resources

25:54.653 --> 25:57.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are in place, and that we have a
governing
structure in place.

25:57.656 --> 26:02.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's difficult, but we will
use the same
model that we used in other
places.

26:02.327 --> 26:03.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It will take time.

26:03.996 --> 26:07.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be problems, but I
think, so far,
we're off to a pretty good
start.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
I know you
have still got a lot of work
ahead of you

26:09.868 --> 26:12.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Mosul, but let's look forward
to Raqqa
a little bit.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This seems to be an ISIL
stronghold.

26:14.440 --> 26:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is certainly on the target
list for anybody
who wants to take out ISIL.

26:18.677 --> 26:19.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
When does that happen?

26:19.678 --> 26:21.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who helps us with that?

26:21.079 --> 26:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Well, I would just
say it will
be starting pretty soon.

26:24.416 --> 26:28.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one reason it will be
starting pretty
soon is that Raqqa -- you know,
if Mosul is

26:28.554 --> 26:32.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of their national capital
-- this is
where Baghdadi declared their
phony caliphate

26:32.624 --> 26:34.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- Raqqa is their administrative
capital.

26:34.893 --> 26:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Raqqa is where they're planning
and plotting
attacks against us, against our
partiers.

26:40.466 --> 26:45.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're obviously using
intelligence and all
sorts of information sources to
eliminate

26:45.704 --> 26:47.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
those leaders when we find them.

26:47.673 --> 26:51.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most importantly, Muhammad
Adnani was their
overall operational planner of
external attacks.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was in Raqqa for some time.

26:53.679 --> 26:58.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were able to find and locate
him and ultimately
eliminate him and some of his
deputies in

26:58.550 --> 27:01.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an area to just the west of
Raqqa.

27:01.820 --> 27:05.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking with our local
forces on the
ground and we're talking, of
course, with

27:05.324 --> 27:07.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our allies in Turkey.

27:07.259 --> 27:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking with the Syrian
opposition constantly
about the force makeup that will
be needed

27:11.797 --> 27:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to liberate the city of Raqqa in
a way that
is ultimately stabilizing.

27:15.334 --> 27:18.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We seem to
have a tricky
set of partnerships here in
going after ISIL.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the one hand, you have got
Turkey, a strong
NATO ally.

27:21.607 --> 27:25.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, on the other hand, you have
got the Syrian
Kurds or the YPG, which we have
been allied

27:25.410 --> 27:30.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with, but here are our two
allies really actively
fighting against each other.

27:30.082 --> 27:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey has just recently bombed
the YPG in
multiple locations.

27:33.619 --> 27:36.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They don't want the Kurds
involved in retaking
Raqqa in any way.

27:36.922 --> 27:40.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got -- how do you get
both of these
partners to be on mission?

27:41.026 --> 27:45.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Yes, so, I mean,
obviously,
it's an inherently complex
situation.

27:45.264 --> 27:49.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why we're constantly
engaged with
all of these different actors.

27:49.334 --> 27:54.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're very determined to
make sure that
we are totally transparent with
Turkey with

27:54.072 --> 27:56.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
every single thing we are doing
in Syria.

27:56.108 --> 28:01.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're also working with our
partners on
the ground inside Syria, the
Syrian Democratic

28:01.246 --> 28:04.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forces, and with the Syrian
opposition.

28:04.349 --> 28:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what we try to do is try to
encourage
as much as possible a united
focus on ISIL.

28:09.888 --> 28:14.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ultimately, what we're doing is
liberating
territory that is inside Syria.

28:14.259 --> 28:18.997 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want Syrians from the local
area to liberate
their own territory.

28:19.031 --> 28:24.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fundamental premise of this
campaign against
ISIL, at least in Iraq and
Syria, it's a global

28:24.536 --> 28:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign, but in the Iraq and
Syria component,
is locally based forces to hold
ground after

28:30.208 --> 28:32.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ISIL is gone.

28:32.044 --> 28:35.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's one reason we
have actually
been able to hold the territory
that we have

28:35.080 --> 28:36.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
retaken from ISIL.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at what we have done,
for example,
in Anbar Province, and it's the
same premise

28:39.885 --> 28:41.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

28:41.720 --> 28:46.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as we begin to move south
towards Raqqa,
the forces that we want as a
vanguard to that

28:46.558 --> 28:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force are locally based Arab
forces who know
the terrain and know the
territory.

28:51.897 --> 28:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a number of them already
signed up.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have the training platforms
ready to go.

28:55.867 --> 28:57.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is all being done as we
speak.

28:57.769 --> 29:01.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think you will see some
initial movement
towards Raqqa fairly soon.

29:01.306 --> 29:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not going to get too far
ahead of
our military colleagues as they
put this together.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have to move on Raqqa
soon.

29:07.779 --> 29:09.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to move on it fast.

29:09.214 --> 29:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have to move on it in a
very deliberate
and smart way.

29:12.618 --> 29:16.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that will require constant
engagement
with all of our partners, many
of whom, of

29:16.054 --> 29:19.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
course, do have divergent
opinions and divergent
viewpoints.

29:19.591 --> 29:23.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Brett McGurk,
thanks for joining us.

29:23.295 --> 29:31.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRETT MCGURK: Thanks so much.

29:31.203 --> 29:35.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:35.207 --> 29:41.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": two
men give
their personal advice on staying
out of jail;

29:41.346 --> 29:48.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the curse is broken -- the
Chicago Cubs
celebrate their first World
Series championship

29:48.220 --> 29:50.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in 108 years.

29:50.822 --> 29:56.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But first: How is the
presidential campaign
affecting Donald Trump's
business empire and

29:56.294 --> 29:58.764 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the brand that is so central to
it?

29:58.797 --> 30:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
has the story.

30:01.867 --> 30:05.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series,
Making Sense.

30:05.871 --> 30:14.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: From the get-go,
Donald Trump
the candidate has pushed Donald
Trump the

30:14.246 --> 30:15.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
brand.

30:15.614 --> 30:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We have Trump Steaks.

30:17.349 --> 30:21.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, if you want to
take one,
we will charge you about, what,
50 bucks a

30:21.286 --> 30:22.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
steak.

30:22.287 --> 30:23.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"Trump" magazine is out.

30:23.288 --> 30:25.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's called "The Jewel of
Palm Beach."

30:25.390 --> 30:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we -- it's all -- it goes
all of my clubs.

30:27.225 --> 30:28.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have had it for many years.

30:28.927 --> 30:29.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's the magazine.

30:29.928 --> 30:30.896 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's great.

30:30.929 --> 30:31.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Anybody want one?

30:31.930 --> 30:33.765 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here, take one.

30:33.799 --> 30:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But it's not so
much products
Trump's been hyping as his
locations, locations

30:37.369 --> 30:39.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and locations.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: A lot of people
think this will
be the greatest par three
anywhere in the

30:41.840 --> 30:42.808 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's 800 acres in the middle of
Miami.

30:44.609 --> 30:46.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been a tremendous success.

30:46.712 --> 30:51.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the most coveted piece
of real estate
in Washington, D.C.

30:51.616 --> 30:55.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Coveted, that had
been the mark
of a Trump-branded property.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT PASSIKOFF, Brand
Consultant: If you
were looking for an apartment,
is this place

30:59.558 --> 31:00.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
OK for you?

31:00.759 --> 31:02.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes.

31:02.094 --> 31:06.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT PASSIKOFF: How about this
place with
the big Trump on it?

31:06.264 --> 31:10.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Brand consultant
Robert Passikoff
has studied Donald Trump for
decades.

31:10.469 --> 31:13.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT PASSIKOFF: He was a human
brand.

31:13.238 --> 31:17.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was an icon for the good
life.

31:17.175 --> 31:19.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People aspire to luxury.

31:19.377 --> 31:21.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They aspire to glamour.

31:21.313 --> 31:23.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They aspire to money.

31:24.015 --> 31:32.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The great brands imbue what
would just be
a product with real, real values
that people

31:32.691 --> 31:34.426 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aspire to.

31:34.459 --> 31:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: For which they have
been willing
to pony up a premium, 30 percent
for condos

31:38.764 --> 31:40.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and hotel rooms.

31:40.665 --> 31:45.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT PASSIKOFF: You and I
could have built
the building, and it could've
been a wonderfully

31:45.337 --> 31:52.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
luxurious building, and we could
get $1,000
dollars a square foot for our
apartments.

31:52.210 --> 31:58.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if we put the Trump name on
it, we could
get $1,300 or more for it.

31:58.583 --> 32:03.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The value of
Trump's brand going
forward was actually a matter of
public dispute

32:03.321 --> 32:05.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before the campaign.

32:05.123 --> 32:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He claimed it was worth $3.3
billion.

32:08.126 --> 32:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Forbes" magazine put the total
at just $125
million.

32:12.097 --> 32:16.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what is the human brand
known as Trump
really worth?

32:16.401 --> 32:21.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One recent hint, the latest
jewel in the crown,
Washington, D.C.'s old post
office building,

32:21.940 --> 32:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now a deluxe hotel, which the
Trumps debuted
just last week.

32:28.079 --> 32:37.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Many, many years
of love and
happiness and everything else.

32:37.355 --> 32:38.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Inside, love and
happiness.

32:38.356 --> 32:39.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Outside, not so much.

32:39.591 --> 32:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROTESTERS: The people united
will never be
defeated.

32:41.426 --> 32:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: More ominous for
the Trump brand,
rooms expected to fetch $700 or
more a night

32:46.598 --> 32:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been advertised for $400
and were still
going empty when rival hotels
were fully booked.

32:53.705 --> 32:59.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in Trump's business home
base, New York
City, what I like to call
anecdata -- random

32:59.544 --> 33:02.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interviews, that is -- suggests
a similar
trend.

33:02.814 --> 33:06.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're right across from the
Trump International
Hotel, right?

33:06.384 --> 33:15.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How many of you are more likely
to buy a Trump
product or go to the Trump Hotel
now?

33:15.227 --> 33:16.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Less likely?

33:17.028 --> 33:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I would be less inclined
now, given
the things that have come out
over the course

33:21.933 --> 33:23.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this campaign.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Less likely as well.

33:24.769 --> 33:25.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

33:25.770 --> 33:26.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Less likely.

33:26.771 --> 33:28.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Absolutely.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't want to give someone
business that
kind of treats people that way.

33:30.041 --> 33:34.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I never bought a Trump
product, but I
been in the Trump International
Hotel.

33:34.079 --> 33:36.414 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Would you go there
again?

33:36.448 --> 33:37.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Not anymore.

33:37.482 --> 33:41.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I buy labels, but not
Trump, no longer.

33:41.519 --> 33:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I'm not buying no Trump
products.

33:43.154 --> 33:44.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Why not?

33:44.155 --> 33:45.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Because he's an idiot.

33:45.891 --> 33:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Of course, this is
true-blue
Midtown Manhattan, not exactly a
bastion of

33:49.928 --> 33:51.463 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump support.

33:51.496 --> 33:56.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, liberal
enclaves are where
so many Trump properties sit.

33:56.134 --> 34:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And visits are demonstrably down
at almost
all of them, says Sarah Spagnolo
of mobile

34:01.673 --> 34:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
app firm Foursquare, which
tracks foot traffic
electronically.

34:05.410 --> 34:09.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SPAGNOLO, Foursquare:
Fewer people are
going to his properties since he
announced

34:09.481 --> 34:11.082 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his campaign.

34:11.116 --> 34:15.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is actual data
from some
50 million monthly users of the
app.

34:15.186 --> 34:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You know, I'm
automatically
attracted to beautiful -- I just
start kissing

34:17.923 --> 34:18.890 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

34:18.924 --> 34:20.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's like a magnet.

34:20.292 --> 34:22.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Gathered before the
"Access Hollywood"
tape surfaced.

34:22.694 --> 34:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH SPAGNOLO: When you look at
the 15 months
before Trump announced his
candidacy in June

34:27.565 --> 34:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of 2015, as compared to the 15
months following
that announcement, there's been
a drop in

34:32.437 --> 34:34.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
absolute visits of 17 percent.

34:34.272 --> 34:38.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you look at women in
particular,
there's been a drop of 21
percent.

34:38.977 --> 34:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we feel rather confident
that the decreases
that we're seeing in foot
traffic are likely

34:43.682 --> 34:45.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be correlated with revenue.

34:45.517 --> 34:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: We did find one new
Trump consumer.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP SUPPORTER: I buy his hat.

34:50.255 --> 34:51.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I buy his T-shirt.

34:51.856 --> 34:53.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I buy everything.

34:53.625 --> 34:56.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And when we asked
Donald Trump
Jr. for his appraisal, he
pooh-poohed the

34:57.028 --> 34:58.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
notion of brand depreciation.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR., Son of Donald
Trump: People
are going to react.

35:00.298 --> 35:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're going to overreact.

35:01.967 --> 35:04.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're going to do what it
takes to -- oftentimes
to fill a sort of P.C. niche.

35:04.135 --> 35:07.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, in the long run,
it's not going
to change anything for us.

35:07.739 --> 35:13.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And given the
fervency of Trump's
support elsewhere, it's
impossible to know

35:13.178 --> 35:14.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
otherwise.

35:14.479 --> 35:15.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR.: There's
aspects of it that
could be great.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not doing this to leverage
business,
you know?

35:18.416 --> 35:21.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When my father did this, he's
like, could
be good, could be bad, I don't
know.

35:21.653 --> 35:27.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in the end, none of that
matters, because
what matters is making sure we
fix the country.

35:27.258 --> 35:29.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, that's the bigger
message.

35:29.127 --> 35:34.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for him, it was a much
bigger picture
than what -- there was no
consideration as

35:34.499 --> 35:35.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to what it would do to the
business.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was about, I have to do this
an American.

35:38.069 --> 35:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Nela Richardson
chief economist
at real estate firm Redfin,
claims the brand

35:44.009 --> 35:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has become a clear and present
danger.

35:46.244 --> 35:50.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NELA RICHARDSON, Redfin: Before
Trump became
the Republican nominee in 2015,
there was

35:50.515 --> 35:52.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
definitely a premium.

35:52.450 --> 35:56.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
After Trump became the
Republican nominee,
that premium disappeared.

35:56.454 --> 36:00.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was like there was nothing
special at all
about having a Trump-branded
condo.

36:00.625 --> 36:05.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: As a result, says
Richardson,
sellers are no longer touting
the Trump name.

36:05.730 --> 36:11.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NELA RICHARDSON: After that
brand took a hit,
and there was less good buyer
sentiment towards

36:11.202 --> 36:15.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the brand, there was this big
drop-off in
that use of the Trump name.

36:15.173 --> 36:19.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, for condos that are
currently listed,
far fewer of them actually use
that Trump

36:19.611 --> 36:21.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
name in the listing.

36:21.446 --> 36:24.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: In fact, in
Manhattan, there's
even evidence that the Trump
brand is becoming

36:24.949 --> 36:26.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a liability.

36:26.885 --> 36:32.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to StreetEasy.com,
sales of Trump-branded
condos dropped more than 26
percent in the

36:32.791 --> 36:36.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
past year, a period when the
overall market
was up.

36:37.028 --> 36:43.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at Trump International and
Trump Place,
more condos were delisted this
year than last.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Film and TV producer Linda
Gottlieb lives
at Trump Place.

36:46.037 --> 36:49.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA GOTTLIEB, Film and TV
Producer: The
brand is only as good as the
name, right?

36:49.874 --> 36:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you think of Trump, and you
think of beautiful
lobbies and well-built
buildings, then of

36:55.313 --> 36:57.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
course the brand is worth
something.

36:57.315 --> 37:05.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you think of Trump and
you think of
racist, misogynist, lying,
anti-immigrant

37:05.523 --> 37:06.691 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- what did I leave out?

37:06.724 --> 37:09.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then the brand is certainly
worth a lot less.

37:09.260 --> 37:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Trump Place is a
complex of seven
buildings, condos and
apartments, that Trump

37:14.566 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
helped develop, but doesn't own.

37:16.768 --> 37:22.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recently, Gottlieb, who's lived
here for four
years, started a petition to
remove his name

37:22.407 --> 37:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the rental buildings; 500
of her neighbors
have already signed.

37:26.411 --> 37:31.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDA GOTTLIEB: Mr. Trump can
put his name
on steaks and wine bottles and
neckties, and

37:31.716 --> 37:33.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't have to buy those
things.

37:33.618 --> 37:37.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I do have to come into my
home every day,
and I do have to see his name.

37:37.188 --> 37:40.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But she won't have
to see his
name as much as she used to.

37:40.725 --> 37:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The landlord is replacing the
Trump-named
doormats and building staff
uniforms.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDA GOTTLIEB: I'm embarrassed
to tell a
taxi driver where I live.

37:48.633 --> 37:51.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm embarrassed to have my kids
come.

37:51.035 --> 37:53.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People say you -- you live in a
Trump building?

37:53.872 --> 37:56.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How can you feel good about this
being your
home?

37:56.374 --> 38:01.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Robert Passikoff
thinks even
the Trumps are now distancing
themselves from

38:01.279 --> 38:03.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the all-too-human brand.

38:03.047 --> 38:09.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT PASSIKOFF: The new hotel
chain that
Trump, in fact, does own is
going under a

38:09.587 --> 38:10.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
name other than Trump.

38:10.955 --> 38:11.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Scion.

38:12.023 --> 38:13.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT PASSIKOFF: Scion.

38:13.825 --> 38:20.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're hoping that they will
sneak this one
by as something that millennials
will come

38:20.532 --> 38:22.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

38:22.367 --> 38:25.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Nothing sneaky
about it, says
Donald Trump Jr., a key
executive of the Trump

38:25.670 --> 38:28.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Organization, and indeed the
scion of the
family.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR.: We wanted to
make sure that
we could actually take advantage
of some of

38:31.876 --> 38:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these great four-star properties
that are
luxury, that are more catered to
perhaps a

38:35.079 --> 38:38.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millennial crowd than what you
have seen,
whether it's Chicago, whether
it's D.C., whether,

38:38.950 --> 38:41.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know, these opulent, very
luxury hotels.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we have been working on that
for years.

38:43.188 --> 38:48.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And in any case, he
insists,
his father's controversial
campaign will have

38:48.126 --> 38:50.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
little effect on the family
brand.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR.: I think his
brand has been
around.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's been a relatively
controversial guy for
decades.

38:54.065 --> 38:56.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You know, I think that
continues.

38:56.167 --> 39:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there's some people that
may be affected
by it, and there's others that
you pick up.

39:00.271 --> 39:03.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the end, it's probably, you
know, net-neutral,
and doesn't really change much.

39:03.241 --> 39:05.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But we will see.

39:05.043 --> 39:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Reporting from
branded Trump
properties up and down the East
Coast, this

39:08.546 --> 39:11.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is economics correspondent Paul
Solman.

39:11.449 --> 39:18.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, online, the
election has
helped reveal that a lot of
voters are angry

39:18.556 --> 39:24.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about America's economic
challenges, but how
grounded is that anger in the
facts?

HARI SREENIVASAN: Next to
another in our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
hear from

39:40.511 --> 39:42.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interesting people about their
passions.

39:42.447 --> 39:47.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Vaughn Brown and Ivan
Mayo, who were
both incarcerated as teenagers
at Rikers Island.

39:47.852 --> 39:52.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now in their early 20s, they're
part of the
Getting Out and Staying Out
reentry program

39:52.991 --> 39:54.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
based in East Harlem.

39:54.792 --> 39:56.494 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VAUGHN BROWN, Formerly
Incarcerated: Every
day you wake up while you're
incarcerated,

39:56.527 --> 40:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you think about that one day
that you got
locked up.

40:00.398 --> 40:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If I would have done things
differently 40
minutes, if I would have decided
that, you

40:05.136 --> 40:09.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know what, stay home, how much
different my
life could be and would be now.

40:09.107 --> 40:12.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
IVAN MAYO, Formerly
Incarcerated: Once you
start doing grown man time, it's
grown man

40:12.477 --> 40:14.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business.

40:14.212 --> 40:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of things you got
to do to keep
yourself safe, occupied and just
get home

40:19.350 --> 40:20.852 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in one piece.

40:20.885 --> 40:32.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VAUGHN BROWN: I got involved
with the wrong
crowd.

40:32.797 --> 40:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's not an excuse for the
bad decisions
that I made.

40:35.833 --> 40:39.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
March 3, 2011, I got arrested
for attempt
robbery in the second-degree.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IVAN MAYO: When I was 13, I was
incarcerated.

40:42.707 --> 40:44.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I never really took things
serious.

40:44.342 --> 40:49.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I always thought things was a
joke until reality
really hit me.

40:49.047 --> 40:55.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VAUGHN BROWN: My first day in
Rikers Island,
it was kind of like, I'm
actually locked up.

40:55.053 --> 40:57.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I can't believe that I'm
actually locked up.

40:57.555 --> 41:00.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just wanted to like wake up
and it would
all be a dream.

41:00.858 --> 41:03.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IVAN MAYO: I felt like my life
was over.

41:03.728 --> 41:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I felt like there was no coming
back.

41:05.396 --> 41:07.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: You spent 13 to 20 in
the system?

41:07.965 --> 41:09.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
IVAN MAYO: Yes.

41:09.467 --> 41:14.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, that bothers me a lot, too,
because I
never really had a childhood.

41:14.305 --> 41:19.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I say, and the way I
act now is how
I would have act when I was
younger.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VAUGHN BROWN: I got into a few
fights.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was -- a lot of it was
back to back.

41:23.114 --> 41:27.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If someone seen that this person
did something
to you and you did nothing about
it, then

41:27.585 --> 41:29.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you open the door for everyone.

41:29.187 --> 41:32.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, eventually, they sent me to
the box for
about four months.

41:32.357 --> 41:33.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: What is the box?

41:33.825 --> 41:35.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VAUGHN BROWN: Oh, it's solitary
confinement,
basically.

41:35.860 --> 41:40.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're surrounded by your
thoughts, everything
you did, everything you wanted
to do, what

41:40.198 --> 41:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you could have did better.

41:41.866 --> 41:45.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After that, that I decided that,
whenever
I get out of jail, I'm never
coming back.

41:45.436 --> 41:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVAN MAYO: I always tell myself
I'm not going
back.

41:47.905 --> 41:49.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm going to always stick to
that.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will never go back to prison.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a place for anybody.

41:52.310 --> 41:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a -- I wouldn't wish it
on my worst
enemy.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think it corrects you.

41:56.781 --> 42:03.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it makes you kind of
wiser, but it
gets you a little angry at the
same time.

42:03.121 --> 42:06.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VAUGHN BROWN: Fortunately, for
me, when I
came out of the box, I went back
to school.

42:06.891 --> 42:12.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, I read about 70-plus
books, social
psychology, psychology, the
foundation of

42:12.430 --> 42:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
social work practice, just to
name a few.

42:15.099 --> 42:18.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: And you like cooking;
is that right?

42:18.102 --> 42:19.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IVAN MAYO: Oh, yes, of course.

42:19.637 --> 42:22.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a chef, Mr. Chef.

42:22.073 --> 42:23.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: What do you make?

42:23.875 --> 42:26.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVAN MAYO: On occasional times,
I probably
make salad.

42:26.611 --> 42:28.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everybody asks me.

42:28.312 --> 42:30.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wake me up out of my sleep
if I'm sleeping
on the table, yo, make some
salad.

42:30.214 --> 42:33.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm like I can do that.

42:33.418 --> 42:38.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VAUGHN BROWN: With being branded
a felon,
you're denied employment,
housing, and education

42:38.356 --> 42:40.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a lot of ways.

42:40.158 --> 42:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for a lot of people, the
reason why they
turn back to crime is because,
if I'm being

42:44.295 --> 42:47.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
denied all this, people now feel
like they
have limited options.

42:47.732 --> 42:50.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that point, it's now easy for
a person
to say, you know what, I'm going
to stick

42:50.868 --> 42:52.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with what I'm already
comfortable with anyway.

42:52.737 --> 42:56.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IVAN MAYO: It do bother me when
people realize
that I have been in jail, and
they're like,

42:56.741 --> 42:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oh, you missed this, you missed
this type
of event, you missed this event.

42:59.844 --> 43:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Like -- and it bothers me.

43:00.845 --> 43:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I always wanted to be a part of
stuff.

43:02.613 --> 43:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How they say -- what is the
saying?

43:03.848 --> 43:05.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You trip and fall, you got to
get back up
or whatever?

43:05.349 --> 43:11.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess I tripped for a long
time man and
had to get back up on my feet.

43:11.689 --> 43:12.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Ivan Mayo.

43:12.690 --> 43:13.825 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VAUGHN BROWN: My name is Vaughn
Brown.

43:13.858 --> 43:16.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IVAN MAYO: This is my Brief But
Spectacular
take...

43:16.761 --> 43:19.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VAUGHN BROWN: ... on getting out
and staying
out of jail.

43:19.597 --> 43:27.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
additional
Brief But Spectacular series on

HARI SREENIVASAN: Was there any
other way
for this World Series to end,
other than with

43:40.518 --> 43:42.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an epic finish?

43:42.320 --> 43:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two of the league's oldest
teams, the Chicago
Cubs and the Cleveland Indians,
were both

43:45.189 --> 43:50.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eager to make history and ready
to end decades
of frustration as they battled
to the end.

43:50.761 --> 43:54.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The series finally ended with a
stunning roller-coaster
ride in game seven.

43:54.599 --> 43:57.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The Cubs win the World
Series!

43:57.235 --> 44:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After more
than a century
of frustration, fandom and
futility, the Cubs

44:04.208 --> 44:05.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
celebrated in Cleveland.

44:06.010 --> 44:09.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They became the first baseball
team since
1979 to win the championship on
the road after

44:09.814 --> 44:13.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming back from a
three-game-to-one deficit.

44:13.317 --> 44:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The game lasted more than
four-and-a-half-hours,
including a rain delay, before
finally ending

44:14.952 --> 44:16.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the 10th inning.

44:16.354 --> 44:17.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Players raced around the field
and celebrated
in the locker room.

44:17.655 --> 44:18.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Center fielder Dexter Fowler hit
a home run
to start the game.

44:18.623 --> 44:19.223 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEXTER FOWLER, Chicago Cubs
Player: I cried.

44:19.257 --> 44:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I cried like a little kid.

44:20.424 --> 44:21.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it hasn't been done in
a century
and some.

44:21.726 --> 44:23.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to be a part of this is
definitely -- it's
a pleasure.

44:23.528 --> 44:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Fans young and
old gathered
in the streets outside Wrigley
Field, even

44:25.296 --> 44:25.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writing names of loved ones on
the outside
wall of the ballpark, and they
celebrated

44:25.830 --> 44:27.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
throughout the city.

44:27.465 --> 44:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY POE, Chicago Cubs Fan: I
have been waiting
for a long time, 76 years old.

44:28.566 --> 44:29.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I couldn't wait to finally
get a championship.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.201 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they did for me tonight,
finally.

44:30.234 --> 44:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: You could have a heart
attack.

44:30.935 --> 44:31.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JERRY POE: Tell me about that.

44:31.502 --> 44:32.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: They deserve it.

44:32.503 --> 44:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the best team we have
had in years.

44:34.272 --> 44:35.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Cubs
jumped out early
and kept building their lead,
getting runs

44:35.339 --> 44:36.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against the best pitching squad
of the postseason.

44:36.207 --> 44:37.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By the fifth inning, they were
up 5-1.

44:37.742 --> 44:39.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then the Cubs pulled their
starting pitcher
for another ace, Jon Lester.

44:39.076 --> 44:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He threw a wild pitch that led
to two runs,
narrowing the gap.

44:40.011 --> 44:40.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in the eighth inning, this
happened.

44:40.511 --> 44:41.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The game was tied.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After a rain delay, the Cubs
scored the winning
runs in the 10th.

44:43.681 --> 44:44.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Suddenly, the so-called curses
of past Cub
lore were gone, an idea that had
crept back

44:44.515 --> 44:45.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into some players during the
game.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEN ZOBRIST, Chicago Cubs
Player: I got to
be honest.

44:47.051 --> 44:48.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When they came back in the
eighth, it was
on my mind a little bit.

44:48.786 --> 44:49.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Cubs manager
Joe Maddon
said it was time to end the talk
of curses.

44:49.854 --> 44:51.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE MADDON, Chicago Cubs Manger:
I love tradition.

44:51.489 --> 44:52.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think tradition is worth time
mentally,
and tradition is worth being
upheld.

44:52.323 --> 44:54.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But curses and superstitions are
not.

44:54.058 --> 44:56.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's really great for entire
Cubdom to
get beyond that moment and
continue to move

44:56.093 --> 44:56.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forward, because now, based on
the young players
we have in this organization, we
have an opportunity

44:56.761 --> 44:58.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be good for a long time.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For Cleveland,
whose fans
have been waiting for a title
for so long,

44:59.096 --> 44:59.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it was a painful loss.

44:59.964 --> 45:01.732 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the underdog Indians never
gave up.

45:01.766 --> 45:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERRY FRANCONA, Cleveland
Indians Manager:
I talked before the game about
being an honor

45:02.400 --> 45:03.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be in a game like that.

45:03.901 --> 45:04.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to be associated with those
players in
that clubhouse, it's an honor.

45:04.535 --> 45:05.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I just told them that.

45:05.069 --> 45:05.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's going to hurt.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It hurts because we care.

45:07.572 --> 45:08.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they need to walk with their
head held
high, because they left nothing
on the field.

45:08.706 --> 45:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's all the things we
ever ask them
to do.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They tried until there was
nothing left.

45:11.309 --> 45:12.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Cubs were
greeted in
the early hours of the day in
Chicago.

45:12.176 --> 45:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tomorrow, there will be a big
parade.

45:13.477 --> 45:15.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some perspective on this moment,
from a longtime
sportswriter.

45:15.246 --> 45:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lester Munson is a Chicago
native who has
covered sports for upwards of
two decades.

45:16.647 --> 45:17.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is a senior writer for ESPN
and joins us
tonight from Chicago.

45:17.582 --> 45:18.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where did you watch the game
last night?

45:18.916 --> 45:19.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LESTER MUNSON, ESPN: I watched
the game at
home with my wife.

45:19.450 --> 45:20.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We had a great time.

45:20.585 --> 45:22.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We stayed up late, and we loved
every minute
of it.

45:22.420 --> 45:22.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
there had to be
a few minutes you didn't love,
about the eighth

45:22.853 --> 45:23.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inning or so.

45:23.854 --> 45:25.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESTER MUNSON: The eighth inning
was a killer.

45:25.690 --> 45:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you are a lifetime Cub fan,
as I am, when
Davis hit that home run, you had
that sinking

45:26.791 --> 45:27.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
feeling that we have had so many
times as
Cub fans.

45:27.725 --> 45:28.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You thought, oh, no, it's
happening again.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're going to have another
tragedy.

45:30.294 --> 45:30.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then this team rallied after
the rain
delay, a glorious ending after
that temporary

45:30.595 --> 45:31.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
setback.

45:31.929 --> 45:33.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We don't do
sports much
on the "NewsHour."

45:33.698 --> 45:34.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every once in a while, we
announce the winner
of the World Series or the Super
Bowl.

45:34.932 --> 45:36.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But why was this win so
important for the
city of Chicago?

45:36.567 --> 45:37.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESTER MUNSON: It was important
for the city
of Chicago because of its
timing.

45:37.802 --> 45:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are in a time of trouble and
turmoil here
in Chicago.

45:38.636 --> 45:39.537 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The political leadership is
inept.

45:39.570 --> 45:40.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The school system is in
financial trouble.

45:40.571 --> 45:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have a murder rate that is
unacceptable.

45:41.706 --> 45:43.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is more trouble than any
city should
have.

45:43.641 --> 45:44.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then along comes this joyous
event, something
that everybody can enjoy,
something that everybody

45:44.175 --> 45:44.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can participate in.

45:44.875 --> 45:45.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was a bit of a surprise.

45:46.010 --> 45:47.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Cubs have not been
successful over the
decades.

45:47.912 --> 45:48.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although you could see this
coming, nevertheless,
it was a wonderful surprise at a
great time

45:48.579 --> 45:49.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the history of this city.

45:49.580 --> 45:50.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, put this
in perspective.

45:50.781 --> 45:52.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all heard about the 108-year
drought of
this event.

45:52.550 --> 45:53.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this is -- the essence of a
Cubs fan is
to be a guy who always roots for
the losing

45:53.351 --> 45:54.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
team, the lovable loser
sometimes.

45:54.385 --> 45:55.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LESTER MUNSON: There's no
question about that.

45:55.653 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is such a wonderful
experience to go to
Wrigley Field.

45:57.321 --> 46:02.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just to be there on a nice
evening or on a
sunny afternoon is an experience
all unto

46:02.693 --> 46:04.228 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
itself.

46:04.261 --> 46:08.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Winning was never really
necessary for Cub
fans.

46:08.432 --> 46:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We packed the venue, even though
the team
was mediocre.

46:12.803 --> 46:19.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, beginning last year, it
became apparent
that this was a different kind
of a Cub team.

46:19.677 --> 46:23.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other Cub teams would have
collapsed last
night in the eighth inning.

46:23.948 --> 46:29.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This team, instead of
collapsing, rallied
and won a glorious championship
for our city.

46:29.820 --> 46:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And the way
that this happened,
literally, game seven of a World
Series, on

46:36.460 --> 46:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the road, coming back from a
three-game deficit,
so many different layers of odds
stacked against

46:42.266 --> 46:44.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this squad.

46:44.035 --> 46:48.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESTER MUNSON: Everything seemed
to be going
wrong, and then, finally, Sunday
night, the

46:48.839 --> 46:53.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Cubs put on a terrific
demonstration of what
they have been doing all year.

46:53.444 --> 46:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They began the three-game
winning streak.

46:56.280 --> 47:02.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, as you suggest, in
Cleveland, in front
of Cleveland fans, with
everything on the

47:02.620 --> 47:05.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
line, it could have been a
tragedy.

47:05.089 --> 47:07.224 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there is something about
this team.

47:07.258 --> 47:09.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have a joy in what they do.

47:09.894 --> 47:14.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are very good at what they
do, and they
did it brilliantly last night.

47:14.298 --> 47:18.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there --
what's the mood
that you get on the street?

47:18.636 --> 47:23.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even in the past couple of
weeks, people have
been displaying their Chicago
roots around

47:23.307 --> 47:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the country where they are.

47:25.076 --> 47:31.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESTER MUNSON: Here on the
streets of Chicago,
you see W. flags everywhere, the
Cub flag

47:31.082 --> 47:33.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that shows a W. for a winning
team.

47:33.851 --> 47:34.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's on boats in the Chicago
River.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's on cars in the streets.

47:37.021 --> 47:41.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's in the windows of office
buildings.

47:41.192 --> 47:43.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's on the gates of residential
buildings.

47:43.527 --> 47:44.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You see it everywhere.

47:44.929 --> 47:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see that everybody
is participating
in this great event.

47:50.101 --> 47:55.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even Sox fans who might be
reluctant to join
the celebration are in the
middle of it now.

47:55.673 --> 47:57.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is nothing they can do.

47:57.608 --> 48:01.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Does this
change some element
of the identity of being a
Chicago Cubs fan?

48:01.812 --> 48:04.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now you're just another team
that's won the
World Series.

48:04.381 --> 48:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You don't have that long streak
going for
you, that thing to hate.

48:08.119 --> 48:14.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESTER MUNSON: I could feel a
change among
Cubs fans during the end of the
season and
