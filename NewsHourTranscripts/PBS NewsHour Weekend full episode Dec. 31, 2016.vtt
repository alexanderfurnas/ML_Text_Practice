04:18.892 --> 04:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF INCIDENTS THAT ARE CAUGHT ON

04:20.760 --> 04:21.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIDEO.

04:21.628 --> 04:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SEE ABOUT A 63% INCREASE IN

04:24.931 --> 04:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEATHS THAT OCCURRED THIS

04:26.600 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR THAT WERE CAPTURED EITHER

04:28.301 --> 04:30.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON OFFICERS' BODY CAMERAS OR BY

04:30.337 --> 04:31.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BYSTANDERS.

04:31.471 --> 04:33.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WE SEE THAT THERE HAS

04:33.707 --> 04:34.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN AN INCREASE OVER THE LAST

04:34.574 --> 04:35.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO YEARS, BUT WE KNOW THAT

04:35.976 --> 04:37.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S AN INCREASE, ALSO, IN

04:37.511 --> 04:38.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NUMBER OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS

04:38.311 --> 04:39.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

04:39.146 --> 04:40.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE ROUGHLY 18,000

04:40.313 --> 04:41.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPARTMENTS, AND FROM WHAT WE

04:41.681 --> 04:44.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND, NEARLY HALF OF THEM

04:44.017 --> 04:45.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE OFFICERS THAT ARE EQUIPPED

04:45.051 --> 04:46.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH BODY-WORN CAMERAS.

04:46.353 --> 04:47.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S IMPORTANT

04:47.521 --> 04:49.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION, TOO, NOT JUST IN

04:49.389 --> 04:51.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOCUMENTING THESE INCIDENTS, BUT

04:51.258 --> 04:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE PROSECUTIONS OF OFFICERS

04:53.426 --> 04:54.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS WELL, IF THEY ARE

04:54.361 --> 04:55.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTIGATED.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: NOW, THE F.B.I.

04:56.429 --> 04:57.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO KEEPS TRACK OF THESE

04:57.597 --> 04:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBERS, BUT THEIR NUMBERS ARE

04:58.932 --> 05:00.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEARLY HALF OF THE "POST'S"

05:00.967 --> 05:01.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTING.

05:01.835 --> 05:03.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY IS THAT?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT WE

05:05.172 --> 05:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD FOUND AS WELL.

05:06.206 --> 05:09.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE FIRST YEAR-- THOSE

05:09.109 --> 05:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBERS ARE VOLUNTARILY

05:10.043 --> 05:10.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTED.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO POLICE DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE

05:11.711 --> 05:14.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY AREN'T REQUIRED TO GIVE

05:14.147 --> 05:15.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT INFORMATION TO THE F.B.I.,

05:15.782 --> 05:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WHAT WE FOUND IN OUR TWO

05:17.450 --> 05:18.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS OF REPORTING IS THAT THE

05:18.852 --> 05:20.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER IS STILL ABOUT 1,000

05:20.754 --> 05:22.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FATALITIES A YEAR, BUT THAT OUR

05:22.222 --> 05:24.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER IS TWO TIMES THE NUMBER

05:24.257 --> 05:26.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE F.B.I. IS REPORTING.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THE F.B.I. THE YEAR BEFORE

05:27.594 --> 05:28.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST, WHEN OUR NUMBERS FIRST

05:28.562 --> 05:31.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTED COMING OUT, ACKNOWLEDGED

05:31.331 --> 05:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY HAVE A PROBLEM WITH

05:32.933 --> 05:34.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR DOCUMENTATION, AND THEY

05:34.234 --> 05:36.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE MADE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE

05:36.570 --> 05:37.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NEXT YEAR, THEY ARE PLANNING

05:38.538 --> 05:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO LAUNCH NEW EFFORTS TO TRY TO

05:40.740 --> 05:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS AND HAVE

05:42.342 --> 05:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: TWO FACTORS IN THIS

05:45.512 --> 05:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DATA THAT ARE WORTH DISCUSSION--

05:47.480 --> 05:49.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MENTAL ILLNESS AND DOMESTIC

05:49.249 --> 05:50.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTURBANCES.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DO THE DATA TELL YOU?

05:52.452 --> 05:53.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE DATA TELLS US THAT THOSE

05:53.887 --> 05:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO THINGS YOU TALKED ABOUT ARE

05:55.655 --> 05:57.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THE KEY INDICATORS OR

05:57.624 --> 06:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEY THINGS THAT THE BUCKETS IN

06:00.927 --> 06:02.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH PEOPLE WHO ARE KILLED BY

06:02.362 --> 06:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE FALL INTO.

06:03.830 --> 06:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO ONE IN FOUR OF THOSE

06:05.365 --> 06:07.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASES ARE PEOPLE WHO WERE IN

06:07.167 --> 06:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME SORT OF MENTAL-- HAD MENTAL

06:09.135 --> 06:10.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ILLNESS OR WERE IN SOME SORT OF

06:10.303 --> 06:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MENTAL ILLNESS CRISIS.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE SECOND BUCKET HAS NOT

06:14.074 --> 06:16.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN REPORTED A LOT, BUT IT'S

06:16.042 --> 06:17.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SAME AS IT WAS ROUGHLY LAST

06:17.410 --> 06:18.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR, WHICH IS, DOMESTIC

06:18.678 --> 06:20.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTURBANCES MAKE UP ABOUT ONE

06:20.714 --> 06:22.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SIX OF THOSE FATALITIES.

06:22.849 --> 06:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: A SMALL PERCENTAGE

06:24.050 --> 06:25.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE SHOT AND

06:25.719 --> 06:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILLED BY POLICE WERE UNARMED,

06:27.153 --> 06:28.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST 5%.

06:28.588 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST HAD GUNS OR KNIVES.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT DOES THIS TELL US ABOUT

06:32.092 --> 06:34.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LETHAL FORCE AND WHAT POLICE

06:34.494 --> 06:35.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACE?

06:35.562 --> 06:36.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE SOME DISPARITIES,

06:36.730 --> 06:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT

06:37.430 --> 06:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNARMED.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE UNARMED PERCENTAGE HAS

06:39.399 --> 06:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY GONE DOWN.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO LAST YEAR WAS ABOUT 9% AND

06:42.402 --> 06:44.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS YEAR IS ABOUT 5%.

06:44.037 --> 06:45.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IT TELLS US, AT LEAST WHAT

06:45.772 --> 06:47.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EXPERTS TELL US IS THIS IS A

06:47.841 --> 06:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE WHO, WITH

06:51.911 --> 06:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT TRAINING, THROUGH

06:53.346 --> 06:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DE-ESCALATION, IF OFFICERS ARE

06:55.548 --> 06:57.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABLE TO SLOW DOWN THE PROCESS,

06:57.984 --> 06:59.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THESE ARE LIVES THAT MIGHT

06:59.119 --> 06:59.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE SAVED.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO, WHAT HAS HAPPENED THIS

07:01.521 --> 07:03.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR IS A NEW TRAINING THAT WAS

07:03.623 --> 07:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBUTED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO IN

07:05.959 --> 07:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW ORLEANS IN WHICH OFFICERS

07:07.794 --> 07:09.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACROSS THE COUNTRY GATHERED FROM

07:09.763 --> 07:11.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
160 DEPARTMENTS, AND THEY'RE

07:11.298 --> 07:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING TRAINED ON NEW TECHNIQUES

07:13.700 --> 07:16.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SLOW DOWN A SITUATION, TO

07:16.002 --> 07:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DE-ESCALATE SITUATIONS, AND THEY

07:18.104 --> 07:19.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE THAT IF MORE POLICE

07:19.606 --> 07:20.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPARTMENTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY

07:20.440 --> 07:22.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMPLOY THESE METHODS, THAT YOU

07:22.309 --> 07:23.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD ACTUALLY SEE THE NUMBER OF

07:23.677 --> 07:25.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FATALITIES GO DOWN DRAMATICALLY.

07:25.645 --> 07:27.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY'RE ESTIMATING ABOUT 300

07:27.547 --> 07:28.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO 400 OF THE FATALITIES, OF THE

07:28.748 --> 07:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1,000 PEOPLE KILLED THIS YEAR

07:30.550 --> 07:32.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT, PERHAPS, NOT HAPPEN IN

07:32.686 --> 07:34.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FUTURE WITH TECHNIQUES LIKE

07:34.321 --> 07:35.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS.

08:53.933 --> 08:54.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY STAND OUT.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRST WAS THE BOXING DAY

08:56.770 --> 08:58.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TSUNAMI IN INDONESIA'S ACEH

08:58.938 --> 09:00.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROVINCE AT THE END OF 2004.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAS A NATURAL CATASTROPHE

09:03.543 --> 09:05.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON A SCALE THAT NO ONE HAS EVER

09:05.412 --> 09:06.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEN BEFORE.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN INDONESIA'S ACEH PROVINCE

09:07.747 --> 09:09.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONE, 160,000 PEOPLE WERE

09:09.616 --> 09:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILLED IN THE SPACE OF 20

09:10.784 --> 09:11.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINUTES.

09:11.951 --> 09:13.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I SAW WHAT I BELIEVE WAS

09:13.586 --> 09:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUSANDS OF BODIES DURING THE

09:15.555 --> 09:16.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTH I SPENT THERE.

09:16.689 --> 09:17.724 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DESTRUCTION WAS JUST

09:17.724 --> 09:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNIMAGINABLE, THE SUFFERING, THE

09:19.726 --> 09:21.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURVIVORS-- YOU CAN JUST IMAGINE

09:21.161 --> 09:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SHOCK THESE PEOPLE WERE IN.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE OTHER STORY FOR ME WAS,

09:25.799 --> 09:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY, THE IRAQ WAR.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS THE REUTERS BUREAU CHIEF

09:28.868 --> 09:31.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN IRAQ FROM 2007-2008.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS YOU PROBABLY REMEMBER,

09:33.306 --> 09:35.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2007 WAS THE YEAR OF THE-- THE

09:35.141 --> 09:37.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEAR OF THE SURGE.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE EXTRA AMERICAN TROOPS

09:39.245 --> 09:40.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENT TO IRAQ, AND THE VIOLENCE

09:40.513 --> 09:42.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2007

09:42.482 --> 09:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS THE WORST IN THE ENTIRE IRAQ

09:45.685 --> 09:46.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAR.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DURING THAT TIME, IN JULY OF

09:48.822 --> 09:52.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2007, VERY TRAGICALLY, WE LOST

09:52.125 --> 09:53.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE STAFF FROM THE REUTERS

09:53.960 --> 09:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEAM, TWO KILLED BY A U.S.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APACHE HELICOPTER, AND ANOTHER,

09:57.564 --> 09:59.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TRANSLATOR, WHO WAS KILLED BY

09:59.199 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUNMEN IN THE STREETS OF

10:00.533 --> 10:01.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAGHDAD, WHICH WAS A VERY

10:01.668 --> 10:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAUMATIC TIME FOR MYSELF AND

10:03.503 --> 10:04.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR ALL OUR STAFF.

10:04.471 --> 10:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, OF COURSE, THE FAMILIES OF

10:05.271 --> 10:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE MEN.

10:06.105 --> 10:07.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: WHEN DID YOU KNOW

10:07.574 --> 10:10.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THIS WENT PAST HAVING AN

10:10.877 --> 10:12.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMOTIONAL REACTION TO SOMETHING,

10:12.479 --> 10:13.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE ALL REPORTERS

10:13.546 --> 10:15.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE'RE THERE TO DO ANALYSIS

10:15.281 --> 10:16.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND REPORT THE FACTS, WHEN DID

10:16.916 --> 10:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW THAT THOSE KIND OF MORE

10:19.018 --> 10:21.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORMAL FEELINGS WERE MORPHING

10:21.287 --> 10:22.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO SOMETHING ELSE?

10:22.622 --> 10:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ALISON, TO BE HONEST, I

10:24.224 --> 10:26.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T-- I WAS IN DENIAL FOR

10:26.192 --> 10:27.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS THAT I HAD A PROBLEM.

10:27.894 --> 10:28.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS IN DENIAL THAT I WAS

10:28.862 --> 10:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS OF P.T.S.D.,

10:31.397 --> 10:33.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MY SENSITIVITY TO NOISE, MY

10:33.199 --> 10:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGITATION, MY ANXIETY.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE SYMPTOMS MEANT THAT I HAD

10:36.302 --> 10:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MEDICAL ISSUE.

10:38.071 --> 10:41.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT REALLY WASN'T UNTIL WITH MY

10:41.441 --> 10:42.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY WIFE AT

10:42.609 --> 10:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BREAKING POINT EARLIER THIS YEAR

10:44.444 --> 10:45.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT I AGREED TO SEE A

10:45.745 --> 10:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PSYCHIATRIST WHO DIAGNOSED ME

10:48.147 --> 10:49.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH P.T.S.D.

10:49.048 --> 10:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT WAS THAT MOMENT THAT I

10:51.017 --> 10:52.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAME TO THE ACCEPTANCE THAT I

10:52.452 --> 10:53.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD P.T.S.D.

10:53.720 --> 10:54.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: THERE WAS ONE

10:54.521 --> 10:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCIDENT IN IRAQ WHERE

10:57.457 --> 10:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLEAGUES OF YOURS WERE KILLED,

10:59.859 --> 11:03.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU HAD TO ABSORB IT AS A

11:03.229 --> 11:05.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTER, BUT THAT IT MAY HAVE

11:05.532 --> 11:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN A TRIGGER FOR YOU?

11:06.900 --> 11:07.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT

11:07.867 --> 11:09.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THAT SITUATION?

11:09.802 --> 11:10.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AS THE BUREAU CHIEF, I WAS

11:10.970 --> 11:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYONE'S

11:12.605 --> 11:16.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAFETY, OF COURSE, AND WHEN-- SO

11:16.910 --> 11:17.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAD THREE STAFF KILLED IN TWO

11:17.911 --> 11:19.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAYS.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRANSLATOR, IT WAS JUST A

11:20.747 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RANDOM ATTACK, A GUNMAN ON THE

11:22.782 --> 11:23.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREETS.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS REALLY NOT A LOT I

11:25.051 --> 11:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD DO ABOUT THAT ONE.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE OTHER TWO, THEY'D GONE

11:28.621 --> 11:30.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO JUST INVESTIGATE REPORTS THAT

11:30.957 --> 11:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAD BEEN A U.S. AIRSTRIKE

11:32.058 --> 11:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON BUILDINGS IN EAST BAGHDAD AND

11:34.027 --> 11:34.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY FOUND THEMSELVES IN A GROUP

11:34.961 --> 11:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MEN, SOME OF WHOM APPEARED TO

11:36.729 --> 11:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE ARMED, AND THEY WERE ATTACKED

11:40.400 --> 11:42.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY A U.S. APACHE HELICOPTER AND

11:42.635 --> 11:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE KILLED, ALONG WITH MOST OF

11:44.871 --> 11:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MEN IN THAT-- IN THAT GROUP.

11:46.806 --> 11:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WAS JUST-- I CAN'T

11:49.008 --> 11:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPLAIN HOW DIFFICULT THAT WAS.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS, OBVIOUSLY, A STORY AT

11:53.179 --> 11:54.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TIME, AND SO, I WAS-- I WAS

11:54.847 --> 11:56.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVING TO WRITE THE STORY OF

11:56.616 --> 11:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR DEATHS AND I WAS

11:57.884 --> 11:59.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVESTIGATING HOW IT HAPPENED,

11:59.319 --> 12:00.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HAPPENED.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS, OBVIOUSLY, DEALING WITH

12:01.120 --> 12:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE U.S. MILITARY BECAUSE IT WAS

12:02.388 --> 12:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THEIR HELICOPTERS.

12:03.823 --> 12:05.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THERE WAS THE GRIEF

12:05.692 --> 12:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN THE BAGHDAD OFFICE.

12:07.527 --> 12:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS JUST ENORMOUS.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS SO MUCH ANGUISH.

12:10.863 --> 12:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE HAD TO-- OBVIOUSLY, THERE

12:13.333 --> 12:15.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE THE FUNERALS THAT HAD TO BE

12:15.668 --> 12:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZED AND IT WAS-- IT WAS

12:18.104 --> 12:19.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST A VERY-- IT WAS THE MOST

12:19.472 --> 12:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT PERIOD OF MY LIFE,

12:21.207 --> 12:22.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE FEW DAYS, AND THEN WEEKS,

12:22.609 --> 12:24.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THEIR

12:24.577 --> 12:25.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEATHS.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS TIME WENT ON IN IRAQ,

12:26.779 --> 12:28.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHILE I WORKED THERE, I TRIED TO

12:28.548 --> 12:30.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST BURY THESE THOUGHTS AND

12:30.516 --> 12:31.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMOTIONS.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OVER TIME, I THINK I

12:32.285 --> 12:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUCCESSFULLY COMPARTMENTALIZED

12:33.820 --> 12:35.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, BUT IT EVENTUALLY CAME

12:35.421 --> 12:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK TO HAUNT ME AND WAS REALLY

12:37.290 --> 12:39.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE MAJOR TRIGGERS, I

12:39.025 --> 12:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK, FOR MY P.T.S.D.

12:40.893 --> 12:42.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: NOW, THAT ATTACK

12:42.595 --> 12:44.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS RELEASED BY WIKILEAKS.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU HAD REPEATED EXPOSURE TO

12:46.099 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT BECAUSE YOU COULD SEE IT

12:47.367 --> 12:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN, RIGHT?

>> THAT'S RIGHT, ALISON.

12:50.870 --> 12:54.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK FOR ME, ONE OF THE

12:54.340 --> 12:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS THAT I FEEL IS A DEEP

12:58.144 --> 13:00.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENSE OF GUILT AND SHAME BECAUSE

13:00.780 --> 13:03.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THAT WIKILEAKS-- WHEN

13:03.282 --> 13:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIKILEAKS RELEASED THAT VIDEO IN

13:04.651 --> 13:07.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APRIL 2010, I WAS ACTUALLY ON

13:07.587 --> 13:09.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOLIDAY IN TASMANIA AT THE TIME,

13:09.122 --> 13:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE I LIVE NOW, AND I KNEW

13:11.958 --> 13:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST ABOUT-- MORE ABOUT THAT

13:13.993 --> 13:18.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCIDENT THAN ANYONE, AND YET, I

13:18.331 --> 13:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST WAS SO-- SO FROZEN.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS SO SHOCKED TO SEE THAT, TO

13:22.935 --> 13:23.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THAT COME OUT.

13:23.903 --> 13:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS AN-- IT WAS IN A

13:24.937 --> 13:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEWSPAPER.

13:25.705 --> 13:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I PICKED UP A NEWSPAPER, AND

13:26.739 --> 13:27.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IT WAS SPREAD ACROSS A

13:27.707 --> 13:29.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUPLE OF PAGES.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I JUST WENT INTO I GUESS SHUT

13:31.110 --> 13:32.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN, LOCKDOWN.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE

13:33.880 --> 13:34.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WANTED OTHERS TO DEAL WITH

13:36.349 --> 13:38.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS A MAJOR GLOBAL STORY AT

13:38.051 --> 13:39.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TIME BECAUSE THIS WAS THE

13:39.118 --> 13:40.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST TIME REALLY ANYONE HAD

13:40.486 --> 13:41.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARD OF WIKILEAKS.

13:41.688 --> 13:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO THIS DAY I JUST FEEL VERY

13:43.523 --> 13:45.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUILTY ABOUT THAT, BECAUSE I

13:45.124 --> 13:46.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD HAVE ADDED REALLY

13:46.325 --> 13:48.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT CONTEXT, I THINK, INTO

13:48.061 --> 13:50.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY IN 2007,

13:50.430 --> 13:51.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DURING THE AFTERMATH, AS

13:51.831 --> 13:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, WHEN WE WERE PURSUING THE

13:53.599 --> 13:54.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. MILITARY-- WE WANTED THAT

13:54.867 --> 13:55.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAPE.

13:55.568 --> 13:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WERE FILING FREEDOM OF

13:56.736 --> 13:58.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION REQUESTS TO THE U.S.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY NEVER GAVE US THE TAPE.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: KNOWING NOW WHAT

14:02.775 --> 14:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW ABOUT P.T.S.D. AND

14:04.177 --> 14:06.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT YOUR OWN HEALTH, WERE

14:06.679 --> 14:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE TIMES WHEN THE P.T.S.D.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEPT YOU FROM DOING YOUR JOB IN

14:10.416 --> 14:11.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WAY YOU WANTED TO DO YOUR

14:11.451 --> 14:12.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOB?

14:12.985 --> 14:14.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK IN THE LAST COUPLE OF

14:14.487 --> 14:16.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS, CERTAINLY.

14:16.289 --> 14:17.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE TIMES I COULDN'T GET

14:17.590 --> 14:18.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF BED.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WOULD BE SO DEPRESSED, I WOULD

14:20.193 --> 14:22.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIE IN BED AND I BARELY HAD

14:22.795 --> 14:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENOUGH STRENGTH TO SEND AN EMAIL

14:24.797 --> 14:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO MY-- TO MY BOSS AT THE TIME

14:27.600 --> 14:30.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SAY, "LOOK, I JUST CAN'T-- I

14:30.136 --> 14:30.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T GET OUT OF BED.

14:30.770 --> 14:31.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I CAN'T WORK TODAY."

14:31.904 --> 14:33.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF I GOT REALLY STRESSED, I

14:33.706 --> 14:35.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD ACTUALLY-- IT WOULD FEEL

14:35.475 --> 14:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE I WAS BACK IN MY OFFICE

14:37.276 --> 14:37.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN IRAQ.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'D FEEL LIKE I WAS TRANSPORTED

14:39.679 --> 14:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK TO THAT PLACE.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHEN I GOT STRESSED, I WOULD

14:42.882 --> 14:45.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST REACT VERY BADLY.

14:45.184 --> 14:46.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WOULD BANG MY FISTS ON THE

14:46.085 --> 14:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TABLE.

14:46.786 --> 14:47.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WOULD SHOUT.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I LOOK BACK NOW AND I THINK

14:49.689 --> 14:51.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I JUST WISH I'D TAKEN MUCH MORE

14:51.557 --> 14:52.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOTICE OF THOSE SYMPTOMS AND

14:52.492 --> 14:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN WILLING TO ACCEPT THAT I

14:54.160 --> 14:55.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD A PROBLEM.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: AT ONE POINT, YOU

14:57.130 --> 14:59.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIED TO HEAL YOURSELF.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WOULD GO ON LONG WALKS, ON

15:01.834 --> 15:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE LONG HIKES, BUT YOU HAVE

15:03.770 --> 15:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINCE LEARNED THAT THAT

15:04.504 --> 15:06.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY, THE BEHAVIOR YOU WERE

15:06.305 --> 15:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXHIBITING REALLY WASN'T SAFE

15:08.040 --> 15:08.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEHAVIOR.

15:08.875 --> 15:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT

15:09.809 --> 15:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MY

15:11.644 --> 15:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PSYCHIATRIST SUGGESTED TO ME WAS

15:13.212 --> 15:14.213 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO A LITTLE BIT OF BUSH

15:14.213 --> 15:15.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALKING, GET OUT INTO NATURE.

15:15.615 --> 15:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, OF COURSE, TASMANIA HAS

15:17.683 --> 15:18.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST

15:18.951 --> 15:20.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREDIBLE RAINFORESTS.

15:20.620 --> 15:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I DID.

15:21.888 --> 15:22.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I TOOK THAT ADVICE, AND I WOULD

15:22.855 --> 15:25.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO ON SOME NICE DAY HIKES AND I

15:25.725 --> 15:26.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY ENJOYED THAT.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN AFTER A COUPLE OF

15:28.728 --> 15:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MONTHS AFTER BEING DIAGNOSED, I

15:30.496 --> 15:31.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTED TO DO SOME MULTI-DAY

15:31.931 --> 15:33.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALKS, STAYED OUT IN THE

15:33.766 --> 15:35.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAINFOREST, STAY IN CAVERNS,

15:35.301 --> 15:36.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SORT OF THING.

15:36.335 --> 15:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I REALLY FOUND PEACE IN THE

15:39.338 --> 15:40.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RAINFOREST.

15:40.006 --> 15:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS WHERE MY MIND WAS STILL.

15:41.974 --> 15:42.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I COULD BREATHE.

15:42.875 --> 15:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I COULD JUST LEAVE ALL OF THAT

15:44.877 --> 15:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMOTIONAL BAGGAGE AT HOME AND

15:46.579 --> 15:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST LOOK AT THE TREES, WALK

15:48.848 --> 15:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE BEAUTIFUL TRAILS AND FEEL

15:51.017 --> 15:52.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY, REALLY AT PEACE.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WITH P.T.S.D., ONE OF THE

15:54.987 --> 15:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYMPTOMS IS RISK-TAKING

15:56.722 --> 15:57.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEHAVIOR.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT GOT TO THE POINT WHERE I

15:58.624 --> 16:02.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS PLANNING MULTI-DAY HIKES, UP

16:02.061 --> 16:04.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO A WEEK, A WEEK'S WALKS,

16:04.697 --> 16:07.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH SOME PRETTY ROUGH

16:07.967 --> 16:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRAIN IN TASMANIA ON MY OWN,

16:10.036 --> 16:11.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WINTER.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MY WIFE WAS WORRIED ABOUT

16:13.739 --> 16:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY FATHER-IN-LAW GAVE ME A

16:15.741 --> 16:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSONAL LOCATER BEACON TO SAY,

16:17.577 --> 16:19.345 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK-- HE SAID, "YOU REALLY

16:19.345 --> 16:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD CONSIDER THIS BECAUSE IT

16:20.913 --> 16:22.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS QUITE DANGEROUS."

>> Stewart: BEING A JOURNALIST

16:22.782 --> 16:23.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TALK ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE

16:33.226 --> 16:34.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IT'S LIKE TO LIVE WITH MENTAL

>> Sreenivasan: FIRST OF ALL,

18:02.815 --> 18:04.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY ARE PEOPLE DOING IT?

18:04.283 --> 18:05.484 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IT FOR A STORY ABOUT

18:05.484 --> 18:06.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEMSELVES?

18:06.585 --> 18:07.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THOSE THINGS ARE RELATED,

18:07.486 --> 18:08.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDENTITIES AND STORIES, YOU

18:08.621 --> 18:09.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT PEOPLE WANT

18:10.156 --> 18:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDENTITIES THAT THEY CAN USE TO

18:12.158 --> 18:13.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL A RICH STORY, OR A RICHER

18:13.292 --> 18:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY, ABOUT THEIR LIVES.

18:14.293 --> 18:15.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN THE CASE OF AFRICAN

18:15.294 --> 18:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS, PART OF THAT STORY

18:16.796 --> 18:17.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN LOST.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT THE ATTEMPT TO USE

18:19.532 --> 18:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENETIC ANCESTRY TESTING, TO

18:20.700 --> 18:23.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIND A NATION STATE, ETHNIC

18:23.202 --> 18:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUP, INFORMATION THAT YOU

18:24.270 --> 18:25.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO

18:25.905 --> 18:26.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE, BEFORE WE HAD NEW

18:26.906 --> 18:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELPED US TO

18:28.274 --> 18:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE SOME BEST GUESSES ABOUT

18:29.709 --> 18:32.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE PEOPLE OF AFRICAN DESCENT

18:32.178 --> 18:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE U.S. MIGHT BE FROM AND

18:33.312 --> 18:34.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN ALLOW YOU TO COMPLETE A

18:34.914 --> 18:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY.

18:35.581 --> 18:36.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE IDENTITY PIECE AND STORY

18:36.582 --> 18:38.217 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PIECE ARE VERY MUCH CONNECTED.

18:38.217 --> 18:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THERE IS ALSO

18:39.085 --> 18:41.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A NOTION OF OWNERSHIP.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: FOR A SECOND

18:43.656 --> 18:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS I AM OPTING INTO IT.

18:45.424 --> 18:45.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES.

18:45.958 --> 18:46.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: AND I OWN

18:46.592 --> 18:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I WILL TAKE THIS PIECE OF

18:48.194 --> 18:50.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION THAT I KNOW, AND I

18:50.363 --> 18:51.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE THIS TO MYSELF.

18:51.597 --> 18:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S THE CRITICAL PIECE

18:53.099 --> 18:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE WE KNOW FOR COMMUNITIES

18:55.368 --> 18:56.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COLOR THAT GENETICS HAS NOT

18:56.902 --> 18:59.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALWAYS BEEN A ROSY SPACE OF

18:59.238 --> 19:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESEARCH, AND THAT THERE HAVE

19:00.973 --> 19:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN HISTORICAL TRAGEDIES IN THE

19:02.975 --> 19:04.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST THAT WOULD LEAD,

19:04.477 --> 19:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICANS,

19:05.945 --> 19:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE SUSPICIOUS OF GENETIC

19:07.646 --> 19:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TESTING.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO THE ABILITY TO OPT IN,

19:10.416 --> 19:11.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ABILITY TO NOW IN THE

19:11.584 --> 19:13.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
21st CENTURY USE GENETICS

19:13.252 --> 19:14.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO SOMETHING POWERFUL, TO

19:14.353 --> 19:15.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL A POWERFUL STORY ABOUT YOUR

19:15.554 --> 19:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDENTITY AND YOUR LIFE AND TO

19:17.623 --> 19:18.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHOOSE HOW YOU WANT TO TAKE THAT

19:18.991 --> 19:19.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY UP.

19:19.725 --> 19:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETIMES PEOPLE GET INFORMATION

19:21.660 --> 19:23.095 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY FIND USEFUL OR

19:23.095 --> 19:24.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERESTING, AND SOMETIMES THEY

19:24.096 --> 19:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT BECAUSE YOU HAVE OPTED IN AS

19:26.699 --> 19:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A CONSUMER, YOU GET TO CHOOSE.

19:28.300 --> 19:29.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU GET TO ADJUDICATE WHETHER OR

19:29.869 --> 19:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT YOU THINK THAT INFORMATION

19:31.070 --> 19:32.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS USEFUL FOR YOUR STORY.

19:32.738 --> 19:35.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DOES THIS

19:35.274 --> 19:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE OUR SENSE OF COMMUNITY OR

19:37.076 --> 19:38.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO I IDENTIFY WITH?

19:38.477 --> 19:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THIS MOMENT, I MIGHT BE

19:40.846 --> 19:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFRICAN AMERICAN OR INDIAN

19:42.948 --> 17:20:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN, BUT IF I REALLY GO

17:20:40.111 --> 19:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK THROUGH MY GENETIC ROOTS,

19:47.153 --> 19:48.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAIT A MINUTE, I'M FROM THIS

19:48.154 --> 19:49.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY, ALSO?

19:49.555 --> 19:50.589 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE USE AFRICAN AMERICAN

19:50.589 --> 19:52.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYNONYMOUSLY WITH THINGS LIKE

19:52.625 --> 19:53.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRISH AMERICAN OR SCOTTISH

19:53.826 --> 19:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN, BUT THOSE ARE

19:54.894 --> 19:56.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES, AND AFRICA --

19:56.462 --> 19:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AFRICA IS A CONTINENT.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:58.164 --> 19:59.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE 54 COUNTRIES ON THE

19:59.432 --> 20:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTINENT OF AFRICA.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE ABLE TO SAY I'M

20:02.568 --> 20:04.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUINEAN-AMERICAN, I'M

20:04.170 --> 20:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NIGERIAN-AMERICAN, IS ACTUALLY A

20:05.805 --> 20:06.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT ETHNIC STORY, BEING A

20:09.442 --> 20:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HYPHENATED AMERICAN IS REALLY

20:10.743 --> 20:11.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF THE AMERICAN STORY.

20:11.977 --> 20:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S HOW POLITICS HAPPENED.

20:13.412 --> 20:15.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S HOW WE DO FORMS OF SOCIAL

20:15.915 --> 20:17.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZING.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT ADDS A LEVEL OF

20:18.984 --> 20:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFICITY FOR AFRICAN

20:20.052 --> 20:21.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS THAT MIGHT NOT

20:21.587 --> 20:22.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE.

20:22.955 --> 20:23.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> REGARDLESS OF WHICH

20:23.856 --> 20:25.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITIES DECIDED TO DO

20:25.191 --> 20:26.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS FOR THEMSELVES, ONE OF THE

20:26.959 --> 20:29.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINGS THAT CONCERNS ME IS WHERE

20:29.495 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THAT INFORMATION RESIDE?

20:31.330 --> 20:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER THEY DO THE TEST, AFTER

20:32.965 --> 20:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY GET MY GENETIC CHEEK SWAB,

20:35.267 --> 20:37.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AFTER THAT LAB FIGURES OUT

20:37.203 --> 20:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IT IS ABOUT MY STORY TO

20:38.404 --> 20:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL ME, THEY HAVE A COPY OF MY

20:40.940 --> 20:43.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
D.N.A. IN THEIR LAB, AND I

20:43.476 --> 20:45.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY PRESSED "I AGREE"

20:45.177 --> 20:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT READING THE FINE PRINT.

20:46.846 --> 20:47.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DIFFERENT COMPANIES DO

20:47.780 --> 20:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT THINGS.

20:48.781 --> 20:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WE NOW KNOW THAT 23andMe HAS

20:50.850 --> 20:52.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMITTED TO DOING

20:52.151 --> 20:53.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
