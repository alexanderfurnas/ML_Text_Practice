JOHN YANG: Good evening. I'm
John Yang. Gwen
Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
away.

00:08.675 --> 00:13.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: Three
attacks in
three countries just days apart
kill more

00:13.447 --> 00:18.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than 200 people. The growing
threat of ISIS
around the world.

00:18.585 --> 00:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead on this Fourth of
July: political
correctness on the campaign
trail. Drawing

00:23.557 --> 00:27.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the line between straight talk
and offensive
speech.

00:27.060 --> 00:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Should the NFL embrace
medical marijuana?
A growing number of players say
yes.

00:32.900 --> 00:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE TURLEY, Former NFL Player:
Cannabis has
saved my life. I don't think of
suicide anymore.

00:37.905 --> 00:43.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a big thing. You would
think the NFL
would want to address that a
little bit more.

00:43.777 --> 00:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:47.281 --> 00:50.717 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:50.751 --> 01:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A spate of recent
attacks around
the world shows the growing
global reach of

01:04.932 --> 01:11.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Islamic State and its
followers. In Iraq
alone this weekend, at least 157
people were

01:11.138 --> 01:21.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
killed in one of Baghdad's
deadliest bombing
since the 2003 invasion.

01:21.081 --> 01:27.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 24 hours after the
attack, makeshift
teams were still pulling bodies
out of charred

01:27.287 --> 01:33.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
buildings. It was one of
Baghdad's bloodiest
days in over a decade. Officials
say they

01:33.794 --> 01:38.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expect the death toll to climb.
It left residents
visibly shaken.

01:38.298 --> 01:42.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZINA MOHAMMED, Iraq (through
translator):
May God punish those who were
responsible

01:42.469 --> 01:46.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for such a bombing. So many
people are still
under the debris.

01:46.473 --> 01:51.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALA KHUDIER, Baghdad (through
translator):
This street is one of the most
beautiful streets

01:51.778 --> 01:57.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Baghdad. It's like the Champs
Elysees in
France. We were smelling flowers
from a distance

01:57.484 --> 02:00.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of this street. Now we are
smelling dead
bodies.

02:00.420 --> 02:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Islamic State
quickly claimed
responsibility for the suicide
truck bombing

02:05.659 --> 02:10.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the largely Shiite
neighborhood. Many of
the victims were young,
gathering to break

02:10.564 --> 02:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the day's fast, part of the
Islamic holy month
of Ramadan.

02:15.369 --> 02:21.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sunday's bombings capped a week
of ISIS-linked
attacks spanning the globe. Last
Tuesday,

02:21.441 --> 02:28.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three suicide bombers stormed
Turkey's Ataturk
Airport in Istanbul, killing at
least 45 people.

02:28.448 --> 02:42.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkish officials blamed ISIS,
although there
was no direct claim of
responsibility. Most

02:42.829 --> 02:45.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were foreigners. One was
American.

02:45.332 --> 02:49.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): Two
people opened
fire in the air. Then I shouted
and ran to

02:49.369 --> 02:53.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a safe area. They closed the
gate chanting
Allahu akbar opened fire.

02:53.440 --> 03:00.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: ISIS claimed
responsibility for
that attack as well. All this
comes as ISIS

03:00.580 --> 03:06.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has lost significant territory
in places that
were once its strongholds, Iraq
and Syria.

03:06.887 --> 03:11.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, Iraqi forces fully
liberated the
city of Fallujah, which the
group had controlled

03:11.458 --> 03:17.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since 2014. Iraqi officials
attribute the
uptick in suicide bombings to
ISIS losses

03:17.864 --> 03:19.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the battlefield.

03:19.533 --> 03:24.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have more on the threat
of the Islamic
State right after the news
summary.

03:24.071 --> 03:29.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Saudi Arabia, suicide
bombings rocked three
different cities. There was no
immediate claim

03:29.076 --> 03:34.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of responsibility. The attacks
struck just
before the end of Ramadan. They
detonated

03:34.281 --> 03:39.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
near the Prophet Mohammed's
Mosque in Medina,
one of Islam's holiest sites, as
well as a

03:39.886 --> 03:45.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shiite mosque in Qatif, and just
outside the
U.S. Consulate in Jeddah. In
addition to the

03:45.759 --> 03:49.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bombers, four security officers
were killed
in Medina.

03:49.229 --> 03:54.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The leader of the United
Kingdom's right-wing
anti-European Union party said
today he's

03:54.968 --> 03:59.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resigning. Nigel Farage, the
head of the U.K.
Independence Party, is the
latest politician

03:59.573 --> 04:05.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to step aside, after the country
voted to
leave the E.U. Today in London,
the 52-year-old

04:05.112 --> 04:10.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said he never wanted to be a
career politician,
and pledged support for the
party's next leader.

04:10.617 --> 04:14.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIGEL FARAGE, U.K. Independence
Party Leader:
My aim for being in politics was
to get Britain

04:14.154 --> 04:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the European Union. That
is what we
voted for in that referendum the
two weeks

04:19.759 --> 04:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago. And that is why I now feel
that I have
done my bit, that I couldn't
possibly achieve

04:26.500 --> 04:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than we managed to get in
that referendum,
and so I feel it's right that I
should now

04:33.073 --> 04:34.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stand aside.

04:34.841 --> 04:38.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Farage now joins
conservative party
Prime Minister David Cameron who
plans to

04:38.478 --> 04:44.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
step down by fall, and let a
successor deal
with the process of Britain's
exit from the

04:44.551 --> 04:46.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
E.U.

04:46.419 --> 04:50.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 180 people have died
in flooding
across central and southern
China. Torrential

04:50.657 --> 04:56.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rains from summer monsoons
triggered a landslide,
washed away railroad lines, and
shut down

04:56.696 --> 05:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
roads. The downpour is expected
to continue
until Wednesday; 33 million
residents have

05:02.802 --> 05:05.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been affected by the deluge.

05:05.138 --> 05:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And back in this country, it was
a Fourth
of July marked by festive
parades, fireworks,

05:10.076 --> 05:15.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and increased security. Under
gloomy skies
in the nation's capital, police
were on guard

05:15.148 --> 05:20.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as visitors made their way
through checkpoints
near the National Mall. And in
Philadelphia,

05:20.153 --> 05:25.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people watched a star-studded
reading of the
Declaration of Independence
before that city's

05:25.225 --> 05:27.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
parade got under way.

05:27.761 --> 05:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And some big news out of the
National Basketball
Association today. Superstar
Kevin Durant

05:33.333 --> 05:38.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced he's joining the
Golden State Warriors.
The move will bring even more
talent to a

05:38.605 --> 05:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
team that won a record 73 games
last season.
The former MVP and seven-time
all-star has

05:44.711 --> 05:51.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reportedly agreed to a two-year,
$54.3 million
contract.

05:51.418 --> 05:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how ISIS
is inspiring attacks around the
world; more

05:56.523 --> 06:02.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign controversies for both
Hillary Clinton
and Donald Trump; could medical
marijuana

06:02.462 --> 06:14.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help NFL players ease their
pain?; and much
more.

06:14.407 --> 06:23.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a closer look at the
increase in attacks
by ISIS around the globe with
two reporters

06:23.183 --> 06:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who have covered the insurgency
very closely.

06:25.885 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joby Warrick covers national
security for
The Washington Post. His book
"Black Flags:

06:30.924 --> 06:36.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Rise of ISIS" won this
year's Pulitzer
Prize for Nonfiction. It's his
second Pulitzer.

06:36.863 --> 06:41.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Rukmini Callimachi is a
correspondent
with The New York Times and
joins us from

06:41.501 --> 06:42.969 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Paris.

06:43.003 --> 06:43.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rukmini, I would like to start
with you.

06:46.039 --> 06:52.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This spasm of violence that we
have seen over
the last two weeks, three
attacks, three countries,

06:52.646 --> 06:56.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what do you make of this? Are
they sending
a message? Is this a coincidence
Were they

06:56.249 --> 06:57.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
planning it this way?

06:58.018 --> 07:02.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI, The New York
Times: ISIS,
like all jihadi groups,
considers Ramadan

07:02.656 --> 07:06.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be a sacred time for doing
jihad.

07:06.693 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before the start of the holy
month of
Ramadan, which began roughly
three weeks ago,

07:11.564 --> 07:17.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the spokesman of the group
issued once again
a call for an increase in
violence. And so

07:17.537 --> 07:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the way I read it that these
attacks and the
heightening of them in this
period is a response

07:22.475 --> 07:24.244 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to that call.

07:24.277 --> 07:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Joby, how do
they do this?
How do they get these attacks
going? Some

07:26.713 --> 07:30.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them, are they directed by
ISIS? Are they
just inspired by ISIS?

07:30.817 --> 07:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK, The Washington
Post: Yes, it's
a mixed bag.

07:32.619 --> 07:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as Rukmini said, they have
been issuing
the call to do something during
Ramadan. And

07:37.691 --> 07:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the call specifically says
whatever is available
to you. Don't wait for orders,
don't wait

07:42.128 --> 07:45.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for instructions. If you have an
opportunity
to do something nasty, do it.

07:45.732 --> 07:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so you have see a lot of
lone wolf attacks.
You have seen some gangs getting
together

07:49.336 --> 07:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and doing some of these attacks.
It's not
necessarily coordinated, but
it's very effective.

07:52.405 --> 07:57.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Rukmini, were
these attacks
in any way -- you said that they
sent the

07:57.844 --> 08:04.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
word out that they wanted this
to happen.
But is it just that the
opportunities came

08:04.217 --> 08:05.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up in this cluster?

08:06.019 --> 08:10.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: If you are
an adherent
to this group, you know the
rhythm and you

08:10.323 --> 08:18.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know that Ramadan is a period
when these attacks
almost like a prayer are
supposed to be viewed

08:18.965 --> 08:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more holy than at other times of
the year.

08:21.634 --> 08:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's reasonable
to expect that
the attacks we have seen have
been in the

08:27.006 --> 08:32.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
planning stages for some time
and that they
use Ramadan as a time to hit.
And adding to

08:32.612 --> 08:37.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Joby said, we have seen in
this period
of Ramadan both inspired
attacks. So, we had

08:37.817 --> 08:41.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Omar Mateen in Orlando Florida,
and we had
a guy called Larossi Abballa
here in France

08:41.921 --> 08:45.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who stabbed to death a policeman
in the name
of ISIS.

08:45.358 --> 08:51.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We saw attacks that they
directed them themselves
and carried out themselves, like
Baghdad yesterday.

08:51.698 --> 08:56.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then we have seen attacks
like Bangladesh,
which are being carried out
basically by their

08:56.903 --> 08:58.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
territories abroad.

08:58.705 --> 09:04.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bangladesh has been one of their
territories
that they have spent a lot of
time hyping

09:04.677 --> 09:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in their publication. And the
attack in the
cafe that happened a few days
ago was the

09:10.049 --> 09:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
19th attack in Bangladesh
claimed by ISIS
in less than nine months.

09:15.388 --> 09:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Is there a danger,
Joby, that there
is going to be a backlash? The
Turkey attack,

09:19.726 --> 09:25.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey has never really taken a
lot of action
against ISIS. Is this going to
trigger a big

09:25.398 --> 09:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
response from Turkey?

09:26.766 --> 09:29.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOBY WARRICK: The Turks
certainly indicating
that it will.

09:29.803 --> 09:34.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have been trying to track
down on recruits,
for example, and weapons going
across the

09:34.741 --> 09:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
border. But now it's obviously a
full-scale
war. So you have to be seeing
what they will

09:38.778 --> 09:42.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do that is different from what
they are doing
now, perhaps some more shares
resources, allowing

09:42.348 --> 09:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
others to use their soil for
attacks against
the caliphate.

09:45.652 --> 09:49.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that the Turks are
really in the
game now. So, in that sense,
there is blowback.

09:49.189 --> 09:54.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There will be a price exacted
with ISIS for
doing these kinds of attacks.
And you will

09:54.093 --> 09:57.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see it in other places too such
as Bangladesh.
The whole world really is
rallying in a way

09:58.031 --> 10:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is unprecedented against
this organization.

10:00.467 --> 10:04.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Rukmini, a lot
has been made
about the fact that the attacks
in Turkey

10:04.637 --> 10:10.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and in Bangladesh were carried
out by groups,
rather than individuals, that it
was sort

10:10.977 --> 10:17.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of coordination amongst these
people. Is this
something new? Is this sort of a
new development,

10:17.083 --> 10:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taking this to a next stage?

10:18.117 --> 10:19.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUKMINI CALLIMACHI: Not really.

10:19.953 --> 10:25.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have to look back to the
November 13 attack
in Paris, which was carried out
by 10 ISIS

10:25.492 --> 10:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attackers, nine of whom traveled
from Syria
to carry out those killings. The
Brussels

10:30.663 --> 10:34.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks were a mixed bag. It
included people
that had traveled from Syria and
then other

10:34.667 --> 10:37.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
locals that they joined up with
there.

10:37.770 --> 10:44.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey, we're still in that fog
where we don't
exactly know how these people
entered Turkey.

10:44.444 --> 10:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did they come from Syria? Did
they come from
somewhere else? But the
indication has been

10:49.849 --> 10:52.919 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they were most likely sent
by ISIS central.

10:52.952 --> 10:58.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then Bangladesh, you have a
growing network
that I think has gone unnoticed
because until

10:58.591 --> 11:03.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a couple of days ago they hadn't
had a catastrophic
attack like we have seen now.
But if you are

11:03.863 --> 11:10.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
watching their publication and
their propaganda,
Bangladesh was very much a place
that was

11:10.036 --> 11:14.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their crosshairs. They have
been very much
amping up their rhetoric there.

11:14.874 --> 11:18.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Joby, this also
comes as they
have been losing territory. They
have been

11:18.778 --> 11:26.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
losing ground in Iraq, in Syria.
They just
lost Fallujah this past week.

11:26.352 --> 11:31.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this in any sense ISIS saying
we don't
-- it doesn't matter? They're
going to project

11:31.791 --> 11:34.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their source outside that
territory in a way?

11:34.694 --> 11:38.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOBY WARRICK: It is interesting
that the weaker
they get in their caliphate, in
their home

11:38.565 --> 11:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
territory, the more they do seem
to lash out.

11:40.633 --> 11:45.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether this is really them
just trying
to still be relevant, or if it's
something

11:45.872 --> 11:48.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that suggests that they're
really moving to
a new phase, that is something
we -- still

11:48.942 --> 11:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has to be seen, because even
though they are
losing territory, they are
losing personnel

11:51.978 --> 11:55.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the caliphate, they are
growing their organization
other places.

11:55.348 --> 12:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see these other inspired
groups. We see
cells. We see real reorganized
ISIS organizations

12:01.955 --> 12:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in other places. And some of
those are getting
big instead of smaller, so this
campaign is

12:06.492 --> 12:08.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not over by any stretch.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Joby Warrick, Rukmini
Callimachi,
that's a very sobering note to
end on. Thanks

12:11.698 --> 12:17.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for being with us.

12:17.136 --> 12:22.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOBY WARRICK: Thank you.

12:22.575 --> 12:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And now to Politics
Monday, Independence
Day edition.

12:28.548 --> 12:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, I'm joined now by Stu
Rothenberg
of the Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales
Political Report

12:32.986 --> 12:37.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and a columnist for The
Washington Post, and
Tamara Keith, NPR White House
correspondent.

12:37.824 --> 12:38.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Stu, Tam, welcome.

12:38.925 --> 12:40.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Thank
you.

12:40.760 --> 12:45.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's a holiday, but
it's not a
holiday from Donald Trump's
tweets and Donald

12:45.498 --> 12:47.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump tweet controversy.

12:47.400 --> 12:52.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He sent one out over the
weekend. He referred
to Hillary Clinton as the most
corrupt candidate

12:52.605 --> 12:59.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever, no surprise. But it looked
like -- the
words were on a six-pointed star
over a sea

12:59.045 --> 13:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cash. People quickly picked
up it out on
social media, said it was a Star
of David.

13:04.584 --> 13:10.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton released a
statement today.
She called it blatantly
anti-Semitic. Trump

13:10.390 --> 13:16.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took it back, killed the tweet,
and also said
that the dishonest media was
depicting the

13:16.462 --> 13:21.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
star in the tweet as a Star of
David, rather
than a sheriff's star or plain
star.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.236 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Stu.

13:23.269 --> 13:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Editor and
Publisher, The
Rothenberg &amp; Gonzales Political
Report: Well,

13:25.138 --> 13:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we always -- I carry sheriff's
stars around
with me all the time and use
them in my tweets

13:27.440 --> 13:28.041 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too.

13:28.074 --> 13:28.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: To make points.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: No.

13:30.643 --> 13:36.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, John, it's another day of
Donald Trump,
it's another controversy, it's
another instance.

13:36.115 --> 13:41.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we hadn't done this six,
eight, ten,
20 times before, maybe you could
say, oh,

13:41.087 --> 13:43.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this was a mistake or this was
misinterpreted.

13:43.790 --> 13:48.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's a whole series of
these and this
is who the man is. And this is
what the campaign

13:48.961 --> 13:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is. The campaign isn't field
organization
or TV ads. It's tweets, and
controversial

13:56.602 --> 13:58.237 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tweets.

13:58.271 --> 14:03.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Do you think he knows
what the
connotation is to these things,
or does he

14:03.142 --> 14:04.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not notice them or...

14:04.977 --> 14:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Oh, I would
certainly hope
-- he is an adult. He ought to
know. He is

14:08.414 --> 14:12.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a 70-year-old man who claims to
be knowledgeable,
and know some history, and of
course he should

14:12.919 --> 14:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know. I don't understand and the
campaign
doesn't explain, does it? They
don't tell

14:17.523 --> 14:19.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you how this happens.

14:19.358 --> 14:23.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: So, there's
reporting out there
from this news organization Mic
that this

14:23.396 --> 14:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
image wasn't generated by the
Trump campaign.

14:25.898 --> 14:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It came from a dark place in the
Internet
where you find white supremacist
things like

14:31.104 --> 14:36.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this. And his campaign, we have
asked. My
colleagues at NPR, we have been
in touch with

14:36.409 --> 14:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his campaign repeatedly all
weekend long,
saying, where did this image
come from, how

14:41.380 --> 14:47.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did this happen, why did you
then take it
down, what do you have to say
for this?

14:48.020 --> 14:51.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been no response.
If it weren't
a pattern, if it hadn't happened
many times

14:51.958 --> 14:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before -- and Trump has been
slow to either
disavow, say, oh, gosh, fire
that intern or

14:59.398 --> 15:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and this tweet that he sent
out was really
justifying it, rather than
disavowing it.

15:06.072 --> 15:10.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Tamara, the
candidate you
have been following most
closely, Secretary

15:10.676 --> 15:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, had her own
sort of damage
control this past week, meeting
-- the tarmac

15:15.181 --> 15:22.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meeting Attorney General Loretta
Lynch and
her husband, the former
President Bill Clinton.

15:22.121 --> 15:26.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This all sort of blew up also.
How did she
handle it, and do you think she
handled it

15:26.893 --> 15:28.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well?

15:28.728 --> 15:30.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I just want to
just talk about
one other thing, which is she
had an interview

15:30.730 --> 15:35.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the FBI. That should have
been the news
all weekend long.

15:35.067 --> 15:39.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And because Donald Trump tweeted
that thing
out, some of the information was
taken away

15:39.605 --> 15:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from what was a very bad day for
Hillary Clinton.
You have the party's presumptive
nominee sitting

15:45.711 --> 15:51.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down for a three-and-a-half-hour
interview
with the FBI about an issue, her
e-mail server,

15:51.984 --> 15:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that has been dogging her the
entire campaign.

15:54.587 --> 16:01.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This comes on the heels of the
tarmac situation,
which both President Clinton and
Attorney

16:01.160 --> 16:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
General Loretta Lynch say they
wouldn't do
again. That casts a question
over the entire

16:08.034 --> 16:09.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investigation.

16:09.969 --> 16:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is very easily to
be able say,
well, it's rigged. They had a
chat on an airplane.

16:15.441 --> 16:21.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there is not going to be a
good answer
to that reasonable doubt that
he's raising.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Stu, in these
investigations, they
end, usually...

16:24.784 --> 16:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: They never
end.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They never will.

16:28.454 --> 16:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they end with an indictment,
we know about
it. If they end without an
indictment, the

16:32.458 --> 16:34.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FBI policy is not to say
anything.

16:34.460 --> 16:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes. Well,
certainly, this
was a very bad few days for the
former secretary

16:39.932 --> 16:44.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of state, lot of negative
coverage, lot of
negative news, lots of questions
about the

16:44.503 --> 16:47.006 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tarmac.

16:47.039 --> 16:52.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was terribly embarrassing. I
think it was
a big news day, a big news
event, but I think

16:52.178 --> 16:56.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the long term in terms of the
election
itself, the campaign and then
the election,

16:57.016 --> 17:00.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's less of a dramatic event,
for this reason.
We're either going to get an
indictment or

17:00.586 --> 17:02.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're not going to get an
indictment.

17:02.421 --> 17:06.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if we get to the Democratic
Convention
and there's no indictment, I
don't know. Maybe

17:06.459 --> 17:12.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we will hear that the
investigation has concluded
and that there are some report
or comments.

17:12.665 --> 17:16.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in any case, we're going to
go to a different
phase of the campaign.

17:16.636 --> 17:21.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is bad for her
today. I agree
completely. The idea of Donald
Trump stepping

17:21.707 --> 17:27.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Hillary Clinton's terrible
news is ridiculous
from a political point of view.
But so she

17:27.380 --> 17:32.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had a bad few days, and I think
this will
pass. Big news event, not the
impact on the

17:32.885 --> 17:34.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. And law
enforcement forces
tell NPR's Carrie Johnson that
they do not

17:37.256 --> 17:39.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
anticipate an indictment in this
case.

17:39.759 --> 17:43.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that Clinton has sat
down for this
interview means that --
typically, that means

17:43.763 --> 17:46.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it's nearing an end, when
the principal
sits down for an interview.

17:46.465 --> 17:49.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And, Tamara, we are
going to go
to a new phase of the campaign
tomorrow, President

17:49.936 --> 17:54.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama appearing for the first
time with the
candidate who wants to replace
him.

17:54.674 --> 17:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. And he wants
her to replace
him.

17:58.177 --> 18:02.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will campaigning together
in South Carolina
-- or -- sorry -- North
Carolina, which is

18:02.782 --> 18:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an important swing state, one
that President
Obama won narrowly in 2008, lost
narrowly

18:08.354 --> 18:15.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2012. The Clinton campaign
sees it as a
target state. They have been
running ads there.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then Donald Trump has scheduled
an event in
the evening also in North
Carolina.

18:18.898 --> 18:22.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: A little
counterprogramming. Stu,
he's not on the ballot, but, in
less than

18:22.401 --> 18:25.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a minute, does the president
have coattails
that could help Hillary?

18:25.071 --> 18:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I think he
could help in
terms of enthusiasm, generating
turnout among

18:29.308 --> 18:33.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
African-Americans and possibly
among younger
voters.

18:33.379 --> 18:38.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sure. Job numbers are good. Poll
numbers are
up. Right now, he's an asset. We
will see

18:38.150 --> 18:42.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
if that continues, but
certainly. And North
Carolina is absolutely an
important state.

18:42.555 --> 18:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is bigger than Wisconsin in
terms of electoral
votes. We talk about Wisconsin
and Pennsylvania.

18:47.693 --> 18:48.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
North Carolina is a big deal.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Stu Rothenberg,
Tamara Keith, happy
Fourth of July.

18:51.564 --> 18:52.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: You too.

18:52.365 --> 18:52.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

18:52.932 --> 18:54.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Thanks.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sticking with politics, we take
a look at
the intersection of inflammatory
rhetoric

18:57.436 --> 18:59.171 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and free speech.

18:59.205 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan has a
historical perspective.

19:01.774 --> 19:07.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Candidates'
speeches on
the campaign trail can at times
get inflammatory

19:07.646 --> 19:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with little regard for accuracy.
That's not
new. But this election season
has been marked

19:12.651 --> 19:15.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by divisive language that some
find hateful.

19:15.721 --> 19:21.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what is the line to be
looking for? And
what lessons of the past can
help guide us?

19:21.227 --> 19:24.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me now to dissect the
rhetoric on
the campaign trail is
presidential historian

19:24.263 --> 19:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Beschloss, and Beverly
Gage, professor
of American history at Yale.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for joining us.

19:30.770 --> 19:37.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I want to ask. I guess the
first question
is, is, when free speech
intersects with fear-mongering,

19:37.910 --> 19:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael Beschloss, how much is
too much? How
do we figure out where that line
is?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS, Presidential
Historian:
Well, I think the one certain
line is when

19:44.016 --> 19:49.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you have a presidential
candidate, especially
of a major party, criticizing
groups within

19:49.188 --> 19:51.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American society.

19:51.157 --> 19:55.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has happened in history.
You had, for
instance, the candidate of the
Know-Nothings,

19:55.161 --> 20:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1856, Millard Fillmore, a former
president,
who said if you allow people of
Irish origin

20:03.969 --> 20:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and others to run rampant in
American society
-- he was also anti-Catholic --
this will

20:09.175 --> 20:11.110 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a danger to America.

20:11.143 --> 20:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think most nominees of
major parties
through at least our modern
history realize

20:15.981 --> 20:21.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is a country that
depends on all
sorts of people living together
under one

20:21.454 --> 20:26.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
umbrella, and they also realize
that if you
want to win, usually, that
happens by not

20:26.559 --> 20:29.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
alienating groups, but by trying
to bring
them together.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Beverly Gage,
is it easy
to find that line?

20:31.730 --> 20:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BEVERLY GAGE, Assistant
Professor of American
History, Yale University: I
think it's not

20:34.400 --> 20:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always so easy to find it, but
it's the sort
of thing where people tend to
know it when

20:38.404 --> 20:40.172 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they see it.

20:40.206 --> 20:44.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one basic measure is whether
or not someone
is telling the factual truth. We
would like

20:44.844 --> 20:49.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to think that that is sort of a
baseline.
People don't, of course, always
adhere to

20:49.682 --> 20:51.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

20:51.417 --> 20:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I agree with Michael that
one of the other
lines that we are really talking
about is

20:54.954 --> 21:02.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vilifying whole swathes of
people, creating
a kind of conspiratorial
language, a discourse

21:02.595 --> 21:06.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that is about guilt by
association. Those
can be very, very dangerous
things, but they

21:06.932 --> 21:08.701 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have been around a long time.

21:08.734 --> 21:11.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Here is a
sample clip from
some of the things that at least
presidential

21:11.804 --> 21:14.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
candidate Donald Trump has said
that has a
lot of folks concerned.

21:14.406 --> 21:17.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I have had horrible rulings. I
have been treated

21:17.376 --> 21:18.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very unfairly by this judge.

21:19.011 --> 21:22.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, this judge is of Mexican
heritage. I'm
building a wall.

21:22.314 --> 21:31.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A total and complete shutdown of
Muslims entering
the United States, until our
country's representative

21:31.323 --> 21:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can figure out what the hell is
going on.

21:34.627 --> 21:39.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael, you
gave some good
examples of how this kind of
speech has happened

21:40.032 --> 21:43.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the past. Is there something
different
about this campaign? Is it just
the times

21:43.302 --> 21:47.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we live in? Is it the
technology that
transfers this speech so
quickly? What is

21:47.306 --> 21:49.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
changing things?

21:49.175 --> 21:51.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Sure. You
have got Twitter,
you have got the Internet. It's
a lot easier

21:51.110 --> 21:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make charges like this and
have people
hear them very quickly.

21:54.813 --> 21:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the other thing is that,
earlier in history,
you have had instances like this
-- Strom

21:59.885 --> 22:06.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thurmond in 1948 would talk
about law and
order, and what he was really
referring to

22:06.425 --> 22:12.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was what he thought was the
danger, his word,
to American society of
integration of the

22:12.298 --> 22:14.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
races.

22:14.133 --> 22:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
George Wallace slightly more
muted than that
in 1968. They were never able to
get nominated

22:19.004 --> 22:23.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a major party. That's what
makes Donald
Trump's situation so interesting
and novel.

22:23.776 --> 22:27.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Beverly Gage,
one of the
things that came up, at least
historical,

22:27.246 --> 22:32.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we started doing searches
for this, the
daisy ad that was back in the
LBJ campaign,

22:32.718 --> 22:36.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it was one of the most striking
one-minute-long
ads that we have ever seen.

22:36.488 --> 22:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a little girl. She's
picking petals.
Everything seems to be going
fine. There's

22:40.125 --> 22:44.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
no music, nothing. Then, all of
a sudden,
we sort of zoom, I guess when
the camera zoom

22:44.129 --> 22:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea was new, zoom into her
eyeball and see
this atomic explosion, with the
narrator coming

22:49.768 --> 22:51.604 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

22:51.637 --> 22:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEVERLY GAGE: That was a Lyndon
Johnson ad
targeting Barry Goldwater. It
was not broadcast

22:56.775 --> 23:02.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very much, but it became one of
the most dramatic
and famous political ads in its
moment because

23:02.147 --> 23:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it basically suggested that, if
you vote for
Barry Goldwater, you were going
to get a nuclear

23:08.487 --> 23:12.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
holocaust around the world, a
pretty big leap.

23:12.691 --> 23:18.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, I think the
1964 election
is interesting for the politics
that surrounded

23:18.130 --> 23:22.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Goldwater. The establishment
wing of the party
didn't like Goldwater at all.
They thought

23:22.234 --> 23:28.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was an extremist, that he was
using violent
rhetoric, that he was taking the
support of

23:28.107 --> 23:33.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups like the John Birch
Society, which
had a very kind of
conspiratorial, anti-communist

23:33.212 --> 23:36.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approach, and so it really
divided the party.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things that was
interesting
then and that I think we are
going to see

23:39.218 --> 23:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
playing out now is, just how
much control
does a party have over its own
nominee?

23:45.257 --> 23:48.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
Beschloss, does
selling fear work?

23:48.060 --> 23:50.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: It sometimes
does.

23:50.596 --> 23:55.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wendell Willkie in 1940, he
certainly was
-- never said anything remotely
like what

23:55.934 --> 24:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are talking about in terms of
defaming
minority groups, but he did in
the full campaign

24:01.440 --> 24:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say essentially, if you elect
Franklin Roosevelt,
even though he is promising you
that he will

24:06.645 --> 24:12.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not involve the United States in
a foreign
war, you can be sure that, if
he's elected,

24:12.117 --> 24:15.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we are going to be at war
probably within
a few months.

24:15.654 --> 24:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He didn't believe that was true.
It went way
beyond the facts, but it caused
Willkie to

24:20.492 --> 24:25.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soar ahead in the polls to the
point that,
by November, he was almost
within striking

24:25.364 --> 24:27.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
distance of winning the
presidency.

24:27.566 --> 24:31.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Beverly Gage,
as you pointed
out, this is not one party or
another. This

24:31.437 --> 24:33.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is kind of as old as politics.

24:33.172 --> 24:37.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just in the last cycle, a
lot of people
took Hillary Clinton to task for
the 3:00

24:37.042 --> 24:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a.m. ad that she had against
Barack Obama.
It was just pictures of kids
sleeping in their

24:41.580 --> 24:45.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beds, and it was, it's 3:00
a.m., the red
phone, so to speak, in the White
House is

24:45.918 --> 24:49.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ringing. Do you know who is
going to answer
that phone? Are you sure who
you're going

24:49.388 --> 24:52.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to vote for now is going to make
that decision?

24:52.958 --> 24:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess in politics and almost
in sales, it
is almost a natural thing. I
have to convince

24:57.896 --> 25:02.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you that there is a problem and,
B, that I
am the solution. Right?

25:02.568 --> 25:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do we figure out when we
cross over that?
And it's also pretty natural in
politics to

25:07.439 --> 25:11.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to tear the other candidate
down, but
without necessarily going into
this other

25:11.710 --> 25:13.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
space that we seem to be in
today?

25:13.379 --> 25:15.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BEVERLY GAGE: Right.

25:15.314 --> 25:20.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And fear is a good motivator
often. And, sometimes,
it's a very accurate thing. It
is something

25:20.519 --> 25:26.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that you want to mobilize in
people. Sometimes,
there are really concrete things
to be afraid

25:26.825 --> 25:28.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of.

25:28.560 --> 25:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the difference is when
it crosses
the line into conspiracy
thinking and into

25:34.633 --> 25:39.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this sort of, well, we have this
one fact
and therefore we are going to
infer a whole

25:39.938 --> 25:43.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
set of other terrible things
that might happen
from that one fact.

25:43.142 --> 25:48.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a very hard line to draw.
And I think
the other thing that is
interesting to think

25:48.580 --> 25:54.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, is the way that this kind
of fear-based
politics, which often comes up
in campaigns,

25:54.820 --> 26:00.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if the candidate who is
using that kind
of fear-based politics loses, it
can have

26:00.058 --> 26:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pretty dramatic long-term
consequences.

26:02.361 --> 26:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Beverly Gage,
Michael Beschloss,
thanks so much for your
perspective, as always.

26:07.266 --> 26:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL BESCHLOSS: Thank you,

Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
a slave helped
Jack Daniel make his whiskey; a
story of life,

26:24.583 --> 26:30.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
death and redemption, the last
in our series
of summer reads; and reflecting
on true American

26:30.222 --> 26:32.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heroes on this Independence Day.

26:32.658 --> 26:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, a pair of NFL
players are challenging
the league to reconsider its
policy on pot

26:38.764 --> 26:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when it comes to medical use and
particularly
to treat pain.

Katie Couric of Yahoo News sat
down with the
players. Here's an extended
excerpt of her

26:48.006 --> 26:49.975 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

26:50.008 --> 26:54.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EUGENE MONROE, NFL Player:
Cannabis is a substance
that has been stigmatized for
years, and that's

26:54.613 --> 26:58.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
why I'm so adamant about
educating people
on the health benefits of it.

®MD-BO /KATIE COURIC: Eugene
Monroe made
headlines when he became the
first active

27:02.488 --> 27:08.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
player in the NFL to publicly
call for the
league to change its policy on
pot, which

27:08.861 --> 27:10.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is on the banned substance list.

27:10.762 --> 27:16.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EUGENE MONROE: I would like to
know why the
NFL is maintaining such a stern
position of

27:16.602 --> 27:23.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the medical value of cannabis
when, countrywide,
doctors are prescribing it to
their patients.

27:23.675 --> 27:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /KATIE COURIC: Monroe, who
was recently
cut from the Baltimore Ravens,
believes using

27:28.180 --> 27:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marijuana for pain relief can be
a much safer
alternative to prescription
drugs like oxycodone.

27:34.019 --> 27:39.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EUGENE MONROE: What I noticed
was that former
players would openly speak about
their experience

27:39.825 --> 27:42.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of being addicted to opioids
that they were
prescribed by their team
doctors.

27:42.694 --> 27:47.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM MCMAHON, Former NFL Player:
I was eating
100 Percocets a month during my
career, even

27:47.165 --> 27:53.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up until five years after I
retired. And it
just made me feel bad. It made
my head fuzzy.

27:53.038 --> 27:54.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It screws up your insides.

27:54.973 --> 27:59.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE TURLEY, Former NFL Player:
The rage episodes,
all of these things, vertigo,
were mounting

27:59.244 --> 28:02.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so much greater under the pill
prescription.

28:02.481 --> 28:07.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /KATIE COURIC: But when
former NFL
lineman Kyle Turley turned to
marijuana for

28:07.853 --> 28:10.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relief, he says everything
changed.

28:10.822 --> 28:15.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE TURLEY: I wouldn't be here
today if it
wasn't for cannabis, period.
Cannabis has

28:15.727 --> 28:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saved my life. I don't think of
suicide anymore.
That's a big thing. You would
think the NFL

28:22.134 --> 28:24.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would want to address that a
little bit more.

28:24.803 --> 28:29.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /KATIE COURIC: The NFL
told us its
policy that covers marijuana is
collectively

28:29.675 --> 28:36.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bargained and is a joint NFL/NFL
Players Association
program, adding: "We are guided
by medical

28:36.448 --> 28:39.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
advisers. They have not
indicated a need to
change."

28:39.885 --> 28:42.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER GOODELL, National Football
League Commissioner:
We believe it's the correct
policy for now

28:42.654 --> 28:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the best interest of our
players and the
long-term health of our players.
I don't foresee

28:46.892 --> 28:48.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a change in that clearly in the
short term.

28:49.027 --> 28:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
®MD-BO /KATIE COURIC: What do you
want from
the NFL?

28:50.862 --> 28:57.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EUGENE MONROE: I want the NFL to
take a serious
look at the medical value of
cannabis, which

28:57.402 --> 29:02.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they currently deny. I want them
to stop testing
players, and stop punishing
players for consuming

29:02.941 --> 29:04.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cannabis.

marijuana's effect on the brain.

DR. STACI GRUBER, McLean
Hospital: Professional
athletes who are in pain much of
the time,

29:12.050 --> 29:17.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the question is, how can we best
treat them?
Twenty-five states plus D.C. now
have full

29:17.055 --> 29:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medical marijuana laws. Another
18 have partial
medical marijuana laws. The
question is, what

29:22.260 --> 29:25.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does it do? Is it all good? All
bad? Or somewhere
in between?

29:25.163 --> 29:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /KATIE COURIC: Derrick,
this is the
first time you're speaking out
about this.

29:29.368 --> 29:36.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICK MORGAN, NFL Player: I
think that for
the NFL to say that cannabis
doesn't benefit

29:36.642 --> 29:42.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the long-term health of its
players without
actually having gone and done
the research,

29:42.047 --> 29:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think that's accurate,
that's an accurate
statement.

29:44.182 --> 29:49.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /KATIE COURIC: Derrick
Morgan, a linebacker
with the Tennessee Titans, has
joined forces

29:49.388 --> 29:55.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Eugene Monroe. Both believe
marijuana
may not only be a safer
alternative for pain

29:55.093 --> 29:59.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relief, but could also be
effective for dealing
with the symptoms of CTE.

29:59.631 --> 30:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICK MORGAN: You hear all the
research
and the news about the CTE, the
traumatic

30:04.603 --> 30:08.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brain injury, and, as a player,
you take notice
of that.

30:08.373 --> 30:13.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /KATIE COURIC: CTE, the
neurodegenerative
disorder that has been
discovered in the brains

30:13.578 --> 30:19.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of many deceased NFL players,
was the focus
of the movie "Concussion." While
the league

30:19.317 --> 30:24.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acknowledges the findings, it
believes additional
research is needed to determine
potential

30:24.423 --> 30:30.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
causes of the disease.

30:30.062 --> 30:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monroe believes a compound found
in marijuana
may even help prevent CTE.

30:35.200 --> 30:40.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EUGENE MONROE: The U.S.
government has a patent
on cannabinoids that say they
protect the

30:40.639 --> 30:45.711 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
brain in the event of a
traumatic injury,
which is concussions. And I have
been an unfortunate

30:45.744 --> 30:51.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
recipient of numerous
concussions throughout
my career, and quite fearful of
the potential

30:51.516 --> 30:53.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
impact later in my life.

30:53.318 --> 30:58.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. STACI GRUBER: I think
there's been some
extraordinary compelling
pre-clinical work

30:58.390 --> 31:05.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that's demonstrated CBD,
cannabidiol, is incredibly
effective at helping to limit
the extent of

31:05.063 --> 31:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brain injury, which is really
very intriguing
and promising.

31:08.233 --> 31:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DERRICK MORGAN: I feel like the
NFL has a
responsibility to look into it,
to delegate

31:14.005 --> 31:20.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time and money to research this
for its players.
Given how much influence that
the NFL has

31:20.812 --> 31:28.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on society, I think that it
would help the
greater good. There's a lot of
people suffering

31:28.553 --> 31:34.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there's a lot of people that
can benefit
from cannabis as a medical
treatment.

Cannabis is not cannabis is not
cannabis.

32:57.642 --> 33:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's made up of 130 different

for these

by some recent
revelations about the
bestselling brand of

33:54.866 --> 34:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American whiskey. Last week, The
New York
Times reported that Jack
Daniel's founder

34:00.205 --> 34:05.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually learned a lot about
making whiskey
from a slave who worked for the
same distiller.

34:05.477 --> 34:10.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While that's been known before,
it hasn't
been widely advertised. Now the
company is

34:10.181 --> 34:14.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starting to acknowledge their
complicated
history on its distillery tours
in Tennessee.

34:15.020 --> 34:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That has some people asking
questions about
the heritage of American whiskey
and about

34:19.824 --> 34:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other culinary matters in the

knew for a long time about the
role of this

34:35.206 --> 34:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slave named Nearis Green in the
development
of the company, but they just
never talked

34:39.010 --> 34:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it. How common was that in
the development
of food and drink across the
South?

were involved
in every single aspect of
Southern life.

34:49.688 --> 34:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even when someone didn't --
quote -- "own
enslaved people" or own slaves
-- we prefer

34:54.326 --> 35:00.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say enslaved people or

-- enslaved folks were doing the
work.

35:00.498 --> 35:05.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's very interesting,
because you read
these journals and writings of
Southern planters,

35:05.537 --> 35:10.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's as if their hands are
in the dirt,
it's as if their fingers are on
the bricks,

35:10.241 --> 35:14.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's as if their hands are in
the kitchen
and their hands are on the
shovels. But they

35:14.713 --> 35:16.414 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are not.

35:16.448 --> 35:20.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so enslaved people are often
hired out
to work for other people.
Distillers were

35:20.986 --> 35:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
experts. They were skilled
workers. So, that
is another form of income.

35:25.790 --> 35:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you are only making so
much of a cash
crop, a lot of your money is
going to come

35:30.562 --> 35:37.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from in the hills and the
piedmont from making
alcohol, which is substantial.
So, that enslaved

35:37.035 --> 35:41.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person would have been very
valuable and very
necessary to an operation of
that sort.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But they weren't just
providing
the labor.

35:44.009 --> 35:45.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL TWITTY: No.

35:45.744 --> 35:49.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They were helping
develop and create
the craft of what they were
doing.

35:49.514 --> 35:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL TWITTY: Oftentimes, they
were the
brains.

35:52.183 --> 35:58.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, unfortunately, because
enslaved people
were considered three-fifths of
a person,

35:58.089 --> 36:05.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they aren't being given credit
for their intellectual
capital. So, when an enslaved
person invents

36:05.130 --> 36:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something or innovate something,
they improve
something, that credit is being
given to the

36:09.734 --> 36:12.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
slave holder, not to the
enslaved.

36:12.737 --> 36:19.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that this does over time is,
it sets up
for a really bad paradigm, where
we think,

36:19.277 --> 36:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these poor people, they were
just the machines,
they were just set to do a task.
And the reality

36:25.650 --> 36:31.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is, no, these were innovative,
entrepreneurial,
intelligent people.

36:31.523 --> 36:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't set -- you don't bring
a bunch of
idiots to your country to build
it. You bring

36:36.361 --> 36:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
geniuses. And a lot of times,
that is what
was going on. They were expert
horticulturists.

36:41.466 --> 36:45.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were expert blacksmiths.
They were expert
distillers.

36:45.036 --> 36:50.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the unfortunate part is, we
know there
were more people like Mr. Green,
but will

36:50.909 --> 36:57.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we ever know their names or
their stories
or what they could have been had
they been

36:57.282 --> 36:58.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
free men and women?

36:59.017 --> 37:02.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And the influence is
more than
just liquor and distilling and
fermenting

37:02.620 --> 37:03.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
alcohol.

37:03.154 --> 37:04.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL TWITTY: Yes.

37:04.756 --> 37:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It is was through
what we now think
of as Southern cooking, right?

37:06.424 --> 37:08.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL TWITTY: Oh, absolutely.

37:08.193 --> 37:13.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I was just part of an
ongoing debate,
which will never end, over the
ownership of

37:13.698 --> 37:18.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Southern cooking. And the best
way to put
it is, is that this is a
co-created world.

37:18.536 --> 37:24.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a co-created world between
Africans,
Europeans and Native Americans
and others

37:24.442 --> 37:28.813 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are making up Southern-ness
and American-ness
as they go.

37:28.847 --> 37:34.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would like to always quote
art historian
Robert Farris Thompson, who
says, until you

37:34.085 --> 37:36.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know how African you are, you
don't know how
American you are.

37:37.021 --> 37:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, all of these pieces are
woven in together.
And you can't possibly talk
about the Southern

37:41.192 --> 37:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kitchen without talking about
peanuts or sesame
or okra or watermelon or deep
frying or barbecue

37:47.699 --> 37:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or other forms of cooking
techniques and spicing
and ways of looking at food that
are uniquely

37:54.339 --> 37:56.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part of the African diaspora.

37:56.141 --> 38:02.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What do you think of
Jack Daniel's
distillery now acknowledging the
role that

38:02.247 --> 38:07.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
this man played in the
development of the
company and of the product?

38:07.218 --> 38:12.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL TWITTY: Well, I think
it's pretty
critical.

38:12.257 --> 38:17.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that we are at a point
where the pushback
-- and I have led some of that
pushback -- talking

38:17.428 --> 38:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about cultural appropriation,
talking about
giving credit where credit is
due -- sometimes,

38:21.599 --> 38:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I recoil, because I feel, oh, I
don't know
if I'm doing the right thing.

38:26.171 --> 38:30.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I hear news like this,
I know I am.
And other people who are like me
are rewriting

38:30.308 --> 38:34.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the history of American food and
drink, not
just because we want to talk
about the past,

38:34.546 --> 38:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we have brilliant black
mixologists, brilliant
black bartenders in the now
whose legacy we

38:41.319 --> 38:47.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can not only celebrate, but
preserve, so people
know that Mr. Green didn't die
in vain.

38:47.325 --> 38:49.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Michael Twitty,
thanks for being
with us/

38:49.494 --> 38:52.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL TWITTY: Thank you very
much.

38:52.764 --> 39:02.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There are 2.2 million
prisoners
in the United States. Almost
half of them

39:02.874 --> 39:09.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There are 2.2 million
prisoners
in the United States. Almost
half of them

39:09.847 --> 39:11.683 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are black.

39:11.716 --> 39:15.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this final addition to our
summer reading
list, we hear from one former
inmate who is

39:15.887 --> 39:17.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trying to stem the tide.

39:17.889 --> 39:23.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the recent Los Angeles Book
Festival, Jeffrey
Brown talked with Shaka Senghor,
the author

39:23.228 --> 39:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of "Writing My Wrongs: Life,
Death, and Redemption
in an American Prison."

39:28.399 --> 39:31.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you
first, why did
you write this book?

39:31.636 --> 39:33.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR, Author, "Writing
My Wrongs:
Life, Death, and Redemption in
an American

39:33.371 --> 39:36.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prison": I thought it was really
important
to help people understand what's
happening

39:36.374 --> 39:39.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the inner city where young
men and women
were ending up in a prison
system.

39:40.011 --> 39:44.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But also I wanted to bring
people as close
to the prison experience as
possible without

39:44.349 --> 39:48.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
them have to actually get
arrested, because
I think in order to solve a
problem, you have

39:48.753 --> 39:50.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be in close proximity to it.

39:50.622 --> 39:56.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just think the book brings
you right
there front and center. Our
system is a mystery

39:56.294 --> 40:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to most taxpayers. And it
shouldn't be. I
think that we should know as
much about the

40:02.333 --> 40:07.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prison system as possible,
considering that
the society has been so deeply
impacted by

40:07.805 --> 40:09.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what's happening within the
system.

40:09.040 --> 40:11.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell me a little
bit about
your childhood.

40:11.075 --> 40:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: I grew up in the
city of Detroit
on the East Side in a household,
and on the

40:14.445 --> 40:18.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside looking in was the model
for middle-class
black America.

40:18.249 --> 40:23.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Unfortunately, what was
happening in my household,
which is all too often the case
for young

40:23.154 --> 40:28.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men and women who end up running
away, is
my mother was being abusive. And
I decided

40:28.226 --> 40:34.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to run away. And that's how I
got seduced
into the drug trade at the age
of 14.

40:34.832 --> 40:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Drug trade, which
led you on
to streets, which led you to
guns.

40:38.636 --> 40:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: When I first got
seduced into
that culture, I had no idea,
like, everything

40:45.410 --> 40:47.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that that entailed.

40:47.278 --> 40:51.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was a relatively short
time that I
experienced every imaginable
horror that comes

40:51.816 --> 40:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with drug culture, including a
childhood friend
being murdered, both my older
brothers being

40:58.056 --> 41:03.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot, and eventually myself
being shot multiple
times at the age of 17.

41:03.428 --> 41:07.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the world of street
culture. And
I wanted people to really
understand what's

41:07.632 --> 41:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happening in this space, why
it's happenings
and how we can stop it.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And it led
eventually to you
shooting and killing someone.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Yes.

41:15.707 --> 41:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: When you say
people understanding,
did you understand at the time
right...

41:19.577 --> 41:20.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Not at all.

41:20.511 --> 41:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: No? Right and
wrong and...

41:22.680 --> 41:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: I mean, it was an
understanding
of what was legal and what
wasn't legal.

41:29.320 --> 41:34.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, obviously, I grew up
with a moral
compass to differentiate between
right and

41:34.659 --> 41:39.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wrong. However, when you are
immersed in the
psychological trauma of high
levels of gun

41:39.797 --> 41:43.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violence, those decisions are
not always easy
to make.

41:43.234 --> 41:44.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Not on your mind
at that...

41:45.002 --> 41:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Because it goes
from right
and wrong to what is survival.
And when you

41:48.906 --> 41:50.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are operating out of survival
mode, the rules
change.

41:50.942 --> 41:55.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What did you
expect prison
would be like before you went?

41:55.747 --> 41:58.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: I expected it to
be a horrible
experience of human misery.

41:58.649 --> 42:06.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it proved to be true when I
went inside
prison at the age of 19. It was
really one

42:06.691 --> 42:13.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the most volatile,
dehumanizing, degrading
environments in modern society
right now.

42:13.231 --> 42:18.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You write about a
letter from
your then 10-year-old son,
right, that helped

42:18.369 --> 42:19.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transform you.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Yes.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Tell us about
that.

42:21.873 --> 42:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: As a father, my
responsibility
is to provide and protect. And I
was failing

42:27.178 --> 42:32.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do that by being incarcerated
for a very
serious crime, and one in which
my child was

42:32.216 --> 42:34.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
growing up to look at me as a
monster.

42:34.652 --> 42:40.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I knew I had a
responsibility to turn
my life around in such a way
that he can understand

42:40.258 --> 42:43.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, even though I made a poor
decision,
that doesn't totally define who
I am as a

42:43.528 --> 42:45.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human being.

42:45.329 --> 42:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There are going
to be people
who watch this and say, you
killed somebody,

42:48.966 --> 42:49.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

42:49.500 --> 42:50.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Yes.

42:50.968 --> 42:54.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Prison is not
supposed to be
a good experience, right?

42:54.071 --> 42:55.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Yes.

42:55.473 --> 42:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're being
punished.

42:57.975 --> 42:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what's the response to that?

42:59.844 --> 43:03.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: So, 90 percent of
who are incarcerated
will at some point get out.

43:03.047 --> 43:07.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to decide what kind
of men and
women we want to return to
society. And the

43:07.785 --> 43:13.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea that you can punish,
degrade and dehumanize
somebody and then expect
positive outcomes

43:13.124 --> 43:14.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is ridiculously absurd.

43:14.892 --> 43:18.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It just goes against logic,
because you get
out of people what you pour into
them. And

43:18.896 --> 43:24.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so my position is that, while I
had a horrible
experience, I am OK today,
because I was able

43:25.002 --> 43:32.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do things to ensure that I
left with my
mental faculties intact and my
psychological

43:32.310 --> 43:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
faculties intact. But that is
not the normal
case.

43:34.879 --> 43:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Part of how part
of how you
did it was through reading and
then writing.

43:37.815 --> 43:38.316 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

43:38.349 --> 43:39.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Yes.

43:39.650 --> 43:41.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Had you been a
reader, a writer
before all this?

43:41.853 --> 43:44.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: So, those were
the classes
that I always excelled in.

43:44.222 --> 43:48.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were things that I loved. I
learned how
to read when I was 4 years old.
I have always

43:48.793 --> 43:53.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had an appreciation for the
written word.
In terms of actually becoming a
writer, that

43:53.631 --> 44:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't come until later on, when
I just decided
to join into the world of
literature and just

44:00.204 --> 44:03.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
started writing fiction and
things along those
lines.

44:03.074 --> 44:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, fiction was
the way in?

44:04.842 --> 44:08.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Yes, fiction was
the way in.
It allowed me to explore
different worlds.

44:08.379 --> 44:13.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It allowed me to examine
different aspects
of who I am as a person.

44:13.618 --> 44:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think sometimes you can
tell the deeper
truths through fiction, because
it is not

44:17.922 --> 44:23.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as antagonistic, it's not as
personal. Sometimes,
it gives you enough distance to
really kind

44:23.661 --> 44:25.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of think about things
differently.

44:25.563 --> 44:30.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so literature played a
profound role in
turning my life around, but it
was also journaling

44:30.902 --> 44:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well, like being able to
really write and
ask myself those tough
questions, like, how

44:35.973 --> 44:40.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did I go from wanting to be a
doctor to serving
my most promising years in
prison?

44:40.378 --> 44:47.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the discoveries that I had
and epiphanies
I had along the way helped me
course-correct

44:47.652 --> 44:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and really rethink what I wanted
to do with
my life.

44:51.422 --> 44:53.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, now you're
out. You have
published this memoir, and you
were telling

44:53.257 --> 45:00.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me before we started about
getting involved
with literature, literacy
programs in Detroit.

45:00.364 --> 45:01.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Yes.

45:02.033 --> 45:06.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I grew up in Detroit. I do a
lot when
I'm home to work with young men
and women

45:06.804 --> 45:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are growing up in a similar
circumstance
that I grew up in. And I found
that when you

45:11.542 --> 45:15.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can introduce them to literature
that connects
to their reality, that they are
a lot more

45:15.613 --> 45:17.481 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
receptive.

45:17.515 --> 45:23.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Getting the book in the hands of
as many students,
high schoolers in Detroit to
read during the

45:23.054 --> 45:27.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
summer would just be a
phenomenal way to have
a conversation about ending gun
violence and

45:27.725 --> 45:31.929 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
disrupting the
playground-to-prison pipeline
that is so prevalent in inner
cities.

45:31.963 --> 45:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're at a pivotal
moment when it
comes to criminal justice
reform. I think

45:36.667 --> 45:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're at a pivotal moment when
it comes to
racial dynamics and inner-city
gun violence.

45:41.706 --> 45:46.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people want change. And I
think the book
allows people to really examine
how we can

45:46.877 --> 45:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go about fixing things and
turning things
around.

45:48.312 --> 45:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The book is
"Writing My Wrongs."

45:51.682 --> 45:52.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Shaka Senghor, thank you very
much.

45:52.750 --> 45:54.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAKA SENGHOR: Thank you so much
for having
me.

45:54.685 --> 45:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Finally tonight, a "NewsHour"
essay from author
Sebastian Junger.

46:22.013 --> 46:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On this Independence Day, he
reflects on American
heroes.

46:25.182 --> 46:29.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEBASTIAN JUNGER, Author:
Several years ago,
I spent much of a deployment
with a platoon

46:29.120 --> 46:32.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of combat infantry at a remote
outpost called
Restrepo.

46:32.857 --> 46:39.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was named after the medic PFC
Juan Sebastian
Restrepo, who was born in
Colombia, emigrated

46:39.130 --> 46:44.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to America as a child, and died
fighting at
the bottom of a hill in
Afghanistan.

46:44.769 --> 46:48.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was no running water at
Restrepo, no
cooked food, no communication
with the outside

46:48.806 --> 46:53.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
world, and absolutely no
privacy. Mostly,
there was just a lot of combat.
The platoon

46:54.011 --> 46:59.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was in several hundred
firefights that year,
and everyone out there was
almost killed.

46:59.450 --> 47:03.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet over and over again, I
watched perfectly
ordinary people risk their lives
to keep others

47:03.587 --> 47:08.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
safe. No one was more important
than anyone
else, and race, religion, and
politics had

47:08.993 --> 47:14.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
absolutely no relevance at
Restrepo. It was
most profoundly egalitarian
place I have ever

47:14.098 --> 47:15.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
been.

47:16.000 --> 47:20.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every Fourth of July, I like to
think about
men like Private Restrepo and
what this country

47:20.137 --> 47:25.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
must mean to them. Four percent
of our military
aren't even U.S. citizens. And
yet they emigrate

47:25.843 --> 47:30.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to our shores, put on a uniform
and fight
and die for us.

47:30.381 --> 47:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is it they are fighting
for? What is
it they are risking death for?
For many, of

47:34.518 --> 47:40.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
course, it is economic
opportunity. But that
very economic opportunity is
rooted in the

47:40.391 --> 47:46.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea of a just society where
people are judged
on their own merits, rather than
for the sound

47:46.397 --> 47:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of their last name or the color
of their skin.

47:49.400 --> 47:55.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that America may exist in
its purest form
on the front lines of our
nation's wars. How

47:55.973 --> 48:03.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sad. How ironic. Soldiers now
return to a
society that is tearing itself
apart along

48:03.047 --> 48:08.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every possible ethnic and
demographic boundary.
The gap between rich and poor
continues to

48:08.352 --> 48:13.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
widen. Many people live in
racially segregated
communities, and rampage
shootings seem to

48:13.624 --> 48:15.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
happen every week or two.

48:15.626 --> 48:20.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To make matters worse, powerful
people in
this country talk with
incredible contempt

48:20.264 --> 48:26.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, depending on their views,
the president,
the government, the foreign-born
and entire

48:26.971 --> 48:29.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
segments of the population.

48:29.573 --> 48:35.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm sorry to say that some of my
fellow Americans
would judge PFC Juan Restrepo
for his country

48:35.946 --> 48:40.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of origin before they got around
to honoring
him for his heroism.

48:40.417 --> 48:45.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't believe that this would
be happening
if people in power in this
country had even

48:45.189 --> 48:50.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a minimal understanding of true
public service.
I wonder if any of them thought
to give up

48:50.694 --> 48:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their salary for a year in
solidarity with
the millions of Americans who
lost their jobs

48:56.300 --> 48:58.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during a recession.

48:58.102 --> 49:02.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder if any of them are
prepared to make
a real personal sacrifice for
the good of

49:02.273 --> 49:08.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this nation. And yet such acts
are found in
abundance among the citizens
they serve.

49:08.979 --> 49:15.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, a lifelong New Yorker
named Marty
Bauman died at age 85. Mr.
Bauman contracted

49:15.619 --> 49:20.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
polio while in the Army,
attended college
on the G.I. Bill, and went on to
start a successful

49:20.891 --> 49:26.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business in Manhattan. When his
company ran
into financial trouble in the
1990s, he secretly

49:26.931 --> 49:32.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gave up his salary, so that he
wouldn't have
to fire any of his staff. His
employees only

49:32.436 --> 49:37.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
found out because the company
bookkeeper finally
told them.

49:37.174 --> 49:42.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People like Mr. Bauman are the
true heroes
of this country. This Fourth of
July, think

49:42.746 --> 49:48.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the people, young and old,
rich and
poor, citizen and non-citizen,
who have made

49:48.319 --> 49:50.387 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sacrifices for us all.

49:50.421 --> 49:56.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some are in uniform, but many
are not. They
all deserve our respect, but,
more than that,

49:56.560 --> 50:01.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they deserve a country that
respects itself.
I don't hear that sentiment in
the halls of

50:01.699 --> 50:07.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power. I only hear it at the
outposts of Afghanistan
and on the streets and in the
workplaces of

50:07.204 --> 50:09.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this great land.

50:09.340 --> 50:13.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just a few days ago, I was
walking by a housing
project in New York City and saw
someone throw

50:13.944 --> 50:17.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a candy wrapper on the ground.
Another person
saw him as well.

50:17.481 --> 50:21.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Hey, man," he said, "that's our
country."

50:21.518 --> 50:27.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's right. That's our
country. If the powerful
do not learn this one lesson
from the rest

50:27.091 --> 50:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of us, they will not remain the
powerful for
long.

50:34.031 --> 50:45.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This week, President
Obama travels
to Poland for the NATO summit.

50:45.142 --> 50:50.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, tomorrow, special
correspondent Nick
Schifrin begins our series The
New Cold War.

50:50.648 --> 50:54.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, we preview his
reporting with an
excerpt from the front lines in
Ukraine.

50:54.785 --> 50:59.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On this front
line, Annya (ph),
who also declined to give her
last name, leads

50:59.523 --> 51:04.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what she calls an infantry
brigade. The professional
Russian soldiers here whom U.S.
officials

51:04.828 --> 51:07.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say number in the thousands are
invisible.

51:07.564 --> 51:11.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, as we walk down this road,
what is the
risk here?

51:11.168 --> 51:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Total risk. We're
now walking in their snipers'
scopes. Here,

51:16.073 --> 51:18.776 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everything is within their
snipers' reach.

51:18.809 --> 51:23.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: This is incoming.

51:23.480 --> 51:29.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had been here just a few
minutes when we
heard the incoming bullets above
our head,

51:29.586 --> 51:33.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so we have taken cover. We're
staying low
right now, and we're beginning
to hear rebel

51:33.857 --> 51:35.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
soldiers beginning to fire back.

51:35.626 --> 51:40.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Nick's reporting
takes him across
Ukraine and on to Estonia for a
large NATO

51:40.965 --> 51:44.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military exercise with one of
the former Russian
states.
