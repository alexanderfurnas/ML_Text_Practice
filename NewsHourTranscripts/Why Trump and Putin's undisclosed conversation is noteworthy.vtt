JUDY WOODRUFF: On July the 7th,
President Trump sat down for
a highly anticipated meeting

00:05.566 --> 00:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Russia's President
Vladimir Putin at the G20
summit in Hamburg, Germany.

00:12.566 --> 00:15.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, last night, it was
disclosed that there
was a second lengthy
conversation later that

00:17.800 --> 00:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day between the two leaders,
one that the White House had
not spoken of at the time.

00:21.233 --> 00:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nick Schifrin reports.

00:23.200 --> 00:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It was a
three-hour dinner party for the
world's most powerful people,

00:27.766 --> 00:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
20 leaders, and their spouses.

00:29.833 --> 00:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On the menu, turbot fish
fillet, Friesian beef
cheeks, and chitchat.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump worked the
room, and then took his seat.

00:36.866 --> 00:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Diagonally across
the table, first lady
Melania Trump and Russian
President Vladimir Putin.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The two talked to each
other with the help
of Putin's translator.

00:44.733 --> 00:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as a dessert of raspberries
and cheese was served, Mr.
Trump walked over to Putin.

00:49.466 --> 00:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House spokeswoman Sarah
Sanders today called their
talk brief and informal.

00:52.766 --> 00:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, Deputy
White House Press Secretary:
To try to create that there

00:54.800 --> 00:59.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was some sort of private
conversation in a room
with 40-plus people
seems a little bit

01:00.300 --> 01:02.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ridiculous.

01:02.366 --> 01:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Nick Burns is
a former U.S. ambassador to
NATO and veteran diplomat who

01:04.433 --> 01:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
participated in dozens
of U.S.-Russia meetings.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS, Former U.S.
Undersecretary of State for
Political Affairs: This is not

01:07.800 --> 01:09.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a bad thing.

01:09.733 --> 01:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vladimir Putin and Donald
Trump are the two most
powerful people in the world.

01:12.966 --> 01:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They barely know each other.

01:14.933 --> 01:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They'd only met once before
this G20 dinner, and it's really
important that they get to

01:18.633 --> 01:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know each other and develop
some capacity to have an
effective relationship.

01:22.566 --> 01:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Last night, Trump
blasted the media coverage,
tweeting: "Fake news story

01:26.666 --> 01:29.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of secret dinner
with Putin is sick."

01:29.133 --> 01:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pro-Kremlin Russian
lawmaker Alexei Pushkov
used the exact same
language, describing reports

01:35.133 --> 01:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about a -- quote --
"secret dinner" as sick.

01:37.133 --> 01:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, today, German Chancellor
Angela Merkel's spokesman called
these dinner conversations

01:41.200 --> 01:43.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
normal.

01:43.300 --> 01:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEFFEN SEIBERT, German
Government Spokesman
(through translator):
It is the fundamental

01:45.466 --> 01:49.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
point of the G20 meeting
that, alongside working
meetings, there is room
and opportunity for

01:49.566 --> 01:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
multiple informal contacts.

01:51.666 --> 01:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is certainly the
point of such a dinner.

01:54.266 --> 01:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But what
is unusual is that,
since there were no other
U.S. officials present,

01:57.866 --> 02:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the translator was Putin's,
the U.S. officials who work on
Russia have no official notes.

02:02.466 --> 02:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: The people down
the line cannot do their job if
they don't have an exact sense

02:07.133 --> 02:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what our president said,
what the other guy said, and
how they can then pursue these

02:11.666 --> 02:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issues with the
Russian government.

02:13.733 --> 02:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The dinner talk
came on the same day as Trump
and Putin's only official

02:16.966 --> 02:19.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
meeting.

02:19.433 --> 02:21.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That talk lasted
more than two hours.

02:21.800 --> 02:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next day, having spoken
with Trump at least twice,
Putin praised Trump personally.

02:26.500 --> 02:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
As for personal relations, I

02:30.733 --> 02:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
think that they have
been established.

02:32.733 --> 02:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know how this will
sound, but I will say it how I
see it: The Trump on television

02:36.500 --> 02:38.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is very different
from the real person.

02:38.566 --> 02:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's very direct.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He perceives his conversation
partner very well.

02:42.633 --> 02:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's a fairly quick thinker.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It is that
kind of praise that many
here in Washington find
strange and concerning.

02:50.733 --> 02:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Multiple administration
officials tell the "NewsHour"
they have still not received a

02:53.166 --> 02:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
report from the official
Trump-Putin meeting, let
alone the dinner conversation.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is not business as usual.

02:59.500 --> 03:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICHOLAS BURNS: President Trump
has put together, I think, the
weakest policy on Russia in 70

03:05.433 --> 03:07.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

03:07.466 --> 03:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's why you have seen
so many people concerned
by this one conversation.

03:10.166 --> 03:12.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What did President Trump
say to President Putin?

03:12.766 --> 03:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People in our government need
to know the answers to those
questions, and we as citizens

03:16.433 --> 03:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
need those answers as well.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: A dinnertime
conversation might not
be out of the ordinary,
except the president's

03:21.966 --> 03:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2016 campaign is under
investigation for possibly
colluding with Russia.

03:26.766 --> 03:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the man he was talking to
is accused by U.S. intelligence
of ordering the covert effort

03:31.433 --> 03:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to help Trump get elected.

03:32.966 --> 03:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Nick Schifrin in Washington.

03:35.733 --> 03:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late today, the
Senate Judiciary Committee said
that Donald Trump Jr. and former

03:42.700 --> 03:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign manager Paul
Manafort will testify next
Wednesday about their meeting

03:47.366 --> 03:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with a Russian
lawyer last summer.

03:49.466 --> 03:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's son-in-law,
Jared Kushner, goes before the
Senate Intelligence Committee

03:53.966 --> 03:54.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Monday.
