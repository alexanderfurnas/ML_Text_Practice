GWEN IFILL: We return now to
North Korea's
bombshell claims today.

00:05.405 --> 00:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Siegfried Hecker is former
director of Los
Alamos National Laboratory, and
he now teaches

00:10.077 --> 00:16.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Stanford University. He has
visited North
Korea and its nuclear facilities
seven times.

00:16.116 --> 00:21.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Wendy Sherman was
undersecretary of state
for political affairs during the
Obama administration.

00:21.955 --> 00:25.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the Clinton
administration, she was
a State Department official
focused on North

00:25.425 --> 00:29.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Korea. And she now advises the
Hillary Clinton
campaign.

00:29.162 --> 00:31.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wendy Sherman, how much of a
threat is this
latest test?

00:31.999 --> 00:33.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN, Former U.S.
Undersecretary
of State for Political Affairs:
Well, I think

00:33.700 --> 00:37.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that North Korea has
now conducted
a fourth nuclear test is of
concern.

00:37.738 --> 00:42.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I agree with the White House's
assessment,
at least so far -- and I will be
glad to hear

00:42.075 --> 00:47.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Mr. Hecker has to say --
that this isn't
a hydrogen test, but,
nonetheless, four nuclear

00:48.015 --> 00:49.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tests is a concern to us.

00:49.917 --> 00:53.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, the fact of the
test is more
concerning to you than the type
of test?

00:53.887 --> 00:57.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Well, no. Had it
been a hydrogen
bomb -- and, of course, it will
still be several

00:57.224 --> 01:01.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days before we know that for
sure -- that
is much, much, much more
powerful.

01:01.328 --> 01:05.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, we're also
concerned about
miniaturization of the weapon,
so that it

01:05.933 --> 01:11.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might be carried on a weapon to
South Korea,
or Japan or even to the United
States. So,

01:11.438 --> 01:16.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I this is an acceleration and
escalation by
North Korea. And I think that
the United States

01:16.643 --> 01:18.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the world community need to
act with resolve.

01:18.512 --> 01:22.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Siegfried Hecker,
tell us, what
exactly is possible for North
Korea to have

01:22.449 --> 01:24.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pulled off in this case?

01:24.217 --> 01:25.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SIEGFRIED HECKER, Former
Director, Los Alamos
National Laboratory: Well, it's
not clear

01:25.485 --> 01:27.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
exactly what they did.

01:27.487 --> 01:33.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Ms. Sherman pointed out, they
did another
nuclear test. And, actually, my
greatest concern

01:33.560 --> 01:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that they did the fourth
nuclear test.
With that nuclear test, they
clearly achieved

01:38.966 --> 01:44.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
greater sophistication, in most
likelihood
meaning being able to make the
bomb smaller,

01:44.237 --> 01:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lighter, and, therefore, have
greater reach,
if they're able to get them on a
missile.

01:49.276 --> 01:54.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether it was a hydrogen test
or not, we
don't know. My sense is, we will
probably

01:54.848 --> 02:02.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
never really know. So far, from
what is the
information that's there, it
appears the size

02:02.889 --> 02:08.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the blast, in other words,
the power from
the seismic signal that can be
measured, it's

02:08.462 --> 02:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the same level as the
third nuclear
test in 2013, which we put at
the level of

02:15.936 --> 02:22.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
approximately a Hiroshima bomb.
That's saying
10 to 15 kilotons.

02:22.342 --> 02:29.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, whether it actually
achieved the sophistication
of going to a fusion bomb --
that is, the

02:29.282 --> 02:35.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
normal bombs are fission or
atomic bombs -- the
fusion or hydrogen bomb, that is
a very big

02:35.622 --> 02:43.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
step technologically. And it's
not clear that
that was done, but we also can't
rule out

02:43.296 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the North Koreans have made
a significant
advancement.

02:45.899 --> 02:49.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wendy Sherman, we
talked about
the U.S. reaction. Let's walk
through some

02:49.936 --> 02:52.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the other intersectional
reaction, especially
China.

02:52.806 --> 02:57.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, they have been as
protective
of North Korea as any nation.
Not so today.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WENDY SHERMAN: Right.

02:59.279 --> 03:02.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, today, they said they are
resolutely
opposed to what North Korea has
done. Now

03:02.682 --> 03:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need some resolute action
from China as
well. It is significant and
useful that the

03:08.955 --> 03:13.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. Security Council held an
emergency session.
The reports out of that session
are that nobody

03:13.827 --> 03:18.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
objected to further sanctions.
And Ambassador
Power, the U.S. ambassador,
called for more

03:18.665 --> 03:20.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sanctions.

03:20.500 --> 03:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many candidates today who
are running
for president have called for
greater action.

03:24.738 --> 03:30.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Secretary Clinton, who
certainly understands
what's happening in Asia, has
called for greater

03:30.510 --> 03:35.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sanctions and to ensure, as I
think we all
feel, that we not allow North
Korea to blackmail

03:35.482 --> 03:40.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the international community, but
that we take
resolute action to tell them,
this is not

03:40.787 --> 03:42.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
acceptable.

03:42.589 --> 03:45.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Siegfried Hecker,
let's talk about
resolute action for a moment. A
year ago,

03:45.125 --> 03:50.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the president signed an
executive order to
freeze assets in North Korea.

03:50.163 --> 03:57.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everyone, as Wendy Sherman
pointed out, is
calling for resolute action,
universal condemnation.

03:57.037 --> 04:00.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What difference does that make
for a rogue
state like North Korea?

04:00.207 --> 04:05.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIEGFRIED HECKER: Quite frankly,
I think none,
because we have been through
this at least

04:05.645 --> 04:12.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
since 2003 or so, when North
Korea pulled
out of a nonproliferation
treaty.

04:12.719 --> 04:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the attempts, not only by
the United States,
but by the international
community, has been,

04:18.024 --> 04:27.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in essence, to threaten North
Korea, to sanction
North Korea, to isolate North
Korea. And it

04:27.501 --> 04:33.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simply hasn't worked. I think we
failed to
engage North Korea appropriately
when we had

04:33.974 --> 04:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunities in these last 12
or 13 years.

04:39.446 --> 04:46.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whatever engagement was there
didn't work.
The bottom line is, over this
time, from 2003,

04:46.153 --> 04:52.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they most likely built
their first primitive
device which they tested in
2006, until today,

04:52.726 --> 04:58.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have gone from building a
device, 2003,
testing one that didn't work so
well in 2006,

04:58.899 --> 05:04.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to just now where they had the
fourth test,
the successful test.

05:04.604 --> 05:11.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in the meantime, at the
same time, they
have scaled up their ability to
make more

05:11.077 --> 05:15.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bombs. And so where we used to
have a problem
of having this country that
could perhaps

05:15.682 --> 05:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
build a simple nuclear device,
today, they
appear to have a nuclear
arsenal. That's of

05:21.121 --> 05:22.956 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great concern.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to me, that means we have
to do something
different than what's been done
over the last

05:25.992 --> 05:27.794 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
12 years.

05:27.827 --> 05:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wendy Sherman, we
know that Kim
Jong-un is a tough read. Not
many people have

05:31.498 --> 05:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gotten inside and figured out
what he's really
up to. But if from -- based on
what we know,

05:36.403 --> 05:41.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if what he was trying to do
today was provoke,
what was that provocation
intended to do?

05:41.841 --> 05:44.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Well, I think
he's -- it's
several things.

05:44.844 --> 05:50.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, it's really to
bring together
his own country to believe that
he is strong

05:50.383 --> 05:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and powerful. He is still a
young leader.
He's trying to consolidate his
power. He's

05:55.121 --> 05:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done that through a tyrannical
set of actions,
including killing off some of
his closest

05:59.893 --> 06:03.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advisers, when he thought they
were getting
out of control and he wasn't
being seen as

06:03.763 --> 06:05.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
primary.

06:05.665 --> 06:09.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this was a way to bring his
country together,
which we find completely
reprehensible, but,

06:09.369 --> 06:13.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nonetheless, he's taken that
action. Second,
he's sending a message to the
region and to

06:13.540 --> 06:18.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States that he will
do whatever
he thinks he needs to do to
protect his country.

06:18.845 --> 06:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will not go down, as other
leaders have
gone down around the world.

06:22.182 --> 06:28.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I take Sieg's statements, and I
understand
them, the frustration here to
get North Korea

06:28.488 --> 06:32.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do something, but to get
action takes a
couple of things. It takes a
leader who is

06:32.292 --> 06:36.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
willing to engage. And North
Korea has not
been willing to engage, though
the United

06:36.162 --> 06:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
States and others have made many
entreaties
to them to do so.

06:39.966 --> 06:46.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, secondly, I think we have
to get China,
who has really one of the only
relationships

06:46.139 --> 06:51.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
left with North Korea, along
perhaps a little
bit with Russia, to not only
engage, but also

06:51.978 --> 06:57.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to take tougher action to take
away some of
the goodies that they still
provide to North

06:57.150 --> 06:58.952 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

06:58.985 --> 07:01.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, finally,
Siegfried Hecker,
your take on Kim Jong-un and
whether he is

07:01.321 --> 07:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a real threat in this situation.

07:03.223 --> 07:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIEGFRIED HECKER: So, I like to
be able to
say that I am just a scientist,
and so these

07:07.794 --> 07:12.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
diplomatic matters are certainly
beyond my
own personal reach.

07:12.732 --> 07:19.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the thing that seems clear,
just in terms
of the nuclear weapons piece of
this, is that

07:19.506 --> 07:24.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea looks at these
nuclear weapons
as a deterrent. During all of my
visits and

07:24.744 --> 07:29.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the discussions with their
Foreign Ministry
and the diplomats, rather than
the technical

07:29.549 --> 07:32.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people, they talked about their
deterrent.

07:32.652 --> 07:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the emphasis was always
deterrent, meaning
deterring the United States from
essentially,

07:38.992 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, going into North
Korea, or, as they
like to say, you know, our
hostile policies.

07:46.566 --> 07:53.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think we need to
understand exactly
what is the North Korean
security concern,

07:53.873 --> 07:58.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because without getting over
that concern,
in North Korea, to come to
resolution, it

07:58.712 --> 08:03.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems to me -- and, again, not
being a diplomat
-- that the issue is much bigger
than just

08:03.183 --> 08:09.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nuclear issue. And so
focusing on the
nuclear issue by itself is not
going to be

08:09.055 --> 08:10.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
able to get us there.

08:10.990 --> 08:15.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Siegfried Hecker,
former director
of the Los Alamos Laboratory,
and Wendy Sherman,

08:15.362 --> 08:20.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many former titles, but you were
former undersecretary,
most recently, of political
affairs at the

08:20.900 --> 08:21.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Department of State.

08:21.701 --> 08:22.535 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:22.569 --> 08:23.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you both very
much.

08:23.436 --> 08:25.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENDY SHERMAN: Thank you.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SIEGFRIED HECKER: Thank you very
much. It's
my pleasure.
