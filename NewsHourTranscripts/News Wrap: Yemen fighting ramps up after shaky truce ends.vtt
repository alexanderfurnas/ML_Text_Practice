JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:02.035 --> 00:03.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:03.904 --> 00:05.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Every time I think about those
kids. it gets

00:05.405 --> 00:07.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me mad. And, by the way, it
happens on the
streets of Chicago everyday.

00:07.207 --> 00:08.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
makes an emotional
appeal for background checks and
outlines

00:08.075 --> 00:09.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other actions to curb gun
violence.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Tuesday: how New
Hampshire
is grappling with a heroin
epidemic.

00:11.678 --> 00:13.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TED GATSAS (R), Mayor of
Manchester, New Hampshire:
We need to do something about
it. If we don't,

00:13.580 --> 00:14.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're not going to have to worry
about building
more beds to try and treat
people. We're going

00:14.448 --> 00:16.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to have to start building more
coffins.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And photographer
and MacArthur
grant winner LaToya Ruby Frazier
on why she

00:17.050 --> 00:18.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
documents her struggling
hometown.

00:18.819 --> 00:20.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LATOYA RUBY FRAZIER,
Photographer: I'm not
saying that it's a dying town.
I'm saying

00:20.587 --> 00:21.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we survived. Like, look at
all of the
damage, all the abuse we have
endured, and

00:21.455 --> 00:22.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we're still steadfast and
existing.

00:22.723 --> 00:22.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:23.023 --> 00:24.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:24.758 --> 00:26.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president was
by turns
tearful and tough today, as he
pushed a plan

00:26.727 --> 00:27.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to regulate more gun sales. He
said he's targeting
transactions at shows and flea
markets because

00:27.661 --> 00:29.563 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Congress is afraid to cross the
gun lobby.

00:29.596 --> 00:30.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The National Rifle Association
answered that
the proposals are -- quote --
"ripe for abuse."

00:30.764 --> 00:32.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have the story in full
after the news
summary.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news, an
American soldier
died in a firefight in Southern
Afghanistan.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two other U.S. service members
were wounded,
along with several Afghan
soldiers. Pentagon

00:36.236 --> 00:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials said it happened in
Helmand Province,
and the fighting continued for
hours.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: There
is fighting on the ground as we
speak, which

00:40.941 --> 00:45.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is why it's hard for us to have
every single
detail as to what's transpired,
and there's

00:45.512 --> 00:52.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been an effort once again, as I
mentioned
before, to make sure that
everything's being

00:52.052 --> 00:57.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done to secure the safety of
those Americans
and the Afghan forces that
they're accompanying

00:57.424 --> 00:59.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in this particular situation in
Helmand.

00:59.526 --> 01:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. special
operations forces
have been working with Afghan
troops in Helmand

01:04.498 --> 01:08.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in recent weeks to repel new
Taliban attacks.

01:08.835 --> 01:15.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fighting in Yemen returned to
full pitch today,
just days after a shaky truce
ended. Shiite

01:15.175 --> 01:21.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rebels blasted the city of Marib
with a rocket
barrage, while Saudi Arabia
launched new airstrikes

01:21.581 --> 01:28.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a series of cities, including
Sanaa. Residents
of the capital surveyed the
damage today.

01:28.155 --> 01:33.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some accused the Saudis of
hitting civilian
targets, including a health
center for the

01:33.460 --> 01:35.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
blind, but there were no
casualties.

01:35.762 --> 01:42.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Turkey, an all-too-familiar
scene today,
as the bodies of dozens more
migrants washed

01:42.302 --> 01:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up on shore. Authorities say at
least 36 people
drowned when their boats
capsized in the Aegean

01:48.542 --> 01:54.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sea trying to reach Greece.
Turkish crews
found the victims strewn along
beaches. They

01:54.982 --> 02:00.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also managed to rescue at least
12 others
from the choppy waters, but a
mass migration

02:00.821 --> 02:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agency said the danger has not
deterred people.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOEL MILLMAN, International
Organization for
Migration: Migrants and refugees
continue

02:05.826 --> 02:11.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to enter Greece at a rate of
over 2,500 a
day from Turkey, which is very
close to the

02:11.498 --> 02:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average through December, so we
see the migrant
flows are continuing through the
winter, and,

02:17.738 --> 02:20.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obviously, the fatalities are
continuing as
well.

02:20.907 --> 02:27.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last year, nearly
3,800 migrants
died trying to reach Europe by
sea.

02:27.481 --> 02:32.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the gun
control debate
dominated presidential politics
today, with

02:32.219 --> 02:37.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one exception. Democratic
hopeful Bernie Sanders
went after Wall Street, calling
it an industry

02:37.891 --> 02:43.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fueled by greed, fraud and
arrogance. He told
a crowd in New York that he'd
break up the

02:43.797 --> 02:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nation's big banks in his first
year in office.

02:47.701 --> 02:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The armed men occupying a
national wildlife
refuge in Oregon now say that
they will stay

02:53.673 --> 02:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until federal officials let
locals manage
the land. They made that demand
today at the

02:59.246 --> 03:05.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
site they have occupied since
Saturday night.
Their leader also dismissed a
sheriff's appeal

03:05.118 --> 03:08.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they go home. He said local
people welcome
their presence.

03:08.789 --> 03:15.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMMON BUNDY, Armed Protester: We
also appreciate
the advice that the community
members have

03:15.362 --> 03:22.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given us about how to reach out
and how to
share our message, so that other
community

03:22.936 --> 03:29.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members will know that we are
not about fear.
We're not about force. We're not
about intimidation.

03:29.676 --> 03:35.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So far, federal
agents have
made no move to physically force
the group

03:35.715 --> 03:37.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to leave.

03:37.517 --> 03:43.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2015, it turns out, was a banner
year for
U.S. automakers, the best ever,
in fact. Industry

03:43.323 --> 03:49.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officials projected today that
nearly 17.5
million vehicles were sold
through December.

03:49.696 --> 03:55.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That tops the old record set in
2000. General
Motors led the pack with more
than three million

03:55.335 --> 03:57.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cars and trucks sold.

03:57.971 --> 04:02.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The stock market struggled to
make any headway
today, after Monday's big
losses. The Dow

04:03.009 --> 04:10.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average gained
nine points
to close at 17158. The Nasdaq
rose 11 points,

04:10.550 --> 04:13.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the S&amp;P 500 added four.

04:13.854 --> 04:20.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And West Point now has its first
female commandant
of cadets. Brigadier General
Diana Holland

04:20.093 --> 04:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was sworn in today at the United
States Military
Academy. She's a West Point
graduate herself

04:25.999 --> 04:31.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a veteran of the Iraq and
Afghanistan
wars. Holland's appointment
comes one month

04:31.304 --> 04:37.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the military opened all
combat roles
to women, and 40 years since
West Point admitted

04:37.177 --> 04:38.979 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
women as cadets.

04:39.012 --> 04:44.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the president's
order on guns, too far or not
far enough?;

04:44.751 --> 04:51.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a view from Tehran as tensions
with Saudi
Arabia escalate; tracing
Benjamin Netanyahu's

04:51.291 --> 04:57.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
path to power; what can be done
to loosen
heroin's grip on New Hampshire;
and much more.
