JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.872 --> 00:06.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.873 --> 00:08.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.608 --> 00:10.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: The
current state of U.S.-Russia
relations is

00:10.610 --> 00:12.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at a low point.

00:12.479 --> 00:16.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson
and his Russian counterpart meet
to discuss

00:16.716 --> 00:22.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the future of the two countries'
relationship,
amid disagreements over Syria's
use of chemical

00:22.622 --> 00:24.457 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weapons.

00:24.491 --> 00:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, we sit down with NATO's
secretary-general
after his meeting at the White
House with

00:28.728 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump, who has
strongly criticized
the NATO alliance.

00:33.066 --> 00:39.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Trump administration
sets its sights
on space -- how one congressman
who controls

00:39.672 --> 00:44.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NASA's purse strings is pushing
to go to the
moon, Mars and beyond.

00:44.077 --> 00:45.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

00:45.945 --> 00:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CULBERSON (R), Texas: I
have always wanted
to restore NASA to the glory
days of Apollo,

00:48.381 --> 00:49.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as you and I remember as kids.

00:49.749 --> 00:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to see NASA go above and
beyond the
glory days of Apollo.

00:53.586 --> 01:01.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:01.461 --> 01:04.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:04.264 --> 01:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: New tensions
between the United
States and Russia dominated this
day.

01:14.174 --> 01:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America's top diplomat carried
U.S. grievances
over Syria and other issues to
Moscow, while

01:20.246 --> 01:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump spoke out in
Washington.

01:22.982 --> 01:27.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret
Warner, has our report.

01:27.220 --> 01:33.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The discord was
on display
at the very outset of Secretary
of State Rex

01:33.726 --> 01:37.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tillerson's meetings with
Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SERGEI LAVROV, Russian Foreign
Minister (through
translator): We have a lot of
questions regarding

01:40.100 --> 01:44.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very ambiguous and as well as
sometimes contradictory
ideas on coming from Washington.

01:44.938 --> 01:49.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Tillerson
acknowledged sharp
differences, and after meeting
privately with

01:49.242 --> 01:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir
Putin, he emerged
with an even grimmer appraisal.

01:53.079 --> 01:56.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON, U.S. Secretary of
State: The
current state of U.S.-Russia
relations is

01:56.182 --> 01:58.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at a low point.

01:58.485 --> 02:02.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a low level of trust
between our
two countries.

02:02.388 --> 02:06.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The world's two foremost nuclear
powers cannot
have this kind of relationship.

02:06.526 --> 02:11.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The most
immediate trigger
for tensions, a deadly sarin gas
attack in

02:11.397 --> 02:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syria last week, and the U.S.
response, a
cruise missile strike on a
Syrian air base.

02:18.571 --> 02:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lavrov again denied Russia's
ally the Syrian
government was responsible.

02:22.976 --> 02:28.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SERGEI LAVROV (through
translator): We believe
it's necessary to have an
international, unbiased,

02:28.348 --> 02:30.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
frank investigation into this
incident.

02:30.783 --> 02:35.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were no signs that would
support the
statement, the allegation that
chemical agents

02:35.321 --> 02:37.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were used there at all.

02:37.090 --> 02:41.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Tillerson
insisted again
that Syria's government did
carry out the

02:41.294 --> 02:45.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack, and he called again for
Russia to
abandon President Bashar
al-Assad.

02:45.865 --> 02:51.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: We do think it's
important
that Assad's departure is done
in an orderly

02:51.304 --> 02:57.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, an orderly way, so that
certain interests
and constituencies that he
represents feel

02:57.877 --> 03:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they have been represented
at the negotiating
table for a political solution.

03:03.283 --> 03:06.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How that occurs, we leave that
to the process
going forward.

03:06.986 --> 03:08.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But in New York
this afternoon:

03:08.788 --> 03:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador to
the United
Nations: It is long past time
for Russia to

03:12.192 --> 03:14.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stop covering for Assad.

03:14.227 --> 03:19.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Russia vetoed a
U.N. Security
Council resolution condemning
the gas attack

03:19.666 --> 03:21.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Syria.

03:21.134 --> 03:25.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The chill in Moscow today was a
far cry from
the atmosphere a year ago.

03:25.905 --> 03:31.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then-candidate Donald Trump
repeatedly praised
Vladimir Putin during the
campaign, and he

03:31.077 --> 03:36.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
suggested a rapprochement with
Russia was
both desirable and possible.

03:36.416 --> 03:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That all changed with last
week's gas attack
and President Trump's quick
response.

03:42.522 --> 03:47.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even before the meetings,
President Putin
gave his own pointed assessment
of U.S.-Russia

03:47.660 --> 03:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relations today on Russian state
television.

03:50.096 --> 03:53.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): It is possible to
say that the

03:53.066 --> 03:58.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level of trust on a working
level, especially
on the military level, it has
not improved,

03:58.271 --> 04:00.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but rather has deteriorated.

04:00.106 --> 04:05.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In turn,
President Trump
had harsh new words for the
Russians and their

04:05.545 --> 04:09.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Syrian ally Assad in an
interview that aired
on FOX Business Network.

04:09.949 --> 04:15.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
If Russia didn't go in and back
this animal,

04:15.388 --> 04:18.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you wouldn't have a problem
right now.

04:18.424 --> 04:25.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Frankly, Putin is backing a
person that's
truly an evil person.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think it's very bad for
Russia.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it's very bad for
mankind.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's very bad for this world.

04:31.504 --> 04:36.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. Trump
followed up at
a joint White House news
conference with NATO's

04:36.609 --> 04:38.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
secretary-general.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Right now, we're
not getting
along with Russia at all.

04:40.713 --> 04:45.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We may be an all-time low in
terms of relationship
with Russia.

04:45.385 --> 04:49.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has built for a long period
of time,
but we are going to see what
happens.

04:49.522 --> 04:52.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Tensions are
over more than
Syria.

04:52.725 --> 04:58.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Moscow, Secretary Tillerson
again criticized
Russia's intervention in
Ukraine, which triggered

04:58.398 --> 05:00.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Western sanctions.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REX TILLERSON: Until full
progress is made
under the Minsk accords, the
situation in

05:03.703 --> 05:09.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ukraine will remain an obstacle
to improvement
in relations between the U.S.
and Russia.

05:09.342 --> 05:13.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Lavrov gave no
ground on
Ukraine or charges of Russian
meddling in

05:13.479 --> 05:15.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the U.S. election.

05:15.315 --> 05:20.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The two men did agree to
establish a working
group to try to stabilize
relations.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

05:23.523 --> 05:28.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: China's
leader, Xi Jinping, told
President Trump that

05:28.294 --> 05:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's willing to work with the
U.S. to stop
North Korea's nuclear program
peacefully.

05:34.000 --> 05:39.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The two men spoke in a
late-night phone call,
after Mr. Trump's Twitter
warning yesterday

05:39.405 --> 05:41.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that the U.S. might act alone.

05:41.708 --> 05:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Beijing today, the Chinese
Foreign Ministry
said the call was a positive
sign.

05:46.145 --> 05:50.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LU KANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman
(through translator): On the
nuclear issue,

05:50.083 --> 05:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Xi stated China's
stance that we
abide by the objective of
de-nuclearization

05:54.554 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the peninsula, continue to
maintain the
peace and stability on the
peninsula and continue

05:59.492 --> 06:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to resolve the issue peacefully
via dialogue
and negotiation.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The U.S. clearly understands
this stance.

06:05.698 --> 06:10.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The phone call
came just days
after the two leaders met in
Florida, and

06:10.470 --> 06:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after the president seemed to
tie trade issues
to cooperation on North Korea.

06:15.742 --> 06:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the president said he
will not officially
label China a currency
manipulator.

06:21.047 --> 06:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said that today, as he had
promised during
the campaign.

06:25.251 --> 06:30.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump tweeted today that the
call with
President Xi was a very good
conversation.

06:30.757 --> 06:35.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in an interview that aired
today on FOX
Business News, he also said the
North Korea

06:35.061 --> 06:38.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
situation is -- quote -- "not as
simple as
people would think."

06:38.531 --> 06:45.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that the FBI
obtained a secret
court order last summer to
monitor communications

06:45.471 --> 06:46.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Carter Page.

06:46.739 --> 06:50.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was advising the Trump
campaign at the
time.

06:50.042 --> 06:54.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reports that
a special
court on intelligence matters
found there

06:54.714 --> 06:58.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was reason to believe Page was
acting as a
Russian agent.

06:58.518 --> 07:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today on CNN, Page said -- quote
-- "It's
just such a joke that it's
beyond words."

07:03.756 --> 07:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, President Trump's
former campaign
chair, Paul Manafort, now says
he is registering

07:09.896 --> 07:12.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the U.S. as a foreign
agent.

07:12.365 --> 07:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press confirmed
today that
his lobbying firm did receive
more than $1

07:17.603 --> 07:21.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
million from a pro-Russian
political party
in Ukraine.

07:21.374 --> 07:24.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That was in 2007 and 2009.

07:24.744 --> 07:29.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manafort previously said that
any records
of such payments were
fabricated.

07:29.916 --> 07:35.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In South Africa, tens of
thousands turned
out against President Jacob Zuma
today on

07:35.054 --> 07:36.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his 75th birthday.

07:36.923 --> 07:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the latest in a string of
protests
calling for his resignation over
allegations

07:41.828 --> 07:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of widespread corruption.

07:43.896 --> 07:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Demonstrators flooded the main
square today
in the capital, Pretoria,
chanting and carrying

07:49.335 --> 07:50.770 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a mock coffin.

07:50.803 --> 07:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Zuma attended a
birthday celebration
outside Johannesburg.

07:56.008 --> 08:01.848 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country,
Republicans managed
onto hold a U.S. House seat in
Kansas in Tuesday's

08:01.881 --> 08:04.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
special congressional election.

08:04.183 --> 08:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ron Estes won by just seven
points in a district
that went Republican in November
by 31 points.

08:11.891 --> 08:17.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrat James Thompson conceded
defeat last
night, but he said it's a
warning to Republicans

08:17.230 --> 08:19.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
everywhere.

08:19.131 --> 08:21.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES THOMPSON (D), Kansas
Congressional Candidate:
We have shown that this district
is not just

08:21.501 --> 08:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
competitive, but that we can win
it.

08:24.303 --> 08:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have already shocked this
country.

08:27.106 --> 08:31.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have sent a message that no
Republican
district in this country is
safe.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Kansas seat
had been held
by Mike Pompeo.

08:35.948 --> 08:39.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's now President Trump
director of the CIA.

08:39.285 --> 08:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans face three more
special elections
to hold onto seats in Georgia,
Montana and

08:44.390 --> 08:45.725 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
South Carolina.

08:45.758 --> 08:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their occupants also joined the
Trump administration.

08:49.462 --> 08:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House lifted a hiring
freeze on
the federal work force today.

08:53.799 --> 08:57.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump had imposed it
on his first
day in office.

08:57.637 --> 09:02.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the administration is asking
agencies
to identify cuts that they can
make in their

09:02.909 --> 09:04.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
staffs.

09:04.777 --> 09:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In economic news, the president
told The Wall
Street Journal that he is
concerned that the

09:08.414 --> 09:13.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. dollar is getting too
strong and he said
he had not decided whether to
reappoint Janet

09:13.853 --> 09:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yellen as chairman of the
Federal Reserve
when her term ends in 2018.

09:19.225 --> 09:24.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average
lost 59 points to close at
20591.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 30, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
eight.

09:28.701 --> 09:34.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I speak to
the head of NATO about how the
alliance should

09:34.640 --> 09:42.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
address today's global threats;
Florida battles
wildfires raging across the
state; make NASA

09:42.648 --> 09:43.883 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great again?

09:43.916 --> 09:57.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- the agency's future under
President Trump;
and much more.

09:57.597 --> 10:02.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As we reported earlier,
President Trump hosted
the NATO secretary-general this
afternoon

10:02.268 --> 10:03.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the White House.

10:03.769 --> 10:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a short time later, I spoke
with Jens
Stoltenberg.

10:08.207 --> 10:11.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Secretary-General, welcome
to the "NewsHour."

10:11.544 --> 10:16.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard President Trump say
today that relations
between the United States and
Russia may be

10:16.816 --> 10:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at their lowest point since the
end of the
Cold War.

10:20.453 --> 10:24.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Would you say the same thing
about relations
between NATO and Russia right
now?

10:24.457 --> 10:27.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENS STOLTENBERG, NATO
Secretary-General:
At least the relationship is
difficult.

10:27.259 --> 10:35.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that reflects that we see a
more assertive
Russia, which has implemented a
very significant

10:35.368 --> 10:41.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military buildup over several
years, and a
Russia which has used military
force against

10:41.507 --> 10:44.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
neighbors, especially Ukraine.

10:44.110 --> 10:52.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And NATO is responding to that
with the high
readiness of our forces, with
the biggest

10:52.151 --> 10:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reinforcement to our collective
defense since
the end of the Cold War.

10:55.955 --> 11:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, we say that we
are seeking
to avoid a new Cold War, avoid a
new arms

11:03.095 --> 11:07.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
race, and, therefore, we
continue to work
for a more constructive
relationship with

11:07.533 --> 11:09.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia, including political
dialogue with
Russia.

11:09.769 --> 11:14.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, how do you
prevent it
from becoming just a
oneupmanship?

11:14.340 --> 11:15.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Because you're right.

11:15.741 --> 11:19.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russians have sent more
troops, move material
to their border.

11:19.645 --> 11:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATO is now doing the same thing
on its eastern
border.

11:24.383 --> 11:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does this thing just -- how
do you keep
it from spiraling out of
control?

11:27.887 --> 11:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: Partly by
making sure that
what NATO does is proportionate,
defensive.

11:33.559 --> 11:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, we are deploying
battle groups,
battalions, which we consider
necessary to

11:42.735 --> 11:49.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convey a message of deterrence,
credible deterrence,
that if one NATO ally is
attacked, it will

11:49.709 --> 11:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trigger a whole response from
the whole alliance.

11:52.445 --> 12:01.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, at the same time, we have
been able to
convene last three meetings of
-- in what

12:01.287 --> 12:05.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we call the NATO-Russia council
after two
years without any meetings.

12:05.791 --> 12:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this council is a platform
where NATO
and Russia meets.

12:09.662 --> 12:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We discuss issues like Ukraine,
like Afghanistan,
and so on.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

12:15.634 --> 12:17.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: And that's a
way to keep
the channels for political
dialogue open and

12:17.336 --> 12:18.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to keep the tensions down.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You did just from
the meeting
with President Trump.

12:22.408 --> 12:28.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spent months and months in
his campaign
for president and even since
then criticizing

12:28.280 --> 12:35.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO, criticizing its role, at
times even
asking whether NATO was
obsolete.

12:35.654 --> 12:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do you think his -- or do
you think his
view of NATO has changed, and,
if so, why?

12:40.793 --> 12:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: I welcome the
fact that
he has clearly stated today that
NATO is not

12:44.930 --> 12:46.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
obsolete.

12:46.132 --> 12:50.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, also, that reflects
that NATO
is adapting.

12:50.302 --> 12:55.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATO is the most successful
alliance in history
because we have been able to
change, to adapt

12:55.474 --> 12:57.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when the world is changing.

12:57.209 --> 13:03.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now NATO is stepping up its
effort in
the global fight against
terrorism, and we

13:03.215 --> 13:07.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
are responding to a more
assertive Russia
with an increase of our
collective defense,

13:08.020 --> 13:11.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with more presence in the
eastern part of
the alliance.

13:11.724 --> 13:18.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as long as NATO changes when
the world
is changing, we will be very
important for

13:18.931 --> 13:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the security of all our allies,
including
the United States.

13:22.001 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you did
note today that
NATO members are increasing
their contributions

13:27.873 --> 13:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the alliance, as President
Trump has been
calling for them to do.

13:32.011 --> 13:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you confident, though, that
that is going
to continue in the way that you
and President

13:37.016 --> 13:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump say that it needs to?

13:38.751 --> 13:44.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: I expect it to
continue,
because all 28 allies have
agreed that they

13:44.790 --> 13:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will stop the cuts in defense
spending, gradual
increase, and then move towards
spending 2

13:49.461 --> 13:53.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
percent of GDP, gross domestic
product, on
defense.

13:53.399 --> 13:58.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the encouraging thing is
that we have
seen that we have turned a
corner.

13:58.938 --> 14:04.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After many, many years of
decline in defense
spending across Europe and
Canada, in 2016,

14:04.076 --> 14:07.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we saw the first significant
increase.

14:07.279 --> 14:11.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We still have a long way to go,
but at least
European allies have kind of
started move

14:11.851 --> 14:13.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the right direction.

14:13.986 --> 14:17.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also spoke
today, Mr. Secretary-General,
about the fight against
terrorism, the global

14:17.623 --> 14:22.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fight, and you said NATO has a
larger role
to play in that regard.

14:22.127 --> 14:24.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What exactly did you have in
mind?

14:24.463 --> 14:29.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: Many things,
but perhaps
the most important thing is to
build local

14:29.134 --> 14:35.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capacity, meaning train local
forces, build
the local defense institutions,
defense ministries,

14:35.541 --> 14:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
command and control, because, in
the long
run, it is expected that local
forces are

14:41.046 --> 14:46.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stabilizing their own country,
fighting terrorism
themselves, instead of NATO
deploying a large

14:46.919 --> 14:49.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
number of combat troops in
combat operations.

14:49.555 --> 14:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's NATO's experience
from Afghanistan.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have ended our combat
operations there.

14:54.927 --> 14:56.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

14:56.795 --> 15:00.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: We train the
local Afghans
to fight terrorism themselves
and think, in

15:00.633 --> 15:03.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the long run, that's a much more
sustainable
approach.

15:03.402 --> 15:07.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that is -- I
think most
observers now see Afghanistan as
slipping

15:07.806 --> 15:09.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back into chaos.

15:09.208 --> 15:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Taliban is stronger than
many people say
that it's been in years.

15:14.813 --> 15:16.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ISIS now has a foothold.

15:16.849 --> 15:21.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you're saying that that's
not a reason
for NATO to get involved?

15:21.487 --> 15:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: I'm saying
that there are
many difficult challenges in
Afghanistan.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we still have Taliban.

15:27.826 --> 15:33.399 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We still have terrorist
organizations there,
and we will see violence and we
will see conflict

15:33.432 --> 15:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there also in the coming years,.

15:36.101 --> 15:39.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have achieved at least
two important
things.

15:39.271 --> 15:44.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afghanistan is no longer a safe
haven for
international terrorists.

15:44.610 --> 15:50.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a strong Afghan army,
which is fighting
the terrorists and Taliban.

15:50.482 --> 15:56.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second thing is that
they are able
to do that without us being
there to conduct

15:56.088 --> 15:57.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the combat operations.

15:57.890 --> 16:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What NATO troops are doing in
Afghanistan
is to train, assist and advise
Afghans, but

16:02.795 --> 16:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are actually doing the
fighting.

16:04.496 --> 16:09.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are actually taking the
responsibility
for the security in their own
country.

16:09.168 --> 16:14.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is a great achievement,
compared
to what we saw just a few years
ago, when

16:14.506 --> 16:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATO troops had to conduct the
combat operations
fighting the Taliban.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you think
that war going
in the right direction, though?

16:20.512 --> 16:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: I think it is
a very important
step in the right direction that
the Afghans

16:27.453 --> 16:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have taken over responsibility
for the security
in their own country, and NATO
being able

16:32.758 --> 16:35.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to end its combat presence in
Afghanistan.

16:35.394 --> 16:43.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But,of course, there are still
many, many
uncertainties, challenges and
difficulties

16:43.902 --> 16:45.404 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Afghanistan.

16:45.437 --> 16:49.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have to enable the
Afghans to manage
those challenges themselves.

16:49.775 --> 16:51.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We cannot solve all the problems
for the Afghans.

16:51.944 --> 16:55.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Mr.
Secretary-General,
a question about Turkey, which,
as you know,

16:55.748 --> 17:00.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is just days away from a
referendum that would
grant sweeping additional powers
to President

17:00.686 --> 17:06.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan, essentially making him
-- or allowing
him to be immune from any
oversight by the

17:06.191 --> 17:08.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
parliament or by the courts.

17:08.527 --> 17:12.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, there are those who
are critics
of his who are saying that this
is going to

17:12.598 --> 17:20.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lead to if it passes is NATO's
second largest
standing army controlled, in
essence, by someone

17:20.939 --> 17:23.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who has dictatorial powers.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How comfortable would you be
with that?

17:26.779 --> 17:33.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: Turkey's a
valued ally,
important ally for NATO, not the
least because

17:33.585 --> 17:42.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of its strategic geographic
location, bordering
Syria and Iraq and close to
Russia and the

17:42.294 --> 17:44.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Black Sea.

17:44.096 --> 17:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have to remember Turkey
has suffered
many terrorist attacks, a failed
coup attempt

17:49.201 --> 17:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in July of last year, and is the
ally most
affected by the instability, the
violence

17:55.574 --> 17:58.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we see in Syria and Iraq.

17:58.143 --> 18:04.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turkey has, of course, the right
to protect
itself against terrorism,
against attacks,

18:04.216 --> 18:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I expect it to be done in a
way which
is in accordance with the rule
of law, democratic

18:12.424 --> 18:14.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
values.

18:14.259 --> 18:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is something I have
expressed several
times in meetings with the
Turkish leaders.

18:19.965 --> 18:24.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Jens Stoltenberg,
who is the
secretary-general for NATO, we
thank you very

18:24.470 --> 18:25.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

18:25.771 --> 18:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENS STOLTENBERG: Thank you so
much.

18:33.645 --> 18:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: More than 100
wildfires are
burning in and around Florida,
and the state

18:41.019 --> 18:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is expecting a difficult fire
season ahead.

18:44.189 --> 18:47.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, the governor declared
a state of
emergency there.

18:47.659 --> 18:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the latest.

18:49.294 --> 18:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Over 70,000
acres have burned
across the state since February.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the fires are not just in
one spot.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're located in all corners
of the state.

18:58.670 --> 19:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is also occurring while
Florida is dealing
with a major drought.

19:02.374 --> 19:07.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jim Karels is the director of
the Florida
Forest Service and a 32-year
veteran of fighting

19:07.613 --> 19:08.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fires.

19:08.614 --> 19:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins us from Tallahassee.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

19:11.783 --> 19:14.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jim, I wonder if you could just
give us a
sense of how things are in
Florida right now.

19:14.553 --> 19:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM KARELS, Director, Florida
Forest Service:
Dry.

19:16.388 --> 19:20.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The peninsula of Florida is --
especially
South and Central Florida,
extremely dry right

19:20.292 --> 19:21.827 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

19:21.860 --> 19:25.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's drying out as you go
north all the
way to the Georgia-Florida line.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We mentioned
you're also
dealing with a drought at the
same time.

19:29.768 --> 19:32.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much is that a contributing
factor to
all of this?

19:32.638 --> 19:38.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM KARELS: A big contributing
factor, in
that, you know, we had some late
freezes,

19:38.777 --> 19:43.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't have much of a winter
here in Florida,
but we did have a freeze late
into February,

19:43.582 --> 19:45.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
early March.

19:45.384 --> 19:49.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it went down to
South-Central Florida,
and then it really didn't rain
after that.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So you have got that dry
vegetation.

19:51.623 --> 19:58.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got -- low rainfalls
were really
since about January, kind of a
La Nina effect

19:58.897 --> 20:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that we tend to get every few
years in Florida.

20:01.867 --> 20:08.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we're into our normally
dry season,
April, May, parts of Florida,
early June,

20:08.140 --> 20:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
where we're normally dry anyway.

20:10.676 --> 20:17.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that increases the whole
situation, where
it makes it very easy for fires
to start,

20:17.349 --> 20:18.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
makes it very easy for fires to
spread.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is still
the beginning
of your fire season.

20:22.020 --> 20:24.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you have any sense of what
the longer-term
forecast is?

20:24.489 --> 20:26.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does it look like coming
down the road?

20:26.291 --> 20:30.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM KARELS: Well, we have got a
couple forecasts
out of -- one, our National Fire
Center in

20:30.796 --> 20:32.631 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Boise.

20:32.664 --> 20:39.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that pretty much paints a
red target on
Florida probably through April,
May, and June.

20:39.371 --> 20:46.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NOAA forecasts show the
drought expanding
into some parts of the state
into the same

20:46.144 --> 20:47.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
period, into April, May, June.

20:47.946 --> 20:50.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's normally our dry period.

20:50.983 --> 20:59.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Along with how dry we already
are, it really
paints a picture that we have
got a pretty

20:59.391 --> 21:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intense fire season in front of
us.

21:01.927 --> 21:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are very busy already.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.464 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're busy early.

21:05.497 --> 21:09.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're drier than normal
early, as it is
in early April right now.

21:09.768 --> 21:15.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we really expect to probably
have to fight
fire all the way to June, maybe
even July.

21:15.974 --> 21:18.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it tends to move up the
state.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our worst right now is South
Florida.

21:21.013 --> 21:24.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It moves to Central Florida, and
then it moves
to North Florida as it kind of
closes out

21:24.916 --> 21:25.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our fire seasons.

21:25.951 --> 21:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And over 100
fires.

21:29.121 --> 21:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you give us a sense of what
is causing
so many different simultaneous
fires?

21:34.526 --> 21:39.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM KARELS: Well, right now, the
majority
of our fires are human-caused,
probably 90

21:39.064 --> 21:41.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
percent of them.

21:41.099 --> 21:42.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Various different things.

21:42.934 --> 21:47.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some of it is yard trash
burning, where people
are cleaning, spring cleaning,
and they're

21:47.439 --> 21:49.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
burning their leaves.

21:49.274 --> 21:53.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some of it is vehicles,
catalytic convertors,
that type, or equipment working
in the woods

21:53.445 --> 21:55.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or the wildlands.

21:55.681 --> 21:57.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some of it is arson, incendiary.

21:57.816 --> 21:59.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have some issues with that.

21:59.751 --> 22:03.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then this past weekend, we
got some lightning,
so we're starting to see the
lightning fires

22:03.922 --> 22:05.724 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
evolve as well.

22:05.757 --> 22:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Most Americans
think of
fires out West in the very dry
brush and forestland

22:09.795 --> 22:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we see out there, but I
understand that the
type of vegetation that is
burning and the

22:14.099 --> 22:16.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way it burns in Florida is quite
different.

22:16.134 --> 22:18.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM KARELS: It is.

22:18.270 --> 22:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fire evolved under fire, so it
was constant
fire prior to humans.

22:23.809 --> 22:28.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the vegetation tends to be
more waxy,
more resinous.

22:28.413 --> 22:31.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What we say is, in Florida,
green burns.

22:31.316 --> 22:33.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's different from the West.

22:33.118 --> 22:39.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The West, the fuels tend to be
very cured,
very dry, very -- essentially
dead, where,

22:39.591 --> 22:44.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down here, you come in here and
you look at
our vegetation, you think that's
not going

22:44.296 --> 22:46.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to burn, and it's just the
opposite.

22:46.631 --> 22:49.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it burns under a lot
higher humidity.

22:49.701 --> 22:54.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our fires can burn very
intensely all the
way up to 40, 50 percent
humidity.

22:54.940 --> 22:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the West, it tends to be 20
percent or
below.

22:57.509 --> 23:00.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With all these
different
fires across the state, what is
the danger

23:00.979 --> 23:02.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the human population?

23:02.647 --> 23:07.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JIM KARELS: As you know,
Florida's got a big
population, about 20 million
people.

23:07.119 --> 23:14.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, just about every fire we
have impacts
what we call the urban
interface, or homes,

23:14.459 --> 23:15.694 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
structures.

23:15.727 --> 23:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so far this year, we have
evacuated over
1,800 homes.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And we lost 27.

23:21.500 --> 23:30.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we saved a lot, impacted a
good number
of people in their daily lives
from the wildfires.

23:30.308 --> 23:36.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing in Florida
that it really
experiences is the impact on the
roadways.

23:36.348 --> 23:38.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We get smoke on the highways.

23:38.750 --> 23:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With all those people and with a
lot of tourists
moving through the state, the
roads become

23:44.289 --> 23:46.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dangerous when the visibility
gets down low.

23:46.725 --> 23:49.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right, Jim
Karels of
the Florida Forest Service,
thank you very

23:49.828 --> 23:50.796 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

23:50.829 --> 23:51.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And good luck down there.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM KARELS: Thank you.

23:54.733 --> 24:01.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

24:01.807 --> 24:08.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
new investigation
finds nearly 2,000 allegations
of sexual abuse

24:08.213 --> 24:15.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by U.N. peacekeepers; what's
left in an ancient
Assyrian city after years of
ISIS rule; and

24:22.994 --> 24:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: How will NASA's
mission change
under President Trump and a
Republican Congress

24:28.667 --> 24:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that helps decide where money
should go?

24:31.536 --> 24:37.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some big changes could be in
store for space
exploration and the missions set
into place

24:37.242 --> 24:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now that could stretch well
beyond the Trump
era.

24:40.879 --> 24:45.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has the story for
our weekly
segment about the Leading Edge
of science

24:45.217 --> 24:47.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

MILES O'BRIEN: The balcony at
Congressman
John Culberson's office on
Capitol Hill offers

24:53.091 --> 24:59.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a sweeping panorama of
Washington, but the
Republican from Houston is
usually looking

24:59.164 --> 25:02.634 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
higher.

JOHN CULBERSON (R), Texas:
There's Mercury.

25:09.508 --> 25:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mars is going to appear right
here.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We go this way, there's Orion.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sirius is going to appear right
here.

25:12.978 --> 25:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Culberson has
more than a hobby-level
interest in space.

25:14.446 --> 25:17.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He chairs the House
Appropriations Subcommittee
that oversees NASA.

25:17.983 --> 25:23.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his ninth term, he is riding
high, as the

his strategy

25:23.722 --> 25:25.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for exploring space.

JOHN CULBERSON: NASA has been
underfunded
for far too long.

25:28.593 --> 25:33.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have been short-sticked by
previous administrations,
this past administration.

25:33.498 --> 25:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm very excited and pleased
to see President
Trump recommend enough funding
for NASA as

25:39.471 --> 25:40.805 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a whole.

25:40.839 --> 25:43.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: President Trump
apparently
sees NASA as a priority.

25:43.875 --> 25:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's made passing references to
space in his
inaugural address.

25:47.312 --> 25:52.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We stand at the birth of a new
millennium,

25:52.417 --> 25:55.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ready to unlock the mysteries of
space.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And in his speech
to Congress.

25:58.056 --> 26:02.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: American
footprints on distant
worlds are not too big a dream.

26:02.994 --> 26:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: The Trump
administration is
proposing only a 1 percent
reduction in NASA's

26:08.366 --> 26:10.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
$19 billion annual budget.

26:10.902 --> 26:14.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hardest-hit programs are science
and education.

26:14.706 --> 26:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at a time when the federal
scientific
enterprise is facing deep,
unprecedented cuts,

26:20.412 --> 26:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the space agency may have dodged
a missile.

26:23.815 --> 26:29.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump's space advisers
include former
House Speaker Newt Gingrich and
former Congressman

26:29.220 --> 26:33.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bob Walker, who served as
chairman of the
subcommittee that oversees NASA.

26:33.391 --> 26:38.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT WALKER (R), Former U.S.
Congressman:
Newt has had several
conversations with Trump

26:38.163 --> 26:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and with Vice President Pence.

26:41.566 --> 26:45.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And both of them are space
cadets.

26:45.470 --> 26:50.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are other fairly
high-ranking people
in the White House who are also
space cadets.

26:51.009 --> 26:55.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In this case,
space cadet is
a compliment.

26:55.380 --> 26:59.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Walker says the White House
would like NASA
to get out of low Earth orbit,
leaving that

26:59.517 --> 27:02.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
realm to private enterprise.

27:02.487 --> 27:08.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beyond that, the space agency
takes a role
that increases with the distance
from Earth.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The administration is also
focused on humans
returning to the moon.

27:11.930 --> 27:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT WALKER: I think the moon
is an important
step on the way to Mars.

27:15.634 --> 27:23.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you have to have some
experience in
a very hostile environment where
you develop

27:23.508 --> 27:29.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the technologies that
you need to
exist on Mars before you
actually head to

27:29.481 --> 27:31.216 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Mars.

27:31.249 --> 27:33.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: For Congressman
Culberson,
that is well and good, but he
believes the

27:33.885 --> 27:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
most important green-lit mission
is aimed
at this object, the icy moon of
Jupiter, Europa.

27:41.459 --> 27:47.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Europa Clipper was approved
by the Obama
administration and Congress in
2015, more

27:47.298 --> 27:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than 10 years after Culberson
began obsessively
pushing NASA to go there.

27:52.937 --> 27:55.907 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Europa has always fascinated
him.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beneath the ice is a salty
ocean.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.078 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How much?

28:00.111 --> 28:03.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He answers the question with a
poster on foam
core he keeps in his office.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CULBERSON: This is all the
water on Earth,
both fresh and salt, and all the
water on

28:08.586 --> 28:10.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Europa.

28:10.455 --> 28:13.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a free-floating ice
shell, and there's
two to three times more water on
Europa than

28:13.892 --> 28:15.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there is on Earth.

28:15.794 --> 28:19.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Scientists find
this tantalizing,
because, no matter how far down
they explore

28:19.364 --> 28:22.834 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our oceans, they find all
kinds of living
creatures.

28:22.867 --> 28:28.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN PETER HAND, NASA: And with
that much
water out there today in our
solar system,

28:28.540 --> 28:30.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that begs the question, could
there be life
within that ocean?

28:30.942 --> 28:37.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jet propulsion
laboratory astrobiologist
Kevin Hand is in line to be the
project scientist

28:37.282 --> 28:42.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a NASA mission to land on
Europa by about
2030.

28:42.387 --> 28:46.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That lander would be preceded by
an orbiter
slated for launch in 2022.

28:46.257 --> 28:52.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The orbiter is designed to
capture stunning
imagery and detailed science
about the salts

28:53.031 --> 28:58.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and any organic compounds on the
surface,
and use radar to look beneath at
the boundary

28:58.636 --> 29:01.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between the ice and the ocean.

29:01.106 --> 29:03.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of this will help them
determine where
to land.

29:03.508 --> 29:08.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEVIN PETER HAND: We'd love to
melt through
the ice and reach the ocean
directly, but,

29:08.146 --> 29:15.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
based on the evidence we have,
Europa's ice
shell does serve as a relatively
good window

29:15.420 --> 29:17.188 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the ocean below.

29:17.222 --> 29:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We could, perhaps by sampling
the surface,
also be sampling ocean material,
and thereby

29:23.361 --> 29:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also be potentially grabbing a
sample that
could have some little Europa
organisms.

29:28.099 --> 29:33.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But, for many
years, NASA didn't
seem interested in Europan
krill.

29:33.905 --> 29:39.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NASA administrator under
George W. Bush,
Mike Griffin, thwarted
Culberson's first attempt

29:39.844 --> 29:41.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to land on Europa.

29:41.513 --> 29:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a mission called the
Jupiter Icy Moons
Orbiter.

29:44.783 --> 29:50.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was canceled in 2006 to
pay for completion
of the International Space
Station.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.823 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

29:51.856 --> 29:53.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CULBERSON: When Mike
Griffin canceled
the Europa mission last decade,
it scarred

29:53.458 --> 29:57.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me so badly, I swore I wouldn't
let the bureaucrats
cancel this mission again.

29:57.996 --> 30:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, today, the Europa orbiter
and lander is
the only mission it is still
illegal for NASA

30:04.335 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not to fly.

30:05.336 --> 30:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: You heard right.

30:07.472 --> 30:13.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Culberson made the Europa
orbiter and lander
missions the law of the land in
2015.

30:13.311 --> 30:16.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But exploring Europa is
challenging and expensive.

30:16.948 --> 30:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NASA managers complained their
plate was already
too full with the space station
and an extensive

30:22.220 --> 30:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
campaign to explore Mars.

30:27.058 --> 30:33.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the focus on Mars is
sustained by the
goal of eventually sending
humans to the surface.

30:33.331 --> 30:39.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Europa is only a destination for
robots, and
hearty ones at that.

30:39.070 --> 30:43.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lethal radiation levels ensure
no human can
ever visit.

30:43.741 --> 30:49.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It makes the mission less
attractive to the
powerful astronaut side of the
House at NASA.

30:49.347 --> 30:53.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in this war of the worlds,
Mars has met
its match.

30:53.484 --> 30:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT WALKER: The fact that
people are talking
about Europa right now is a
result of Chairman

30:58.590 --> 31:00.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Culberson's interest in it.

31:00.859 --> 31:07.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact is that he has
caused NASA to
say, if that's what Chairman
Culberson wants,

31:07.098 --> 31:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's what Chairman Culberson
gets.

31:09.000 --> 31:09.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

31:10.001 --> 31:13.004 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Culberson isn't
stopping there.

31:13.037 --> 31:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has written a 50-year plan
for NASA that
includes a spacecraft that can
go 10 percent

31:18.676 --> 31:24.649 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the speed of light for
humanity's first interstellar
mission to the nearest
Earth-like star.

31:24.682 --> 31:29.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The launch date is 2069, 100
years after the
first moon landing.

31:29.554 --> 31:31.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CULBERSON: I have always
wanted to restore
NASA to the glory days of
Apollo, as you and

31:33.524 --> 31:34.859 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I remember as kids.

31:34.893 --> 31:38.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to see NASA go above and
beyond the
glory days of Apollo.

31:38.563 --> 31:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Culberson is all
about making
NASA great again.

31:42.467 --> 31:46.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But watch what happened in the
Oval Office
after the president signed the
authorization

31:46.971 --> 31:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill for space agency's current
budget.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN CULBERSON: Mr. President,
if I may, just
as Americans remember that
President Eisenhower

31:53.144 --> 31:57.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the father of the interstate
highway system,
with your bill signing today and
your vision

31:57.181 --> 32:00.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and leadership, future
generations will remember
that President Donald Trump was
the father

32:00.718 --> 32:02.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the interplanetary highway
system.

32:02.520 --> 32:03.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, that sounds
exciting.

32:03.655 --> 32:04.689 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:04.722 --> 32:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: First, we want to
fix our highways.

32:07.325 --> 32:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're going to fix our highways.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

32:11.396 --> 32:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Europa and Mars
may beckon,
but, for politicians, it's never
wise to ignore

32:15.333 --> 32:21.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the potholes, even when
surrounded by people
who care more about black holes.

32:21.539 --> 32:27.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Miles O'Brien
in Washington.

32:28.012 --> 32:39.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The peacekeeping
force deployed
by the United Nations has come
under increasing

32:39.257 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
scrutiny in recent years.

32:41.192 --> 32:46.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is due in no small part to
past allegations
of sexual abuse by troops
deployed in countries

32:46.998 --> 32:51.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the Democratic Republic of
the Congo
and the Central African
Republic.

32:51.936 --> 32:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new investigation by the
Associated Press
finds the problem of sexual
abuse and exploitation

32:57.842 --> 33:03.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by peacekeepers is wider and
even more disturbing
than previously known.

33:03.281 --> 33:06.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has the story
from our New
York studios.

33:06.184 --> 33:10.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The AP found
nearly 2,000
allegations of abuse and
exploitation in the

33:10.788 --> 33:12.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
past 12 years.

33:12.090 --> 33:14.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 300 of those cases
involved children.

33:14.959 --> 33:19.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since the U.N. cannot punish
peacekeepers
from other countries, only a
fraction of the

33:19.864 --> 33:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
alleged perpetrators served jail
time.

33:22.000 --> 33:27.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The AP also spoke with officials
in 23 countries
who had troops serving as
peacekeepers and

33:27.572 --> 33:30.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
were accused of these
violations.

33:30.074 --> 33:35.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Trish Wilson is the
international investigators
editor who oversaw the AP story.

33:35.079 --> 33:36.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ms. Wilson, thanks for joining
us.

33:36.647 --> 33:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did you come upon the
investigations that
were under way by the U.N.?

33:40.752 --> 33:44.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISH WILSON, Associated Press:
Well, earlier
last year, there was a lot of
reporting out

33:44.122 --> 33:49.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Congo and the Central
African Republic
about another wave of
allegations against

33:49.360 --> 33:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. peacekeepers, so we decided
to take a
look at the numbers going back
to 2004, when

33:55.099 --> 33:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the first wave of allegations
came out against
peacekeepers.

33:58.903 --> 34:01.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's what got us started.

34:01.439 --> 34:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From there, we just kind of --
we just counted
the number of allegations per
year that the

34:06.744 --> 34:08.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.N. had reported.

34:08.546 --> 34:12.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, you have
zoomed in
on Haiti and started to look at
almost a pattern

34:12.984 --> 34:14.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of behavior here.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What happened there?

34:16.587 --> 34:20.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRISH WILSON: Haiti has been
singled out as
being a country where a lot of
these abuses

34:20.558 --> 34:24.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have occurred in an unusually
high number,
given the total of 2,000.

34:24.662 --> 34:27.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we just went to look and see
what we could
find out in Haiti.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We compiled the numbers.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We found 150 cases.

34:30.835 --> 34:33.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We found a lot of cases
involving children.

34:33.871 --> 34:38.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as we were doing the
reporting -- we
have a team in Haiti and we sent
our investigative

34:38.910 --> 34:40.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reporter Paisley Dodds to Haiti.

34:40.978 --> 34:46.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, eventually, we stumbled
across this internal
report, investigative report
from the U.N.

34:46.884 --> 34:54.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which chronicled this amazing
tale of children
that were in a sex ring that was
abused -- and

34:54.892 --> 34:58.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were abused by U.N. peacekeepers
over a three-year
period.

34:58.162 --> 35:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was nine children abused by
134 U.N. peacekeepers.

35:02.300 --> 35:07.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, these
children were
paid sometimes, what, a few
pennies or a dollar

35:07.405 --> 35:09.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at a time for sex acts?

35:09.373 --> 35:11.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TRISH WILSON: Yes.

35:11.209 --> 35:16.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was low as -- there was food,
yogurt, juice
given to the children, who were
hungry, and

35:16.114 --> 35:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's why they did this.

35:18.082 --> 35:23.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw -- the lowest amount we
found was 75
cents, and the highest amount
was $20.

35:23.554 --> 35:28.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: On the one
hand, the U.N.
conducts what you call a
thorough investigation,

35:28.493 --> 35:29.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but then what happens after
that?

35:29.760 --> 35:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRISH WILSON: You know, that's
what's curious.

35:31.929 --> 35:34.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was really a very good
investigation by
the U.N.

35:34.732 --> 35:36.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They looked -- they went to the
children.

35:36.534 --> 35:38.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They made sure that the children
were not
making it up.

35:38.736 --> 35:44.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The children actually spoke
Sinhalese, which
is -- which was very telling.

35:44.075 --> 35:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They showed pictures of 1,000
peacekeepers
to the children.

35:47.645 --> 35:51.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the children identified
various locations
where they had sex with these --
or were forced

35:52.016 --> 35:55.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to have sex, or lured into
having sex by these
peacekeepers.

35:55.253 --> 35:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So it was really quite a good
investigation.

35:58.055 --> 36:02.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What happened after that
investigation is
what typically happens at the
U.N. and is

36:02.360 --> 36:06.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the reasons why this is
such an important
study, or case study.

36:06.130 --> 36:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's -- the problem is that the
U.N. is in
a legal bind.

36:11.269 --> 36:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you said when you opened the
segment, it
doesn't have jurisdiction over
any of these

36:16.073 --> 36:17.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

36:17.141 --> 36:19.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So the deal is, here's our
investigative report.

36:19.310 --> 36:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now it's time for Sri Lanka to
come in and
take a look at this report.

36:22.413 --> 36:27.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in this case, Sri Lanka
did; 114 of those
soldiers were sent home.

36:27.451 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what happened after that is
anybody's
guess.

36:30.221 --> 36:31.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is no accountability.

36:31.756 --> 36:36.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are no names of any of
these people,
and nobody ever went to jail.

36:36.060 --> 36:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if you can imagine, these
kinds of corroborated
crimes against children over a
three-year

36:42.900 --> 36:47.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
period, corroborated by a U.N.
investigative
team, and then nothing happens.

36:47.471 --> 36:51.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And you point
out that there
was -- you said that some of
these students

36:51.475 --> 36:55.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or some of these children
were speaking
Sinhalese, which is one of the
languages spoken

36:55.046 --> 36:56.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Sri Lanka.

36:56.847 --> 36:59.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how would they have known it
if they had
not been in touch with these
peacekeepers?

36:59.617 --> 37:02.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There were other countries as
well involved.

37:02.587 --> 37:04.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's happening in other
parts of the world.

37:04.121 --> 37:05.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRISH WILSON: Yes, there have
been allegations
all over the world.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, this particular story
focused on Haiti.

37:09.827 --> 37:12.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we are looking at -- we are
doing a series.

37:12.763 --> 37:16.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the first in a series
that looks at
what's been going on with U.N.
peacekeepers.

37:16.601 --> 37:22.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there have been, sure,
problems in Central
Africa Republic, problems in
Congo with U.N.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.242 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
peacekeepers, as well as other
places.

37:24.275 --> 37:28.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's been
the reaction
from the United Nations to this?

37:28.346 --> 37:31.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRISH WILSON: Well, they say
that they are
very concerned.

37:31.716 --> 37:33.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do not think that this is
acceptable.

37:33.851 --> 37:38.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They seem to want -- they have
announced yet
another wave of reforms.

37:38.522 --> 37:42.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But these reforms are very
similar to what
they announced in 2004, when the
first wave

37:42.994 --> 37:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of allegations became public.

37:44.395 --> 37:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the question is, well, how
do you fix
this?

37:48.499 --> 37:50.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is this OK?

37:50.368 --> 37:55.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Can we really pay for
peacekeepers to go abroad
to protect people, and, instead,
have this

37:55.673 --> 38:00.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appalling abuse against the very
civilians
they're sent to protect?

38:00.378 --> 38:02.213 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

38:02.246 --> 38:05.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Trish Wilson
from the Associated
Press, thanks so much for
joining us.

38:05.549 --> 38:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TRISH WILSON: Thank you for
having me.

38:10.254 --> 38:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The ISIS campaign
of terror,
murder and conquest has been
well-documented,

38:22.933 --> 38:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the group has also used its
particular
interpretation of Islam to
justify the destruction

38:28.272 --> 38:33.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of historical treasures in what
is known as
the Fertile Crescent, the area
in Mesopotamia

38:33.811 --> 38:39.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, where
the earliest recorded
civilizations began.

38:39.650 --> 38:45.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the ancient ruins of Nimrud
in Northern
Iraq, special correspondent
Marcia Biggs reports.

38:45.623 --> 38:49.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's part of our ongoing
coverage of Culture
at Risk.

38:49.660 --> 38:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The road to the
cradle of civilization
is finally accessible.

38:56.267 --> 39:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're making our way there to
see what's left
of a 3,000-year-old city after
only 2.5 years

39:02.206 --> 39:04.075 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
under ISIS.

39:04.108 --> 39:09.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With us, two archaeologists,
Leila Salih,
originally from nearby Mosul,
and Tobin Hartnell,

39:09.513 --> 39:13.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an Australian teaching at a
local Kurdish
university.

39:13.517 --> 39:19.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It takes us four hours to travel
the roughly
35 miles, through checkpoint
after checkpoint

39:19.323 --> 39:25.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
controlled by Kurdish Peshmerga
and Iraqi
Shia militias.

39:25.496 --> 39:30.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Sheik Khalid Al-Sabah
Al-Jabbouri commands
the Shia militia controlling the
area.

39:30.034 --> 39:34.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He grew up in this village, and
treasures
memories of picnics at Nimrud
and the buses

39:34.638 --> 39:36.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
full of tourists.

39:36.507 --> 39:39.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHALID AL-JABBOURI, Militia
Commander (through
translator): For us in this
village, Nimrud

39:40.010 --> 39:42.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is one of the first things we
saw when we
were born.

39:42.580 --> 39:45.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This ancient city and its
antiques it's a
part of our life.

39:45.683 --> 39:50.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Nimrud is the
ancient city known
as Calah in the Bible, capital
of the Assyrian

39:50.654 --> 39:55.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
empire, known for its famous
lamassu, winged
bulls guarding the gates of the
palace.

39:56.026 --> 39:58.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was destroyed in the seventh
century B.C.

39:58.863 --> 40:05.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its ruins buried in time,
archaeologists unearthed
it 2,500 years later.

40:05.069 --> 40:10.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Islamic State captured
parts of Northern
Iraq in 2014, it declared war on
the ruins

40:10.508 --> 40:15.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Nimrud, releasing this video
of ISIS militants
taking sledgehammers to the
ancient site,

40:15.846 --> 40:29.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
drilling holes in its carvings,
and finally
blowing the entire place up.

40:29.493 --> 40:34.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When ISIS took the town, they
also destroyed
Sheik Khalid's home and killed
40 of his family

40:34.999 --> 40:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
members, including two brothers.

40:37.468 --> 40:41.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he says he rarely cried,
until he saw
this ISIS video.

40:41.739 --> 40:47.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KHALID AL-JABBOURI (through
translator): I
lost something priceless.

40:47.578 --> 40:51.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My sorrow lies in the fact that
we lost something
that we were so proud of when
tourists came

40:51.982 --> 40:53.851 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to our country.

40:53.884 --> 40:59.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pride we felt for them and
our civilization,
what our forefathers made for
our country,

40:59.056 --> 41:01.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's a subject that's part of
our soul.

41:01.659 --> 41:06.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Saddam regime fell in
2003, we and
our clans protected those
monuments because

41:06.797 --> 41:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there was no central Iraqi
government.

41:09.366 --> 41:11.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were able to protect the
palace from looting.

41:11.902 --> 41:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But ISIS, ISIS did something we
were not expecting.

41:15.439 --> 41:21.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The area was taken
back by Iraqi
forces last November, but it was
forever changed.

41:21.812 --> 41:26.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we arrived, the first thing
we noticed
was that the pyramid-like
structure, the famous

41:26.083 --> 41:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ziggurat of the Ishtar Temple,
was erased
from its skyline, and the temple
once at its

41:31.655 --> 41:34.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feet the victim of a massive
explosion.

41:34.592 --> 41:40.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOBIN HARTNELL, Archaeologist:
Every photograph,
every view I have ever seen of
Nimrud has

41:40.898 --> 41:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that temple, that ziggurat.

41:42.132 --> 41:44.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's gone.

41:44.668 --> 41:50.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the thing that is the
most devastating,
is to see it just bulldozed,
just -- it's

41:50.074 --> 41:51.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gone.

41:51.175 --> 41:54.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The iconic image of Nimrud is
with the ziggurat.

41:54.778 --> 41:59.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: For Tobin
Hartnell, this was
an experience he'd waited for.

41:59.283 --> 42:05.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He studied Assyria and its
ancient capital
for 15 years, yet he had never
seen it.

42:05.055 --> 42:10.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He took a job teaching at the
American University
of Iraq in 2014 and was just
about to move

42:10.794 --> 42:13.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his family when ISIS swept
through the region.

42:13.097 --> 42:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOBIN HARTNELL: We got basically
the e-mail
or a call, in my case, an
e-mail, saying,

42:18.235 --> 42:22.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, you don't have to accept
the job because
ISIS has just taken Mosul.

42:22.606 --> 42:27.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My wife and I, we talked about
it, we're going,
because, as archaeologists, this
is where

42:27.378 --> 42:29.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the work needs to be.

42:29.179 --> 42:31.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And how does it
feel to be walking
down these steps for the first
time?

42:31.916 --> 42:34.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TOBIN HARTNELL: I mean, it's
bittersweet.

42:34.084 --> 42:40.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an incredible site that
I have been
looking forward to going to for
over 20 years.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And look at it.

42:42.493 --> 42:46.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, walking over rubble, the
destruction
that ISIS has left has turned
one of the most

42:46.997 --> 42:51.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
magnificent palaces of Assyria
into a disaster
zone.

42:51.402 --> 42:56.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The gates of the
famous Northwest
Palace, once the home of
magnificent winged

42:56.073 --> 42:59.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bulls, reduced to rubble, its
walls bare.

42:59.677 --> 43:05.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOBIN HARTNELL: I never got to
see the gate
as it should be seen, that these
bulls welcomed

43:05.049 --> 43:06.817 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you to the palace.

43:06.850 --> 43:10.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEILA SALIH, Archaeologist:
Every Assyrian
gates have a couple of winged
bulls, so we

43:10.821 --> 43:12.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cannot imagine the gates without
them.

43:12.790 --> 43:16.060 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It wasn't Leila
Salih's first
time here.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was 14 years old when she
first visited
Nimrud.

43:18.662 --> 43:23.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEILA SALIH: To be honest with
you, at that
time, we didn't care about
historical things

43:23.934 --> 43:26.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or ancient civilization things.

43:26.170 --> 43:29.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We just would like to escape out
of school.

43:29.373 --> 43:36.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what I can remember, the
huge figure of
lamassu and the facade of that
palace.

43:36.680 --> 43:40.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: But this was a
happy place for
you to come with friends and
family?

43:40.751 --> 43:41.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LEILA SALIH: Of course.

43:41.986 --> 43:44.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a very happy and wonderful,
amazing place
for us.

43:44.855 --> 43:49.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Salih is from
nearby Mosul,
much of it still controlled by
ISIS.

43:49.293 --> 43:53.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She fled in 2014 with only a
handbag.

43:53.163 --> 43:58.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was the curator for the
Mosul Museum,
which ISIS was seen destroying
in these videos.

43:58.802 --> 44:04.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, even with the widespread
damage, both
she and Hartnell say there is
still hope for

44:04.541 --> 44:05.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nimrud.

44:05.943 --> 44:12.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEILA SALIH: I thought we lost
everything,
as you see in the video.

44:12.116 --> 44:16.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But after I visited Nimrud, yes,
there are
some positive signs for us.

44:16.353 --> 44:20.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOBIN HARTNELL: You can see the
wings of the
bull here.

44:20.591 --> 44:25.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: One source of
hope, large chunks
of the rubble still exist, which
makes restoration

44:25.462 --> 44:27.264 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
easier.

44:27.297 --> 44:31.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And several of the original
lamassu bulls
excavated in the 19th century
have been living

44:31.735 --> 44:35.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for decades in museums in London
and New York.

44:35.406 --> 44:39.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While the displaying of Iraq's
antiquities
abroad may have been
controversial, for the

44:39.443 --> 44:44.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man whose childhood was spent
among the ruins,
this actually provides some
comfort.

44:44.148 --> 44:48.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHALID AL-JABBOURI (through
translator): Maybe
we Iraqis felt hurt when we saw
our monuments

44:48.952 --> 44:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
displayed outside of Iraq.

44:50.921 --> 44:53.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We get hurt because it's our
civilization.

44:53.157 --> 44:57.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when ISIS occupied the city,
I felt relieved
that Nimrud monuments had been
transported

44:57.928 --> 45:00.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outside of Iraq and remain
protected.

45:00.464 --> 45:03.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we are proud of them
wherever they are.

45:03.133 --> 45:09.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: And after over 100
years of
excavation, Hartnell says less
than a quarter

45:09.707 --> 45:11.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the ancient city was actually
unearthed.

45:11.875 --> 45:18.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOBIN HARTNELL: There's still
1,000, 2,000
years of history underneath that
palace.

45:18.315 --> 45:20.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The whole city is waiting to be
discovered.

45:20.184 --> 45:24.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So, in some ways,
this being
razed will allow archaeologists
to see what's

45:24.788 --> 45:26.657 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
underneath?

45:26.690 --> 45:29.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOBIN HARTNELL: If, when we're
doing our cleanup
and restoration, we take some
more time to

45:30.027 --> 45:36.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dig down, we will find many more
discoveries
from what happened before the
empire, what

45:36.867 --> 45:41.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened in the 10th, 11th, 12th
centuries,
which are also great periods in
Mesopotamian

45:41.538 --> 45:42.506 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

45:42.539 --> 45:44.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And yet we know almost nothing.

45:44.441 --> 45:47.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: For Hartnell,
amidst the sobering
reality of finally checking
Nimrud off his

45:47.978 --> 45:51.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bucket list, comfort in
determining what needs
be done.

45:51.749 --> 45:58.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOBIN HARTNELL: You have to see,
be there,
see the destruction to start to
formulate

45:58.388 --> 45:59.356 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a plan.

45:59.389 --> 46:01.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Archaeologists need to be on the
ground.

46:01.225 --> 46:06.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I won't say a dream comes
true, but it
was on my dream list before it
was destroyed,

46:06.797 --> 46:08.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and for very good reason.

46:08.465 --> 46:11.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a fantastic place, and I
think it
will be again.

46:11.268 --> 46:16.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: As the sun sets on
Nimrud, it's
a promise that a new day will
come.

46:16.640 --> 46:23.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Marcia Biggs in
Nimrud, Northern Iraq.

46:23.781 --> 46:34.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now the latest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

46:34.091 --> 46:39.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's "The Refugees," a short
story collection
from last year's winner of the
Pulitzer Prize

46:39.329 --> 46:41.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Fiction.

46:41.131 --> 46:45.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown talked with Viet
Thanh Nguyen
at this year's Conference of the
Association

46:45.269 --> 46:49.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of American Writers and writing
programs here
in Washington, D.C.

46:49.640 --> 46:55.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I wanted to start
with -- maybe
it's a basic question, but it's
the word refugees,

46:55.779 --> 46:57.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because it's an important one to
you.

46:57.681 --> 46:58.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN, Author, "The
Refugees":
Right.

46:58.682 --> 47:00.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What does it
mean?

47:00.584 --> 47:02.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: To be a
refugee, especially
in our contemporary moment, is
to be different

47:02.986 --> 47:04.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than an immigrant.

47:04.755 --> 47:08.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think immigrants are somewhat
acceptable
to Europe and the United States,
but refugees

47:08.992 --> 47:11.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are the unwanted from wherever
they come from.

47:11.395 --> 47:15.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're often unwanted where
they come
to, and especially in the United
States.

47:15.132 --> 47:17.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Americans think it's
un-American to
be a refugee.

47:17.768 --> 47:21.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, it's actually really
important for me
to continually assert, I am a
refugee, I write

47:21.705 --> 47:26.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about refugees, and that we need
to think
about the necessity of opening
our doors and

47:26.810 --> 47:28.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
welcoming refugees in.

47:28.645 --> 47:34.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Living between
worlds, never
leaving one behind fully, why is
that so much

47:34.451 --> 47:38.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harder for the refugee than
other -- than
the immigrant or others?

47:38.989 --> 47:42.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I think
immigrants do feel
some of that attachment to
wherever they came

47:42.659 --> 47:47.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from, but they usually made a
choice to go
somewhere, and they have decided
to look forward

47:47.664 --> 47:48.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to some extent.

47:48.966 --> 47:52.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But refugees are often compelled
to leave
by violent circumstance.

47:52.436 --> 47:54.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're really still attached to
wherever
they came from.

47:54.738 --> 47:58.942 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, that's where I think
refugees oftentimes
have a hard time adjusting, at
least psychologically.

47:58.976 --> 48:03.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They may adjust culturally and
economically,
but, psychologically, half of
them is still

48:03.547 --> 48:05.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
somewhere else.

48:05.382 --> 48:08.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, in the first
story in this
new collection, "Black-Eyed
Women," the main

48:08.352 --> 48:13.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
character is a woman who's a
Vietnamese American
ghostwriter, right?

48:13.957 --> 48:16.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So she's actually there, but not
there, literally.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Right.

48:18.695 --> 48:22.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I wanted to make it sort
of a story
that was about ghosts in many
different ways.

48:22.165 --> 48:25.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's a ghostwriter, but she's
actually haunted
by a real ghost.

48:25.235 --> 48:27.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

48:27.037 --> 48:28.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: And that
ghost is of her
dead brother, who she thought
had died on

48:28.906 --> 48:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the escape from Vietnam on a
boat.

48:30.307 --> 48:32.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, one night, he comes
knocking on
the door.

48:32.576 --> 48:35.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's literally a ghost who swam
thousands
of miles to get to her door.

48:35.913 --> 48:40.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's about the figurative
and the literal
hauntings that so many people
who have escaped

48:40.150 --> 48:42.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
through traumatic circumstances
continue to
live with.

48:42.286 --> 48:43.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

48:43.287 --> 48:44.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the emphasis is on the real
ghost, right?

48:44.755 --> 48:46.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Right.

48:46.290 --> 48:51.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, real, as in
these people
are alive for your characters?

48:51.995 --> 48:53.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Yes.

48:53.397 --> 48:55.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, for many people --
many cultures,
ghosts really exist.

48:55.599 --> 48:59.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, literally, Vietnamese
people, for
example, often recount being
visited by people

48:59.836 --> 49:02.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have just died, not to haunt
them, but
to come and say goodbye.

49:02.806 --> 49:06.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As I read through
the stories
in this book, you have got
characters who

49:06.710 --> 49:09.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have lived here in the U.S. for
a long time.

49:09.313 --> 49:11.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have stories set in Vietnam.

49:11.882 --> 49:13.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have Americans going back.

49:13.317 --> 49:15.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What are you exploring through
these stories?

49:15.752 --> 49:20.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I think that,
when I say
Vietnamese to Americans or to
other people,

49:20.424 --> 49:24.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there might be this idea that
there's only
one Vietnamese kind of culture
or one Vietnamese

49:24.161 --> 49:26.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of people, and I'm going to
speak for
them.

49:26.096 --> 49:28.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Vietnamese are just like
everybody else.

49:28.432 --> 49:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they're diverse.

49:30.267 --> 49:32.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this is a collection where I
wanted to
talk about the young and the
old, the straight

49:32.769 --> 49:36.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the gay, the conservative
and the radicals,
the ones who stayed and ones who
went back,

49:36.873 --> 49:40.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to give people a sense of how
heterogeneous
and contradictory these people
are.

49:40.877 --> 49:46.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Are you aware, as
the readers
are aware, of the newness of
this voice in

49:46.616 --> 49:47.584 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our literature?

49:47.617 --> 49:49.419 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, do you feel that?

49:49.453 --> 49:52.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I think so,
because, in
order to be a writer, you need
to read a lot

49:52.789 --> 49:54.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the traditions in which you
write.

49:54.391 --> 49:56.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

49:56.226 --> 49:57.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: So, I have
read a lot of
Vietnamese writing,
Asian-American writing,

49:57.094 --> 49:58.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and American writing.

49:59.029 --> 50:02.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the novel is explicitly
designed to provoke
all these different categories
and do things

50:02.566 --> 50:06.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that I don't think has been done
before in
those categories, including in
contemporary

50:06.370 --> 50:08.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
American fiction.

50:08.138 --> 50:10.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I want to ask you
about you
and your ghosts, because you
say, I was born

50:10.374 --> 50:12.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in Vietnam, but made in America.

50:13.010 --> 50:16.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To what extent do you feel
yourself of two
worlds?

50:16.079 --> 50:19.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Well, when I
was growing
up, I felt myself to be a spy in
my parents'

50:19.616 --> 50:22.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
household, because they were
Vietnamese, and
I was being Americanized.

50:22.319 --> 50:26.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, when I went outside, I
was a Vietnamese
spying on Americans.

50:26.957 --> 50:31.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that sense of always being
an observer,
always being a spy has continued
to stay with

50:31.728 --> 50:33.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

50:33.663 --> 50:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's been influenced by this
refugee past,
the sense of being haunted by
what has impacted

50:36.433 --> 50:39.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my parents and my Vietnamese
community.

50:39.102 --> 50:42.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's been productive, in the
sense that
it has made me into a writer, to
always be

50:42.572 --> 50:45.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to see things from the
inside and the
outside, to always be observing,
to always

50:45.842 --> 50:47.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be spying on people.

50:47.210 --> 50:49.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's really enormously useful
for a writer.

50:49.246 --> 50:53.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it means I have to allow
myself to not
forget that sense of haunting
and displacement.

50:53.884 --> 50:57.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But that means
you don't want
to leave that behind, in other
words.

50:57.320 --> 51:01.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, you have to live in this
world, but
you also have to hold onto
something.

51:01.625 --> 51:05.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I think I
have to be willing
to be unsettled and to be
uncomfortable.

51:05.996 --> 51:07.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And most people don't want that.

51:07.564 --> 51:08.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most people want to be in one
place.

51:08.698 --> 51:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want to feel settled and
happy.

51:09.866 --> 51:11.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They want to feel comfortable.

51:11.268 --> 51:13.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not a good condition for
a writer,
usually.

51:13.437 --> 51:17.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it means I have to be
willing to tolerate
that, to cultivate that, in
order to get the

51:17.707 --> 51:21.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kinds of insights that I can,
and then make
other people uncomfortable with
those insights

51:21.778 --> 51:23.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as a result.

51:23.780 --> 51:28.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, when you --
if we fast-forward
to today's world, and this
discussion of refugees

51:28.118 --> 51:37.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and immigrants, do you feel a
responsibility
as a writer or as citizen to
address these

51:37.194 --> 51:38.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things even more?

51:38.295 --> 51:40.464 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I do feel
that as an individual.

51:40.497 --> 51:44.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a politically, like, aware
person, but
I also feel that, as a writer,
that I think

51:44.935 --> 51:49.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the writer's most urgent
tasks is to
say something about what is
happening in the

51:49.106 --> 51:50.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
world today.

51:50.941 --> 51:54.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that the sharpening
of the political
division has really made other
writers much

51:55.011 --> 52:00.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more cognizant of that also,
that we need
to address the urgent political
controversies

52:00.817 --> 52:01.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of our time.

52:01.818 --> 52:03.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, how are you
doing that?

52:03.320 --> 52:07.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Well, I think
"The Refugees"
was my way of doing that.

52:07.390 --> 52:11.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it just happened to be that
the refugee
problem, which has always been
with us, has

52:11.728 --> 52:13.563 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come to a head.

52:13.597 --> 52:17.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now, outside of that, I take
the opportunity
outside of this platform as a
writer to write

52:17.634 --> 52:21.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
op-eds, to speak out in public,
to go on the
Seth Meyers show, and not just
to talk about

52:21.872 --> 52:26.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happy things, but also to talk
about our history
and refugees and immigrants to a
late-night

52:26.643 --> 52:27.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
audience.

52:27.644 --> 52:28.712 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

52:28.745 --> 52:30.280 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you get a sense that the
culture is listening?

52:30.313 --> 52:32.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: I think so.

52:32.415 --> 52:35.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Either they're listening because
they hate
refugees and immigrants, or
they're listening

52:35.152 --> 52:38.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because they think we should
embrace and welcome
refugees and immigrants.

52:38.922 --> 52:40.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But people are listening, one
way or the other.

52:40.557 --> 52:44.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
new story collection
is "The Refugees."

52:44.127 --> 52:45.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Viet Thanh Nguyen, thank you
very much.

52:45.929 --> 52:47.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Thanks,
Jeffrey.

52:47.264 --> 52:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we thank him
for talking
with us.

52:49.933 --> 52:55.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tonight on PBS, "Nature"
presents a look
at conservation efforts in
Puerto Rico to

52:55.272 --> 52:59.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protect endangered wildlife from
extinction
on land and at sea.

52:59.910 --> 53:03.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And "American Experience" airs
its final night
of "The Great War."

53:03.413 --> 53:06.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's tonight on most PBS
stations.

53:06.283 --> 53:11.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Why do
so many Americans feel so
financially insecure?

53:11.588 --> 53:17.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two economists followed more
than 200 low-
and moderate-income households
for a full

53:17.928 --> 53:20.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
year to understand why.

53:20.397 --> 53:24.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the results of their study
are part of
a book, "The Financial Diaries."

53:24.267 --> 53:27.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can read an excerpt on our
Web site.

53:27.037 --> 53:29.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:29.306 --> 53:31.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:31.141 --> 53:37.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On Thursday: As Tax Day
approaches, our Making
Sense team zeros in on why,
compared with

53:37.047 --> 53:43.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many other countries, U.S.
taxpayers spend
more time preparing their tax
returns.

53:43.053 --> 53:44.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

NewsHour," thank
you, and we will see you soon.

53:56.700 --> 54:10.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
