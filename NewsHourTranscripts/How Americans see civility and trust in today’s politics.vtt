00:01.966 --> 00:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But first, we
examine the results from our
latest "PBS NewsHour"/NPR/Marist

00:04.933 --> 00:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poll, the president's continued
attacks against the media, and
the battle over health care

00:10.933 --> 00:13.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Capitol Hill.

00:13.033 --> 00:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's time for Politics Monday
with Tamara Keith of NPR and
Stu Rothenberg, senior editor

00:18.400 --> 00:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Inside Elections.

00:20.533 --> 00:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And welcome to you both on this
day before the Fourth of July.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thank you for wearing
red, white and blue.

00:24.966 --> 00:26.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

00:26.933 --> 00:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tam, the
White House is saying they
fully respect that some version

00:30.633 --> 00:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a reform plan that the
Republicans like is going to
pass the Senate, going to pass

00:36.266 --> 00:37.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Congress.

00:37.466 --> 00:39.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What does your
reporting tell you?

00:39.633 --> 00:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It's possible, though,
at the moment, Mitch McConnell

00:41.766 --> 00:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has described the effort to
find a health care bill that
50 Republicans can support

00:48.266 --> 00:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the Senate as like
working with a Rubik's Cube.

00:51.433 --> 00:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, you move one piece,
and then some other piece
moves out of the way.

00:56.266 --> 01:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's a very delicate negotiation
that's happening right now.

01:00.133 --> 01:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not clear that
they will get there.

01:02.266 --> 01:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the Medicaid tests
that were just discussed in
the last segment are a hangup.

01:06.500 --> 01:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are other hangups for
more conservative Republicans.

01:10.533 --> 01:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they are highly motivated
to get to a win, and so you
can't discount the motivation

01:17.366 --> 01:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that exists to find a way.

01:19.400 --> 01:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu, I think I
have you asked this question
before, so what is the calculus?

01:22.533 --> 01:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And if you're a Senate
Republican, what
are you thinking?

01:24.566 --> 01:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Inside
Elections: Yes, I think the
choice is not passing anything,

01:28.266 --> 01:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or passing something
that's going to be broadly
unpopular, but is going
to find a lot of support

01:33.233 --> 01:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from within Republican
and conservative circles.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the choice.

01:37.900 --> 01:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for most Republicans,
I think for most
Republicans strategists,
campaign strategists,

01:41.500 --> 01:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
passing something is
a strong imperative.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's , you have to do
something for the base,
even if you risk alienating
the larger electorate.

01:50.066 --> 01:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For individual members, that
has different equations.

01:52.366 --> 01:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For somebody like Lisa Murkowski
in Alaska, Susan Collins,
Rand Paul, Rob Portman, they

01:58.833 --> 02:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have their own considerations,
ideological or state-based.

02:01.400 --> 02:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it
still looks, Tam, like
it's really hard to square
the circle or circle

02:05.600 --> 02:07.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the square.

02:07.666 --> 02:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, at this
point, it does look that
way, but you know what?

02:10.266 --> 02:13.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It kind of looked that
way in the House, too.

02:13.133 --> 02:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looked like it was
a dead bill, so we were
calling it a zombie bill.

02:17.233 --> 02:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then next thing you
knew, boom, they passed it.

02:20.533 --> 02:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They came up with a compromise
that didn't seem to materially
change anything, and yet

02:27.000 --> 02:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it passed, and they were able
to move it over to the Senate.

02:28.866 --> 02:32.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so, you know, don't
declare this thing dead.

02:32.300 --> 02:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It could be back.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So maybe,
Stu, where there's a
will, there's a way.

02:35.933 --> 02:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And where
there's a Mitch McConnell,
there's always a possibility.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:39.966 --> 02:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, so
let's talk about something
else, and that is, Tam, back to

02:41.566 --> 02:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the president's tweets.

02:43.633 --> 02:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's tweeted I guess a couple
of times about health care,
but he's tweeted a number of

02:47.533 --> 02:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
times about the news media.

02:50.400 --> 02:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week, it was the
cable show hosts Mika
Brzezinski, Joe Scarborough.

02:54.966 --> 02:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But yesterday there was this new
tweet where it was sort of an
edited video of the president

03:01.900 --> 03:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pummeling a man on the
ground, we're showing it
here, with CNN over his face.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do we interpret this?

03:11.200 --> 03:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: There are
many ways to interpret it,
but, you know, President
Trump, as a candidate

03:16.600 --> 03:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and now as a president,
to use the wrestling
analogy, he wanted a heel.

03:22.033 --> 03:23.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He needs a heel.

03:23.033 --> 03:25.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He needs a foe.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, he has
decided that the media is
going to be his foe, his
heel in this wrestling

03:31.766 --> 03:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
match that is his presidency.

03:34.166 --> 03:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, I mean, that image,
that video is a pretty perfect
description of the way he

03:40.400 --> 03:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is approaching this.

03:42.433 --> 03:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Having that fight, having
that feud really excites
some people who support him.

03:49.233 --> 03:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there are others who
are turned off by it and, you
know, we could go down the road

03:52.766 --> 03:57.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the dangers of having
a video that looks
like it is encouraging
violence against members

03:59.766 --> 04:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the media, but it works
for -- this is the same Donald
Trump who ran for president

04:04.866 --> 04:06.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and won.

04:06.366 --> 04:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does
it advance his cause now?

04:08.466 --> 04:10.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes,
first of all, I think Tam
is exactly right on this.

04:10.366 --> 04:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would just add two things.

04:12.100 --> 04:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One is, it advances his
cause by mobilizing and
motivating his base.

04:18.400 --> 04:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They love it when he
attacks the media.

04:20.466 --> 04:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They really think it's exciting
and they agree with him.

04:23.433 --> 04:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure we will talk
about how the media is not
held in the highest regard.

04:27.366 --> 04:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Second of all, he enjoys it.

04:29.833 --> 04:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all -- look, let's
remember, Judy, he did that
in that wrestling show.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He actually did that.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's his ego.

04:37.433 --> 04:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He wants to be the
center of attention.

04:39.000 --> 04:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He wants to be the
focus of everything.

04:42.400 --> 04:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think he just has a
lot of fun when he does that.

04:45.700 --> 04:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for Donald Trump, it's
more fun to do that than to
actually get into the weeds in

04:51.300 --> 04:53.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public policy.

04:53.300 --> 04:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And I was talking
to Republican consultant today
who was like, yes, it's a

04:56.333 --> 05:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
distraction, but maybe it's a
welcome distraction, because if
the people are talking about his

05:00.466 --> 05:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tweets and talking about
WrestleMania, then they aren't
talking about Medicaid cuts.

05:04.600 --> 05:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, of course,
there's been the role of a
free press in a democracy, one

05:08.233 --> 05:11.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the pillars of our form of
government in this country.

05:11.166 --> 05:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we can -- we could talk
about that another time.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do want to raise in our
last few minutes this new CNN
-- I'm sorry -- I had CNN on

05:19.733 --> 05:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the brain from the video -- the
new poll that the "NewsHour"
and NPR did in conjunction

05:25.733 --> 05:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Marist, where, one of
the things we looked at, Stu,
exactly what you mentioned, high

05:29.733 --> 05:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
distrust of the news media.

05:32.233 --> 05:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than two-thirds of
Americans, they were asked,
what do you think about
trust in institutions?

05:35.966 --> 05:37.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And here it is.

05:37.966 --> 05:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thirty-seven percent, a good
deal or a great amount of trust
in the Trump administration,

05:42.033 --> 05:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
30 percent, even less, trust in
the news -- in the media, and
20, about on same par as trust

05:50.133 --> 05:52.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Congress.

05:52.166 --> 05:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you go on to see trust in
the intelligence community,
twice that much, 60 percent, and

05:55.866 --> 05:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the courts, 60 percent.

05:58.033 --> 06:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the bottom line here,
Stu, is that the media may
be a good whipping boy.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes, and I
think the public sees the media
as a political institution,

06:07.066 --> 06:10.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
just as they see
the White House, the
president and Congress.

06:10.433 --> 06:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, right now, nobody
trusts politicians or
people covering politicians.

06:16.166 --> 06:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a horrible trend.

06:18.733 --> 06:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I look back at the Gallup
numbers in the early
1970s, and those of us
in the media are regarded

06:25.466 --> 06:27.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much worse than
we were back then.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's been occurring over
the last couple of decades.

06:30.300 --> 06:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Republican
Senator Ben Sasse over the
weekend said something that goes

06:34.633 --> 06:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in conjunction with the tweets
and fits with these numbers too.

06:37.500 --> 06:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said he was concerned
that the president was
trying to weaponize distrust.

06:41.533 --> 06:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then here's the quote:
"We are at risk of getting to
a place where we don't have

06:46.133 --> 06:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a shared set of public facts.

06:48.200 --> 06:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The republic will not work if
we don't have shared facts."

06:51.800 --> 06:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These numbers are part of a
very long trend of institutions
losing trust from the American

06:58.500 --> 06:59.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that puts America at risk.

07:01.633 --> 07:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
in the last 30 seconds, I want
to show our audience and you

07:04.433 --> 07:06.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this -- the other
question in the poll.

07:06.933 --> 07:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since President Trump
was elected, has the
overall tone and level
of civility in Washington

07:11.466 --> 07:12.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
gotten worse?

07:12.466 --> 07:14.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Seventy percent.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Stayed the same, 20 improved, 6.

07:16.433 --> 07:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Stu, I guess no surprise here.

07:18.566 --> 07:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG: No.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some people actually see
what they want to see.

07:21.233 --> 07:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Strong Republican -- 17
percent said that it improved.

07:24.166 --> 07:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And white evangelicals,
