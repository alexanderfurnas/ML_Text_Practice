00:01.802 --> 00:05.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look at both the symbol
and substance
of what the president announced
today and

00:05.439 --> 00:07.808 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what its impact is likely to be.

00:07.841 --> 00:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Feinblatt is the president
of Everytown
for Gun Safety, which was
created after the

00:12.980 --> 00:18.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newtown shootings and supported
in part by
former New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg.

00:19.019 --> 00:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David Kopel, he is research
director at
The Independence Institute. It's
a libertarian

00:24.625 --> 00:30.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think tank. And he's well --
also an adjunct
professor of constitutional law
at the University

00:30.230 --> 00:31.698 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Denver.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

00:33.934 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Feinblatt, is the president
on the right
track with these moves that he
says are going

00:38.538 --> 00:40.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reduce the number of gun
deaths?

00:40.307 --> 00:42.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT, Everytown for
Gun Safety:
Yes, I think what the president
did today

00:42.175 --> 00:44.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was pretty straightforward.

00:44.311 --> 00:50.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he did was took some
actions to enforce
laws already on the books. One
was, he clarified

00:50.784 --> 00:55.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the law, that, if you're in the
business of
selling guns, you need to get a
license and

00:55.055 --> 00:56.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do a background check.

00:56.823 --> 01:00.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second is, he said that
he was going
to devote the resources to
enforce it. And

01:00.961 --> 01:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, when you combine
clarifying
the law with additional
enforcement resources,

01:06.633 --> 01:12.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what you're going to do is
interrupt some
commercial sellers who are
actually taking

01:12.172 --> 01:17.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advantage of loopholes in the
laws, not getting
a license, and selling without
background

01:17.110 --> 01:18.478 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
checks.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Kopel, do
you -- excuse
me for interrupting.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Kopel, do you agree the
president is
generally on the right track
with this?

01:22.382 --> 01:25.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL, The Independence
Institute: Well,
I agree with most of what Mr.
Feinblatt just

01:25.786 --> 01:29.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, because the president
didn't do anything
at all that changes the law.

01:29.990 --> 01:36.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He just very forcefully and
passionately restated
what has been the law since
1968, which is,

01:36.296 --> 01:40.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you are engaged in the
business, as the
statute says, of selling
firearms, then you

01:40.734 --> 01:46.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to have a federal firearms
license. And
of course he's correct that that
mandate is

01:46.540 --> 01:51.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same whether you sell in
your basement
or at a gun store or on the
Internet or at

01:51.478 --> 01:53.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a gun show.

01:53.313 --> 01:57.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's always been like that.
So, he restated
it. He didn't change anything,
but I think

01:57.884 --> 02:01.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's fine to remind people who
might not know
about that requirement that it
exists.

02:01.722 --> 02:05.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John
Feinblatt, it's really
not that much of a change? It's
just a matter

02:05.192 --> 02:06.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of enforcing what was already
there?

02:06.994 --> 02:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: Look, the law
has been blurry.
It's always -- the law has been,
if you're

02:10.831 --> 02:14.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaged in the business of
selling guns, you
need to get a license and do
background checks.

02:14.801 --> 02:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the problem was that there
was never any
meat on the bone. So, people
didn't know what

02:18.939 --> 02:22.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaged in the business actually
meant. And
so what the president did today,
which was

02:22.976 --> 02:29.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very significant, was, he
actually indicated
what would be the criteria to
know whether

02:29.049 --> 02:30.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
you were engaged in business.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are some of
those criteria?

02:31.818 --> 02:36.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: So, did you buy
a gun and
recently resell it? And, so,
clearly, you're

02:36.223 --> 02:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in it for commerce. It's not
part of your
own collection? It is new in the
box with

02:40.694 --> 02:43.897 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
price tags already on it?

02:43.930 --> 02:48.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are you -- do you have business
cards printed
that actually show that you're
repeatedly

02:48.201 --> 02:54.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
selling guns? Are you showing up
at gun shows
month after month? Things like
that. They're

02:54.374 --> 02:58.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commonsense, but they are very
important,
because what they're offering is
guidance

02:58.612 --> 03:03.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to both law enforcement and to
people who
are selling guns about who needs
to get a

03:03.316 --> 03:05.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
license and who doesn't.

03:05.152 --> 03:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then by saying that he would
put enforcement
might behind it, what I think
will happen

03:11.992 --> 03:17.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that you will see dealers
becoming licensed,
doing background checks, where,
heretofore,

03:17.731 --> 03:19.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they hadn't.

03:19.566 --> 03:23.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, David Kopel,
just spelling
out some of these specifics
could lead to

03:23.203 --> 03:25.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a reduction in gun deaths?

03:25.038 --> 03:28.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL: Well, it will lead
to the public
being better informed.

03:28.341 --> 03:34.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I read the guidance document
that the ATF
published today. And it was
fine. It adhered

03:34.181 --> 03:39.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very closely to the statutory
definition enacted
by Congress and then provided
some examples.

03:39.653 --> 03:44.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And part of what it did was
based on court
cases interpreting the statute.

03:44.191 --> 03:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's good. And I think it
will lead
to more people getting federal
firearms licenses,

03:49.930 --> 03:54.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is necessary to be engaged
in the business
of selling guns, because what
the president

03:54.134 --> 03:59.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is doing is implicitly reversing
a Clinton
era policy, which was to revoke
dealers' licenses

03:59.940 --> 04:04.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because, supposedly, they
weren't selling
enough guns to count as being
engaged in the

04:04.811 --> 04:06.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
business.

04:06.613 --> 04:10.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, 200,000 people lost their
firearms licenses
under the Clinton administration
program,

04:10.784 --> 04:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so, hopefully, this is a step to
restore those
licenses that probably never
should have been

04:15.856 --> 04:17.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taken away.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Kopel, what
about some
of the other things the
president is talking

04:19.693 --> 04:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, spending more money on
mental health,
making mental health treatment
more available,

04:26.366 --> 04:31.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spending money to advance
research to make
guns safer in the hands of
children? What

04:31.671 --> 04:33.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about those things? Will those
make a difference?

04:33.840 --> 04:38.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL: Oh, the mental
health is really
important, and we, as a country,
tend to only

04:38.211 --> 04:43.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
focus on it when there's these
notorious crimes
committed by a severely mentally
ill person.

04:43.583 --> 04:49.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just on a day-to-day basis,
one out of
five prisoners in state prisons
for homicide

04:49.156 --> 04:54.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is seriously mentally ill. And,
of course,
people with mental illness are
victimized

04:54.094 --> 04:58.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by violent crime at a much
higher rate than
the general population.

04:58.632 --> 05:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I applaud the president for
putting resources
towards that, and that's
something we ought

05:03.603 --> 05:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be working on constantly. And
both sides
of the gun debate ought to be
able to come

05:08.175 --> 05:13.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together to support helping
mentally ill people,
not stigmatizing them, not
having punitive

05:13.780 --> 05:17.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
harsh laws against people, but
just giving
people treatment resources.

05:17.551 --> 05:21.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Feinblatt,
given the fact
that, I mean, just at least the
two of you

05:21.421 --> 05:26.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
agree, coming from somewhat
different places
on this, how do you explain the
very vocal

05:26.293 --> 05:27.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
opposition out there?

05:27.427 --> 05:29.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

05:29.196 --> 05:30.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: Well, it's
interesting, because
it's not just me and David. It's
actually

05:30.263 --> 05:32.165 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
90 percent of Americans.

05:32.199 --> 05:36.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, 90 percent of Americans
believe in universal
background checks. Gun owners
believe in it.

05:36.336 --> 05:42.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even NRA members, 74 percent of
NRA members
do. And so this is what the
American public

05:42.709 --> 05:45.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
actually wants. And the
president is taking
steps to do it.

05:45.912 --> 05:50.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, for years, we have
heard these issues
that, if the president acts,
he's going to

05:50.984 --> 05:55.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take people's guns away, he's
confiscating
guns, it's a slippery slope. And
I think David

05:55.222 --> 05:59.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I agree that background
checks can save
lives. Americans believe in it.

05:59.659 --> 06:04.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all the president is really
doing today
is enforcing the laws already on
the books,

06:04.564 --> 06:10.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is what people who oppose
any efforts
at gun safety always say: Why
don't you just

06:10.036 --> 06:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enforce the laws on the books?

06:11.871 --> 06:15.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's surprising to hear that
today, when,
in fact, what the president has
done is exactly

06:15.809 --> 06:17.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what people have called for.

06:17.544 --> 06:20.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David Kopel,
though, is
there more the president -- is
there more

06:20.747 --> 06:26.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- what more could -- let me put
it this way.
What more could Congress do to
make it harder

06:26.987 --> 06:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a gun to be in the hands of
someone who
is going to commit a terrible
crime?

06:30.590 --> 06:37.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL: Well, I think as
Mr. Feinblatt
said, enforcing existing laws.

06:37.297 --> 06:41.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The -- we have cases where
people have been
straw purchasers. That's
somebody where you're

06:41.768 --> 06:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a legal buyer, but you're buying
on behalf
of someone else, so that they
can avoid the

06:46.973 --> 06:52.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
background check and get the
gun. And that's
a very common way that criminals
get guns.

06:52.479 --> 06:55.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the background check system
can't stop
that.

06:55.615 --> 07:01.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Obama administration's
prosecution
of straw purchase cases has been
very lax,

07:01.655 --> 07:03.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
especially compared to the
previous administration.

07:04.024 --> 07:07.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: So, the most
important thing
that you can do is pass
universal background

07:07.794 --> 07:08.995 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
checks.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eighteen states have passed
universal background
checks.

07:10.463 --> 07:11.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which the U.S.
doesn't have.
We don't have that now.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: Which the U.S.
doesn't have.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we're going -- we're moving
state by state.
And in the past year or two, you
have seen

07:17.871 --> 07:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oregon, Colorado, Washington
state, in two
cases by the legislature, in one
case by ballot.

07:23.943 --> 07:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at the states
that have passed
universal background checks, 48
percent fewer

07:29.115 --> 07:34.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
homicides of cops, 48 percent
fewer domestic
homicides with guns, almost half
the amount

07:34.587 --> 07:36.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of trafficking.

07:36.323 --> 07:39.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Background checks work. And it's
important
to know that that's the step
that we have

07:39.826 --> 07:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do. That's the final step
here. It's the
major step.

07:43.263 --> 07:47.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David Kopel,
that's not
what the president has done so
far. It's not

07:47.434 --> 07:54.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what he's doing today. Would
that make a huge
difference in unnecessary gun
deaths, universal

07:54.808 --> 07:56.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
background checks?

07:56.676 --> 07:59.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL: Well, we have one
of these Bloomberg
laws that was passed in
Colorado. And I'm

07:59.612 --> 08:04.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
currently representing most of
the state sheriffs
in federal court in a lawsuit
against it because

08:04.651 --> 08:06.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's so badly structured.

08:06.519 --> 08:11.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It makes it very difficult for
people to teach
gun safety classes. For example,
the Washington

08:11.624 --> 08:18.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
analogue, it's illegal if you're
a gun safety
instructor to hand a gun to a
student empty,

08:18.264 --> 08:22.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unloaded, and show the student
how to handle
it. Those are -- these are
ridiculous laws.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're not universal background
checks.

08:24.437 --> 08:29.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Colorado law was so badly
structured that
it actually reduced the number
of people getting

08:29.442 --> 08:33.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
background checks because it
made them so
difficult to obtain. So,
whatever polls say

08:33.680 --> 08:39.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the theory of background
checks, the
practice and the laws pushed by
Everytown

08:39.419 --> 08:45.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been terrible and highly
destructive to
the shooting sports and
responsible gun use.

08:45.125 --> 08:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly, so
it sounds
like, once one gets beyond what
the president

08:48.828 --> 08:50.897 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suggested today, you do see
opposition?

08:50.930 --> 08:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: You see it, but
you see it
-- certainly, David objects it
to, but every

08:54.934 --> 08:58.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
poll would show that 90 percent
of Americans
believe in universal background
checks, whether

08:58.705 --> 09:02.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're a gun owner, whether
you're not a gun
owner, whether you live in a
rural community

09:02.542 --> 09:04.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or an urban community.

09:04.344 --> 09:08.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's what the American public
wants. It's
what the people of Washington
state voted

09:08.148 --> 09:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for on their own at the ballot,
and it's what
state legislatures are passing.

09:12.085 --> 09:16.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and, today,
we're looking
at what the president did
through his executive

09:16.623 --> 09:17.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
actions.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: That's correct.

09:18.725 --> 09:19.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Feinblatt,
David Kopel,
we thank you both.

09:19.759 --> 09:20.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID KOPEL: Thank you.

09:20.693 --> 09:21.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: Thank you.
