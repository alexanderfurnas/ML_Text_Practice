Also ahead, I sit down with the
former senior American diplomat
in China in his first interview

00:22.333 --> 00:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since resigning in protest after
President Trump's withdrawal
from the Paris climate

00:27.533 --> 00:29.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
accord.

00:29.600 --> 00:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And inside the Islamist militant
group Hezbollah - - a look at
its growing power and roots in

00:35.400 --> 00:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lebanon and its future in a
shifting political landscape.

00:39.233 --> 00:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The Trump
administration has talked tough
about containing Iran, but given

00:46.300 --> 00:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little explanation of how it
would play a role in curbing
Iran and its ally here in

00:49.666 --> 00:54.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lebanon Hezbollah, while
continuing to fight the
common enemy of ISIS.

00:54.366 --> 00:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then,
it's Politics Monday.

Rothenberg look ahead to

testimony from Attorney
General Jeff Sessions.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on

01:12.933 --> 01:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
isn't saying tonight whether

President Trump's
conversations with former
FBI Director James Comey.

01:30.133 --> 01:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the weekend, several
Republican senators
urged the president to
answer that question,

01:35.733 --> 01:37.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yes or no.

01:37.733 --> 01:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the White House
today, reporters pressed
Press Secretary Sean
Spicer on the subject.

01:41.433 --> 01:43.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House
Press Secretary: I think the
president made it very clear on

01:43.766 --> 01:48.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Friday that he would get back as
soon as possible on this and his
position on that conversation.

01:49.933 --> 01:51.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Right, but
what is he waiting for?

01:51.600 --> 01:53.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the delay?

01:53.133 --> 01:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: He's waiting --
he's not waiting for anything.

01:54.600 --> 01:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When he's ready to further
discuss it, he will.

01:56.566 --> 01:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Spicer also
wouldn't say if Attorney General
Jeff Sessions will invoke

01:59.300 --> 02:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
executive privilege when
he goes before a Senate
committee tomorrow.

Russia's ambassador
during the presidential

race.

02:11.166 --> 02:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A second U.S. appeals court

In Seattle today, three judges
of the Ninth Circuit Court
agreed with a ruling by a lower

02:22.266 --> 02:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court in Hawaii that the ban
discriminates against Muslims.

02:25.100 --> 02:30.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A federal appeals court
in Virginia already
issued a similar ruling
in a separate case.

02:31.966 --> 02:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attorneys general of
Maryland and the District of
Columbia charged today that the

02:35.133 --> 02:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president's ongoing business
ties violate the Constitution.

02:39.566 --> 02:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They sued in federal court,
citing the Emoluments
Clause, designed to
head off conflicts of

02:45.533 --> 02:48.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interest.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, the two
officials, both Democrats,
said it's a matter
of saving democracy.

02:50.933 --> 02:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARL A. RACINE, D.C. Attorney
General: We're concerned that
foreign governments are coming

02:57.933 --> 03:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Trump businesses for
the single purpose of currying
special favor from the president

03:03.466 --> 03:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States, so that
their interests can get a higher
priority than the interests

03:09.266 --> 03:11.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the American people.

03:11.233 --> 03:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A White House
spokesman said the suit is
motivated by partisan politics.

03:15.333 --> 03:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A similar lawsuit is
pending in New York state.

03:18.933 --> 03:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House also condemned
Russia's crackdown today on

03:25.333 --> 03:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than a thousand people were

03:28.233 --> 03:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Alex Thomson of
Independent Television
News filed this report.

03:32.266 --> 03:37.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Hundreds arrested
in Moscow alone on a day of
protests nationwide against

03:39.800 --> 03:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
corruption generally and
Vladimir Putin particularly.

03:44.633 --> 03:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Putin is a thief," the chant,
and "Russia without Putin"
-- all of this organized by

03:55.133 --> 04:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kremlin's most
prominent critic by
far, the anti-corruption
campaigner and presidential

04:00.900 --> 04:02.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hopeful Alexei Navalny.

04:02.933 --> 04:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Navalny's plan was to rain
on President Putin's parade,
it's certainly succeeding

04:08.600 --> 04:10.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in this part of
the demonstration.

04:10.733 --> 04:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of people gathered
here, plainly the vast majority
of them here pro-Navalny.

04:14.900 --> 04:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Putin is killing our people.

04:18.866 --> 04:20.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's killing you and me.

04:20.566 --> 04:23.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's sending people to
Ukraine and Syria to
die for his interests.

04:23.966 --> 04:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's tell him
we're not having it.

04:25.766 --> 04:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
I came here for the truth.

04:29.333 --> 04:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our government is not
conducting itself properly.

04:32.033 --> 04:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Navalny was
allowed to demo in Moscow,
just not here, on the main road

04:38.200 --> 04:39.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leading straight
up to Red Square.

04:39.866 --> 04:43.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But late last night, he
ordered his people to
this illegal location.

04:43.333 --> 04:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That made confrontation
inevitable.

04:47.133 --> 04:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Muscovites," he told people
in a late-night appeal,
"come to Tverskaya Street.

04:53.533 --> 04:55.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't go anywhere else."

04:55.533 --> 05:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alexei Navalny himself never
made it to his own protest,
arrested at his home in Moscow.

05:02.433 --> 05:07.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He could now be detained
for up to 30 days.

05:09.333 --> 05:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Across Moscow, as across
Russia, these were the official
independence day celebrations,

05:15.133 --> 05:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the kind the Kremlin wanted
people to see and, let's
face it, most Russians.

05:18.533 --> 05:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Putin remains hugely popular.

05:20.933 --> 05:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Navalny's support runs
at just 2 percent.

05:23.300 --> 05:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
I don't think protesting
today makes any sense.

05:27.633 --> 05:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People are celebrating.

05:28.633 --> 05:29.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're happy.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why spoil the mood?

05:32.133 --> 05:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: This was
Vladivostok demonstrations
and arrests well before
most of Moscow had

05:37.866 --> 05:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even got up this morning,
north to Siberia, Novosibirsk,
and another of more than 200

05:43.566 --> 05:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities where anti-corruption
protesters gathered, and
west to St. Petersburg,
the same pattern,

05:49.800 --> 05:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gathering chanting
and arresting.

05:52.500 --> 05:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And back in this
country, newly elected Montana
Congressman Greg Gianforte

05:58.900 --> 06:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will not go to jail after all
for assaulting a reporter.

06:02.700 --> 06:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican pleaded
guilty today to a misdemeanor
charge, and was sentenced
to 40 hours of community

06:08.333 --> 06:10.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
service.

06:10.333 --> 06:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will also attend 20 hours
of anger management counseling
and pay a fine of $385.

06:16.233 --> 06:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Pennsylvania jury has
begun deliberating in Bill
Cosby's sexual assault trial.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The defense rested
abruptly today.

06:23.933 --> 06:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cosby himself, accompanied
by his wife for the first
time, declined to testify.

06:30.133 --> 06:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His defense team argued the
comedian and his accuser had
a consensual relationship.

06:34.833 --> 06:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Prosecutors argued that
Cosby drugged the woman.

06:37.700 --> 06:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Orlando, Florida, today,
they remembered the deadliest
mass shooting in modern U.S.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

49 people at a gay nightclub
last June 12, before police

06:50.366 --> 06:51.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
killed him.

06:51.866 --> 06:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He'd pledged allegiance to
the Islamic State group.

06:54.500 --> 06:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This morning, a vigil
began at 2:00 a.m., the
same hour as the rampage.

06:59.400 --> 07:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Names of the victims were read
aloud, and hundreds carried
candles and laid flowers.

07:03.566 --> 07:07.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BUDDY DYER, Mayor of Orlando,
Florida: We are not here to
relive the horror of that

07:07.766 --> 07:08.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

07:08.766 --> 07:10.833 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We're here for a
greater purpose.

07:10.833 --> 07:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're here to remember the
innocent lives that were lost.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're here to honor them.

07:16.366 --> 07:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Orlando has been anointed to
show the world how to combat
hatred and evil and promote

07:21.733 --> 07:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
quality and embrace diversity.

07:23.733 --> 07:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we don't just have the
opportunity to do this.

07:26.400 --> 07:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We now have the
responsibility to do this.

a memorial.

is recommending the Bears Ears
National Monument in Utah be

07:41.066 --> 07:42.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
downsized.

07:42.300 --> 07:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It now covers 1.3 million acres.

07:45.433 --> 07:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has said
the protective designations
amount to -- quote --
"a massive federal land

07:49.933 --> 07:51.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grab."

07:51.366 --> 07:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's ordered reviews of Bears
Ears and 27 other sites.

08:09.033 --> 08:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the first family is
finally under one roof
again at the White House.

08:13.633 --> 08:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First lady Melania Trump and

Barron, arrived Sunday night

08:19.366 --> 08:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take up residence.

08:20.866 --> 08:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They'd stayed in New York
until the school year ended.

08:22.900 --> 08:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the former top U.S. diplomat
in China explains why he

08:29.833 --> 08:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
broke ranks with the Trump
administration; Democrats speak
out about the way Republicans

08:35.833 --> 08:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are making decisions on health
care; a Lebanese militant group
gaining power as it fights

08:40.100 --> 08:45.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Syria; and much more.

08:47.400 --> 08:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, former President
Obama and China's President Xi
Jinping announced on the same

08:57.933 --> 09:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day that the U.S. and
China would join the
Paris climate agreement,
in an effort to forestall

09:04.300 --> 09:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
climate change through capping
and reducing emissions.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
China's participation
was seen as key.

09:10.133 --> 09:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the world's
largest emitter of carbon
dioxide, with the United
States running second.

09:16.766 --> 09:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But on June 1, this month,
President Trump announced his
intention to withdraw from the

09:22.733 --> 09:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement, citing possible
economic harm to the U.S. Four
days later, the top American

09:28.600 --> 09:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
official in China, the charge
d'affaires in Beijing, tendered
his resignation, citing

09:33.066 --> 09:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president's withdrawal.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His name is David Rank.

09:36.366 --> 09:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He served 27 years in
the Foreign Service.

09:38.833 --> 09:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he joins me now
for his first interview
since leaving government.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David Rank, welcome.

09:45.033 --> 09:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You knew, when Donald Trump
was running for president,
that he had said that the U.S.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
shouldn't be in
this climate accord.

09:52.366 --> 09:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What was your thinking then?

09:54.366 --> 09:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID RANK, Former U.S.
Diplomat: Boy, I have served
five presidents over 27 years.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been through a lot
of presidential campaigns.

10:00.166 --> 10:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have heard a lot of
things both about the
U.S.-China relationship
and about other issues.

10:05.066 --> 10:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I suppose I thought, boy,
that's bad idea but there are
a lot of bad ideas talked about

10:09.533 --> 10:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in presidential campaigns,
and we will see what happens
when he becomes president.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, when
he made that announcement,
what was your reaction?

10:21.933 --> 10:25.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID RANK: You know, Judy, up
until the day he -- in fact,
I would say the day before,

10:26.500 --> 10:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I -- it kind of
caught me off-guard.

10:28.466 --> 10:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed so improbable that
the U.S. would pull out, because
Paris is a symbol of U.S.

10:38.033 --> 10:40.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leadership in the
region, in the world.

10:40.900 --> 10:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the benefits that
accrue from being a leader and
being in Paris just seemed to

10:47.366 --> 10:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be so obvious that it sort
of caught me off-guard.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What were
the benefits, in your mind?

10:53.700 --> 10:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID RANK: Look, the -- how
many agreements are there in
the world where two countries,

11:00.733 --> 11:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now all but three countries
in the world, are members,
countries that are sort of the

11:02.433 --> 11:05.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
closest partners we
have had for 70 years?

11:05.633 --> 11:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's one of the most important
issues to those countries.

11:09.466 --> 11:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so the benefits of being
the leader in that, of, as you
said, working together with

11:16.566 --> 11:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
China to bring about, to
make the Paris agreement
possible, and being the
true leader on climate

11:23.700 --> 11:28.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issues, really is a
remarkable benefit.

11:28.133 --> 11:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why does
climate matter to you?

11:32.466 --> 11:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID RANK: Well, as I explained
to my staff when I went, not
only did it bother me from

11:40.100 --> 11:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the perspective of bad policy,
but also the obligation we
have to our kids and, frankly,

11:47.166 --> 11:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the moral obligation I feel
to take care of the planet we
have been given and the planet

11:53.000 --> 11:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we leave our children and
their children, and, you know,
realizing that if we -- from

11:59.500 --> 12:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of those perspectives, ask
even to take very small steps,
I realized that I couldn't

12:04.233 --> 12:05.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

12:05.733 --> 12:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I couldn't in good conscience
be party to the U.S. withdrawal.

12:08.866 --> 12:12.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so we have a
disciplined service.

12:12.166 --> 12:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You either agree to
implement the president's
policy or you step aside.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so that was the
solution I put forward.

12:20.700 --> 12:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, his argument
that this was doing economic
harm to the U.S., he talked

12:25.033 --> 12:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about draconian repercussions
for the U.S. thanks to the
accord, and he said he wanted

12:31.400 --> 12:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to negotiate a new
deal on climate?

12:33.666 --> 12:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID RANK: I'm quick to admit
I'm not an expert on climate.

12:40.666 --> 12:44.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And had there been a serious
proposal, had we said, look,
Paris is -- instead of Paris,

12:46.466 --> 12:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we want to do X, Y or Z, you
probably would have changed
the way I looked at it.

12:50.766 --> 12:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There hasn't been any
real indication of that.

12:53.933 --> 12:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I suspect -- well, I will
wait and see from the outside.

12:57.266 --> 13:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How difficult
a decision is this for you?

13:00.233 --> 13:02.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been in the Foreign
Service for 27 years.

13:02.566 --> 13:05.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID RANK: Yes, I love my job.

13:05.900 --> 13:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I love the people I work with.

13:09.900 --> 13:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think -- I would like to
think I got up every morning,
and with a feeling of gratitude

13:16.766 --> 13:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the ability to do what
I was doing, to serve the
American people, to work with a

13:22.100 --> 13:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group of colleagues who
were committed to the
same sorts of goals I am.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it was tough.

13:31.233 --> 13:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was very difficult.

13:32.433 --> 13:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
you could have stayed.

13:34.533 --> 13:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I guess did anybody make
the argument you could stay
and fight and stand up for

13:38.100 --> 13:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what you believe in?

13:39.166 --> 13:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID RANK: Absolutely.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think there's
honor in that.

13:42.333 --> 13:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I made the case to the
folks, because there are a
lot of people who I think, not

13:45.766 --> 13:50.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just in the embassy in Beijing,
but across the State Department
and across the government,

13:52.666 --> 13:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are asking themselves,
if I fundamentally
disagree, what do I do?

13:56.000 --> 14:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my answer to that
is, look, I have my own
particular personal situation.

14:02.466 --> 14:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm relatively close to the
end of my career, or I was.

14:04.233 --> 14:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I had been in for
almost 30 years.

14:06.266 --> 14:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you have got 20 years
ahead of you, then there's
real honor, honor to doing the

14:13.100 --> 14:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of tough work, the slow and
steady work that we as diplomats
and really people throughout

14:19.333 --> 14:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. government -- I
mean, that's the role of the
civil servant, the role of the

14:22.933 --> 14:24.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
public servant.

14:24.566 --> 14:27.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I think it is and
will continue to be
an honorable role.

14:27.866 --> 14:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last thing, and
separate from this decision,
how do you see the state of

14:34.833 --> 14:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
relations right now between the
United States and China, with
President Trump pressing the

14:38.133 --> 14:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chinese in particular to lean
on the North Koreans to pull
back their nuclear program?

14:44.533 --> 14:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID RANK: I think we're early
in the Trump administration.

14:46.633 --> 14:51.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think it's a positive
thing that the president
and his senior advisers
have made it clear

14:53.533 --> 14:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that it's an important
issue, that we have to
grapple with North Korea.

14:56.466 --> 14:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it's not the only
issue between the United
States and China, but certainly

14:59.933 --> 15:03.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it is the one that is
on the front burner.

15:03.466 --> 15:05.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think it will
be a challenge.

15:05.733 --> 15:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will take hard work every
day, not just by the president,
not just by the secretary

15:10.233 --> 15:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of state, but by the colleagues
of mine who are still in
Beijing and colleagues in the

15:17.166 --> 15:18.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
State Department and
the Department of
Defense and elsewhere
in the U.S. government.

15:18.766 --> 15:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a real challenge
to the United States.

15:20.833 --> 15:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Rank, the
former charge d'affaires at
the U.S. Embassy in Beijing,

15:27.200 --> 15:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
China, up until, what,
about eight or 10 days ago.

15:29.166 --> 15:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID RANK: That's right.

15:30.633 --> 15:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you very
much for talking with us.

15:31.866 --> 15:36.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DAVID RANK: Judy,
thank you very much.

15:36.200 --> 15:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is an
important week for the fate of
a bill designed to replace and

15:48.233 --> 15:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potentially overhaul the
health care law often
referred to as Obamacare.

15:55.833 --> 15:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican senators are
trying to finish drafting
key portions of their own
bill affecting coverage

15:58.700 --> 16:01.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and costs.

16:01.300 --> 16:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Democrats say the entire
battle over repealing the
law is quite different
from standard operating

16:06.366 --> 16:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
procedure, and not nearly
transparent enough.

16:09.266 --> 16:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins looks at how
it's playing out in the Senate.

16:12.900 --> 16:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right now
the debate over health care is
red hot in Congress, but only

16:17.433 --> 16:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind closed doors, as
Republicans privately try
to craft a Senate bill.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is something Democrats,
like Senator Claire McCaskill
last week, have been raising

16:27.033 --> 16:28.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
publicly.

16:28.033 --> 16:30.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:30.033 --> 16:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D),
Missouri: We have no idea
what's being proposed.

16:32.700 --> 16:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a group of guys in
a backroom somewhere that
are making these decisions.

16:37.633 --> 16:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There were no
hearings in the House.

16:39.600 --> 16:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, listen, this is hard
to take, because I know we
made mistakes on the Affordable

16:45.100 --> 16:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Health Care Act, Mr. Secretary.

16:47.633 --> 16:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the criticisms
we got over and over again,
that the vote was partisan.

16:51.233 --> 16:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, you couldn't have a more
partisan exercise than what
you're engaged in right now.

16:58.233 --> 17:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're not even going to have a
hearing on a bill that impacts
one-sixth of our economy.

17:04.533 --> 17:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: McCaskill wants
something called regular order.

17:06.633 --> 17:07.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is that?

17:07.900 --> 17:09.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, it used to be
the normal process.

17:09.933 --> 17:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A bill goes through committee
hearings, where experts and
those affected by an issue ring

17:13.666 --> 17:15.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

17:15.633 --> 17:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then senators on the
committee can vote to change
the bill with amendments.

17:18.466 --> 17:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, when a bill gets to
the Senate floor, regular order
means another chance to change

17:22.900 --> 17:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it with amendment
votes there too.

17:25.766 --> 17:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2009, with the Affordable
Care Act, two Senate committees
held three months of hearings

17:30.666 --> 17:33.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and went through weeks
of voting on amendments.

17:33.300 --> 17:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More recently, Senate Leader
Mitch McConnell said he wanted
regular order when Republicans

17:37.800 --> 17:38.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
took over in 2015.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:40.866 --> 17:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: We need to open up,
open up the legislative process

17:43.300 --> 17:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a way that allows more
amendments from both sides.

17:46.066 --> 17:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But that's
not how Republicans so far have
planned this health care debate.

17:50.800 --> 17:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, in regular order,
bills go through committees
and amendment votes.

17:55.000 --> 17:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, this time
around, Senate Republicans
have indicated they
may send their health

17:59.333 --> 18:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care bill straight to the
Senate floor with little,
maybe no chance to amend it.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they have held no
hearings on the bill so far.

18:07.733 --> 18:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Leading this process is
Republican Senate Finance
Chairman Orrin Hatch.

18:10.533 --> 18:12.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:12.633 --> 18:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah: Well,
I don't know that there's
going to be another hearing,

18:13.900 --> 18:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but we have invited
you to participate.

18:15.966 --> 18:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Who stressed
to McCaskill that he wants
Democratic ideas, if not more

18:19.833 --> 18:21.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hearings and votes.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that differs from Hatch
in 2009, when Republicans were
the minority, and he thought

18:27.300 --> 18:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Democrats were moving
too fast on health care.

18:28.866 --> 18:30.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

18:30.466 --> 18:32.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ORRIN HATCH: We at
least ought to take the
time to do this right.

18:32.566 --> 18:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the end,
it took Democrats 14 months to
pass their health care bill in

18:36.133 --> 18:38.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
2009 and 2010.

18:38.133 --> 18:40.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's why this
moment is critical.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Senate will make or
break health care reform.

18:42.733 --> 18:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Senate leaders, including
Hatch, have said they want
to pass a full health care

18:46.166 --> 18:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bill by the end of this month.

18:48.633 --> 18:51.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's just nine or 10
legislative days away.

18:51.833 --> 18:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Lisa Desjardins.

18:57.900 --> 19:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

19:07.000 --> 19:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
it's Politics Monday, a look
at the week ahead for the White

19:11.433 --> 19:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House -- cancer screening tests
traditions in India; and why
professional baseball teams

19:18.866 --> 19:23.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are trying to win
over this baby.

19:23.566 --> 19:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: There is a new
and potentially-explosive
battleground shaping up
in Syria's civil war,

19:30.533 --> 19:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the country's southeast, as
is retreats from its makeshift
capital, Raqqa, and the

19:35.833 --> 19:37.933 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
larger fight for
Syria grinds on.

19:37.933 --> 19:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Along the border shared by
Syria, Iraq and Jordan, American
and British special operations

19:45.366 --> 19:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
troops are training rebel
fighters -- operating
in close proximity,
forces from the Syrian

19:49.900 --> 19:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
army, Russia, Iran,
and Hezbollah.

19:53.733 --> 19:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As special correspondent Jane
Ferguson reports, the Lebanese
militant group is a unique force

20:00.133 --> 20:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the shifting political
landscape in the Middle East.

20:02.500 --> 20:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
While it has been integral to
the Syrian regime's survival,
it also remains committed to its

20:08.633 --> 20:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
original goal, the
destruction of Israel.

20:11.000 --> 20:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Forged amid
the bloodletting of Lebanon's
civil war from 1975 to 1990,

20:19.733 --> 20:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hezbollah was created to fight
Israel, whose army invaded and
occupied the country halfway

20:27.033 --> 20:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through the conflict after
attacks by Palestinian groups.

20:31.866 --> 20:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hezbollah means Party of
God in Arabic, but members
often call themselves
simply the resistance.

20:38.800 --> 20:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is a secretive militant
movement of the Shia sect of
Islam, largely funded and armed

20:44.066 --> 20:46.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by Iran.

20:46.166 --> 20:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To the U.S. and many of
its allies, Hezbollah is
a terrorist organization.

20:52.966 --> 20:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Inside Lebanon, it is regarded
as much a political and social
movement as an armed one.

20:58.400 --> 21:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2006, it fought Israel to a
bloody draw during a 33-day war,
which the militants declared

21:04.133 --> 21:06.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a victory.

21:06.200 --> 21:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was celebrated around
the Arab world, where the
group's popularity rose.

21:10.866 --> 21:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the war, with Iran's
help, Hezbollah reorganized to
become one of the most powerful

21:17.033 --> 21:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
militant groups in
the Middle East.

21:19.466 --> 21:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2013, however, it entered
a much more controversial
war, stepping into
Syria's chaos to shore

21:26.700 --> 21:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up the regime of
President Bashar al-Assad.

21:29.533 --> 21:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Timur Goksel was the
spokesperson for the
U.N. peacekeeping mission
in Lebanon throughout

21:35.133 --> 21:37.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the civil war.

21:37.666 --> 21:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has seen firsthand the
emergence of Hezbollah
and its evolution over
the years from a small

21:42.333 --> 21:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
group of fighters to
a massive movement.

21:45.300 --> 21:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's asking the same
question many others are.

21:48.333 --> 21:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIMUR GOKSEL, Former U.N.
Spokesman: Why did Hezbollah
get so much involved in Syria?

21:52.600 --> 21:54.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because of their love
for Bashar al-Assad?

21:54.266 --> 21:56.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't think so.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to think of what
is happening in Lebanon and
what are Hezbollah's concerns

21:59.300 --> 22:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for their own survival.

22:00.833 --> 22:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The answer to
that question lies in geography.

22:05.400 --> 22:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Designated by foreign
governments as a terrorist
organization, Hezbollah
is blocked from using

22:10.333 --> 22:12.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the sea and air.

22:12.333 --> 22:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To the south sits Israel,
with whom Lebanon is
still officially at war.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hezbollah's weaponry
and financing comes
from Iran, across
Shia-dominated Iraq, through

22:22.600 --> 22:24.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syria and into Lebanon.

22:24.666 --> 22:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Shia axis, as it is often
called, would be broken if
the Sunni-dominated opposition

22:30.066 --> 22:32.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
took over Syria.

22:32.200 --> 22:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIMUR GOKSEL: For them, survival
of the Syrian regime, a friendly
regime in Syria, is Hezbollah's

22:40.300 --> 22:41.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
existence.

22:41.300 --> 22:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's their survival.

22:43.233 --> 22:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: On the
battlefield in Syria, Hezbollah
has proved its effectiveness.

22:47.166 --> 22:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those injured during battles in
Syria rely on the organization's
extensive network and

22:52.800 --> 22:54.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
assistance.

22:54.866 --> 22:58.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour" was given
exclusive access to
this Hezbollah treatment
center in Beirut,

23:00.933 --> 23:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where the group's war wounded
from Syria received treatment
and physical therapy.

23:06.833 --> 23:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were not allowed to
speak with these fighters,
but Imad Khoshman, who
lost a leg fighting

23:09.266 --> 23:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Israeli army in the past
and now runs the center, told
us about the kind of injuries

23:14.866 --> 23:16.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he sees here.

23:16.900 --> 23:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IMAD KHOSHMAN, Runs Treatment
Center (through translator):
They are normally very painful,

23:19.300 --> 23:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
such as spinal cord
injuries or in the brain.

23:22.100 --> 23:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They lead to a person being
paralyzed, not being able to
speak, not being able to move,

23:27.700 --> 23:30.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or losing limbs.

23:30.200 --> 23:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: This young
fighter is recovering
from a devastating
head injury, struggling

23:36.866 --> 23:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to relearn names for
everyday objects.

23:39.733 --> 23:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, the war wounded are
just one type of patient here.

23:46.766 --> 23:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The center mostly offers
medical care to civilians
from the local community.

23:52.266 --> 23:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all part of a policy
cultivated by Hezbollah's
leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

23:59.266 --> 24:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Since becoming the
group's leader in 1992
after Israel killed his
predecessor, Nasrallah

24:04.666 --> 24:07.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has expanded Hezbollah as a
militant group, and supervised
the creation of extensive social

24:09.966 --> 24:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
programs for its community,
effectively creating a state
within a state inside Lebanon.

24:16.833 --> 24:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hezbollah runs its own schools,
medical facilities and even
sports clubs across Lebanon.

24:23.266 --> 24:27.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They may also be used to
control that society, too.

24:27.300 --> 24:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrew Exum was the top Middle
East policy official at the
Pentagon at the end of the

24:31.466 --> 24:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Obama administration
and he lived in Lebanon
for several years.

24:34.933 --> 24:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM, Former U.S. Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense:
The services that Hezbollah

24:36.866 --> 24:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
provides to its constituency
are services that, quite
frankly, the Lebanese government

24:42.566 --> 24:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
has failed to
provide historically.

24:45.100 --> 24:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, so, you can't blame
Lebanon's Shia constituency
for accepting the services
provided by Hezbollah.

24:52.300 --> 24:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, it creates
a real dilemma for them when
they -- if they were to think

24:57.200 --> 24:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about ever moving
away from Hezbollah.

24:59.866 --> 25:04.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Hezbollah is
estimated to have lost over
1,300 fighters in the war, more

25:06.000 --> 25:08.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than they ever lost
fighting Israel.

25:08.100 --> 25:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most of these women have male
loved ones fighting in Syria.

25:12.133 --> 25:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This woman lost a son.

25:14.133 --> 25:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the mother of a man
seen as a martyr, her
emotions are complicated.

25:18.533 --> 25:23.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
The feeling of my son
being martyred is powerful.

25:23.433 --> 25:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will attain a high position
in heaven for what he did for
us and for our dignity, even

25:28.100 --> 25:30.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
though it is difficult.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Because he is my
child, it is difficult.

25:32.100 --> 25:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: To followers
of Hezbollah, this sacrifice
is not made for politics.

25:37.300 --> 25:39.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a religious duty.

25:39.800 --> 25:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that duty is absolute
devotion and loyalty to
the global Shia community's
guardian, regardless

25:45.366 --> 25:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of national boundaries.

25:47.433 --> 25:51.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Currently, that guardian is
Iranian cleric and supreme
Leader Ayatollah Khomeini.

25:54.500 --> 25:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hezbollah has taken Iran's
side in the region-wide
rift between Shia Iran
and Sunni Saudi Arabia.

26:00.700 --> 26:03.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Syria's war is
part of that rift.

26:03.566 --> 26:08.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Saudi Arabia and Iran
back opposing sides in
the sectarian conflict.

26:10.900 --> 26:15.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While Hezbollah's
supporters in Lebanon remain
loyal, its popularity in
Sunni countries across

26:17.133 --> 26:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Middle East, which had
risen after the 2006 war with
Israel, has now plummeted.

26:22.300 --> 26:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The group is now perceived
as killing Sunni civilians
inside Syria on Iran's request.

26:28.500 --> 26:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW EXUM: They very much
played a role in the regime
tactics to isolate, surround

26:35.366 --> 26:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and starve out communities, and
the siege and ultimate fall of
Eastern Aleppo had Hezbollah's

26:43.666 --> 26:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fingerprints all over it.

26:45.600 --> 26:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: But Hezbollah
claims it is fighting terrorists
in Syria and making sure

26:51.266 --> 26:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they don't cross
over into Lebanon.

26:53.833 --> 26:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IMAD KHOSHMAN (through
translator): Our fighters
are injured fighting
terrorists and protecting

26:57.666 --> 26:59.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our borders.

26:59.133 --> 27:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are protecting our people,
our villages and our towns.

27:02.933 --> 27:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: However, for
all it has lost in regional
popularity, the group has become

27:08.966 --> 27:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hugely strengthened militarily.

27:11.400 --> 27:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it is capitalizing on
that by pursuing further
involvement in the region.

27:16.366 --> 27:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The group is also fighting
in Iraq, taking on the
Sunni extremists ISIS.

27:23.366 --> 27:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, the U.S.-led
coalition is also fighting
the Islamic State in Iraq, and

27:28.166 --> 27:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
operating on the same
side as Shia militias,
including Hezbollah.

27:31.666 --> 27:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This indirect relationship
of convenience is an irony of
the war against the Islamic

27:36.433 --> 27:38.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
State.

27:38.533 --> 27:42.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Trump administration
has talked tough about
containing Iran, but
given little explanation

27:44.466 --> 27:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of how it would play a role in
curbing Iran and its ally here
in Lebanon Hezbollah, while

27:49.100 --> 27:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
continuing to fight the
common enemy of ISIS.

27:52.866 --> 27:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America has long viewed
Hezbollah as a terrorist
organization and a deadly enemy.

28:00.466 --> 28:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 1983, the group killed
241 U.S. servicemen in
Lebanon when it blew up
a U.S. Marine barracks.

28:07.066 --> 28:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israel is anxiously watching
Hezbollah's evolution.

28:10.033 --> 28:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Israeli military
has conducted airstrikes
against Hezbollah targets
inside Syria throughout

28:16.933 --> 28:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the war, although that hasn't
stopped the group from expanding
its arms supplies, which

28:22.100 --> 28:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
could threaten Israel.

28:24.200 --> 28:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In February, Hezbollah leader
Nasrallah leader threatened to
strike a nuclear facility in

28:29.066 --> 28:31.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Israel.

28:31.133 --> 28:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HASSAN NASRALLAH, Hezbollah
Leader (through translator):
They know that, if rockets hit

28:33.400 --> 28:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this reactor, what would
befall them and their entity.

28:36.066 --> 28:39.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They are aware of the
risks which would be
inflicted on them.

28:39.000 --> 28:44.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Both Israel and
Hezbollah know a war between
them will bring more devastation

28:45.366 --> 28:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than ever before for
communities on each side.

28:49.066 --> 28:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This, for now, seems to
be the most effective
conflict prevention.

28:53.933 --> 28:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It is not one, however,
guaranteed to keep
this fragile truce.

28:58.633 --> 29:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Jane
Ferguson in Beirut, Lebanon.

29:11.733 --> 29:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we mentioned
at the top of the program,
President Trump's agenda hit

29:21.033 --> 29:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another roadblock today when a
federal appeals court refused
to reinstate his travel ban.

29:27.966 --> 29:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow, Attorney General Jeff
Sessions will testify in front
of the Senate Intelligence

29:34.166 --> 29:37.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Committee's open hearing
on Russia, all this
amid growing criticism
some fellow Republicans

29:38.833 --> 29:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the weekend.

29:40.933 --> 29:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on how all of this
is affecting the White House,
we turn to Christopher Ruddy.

29:44.133 --> 29:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's the CEO of the
conservative Newsmax Media and
a friend of President Trump.

29:50.566 --> 29:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Christopher Ruddy, thank
you for joining us again.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, we know you have
been talking to folks
inside the White House.

29:54.800 --> 29:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last week had to have been one
of the most difficult weeks
for this young presidency,

30:01.233 --> 30:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the Comey testimony,
other matters out there.

30:03.333 --> 30:05.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
How is the president,
how are his team doing?

30:05.366 --> 30:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY, CEO, Newsmax:
Well, I think they came out
of last week pretty good.

30:08.600 --> 30:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke to the president late
last week, and I think he was
pretty optimistic about things

30:15.066 --> 30:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and happy that things -- I
wouldn't say overly happy.

30:18.466 --> 30:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I also think that he
generally felt that he had won a
victory, that Director Comey's

30:24.900 --> 30:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
testimony once again proved
that there was no obstruction.

30:28.866 --> 30:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The director doesn't want to
describe what the president
said to him as obstruction.

30:33.166 --> 30:36.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There is no evidence
of collusion.

30:36.200 --> 30:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a special prosecutor,
Judy, that has been appointed
here where there was never

30:42.433 --> 30:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
an allegation of a crime
or evidence of a crime.

30:44.800 --> 30:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a very highly situation
-- highly unusual situation,
but it's also, I think,

30:51.200 --> 30:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
politically driven.

30:53.200 --> 30:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that that's getting
the president and a lot of
his top aides concerned that

30:59.500 --> 31:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is an effort here
to undermine his agenda
in Washington by people
that want to focus

31:04.000 --> 31:06.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on these investigations.

31:06.000 --> 31:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you're
saying it may be politically
motivated, but even Republicans

31:11.266 --> 31:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Senate Intelligence
Committee said of former
Director Comey's testimony that

31:15.300 --> 31:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they found him credible,
that they view him as
someone with integrity.

31:19.433 --> 31:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he's the person who said
the president lied about the
situation at the FBI, and he

31:25.900 --> 31:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was afraid the president would
also lie about their meeting.

31:29.166 --> 31:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Look, I think
Director Comey is a good guy,
but I also think he violated

31:33.900 --> 31:38.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
bureau policy when he
held a press conference
explaining why he wasn't
going to indict Hillary

31:40.066 --> 31:42.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Clinton back in
June of last year.

31:42.066 --> 31:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The FBI doesn't indict people.

31:43.666 --> 31:45.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They just -- they're an
investigative agency.

31:45.500 --> 31:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm not sure why he gave
that press conference.

31:47.800 --> 31:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he violated FBI rules
when he interfered in the
election two weeks before.

31:54.266 --> 31:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He opened an investigation
into Hillary's e-mails.

31:55.833 --> 31:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Democrats were very angry.

31:58.133 --> 32:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he violated FBI rules
again last week when he admitted
he leaked confidential documents

32:05.033 --> 32:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he compiled as the FBI
director to The New York Times.

32:09.766 --> 32:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people say that might
have been ethically very
bad, but also possibly
a criminal violation.

32:18.033 --> 32:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just think that he
engaged in a very unusual
pattern of activity.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not saying that everything
the president has done has
been right in this case, but

32:30.600 --> 32:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when you look at the facts,
you have to wonder, who
would you trust more here?

32:33.700 --> 32:38.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, you
mentioned the special
counsel, Robert Mueller.

32:38.100 --> 32:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you suggested -- I think I
heard you suggesting that there
is a question about the purpose

32:43.833 --> 32:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of his investigation.

32:45.866 --> 32:49.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I want to ask you about
that, because there
are some Republicans
out there saying that

32:49.133 --> 32:51.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Robert Mueller shouldn't
be doing this job.

32:51.233 --> 32:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is President Trump prepared
to let the special counsel
pursue his investigation?

32:58.133 --> 33:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Well, I
think he's considering perhaps
terminating the special counsel.

33:03.766 --> 33:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he's weighing that
option, I think it's pretty
clear by what one of his lawyers

33:08.466 --> 33:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
said on television recently.

33:10.566 --> 33:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I personally think it would
be a significant mistake, even
though I don't think there is

33:17.066 --> 33:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a justification, and even
though -- I mean, here
you have a situation...

33:19.800 --> 33:21.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

33:21.333 --> 33:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You don't think
there is a justification for?

33:22.766 --> 33:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: For a
special counsel in this case.

33:24.400 --> 33:27.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But also -- I mean,
Robert Mueller, there
are some real conflicts.

33:27.833 --> 33:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He comes from a law firm
that represent members
of the Trump family.

33:32.733 --> 33:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He interviewed the day before,
a few days before he was
appointed special counsel with

33:39.666 --> 33:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president, who was
looking at him potentially to
become the next FBI director.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That hasn't been
published, but it's true.

33:46.266 --> 33:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think it would be
strange that he would
have a confidential
conversation, and then,

33:51.000 --> 33:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a few days later, become
the prosecutor of the person
he may be investigating.

33:57.966 --> 34:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that Mueller shouldn't
have taken the position if
he was under consideration

34:01.733 --> 34:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and had a private meeting with
the president and was privy
maybe to some of his thoughts

34:08.133 --> 34:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about that investigation or
other matters before the bureau.

34:10.200 --> 34:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you know
for a fact that Robert Mueller
was offered another position

34:14.100 --> 34:16.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
before he became
special counsel?

34:16.200 --> 34:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: I
know for a fact that he
was under consideration
and that the president

34:19.666 --> 34:23.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
did talk with him in
the days before he was
named special counsel.

34:23.266 --> 34:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think there's
a conflict there.

34:25.333 --> 34:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Look, my position is that
Mueller is a man of integrity,
but we all know in the history

34:32.200 --> 34:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of these special investigations,
they go far and wide, and
they go well beyond what the

34:37.966 --> 34:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
original jurisdiction was.

34:39.933 --> 34:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's bringing in some of the
top prosecutors that have worked
in the Justice Department.

34:44.233 --> 34:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not going to be
rosy for the White House.

34:47.133 --> 34:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have to look at -- when
you say there's no -- Judy, I
think we both have to agree,

34:51.566 --> 34:53.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so far, there's been no
evidence of wrongdoing.

34:53.733 --> 34:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's been no allegation
that the president engaged in
wrongdoing or any member of his

34:58.666 --> 35:00.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
staff did.

35:00.266 --> 35:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
one other thing, Chris Ruddy.

35:02.300 --> 35:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is, the president's
declined so far to say one
way or the other whether there

35:09.166 --> 35:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is audio recording in the Oval
Office, in the White House, and
that whether his conversations

35:15.866 --> 35:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with Director Comey
could have been recorded.

35:18.733 --> 35:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you know whether there
is a recording system
in the White House?

35:21.233 --> 35:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: I hope not.

35:22.900 --> 35:25.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I don't want any
of my conversations
with him out there.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

35:26.466 --> 35:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't remember half
the things I said to him.

35:27.633 --> 35:29.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But...

35:29.666 --> 35:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why do you think
he has not - - why do you think
he has declined to clarify

35:32.966 --> 35:34.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY:
Well, I don't know.

35:36.266 --> 35:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he was -- the way I
interpreted the president's
remark was that, if there were

35:39.733 --> 35:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tapes, that they would vindicate
the president and not Comey.

35:43.733 --> 35:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I -- maybe he loves having that
out as a mystery out there, but
I'm not interpreting that that

35:50.333 --> 35:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's actual physical tapes.

35:52.366 --> 35:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
Chris Ruddy with Newsmax,
thank you very much.

35:57.566 --> 35:58.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We appreciate it.

35:58.833 --> 36:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTOPHER RUDDY: Great
to be on with you, Judy.

36:00.900 --> 36:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to continue
our politics conversation,
we're joined now by Tamara Keith

36:06.000 --> 36:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of NPR and Stu Rothenberg,
senior editor at
Inside Elections.

36:10.800 --> 36:11.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you both.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's good to have you.

36:13.733 --> 36:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Tam, you just heard Chris
Ruddy, who does talk to people
in the White House -- he said

36:16.800 --> 36:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he talked to the president on
Friday -- say that he thinks
the president is considering

36:22.666 --> 36:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
terminating Robert Mueller.

36:23.933 --> 36:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that something
we were aware of?

36:25.966 --> 36:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Certainly, there has
been stuff around on Twitter of

36:29.933 --> 36:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other Republicans raising
questions about Mueller.

36:33.000 --> 36:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the way that Ruddy just
couched that, he made it
clear that -- and maybe he was

36:39.866 --> 36:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protecting himself and the
president, but he made it clear
that he was basing that on

36:41.900 --> 36:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that one of the
president's lawyers had
said on TV over the weekend.

36:48.633 --> 36:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing that stood out
to me is talking about Robert
Mueller having had a meeting

36:53.666 --> 36:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the White House, having met
with the president, possibly to
take the job of FBI director,

36:59.600 --> 37:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is a job he
had held before.

37:03.000 --> 37:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NPR and Carrie Johnson,
my colleague at NPR,
had been reporting that
Mueller had met with

37:07.200 --> 37:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice Department officials
and also White House officials.

37:10.566 --> 37:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the idea that he also met
with the president himself
is new, to me at least.

37:14.933 --> 37:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu
Rothenberg, this is --
these are -- the story
just keep bubbling up about

37:22.633 --> 37:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mr. Mueller, Mr. Comey,
the president, the
Russia investigation.

37:27.133 --> 37:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a White House that,
this week, is trying to get
-- clearly get away from this.

37:31.466 --> 37:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG,
Inside Elections: Right.

37:32.966 --> 37:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They have labeled
it Workforce Development Week.

37:37.033 --> 37:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What -- can they have -- can
they make any progress in
changing direction when you have

37:43.500 --> 37:44.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this kind of
conversation going on?

37:44.500 --> 37:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Right.

37:46.566 --> 37:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's a great idea
that they should try to change
the discussion and narrative.

37:48.500 --> 37:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, in this case, as
you point out, there's
too much is going on.

37:52.333 --> 37:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During Workforce Development
Week, tomorrow, we have the
Sessions testimony on the Hill.

37:57.233 --> 38:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have two attorneys general,
one from D.C., one from
Maryland, announced that they're

38:01.933 --> 38:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to sue the president
over the Emoluments Clause.

38:05.833 --> 38:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had today the Ninth Circuit
Court issuing an opinion
upholding the travel ban.

38:12.800 --> 38:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's as if the president has
already kind of broken so
many bottles and glasses that

38:18.733 --> 38:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is glass strewn on the
floor and any step he takes,
he's going to crunch something.

38:25.466 --> 38:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it would be a
wonderful idea for the White
House to change the subject, but

38:27.600 --> 38:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can see what happened
in the last 24 hours.

38:29.333 --> 38:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Tam,
they're still trying.

38:30.966 --> 38:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last week, it was
infrastructure week.

38:32.333 --> 38:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: And
that was not...

38:33.333 --> 38:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Mr. Comey.

38:34.333 --> 38:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

38:35.333 --> 38:36.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:36.833 --> 38:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And Mr. Comey
week is actually what it was.

38:38.100 --> 38:40.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so the president
is flying tomorrow.

38:40.633 --> 38:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to Waukesha,
Wisconsin, to tour a
technical college and talk
about apprenticeships.

38:46.533 --> 38:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On a slow news day, any other
president, that might sort of
be a headline, but it certainly

38:52.633 --> 38:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wouldn't be a
front-page headline.

38:55.033 --> 39:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're trying to distract
some very big headlines, going
to a technical college isn't

39:00.833 --> 39:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
necessarily the answer.

39:01.633 --> 39:03.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the other thing.

39:03.633 --> 39:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been trying to press
the White House to find out
what policy change the president

39:06.600 --> 39:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
actually envisions or
they say that they want
more private-to-private
partnerships, to do

39:12.333 --> 39:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more apprenticeships.

39:13.800 --> 39:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Around this
work force development, right.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Exactly, around
this work force development.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then they're saying, well,
you will have to wait until
Wednesday to find out exactly

39:19.800 --> 39:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what we're talking about.

39:21.833 --> 39:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a long time to
wait and it's a long time to
expect people to pay attention

39:25.666 --> 39:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to something that is not related
to the biggest news of the day.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG:
Two other points.

39:30.366 --> 39:33.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
One is, are there tapes?

39:33.333 --> 39:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That hasn't been answered,
so, every day, reporters
are going to ask that.

39:36.366 --> 39:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the other thing
was, I think Chris Ruddy
made some news today.

39:39.400 --> 39:43.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said the president is
considering the firing
of the special counsel.

39:43.300 --> 39:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Isn't that the next
week's discussion now?

39:46.233 --> 39:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's hard for me
to believe that...

39:48.366 --> 39:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and we
couldn't tell - - as Tamara
was saying, we couldn't tell

39:50.633 --> 39:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if he was just referring to
what one of the president's
lawyers is saying, but the fact

39:55.433 --> 39:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that he said it has...

39:56.933 --> 39:58.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And the way
he said it, yes, absolutely.

39:58.133 --> 39:59.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: .. has
to make us wonder.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Stunning.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
mentioned, Stu, you have got
the travel ban decision today

40:04.800 --> 40:06.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the federal court.

40:06.066 --> 40:09.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There doesn't seem
to be good news.

40:09.133 --> 40:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, health care reform
seems to be, at least for the
time being, slogged, stopped

40:15.366 --> 40:16.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

40:16.566 --> 40:17.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Stopped up, is that
the word in the Senate?

40:17.500 --> 40:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is nothing happening yet.

40:18.733 --> 40:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe it will happen.

40:20.266 --> 40:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We haven't seen a
tax reform plan.

40:23.633 --> 40:27.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Are we just going to
watch the news develop
every week like this?

40:27.033 --> 40:28.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

40:28.266 --> 40:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG:
Yes, I think so.

40:29.966 --> 40:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, there is a problem
for the White House
on a number of levels.

40:31.633 --> 40:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president wants to
change the narrative.

40:33.733 --> 40:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He also wants to
accomplish things.

40:35.166 --> 40:36.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He hasn't yet.

40:36.166 --> 40:38.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Maybe he will.

40:38.166 --> 40:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one of the things I believed
for many weeks and months is
that he has to worry about

40:43.433 --> 40:45.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the fatigue factor on
the American public.

40:45.533 --> 40:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember thinking back to
Bill Clinton and all the drama
in the Clinton White House.

40:49.033 --> 40:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And after a while,
people thought, ay yi yi,
another thing we have.

40:52.433 --> 40:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oy gevalt, as we say.

40:55.333 --> 40:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is the same kind of thing.

40:57.500 --> 41:00.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's -- there is another
crisis every day.

41:00.466 --> 41:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And after a while, people
just -- they don't want that.

41:03.566 --> 41:05.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want things to
return to normal.

41:05.666 --> 41:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump's -- the
whole premise of Donald
Trump is upsetting normal.

41:09.466 --> 41:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, you can only do that if
you accomplish certain things
and people start to feel better

41:14.266 --> 41:16.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
about themselves
and the country.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much do
they recognize this at the
White House, do you think, Tam?

41:18.566 --> 41:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, they're
obviously trying to correct it.

41:21.400 --> 41:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're trying to do things that
normal presidents do, like hold
a Cabinet meeting, as they did

41:28.333 --> 41:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, though it turned into
somewhat unusual session of
every Cabinet head praising the

41:33.733 --> 41:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president in very effusive
ways that is sort of beyond
what would be normal for one of

41:40.166 --> 41:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these types of events, one
of these types of photo-ops.

41:42.233 --> 41:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to turn
you to something - - because
we do pay attention to parts of

41:45.900 --> 41:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country, Stu, outside
of Washington occasionally.

41:49.200 --> 41:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there are a couple
of elections coming up.

41:52.100 --> 41:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow in Virginia,
there's a primary as they
choose their governor.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Right.

41:57.333 --> 42:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A week from
tomorrow, there's a much-watched
vote to choose the next member

42:01.066 --> 42:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Congress from the 6th
District in Atlanta, Georgia.

42:03.000 --> 42:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes,
and I think that special
election is a really big deal.

42:05.666 --> 42:07.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

42:07.133 --> 42:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I think
Democrats have been hoping...

42:08.166 --> 42:09.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Georgia.

42:09.666 --> 42:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: In Georgia,
right, the Georgia 6th special.

42:10.466 --> 42:12.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

42:12.566 --> 42:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Democrats
have been hoping for a victory
to take off over a Republican

42:15.233 --> 42:16.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
seat.

42:16.233 --> 42:17.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This one was very close.

42:17.466 --> 42:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump won it by
a point in November.

42:19.666 --> 42:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Democrats feel like they
have a great opportunity here.

42:22.700 --> 42:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they do, then we will
have another news story, another
data point that the White

42:27.100 --> 42:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House will have to respond to.

42:29.600 --> 42:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the Democrats lose,
I think, after losing
in Kansas and Montana --
and, yes, the Democrats

42:36.600 --> 42:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of exceeded expectations
-- but losing in the Georgia
seat, there will be a sense

42:39.566 --> 42:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of just, are the voters really
turning on Donald Trump or not?

42:43.833 --> 42:45.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I think it's a big
deal for both parties.

42:45.633 --> 42:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is the White
House watching that one?

42:47.033 --> 42:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, absolutely
they're watching it.

42:49.133 --> 42:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just today, President
Trump was saying, look, we did
well in Kansas, we did well in

42:55.733 --> 42:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Montana, Democrats think they
have something going on, but,
no, they don't, look at what

42:57.533 --> 42:59.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we have done.

42:59.100 --> 43:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the president himself
is watching this closely.

43:01.733 --> 43:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he
said complimentary things
about Karen Handel, the
Republican candidate.

43:08.066 --> 43:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think
he would take it as a
personal loss if she loses.

43:12.666 --> 43:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Because -- is it, Stu?

43:13.600 --> 43:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: It would be.

43:14.566 --> 43:16.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It would be.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A statement
about Donald Trump?

43:17.233 --> 43:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Oh, yes.

43:19.266 --> 43:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neither Karen Handel, the
Democrat -- the Republican,
nor Jon Ossoff, the Democrat,

43:22.466 --> 43:23.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are perfect candidates.

43:23.466 --> 43:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have raised a lot of money.

43:25.466 --> 43:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a lot of
energy, and most of it is
national money and energy.

43:28.700 --> 43:31.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I don't -- think
there's no doubt.

43:31.066 --> 43:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there was a Democrat in the
White House, I would expect
the Republican to win the race

43:36.533 --> 43:38.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
easily.

43:38.633 --> 43:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now, with a controversial
Republican in the White House,
no, this election is -- it's

43:41.733 --> 43:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about Donald Trump.

43:43.600 --> 43:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu Rothenberg,
Tamara Keith, this is
about the two of you.

43:47.133 --> 43:49.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

43:49.700 --> 43:51.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

43:51.000 --> 43:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Thank you.

43:58.000 --> 44:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: screening
for cervical cancer in places
where the disease rarely

44:03.700 --> 44:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gets priority, amid
other pressing problems.

44:07.333 --> 44:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Fred de
Sam Lazaro has a report on one
effort to prevent a disease

44:14.333 --> 44:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that afflicts about 500,000
women across the world every
year, but has the most deadly

44:18.900 --> 44:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
outcomes in India.

44:20.933 --> 44:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of his ongoing
series Agents for Change.

44:24.266 --> 44:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In a village
just outside Lucknow, India,
recently, there was a rare

44:30.666 --> 44:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunity for many women
like 35-year-old Kiran Rawat.

44:34.566 --> 44:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the first time in her
life, she saw a doctor.

44:38.866 --> 44:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her timing couldn't be better.

44:42.333 --> 44:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There are some white spots
that I found when I applied the

44:47.200 --> 44:48.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
medicine.

44:48.200 --> 44:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's nothing to be afraid of.

44:49.466 --> 44:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
white spots are lesions.

44:51.433 --> 44:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If left untreated, they can
lead to cervical cancer in
women usually between 30 and 60

44:56.633 --> 44:58.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years old.

44:58.066 --> 45:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is preventable and
treatable if detected early.

45:00.433 --> 45:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yet, more than half the cases
worldwide are fatal, the vast
majority of them in developing

45:06.900 --> 45:08.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

45:08.933 --> 45:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In India, cervical cancer claims
almost 70,000 lives a year,
more than anywhere else in the

45:14.066 --> 45:16.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

45:16.133 --> 45:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's because, for millions
of women here, seeing a doctor
is the last resort, an often

45:22.200 --> 45:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unaffordable luxury.

45:24.433 --> 45:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a pilot program run by the
global nonprofit Population
Services International, or PSI,

45:30.166 --> 45:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aimed to change that.

45:32.266 --> 45:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The organization set up medical
screening camps in Uttar
Pradesh, India's most populous

45:37.200 --> 45:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and one of its most
impoverished state.

45:40.200 --> 45:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sixty women came to this one.

45:42.466 --> 45:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Four tested positive for
the pre-cancerous lesions

45:45.233 --> 45:47.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

45:47.766 --> 45:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
UMA SINGH, India: Pick
up a nice ball of cotton,
dip it in freshly made
acetic acid solution.

45:50.966 --> 45:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
In rich countries, Pap
smears and follow-up
treatment are the standard,

45:57.266 --> 45:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that's neither affordable
nor practical here.

45:59.600 --> 46:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, obstetrics professor
Uma Singh demonstrated
to students a low-tech,
low-cost alternative

46:05.900 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
being used in the pilot,
a simple swab of the
cervix with vinegar.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:11.600 --> 46:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UMA SINGH: So, after one minute,
what you do is, do -- do the
inspection with good light.

46:17.666 --> 46:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you see a white area,
you treat it by a procedure
which is called cryotherapy.

46:22.933 --> 46:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO:
Literally freezing it off.

46:24.666 --> 46:26.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:26.166 --> 46:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
UMA SINGH: Yes, that's the
right word, freezing it off.

46:27.566 --> 46:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
lesions are a virus called HPV.

46:29.533 --> 46:34.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The patient can't see or
feel it, and the immune
system usually fights it off.

46:35.933 --> 46:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, about one in every
100 infections turns cancerous.

46:39.133 --> 46:43.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vaccines are available
and have proven effective
in preventing HPV.

46:43.600 --> 46:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the cost puts them out of
reach of most Indian women.

46:46.733 --> 46:48.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

46:48.233 --> 46:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMITHA SINGH, India (through
translator): Don't be afraid.

46:49.133 --> 46:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will remove them.

46:50.300 --> 46:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a very simple
thing, just 10 minutes.

46:52.366 --> 46:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The
approach here is to remove
any lesions right away.

46:56.133 --> 47:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no time or resources
to monitor or biopsy, no
assurance the women will return

47:01.866 --> 47:04.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for follow-up treatment.

47:04.000 --> 47:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is likely that in many,
if not most cases, you are
over-treating the patient.

47:08.833 --> 47:10.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:10.966 --> 47:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
UMA SINGH: Yes, it may be a
little bit of over-treating,
but it has been seen that it

47:13.866 --> 47:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't produce any substantial
harm to the woman in relation
to producing any long-term

47:20.300 --> 47:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
effects on the cervix.

47:22.266 --> 47:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But, often,
women who test positive are
scared off by the prospect

47:25.966 --> 47:26.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of cryotherapy.

47:26.966 --> 47:28.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

47:28.466 --> 47:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SMITHA SINGH: They feel a
big treatment will be done.

47:30.733 --> 47:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And at times, they do not
give consent for the cryo.

47:33.400 --> 47:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: PSI
canvasser Pinky Rawat says that
happens for a simple reason.

47:40.900 --> 47:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PINKY RAWAT, Population
Services International
(through translator):
They hear the word cancer

47:42.366 --> 47:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and they say, if I do have
cancer, what can I do?

47:45.133 --> 47:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They get very scared
when they hear cancer.

47:47.600 --> 47:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But even
as there's fear of cancer,
getting women to the screening

47:53.433 --> 47:56.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a tough sell.

47:56.766 --> 48:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These women complained
that they need help for
far more mundane health
care issues, which

48:01.466 --> 48:02.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
no one provides.

48:02.966 --> 48:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
My legs hurt all the time.

48:06.233 --> 48:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Give me something for my gout.

48:08.266 --> 48:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Many women
labor in the field and in
households struggling to get

48:11.633 --> 48:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by, and they neglect
their own health.

48:13.833 --> 48:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SONI GUPTA, Population
Services International
(through translator):
It's affected my own

48:16.966 --> 48:18.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

48:18.233 --> 48:20.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's been three months
since my mother died.

48:20.200 --> 48:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: PSI worker
Soni Gupta says early screening
and treatment might have

48:23.733 --> 48:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saved her mother, who
died from cervical cancer.

48:26.566 --> 48:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SONI GUPTA (through
translator): I feel terrible.

48:29.033 --> 48:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Even though I work in this field
for women, my own mother died.

48:32.266 --> 48:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Of the
four women who tested positive
for the pre-cancerous lesions,

48:36.900 --> 48:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the social workers the next
morning were able to find just
one willing to go in and get

48:42.700 --> 48:43.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
treated.

48:43.800 --> 48:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN (through
translator): I'm afraid.

48:45.100 --> 48:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have four children.

48:47.133 --> 48:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: It was
Kiran Rawat who needed a lot
of coaxing and reassurance by

48:50.600 --> 48:52.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a PSI outreach worker.

48:52.300 --> 48:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
There's nothing to worry about.

48:55.266 --> 48:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It will just take a few minutes.

48:57.200 --> 48:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you have my phone number.

48:58.566 --> 49:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can call me for anything.

49:01.200 --> 49:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A few
minutes later, accompanied
by her husband, they
were on the way to Dr.

49:05.366 --> 49:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Smitha Singh's clinic.

49:06.633 --> 49:08.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Soon, the 10-minute
procedure was done.

49:08.800 --> 49:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
I was afraid at first.

49:11.233 --> 49:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
But, today, no problems, right?

49:13.233 --> 49:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
No problem today, but I
didn't sleep all night.

49:16.233 --> 49:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The hope is
that she will help spread the
word and a culture of preventive

49:20.800 --> 49:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care, says Dr. Uma Singh.

49:22.233 --> 49:24.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

49:24.300 --> 49:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
UMA SINGH: So, it is
like motivating them to
go for the checkup for
prevention of cancer,

49:29.700 --> 49:33.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for hypertension, for diabetes,
for anemia and multiple things.

49:34.933 --> 49:37.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then you have to ensure
that there have to
be good facilities.

49:37.666 --> 49:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: That much
larger job of building a better
public health system will

49:41.800 --> 49:46.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
take time, but PSI says
its screening program
is set to scale up.

49:48.833 --> 49:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The state government has begun
to train workers to offer it in
all public health clinics based

49:53.333 --> 49:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on results in the pilot,
which concluded in January.

49:56.366 --> 50:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Seven thousand cases
were positive for the
pre-cancerous lesions.

50:00.433 --> 50:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
About two-thirds of these
women had them removed.

50:03.700 --> 50:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
this is Fred de Sam Lazaro
outside Lucknow, India.

50:11.133 --> 50:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at University

50:14.600 --> 50:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of St. Thomas in Minnesota.

50:29.733 --> 50:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now to our "NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that may be of interest to

50:33.733 --> 50:35.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you, too.

50:35.800 --> 50:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Allegiances to sports teams
run deep in many families, but
one Virginia man decided to

50:42.666 --> 50:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let the nation's Major
League Baseball franchises
make their own pitch
for his son's affection.

50:46.966 --> 50:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia
Griffin explains.

50:49.166 --> 50:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PETE VAN VLEET, Father:
This photo is good for
two Astros tickets.

50:52.433 --> 50:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: So, when are
you going to redeem that?

50:55.100 --> 50:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: If it were
up to me, we're having such a
good year, we'd go this season,

50:58.266 --> 50:59.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but that would be
unfair for Jack.

50:59.466 --> 51:00.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:00.966 --> 51:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Right, because
he wouldn't remember it.

51:02.166 --> 51:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PETE VAN VLEET: He
wouldn't remember it.

51:04.633 --> 51:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Jack
wouldn't remember a Houston
Astros game because he
was just born in February.

51:09.466 --> 51:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And while his father, Pete Van
Vleet, is a lifelong Astros
fan, he wants Jack, like his

51:14.033 --> 51:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
5-year-old daughter, Madeline,
to choose his own allegiance.

51:16.166 --> 51:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: I didn't want
to force anything on my own
kids, especially in the realm of

51:20.900 --> 51:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
baseball, so I let them
pick their own team.

51:23.200 --> 51:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: A few seasons
ago, Madeline picked Detroit,
reasoning that Tigers are

51:27.900 --> 51:29.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fierce.

51:29.966 --> 51:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: A friend of
mine asked when, after Jack
was born, is he going to be an

51:31.566 --> 51:32.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Astros fan?

51:32.800 --> 51:34.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I said, no, he can root
for whomever he wants.

51:34.866 --> 51:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then it dawned on me, why
not let the teams have a say?

51:37.433 --> 51:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: When
spring training got under
way, Pete, who, for the
record, is an employee

51:42.233 --> 51:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of PBS, mailed letters to all
30 Major League Baseball teams.

51:46.800 --> 51:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The query was
simple, but serious.

51:49.466 --> 51:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: "I want to
give you, the Pittsburgh
Pirates, the San Francisco
Giants, the Washington

51:53.700 --> 51:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nationals, a chance to make
your own case as to why my
son should pick your team to

51:56.933 --> 51:58.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
root for.

51:58.233 --> 51:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I must tell you, I do
not take this lightly.

51:59.866 --> 52:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Friends may come and go.

52:01.900 --> 52:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Political affiliations and
beliefs in higher powers may
change, but one's team is one's

52:05.466 --> 52:07.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
team forever."

52:07.433 --> 52:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: It wasn't long
before responses, or, arguably,
bribes, began to arrive.

52:13.266 --> 52:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
From the Milwaukee Brewers, a
letter and autographed baseball.

52:16.966 --> 52:18.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: From Matt
Garza, their ace pitcher.

52:18.866 --> 52:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: From
the Miami Marlins.

52:21.066 --> 52:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETE VAN VLEET: "Billy
the Marlin, our mascot
is goofy, adorable and
is blatantly superior

52:26.533 --> 52:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to all other Major
League mascots."

52:28.166 --> 52:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, if he's fishing
for a team, the Marlins
are a good one there.

52:30.800 --> 52:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Pittsburgh
Pirates president Frank
Coonelly wrote a personal note.

52:35.066 --> 52:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: "The Pirate
ship has plenty of room on it
for a young fan from Ashland,

52:39.133 --> 52:41.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Virginia."

52:41.266 --> 52:44.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Nationals
team manager Dusty Baker
sent pint-sized team
gear and an invitation.

52:44.433 --> 52:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: "We want to
get you started by inviting
you to our ballpark to catch a

52:48.200 --> 52:52.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
game, visit the field
during batting practice,
and, of course, a
sharp outfit for you to

52:52.333 --> 52:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
start your collection."

52:54.333 --> 52:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: While the Chicago
Cubs sent an array of 2016
world champions memorabilia

52:59.233 --> 53:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and made a play for Madeline.

53:01.300 --> 53:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: "I know big
sisters have a lot of influence
over their little brothers,

53:04.033 --> 53:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so maybe you can help us
convince Jack to be a Cubs fan."

53:07.866 --> 53:08.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why not?

53:08.866 --> 53:10.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's very smart of them.

53:10.866 --> 53:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Not only did
they send all the swag, but
they are going after the sister

53:12.300 --> 53:13.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vote as well.

53:13.300 --> 53:15.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PETE VAN VLEET: Exactly.

53:15.333 --> 53:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: A total of 13
teams have replied so far, but
have any knocked their argument

53:19.900 --> 53:20.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of the park?

53:20.833 --> 53:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is 4-month-old Jack persuaded?

53:23.300 --> 53:24.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is a smile.

53:24.300 --> 53:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETE VAN VLEET: Maybe that's it

53:25.566 --> 53:28.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Well,
for now, no comment.

53:28.266 --> 53:32.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jack is just enjoying the
pennant pursuers' pursuit.

53:32.366 --> 53:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Julia Griffin in
Ashland, Virginia.

53:36.600 --> 53:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just shameless.

53:39.233 --> 53:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I like the team that went
after -- I guess it was the
Cubs, who thought about the big

53:43.100 --> 53:44.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
sister.

53:44.233 --> 53:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:46.200 --> 53:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Tuesday, we will wrap up
the testimony of Attorney
General Jeff sessions, who faces

53:50.100 --> 53:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
senators of the Select
Committee on Intelligence.

53:52.666 --> 53:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:54.133 --> 53:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again
right here tomorrow evening.

53:56.400 --> 54:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank you,
and we will see you soon.
