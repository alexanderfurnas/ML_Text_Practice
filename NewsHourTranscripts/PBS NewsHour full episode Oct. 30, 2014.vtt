SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, EBOLA CAN  
REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 
IMMUNE SYSTEM.                  

28:22.831 --> 28:24.390
REDUCE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE 
IMMUNE SYSTEM.                  
SO PEOPLE EVEN GET ANTIBIOTICS, 

28:24.392 --> 28:26.714
IMMUNE SYSTEM.                  
SO PEOPLE EVEN GET ANTIBIOTICS, 
EVEN THOUGH EBOLA IS A VIRAL    

28:26.715 --> 28:27.064
SO PEOPLE EVEN GET ANTIBIOTICS, 
EVEN THOUGH EBOLA IS A VIRAL    
DISEASE.                        

28:27.066 --> 28:29.898
EVEN THOUGH EBOLA IS A VIRAL    
DISEASE.                        
SO YOU WOULD THINK IT'S SORT OF 

28:29.899 --> 28:30.917
DISEASE.                        
SO YOU WOULD THINK IT'S SORT OF 
SIMPLE-- FLUIDS AND SOME OF     

28:30.918 --> 28:32.955
SO YOU WOULD THINK IT'S SORT OF 
SIMPLE-- FLUIDS AND SOME OF     
THESE EXTRA MEDICINES-- BUT IN  

28:32.957 --> 28:34.197
SIMPLE-- FLUIDS AND SOME OF     
THESE EXTRA MEDICINES-- BUT IN  
FACT THERE ARE ALL THESE CHOICES

28:34.199 --> 28:35.120
THESE EXTRA MEDICINES-- BUT IN  
FACT THERE ARE ALL THESE CHOICES
THAT HAVE TO BE MADE.           

28:35.122 --> 28:38.497
FACT THERE ARE ALL THESE CHOICES
THAT HAVE TO BE MADE.           
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE        

28:38.498 --> 28:40.534
THAT HAVE TO BE MADE.           
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE        
SOMEBODY WHO TESTS NEGATIVE, BUT

28:40.535 --> 28:42.540
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE        
SOMEBODY WHO TESTS NEGATIVE, BUT
THEN THEY DEVELOP SYMPTOMS WHILE

28:42.542 --> 28:44.196
SOMEBODY WHO TESTS NEGATIVE, BUT
THEN THEY DEVELOP SYMPTOMS WHILE
THEY'RE IN THE SUSPECT WARD,    

28:44.197 --> 28:45.086
THEN THEY DEVELOP SYMPTOMS WHILE
THEY'RE IN THE SUSPECT WARD,    
WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW, IT'S      

28:45.089 --> 28:46.648
THEY'RE IN THE SUSPECT WARD,    
WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW, IT'S      
POSSIBLE THAT THEY STILL WILL   

28:46.651 --> 28:47.412
WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW, IT'S      
POSSIBLE THAT THEY STILL WILL   
TURN POSITIVE.                  

28:47.414 --> 28:50.564
POSSIBLE THAT THEY STILL WILL   
TURN POSITIVE.                  
SO DO YOU KEEP THEM THERE AND   

28:50.566 --> 28:51.361
TURN POSITIVE.                  
SO DO YOU KEEP THEM THERE AND   
POSSIBLY EXPOSE THEM TO OTHER   

28:51.362 --> 28:53.399
SO DO YOU KEEP THEM THERE AND   
POSSIBLY EXPOSE THEM TO OTHER   
PEOPLE WHO HAVE EBOLA IN ORDER  

28:53.400 --> 28:55.118
POSSIBLY EXPOSE THEM TO OTHER   
PEOPLE WHO HAVE EBOLA IN ORDER  
TO TEST THEM AGAIN?             

28:55.120 --> 28:56.392
PEOPLE WHO HAVE EBOLA IN ORDER  
TO TEST THEM AGAIN?             
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL THESE        

28:56.394 --> 28:59.226
TO TEST THEM AGAIN?             
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL THESE        
DIFFICULT CHOICES COME UP, EVEN 

28:59.227 --> 29:00.181
AND, YOU KNOW, ALL THESE        
DIFFICULT CHOICES COME UP, EVEN 
WITH CHILDREN.                  

29:00.182 --> 29:01.424
DIFFICULT CHOICES COME UP, EVEN 
WITH CHILDREN.                  
THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WHERE,  

29:01.426 --> 29:04.193
WITH CHILDREN.                  
THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WHERE,  
YOU KNOW, A PARENT TESTS        

29:04.196 --> 29:05.466
THAT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE, WHERE,  
YOU KNOW, A PARENT TESTS        
NEGATIVE AIR, CHILD TESTS       

29:05.468 --> 29:05.817
YOU KNOW, A PARENT TESTS        
NEGATIVE AIR, CHILD TESTS       
POSITIVE.                       

29:05.820 --> 29:07.697
NEGATIVE AIR, CHILD TESTS       
POSITIVE.                       
SO WHAT DO DO YOU IN THAT

BUT THE DOCTORS AND NURSES HAD  
TO STRUGGLE WITH THIS DECISION  

30:39.376 --> 30:41.729
BUT THE DOCTORS AND NURSES HAD  
TO STRUGGLE WITH THIS DECISION  
OF WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS

COULD THE INFANT BE POSITIVE?   

30:44.214 --> 30:45.424
THEY HAD NO IDEA.               
COULD THE INFANT BE POSITIVE?   
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SCIENCE    

30:45.425 --> 30:46.698
COULD THE INFANT BE POSITIVE?   
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SCIENCE    
AROUND THAT OR DATA OR          

30:46.699 --> 30:47.844
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SCIENCE    
AROUND THAT OR DATA OR          
INFORMATION BECAUSE WE JUST

AROUND THAT OR DATA OR          
INFORMATION BECAUSE WE JUST     
HAVEN'T STUDIED THIS DISEASE AS

MUCH AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD 
TO DO.                          
SO THEY MADE THE BEST CHOICE    

30:53.928 --> 30:54.499
TO DO.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.822
SO THEY MADE THE BEST CHOICE    
THEY COULD.                     
THEY SENT THE BABY HOME WITH THE
