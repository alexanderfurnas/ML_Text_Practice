00:53.120 --> 00:54.855

01:02.930 --> 01:04.698
WITHOUT A NEW CASE OF EBOLA

01:04.698 --> 01:06.433
BEING DETECTED-- TWICE THE

01:06.433 --> 01:08.535
LENGTH OF THE INCUBATION PERIOD.

01:08.535 --> 01:10.704
NEARLY 5,000 OF THE 11,000 WHO

01:10.704 --> 01:12.339
DIED OF THE DISEASE SINCE MARCH

01:12.339 --> 01:14.207
OF 2014 WERE LIBERIAN.

01:14.207 --> 01:16.043
THE DISEASE IS STILL PRESENT IN

01:16.043 --> 01:17.044
THE NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES OF

01:17.044 --> 01:18.779
SIERRA LEONE AND GUINEA.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.814

01:24.851 --> 01:25.852
BALLISTIC MISSILE FROM A

01:25.852 --> 01:28.121
SUBMARINE FOR THE FIRST TIME.

COUNTRY'S LEADER, KIM JONG UN,

01:30.157 --> 01:31.858

01:31.858 --> 01:33.460
FROM THE DECK OF A SHIP.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.362
SECURITY EXPERTS WARN THAT

01:35.362 --> 01:36.830
MISSILES LAUNCHED UNDERWATER ARE

01:36.830 --> 01:38.532
MORE DIFFICULT TO DETECT THAN

01:38.532 --> 01:40.500
THOSE LAUNCHED FROM LAND.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.269
SYRIA'S CHEMICAL WEAPONS PROGRAM

01:42.269 --> 01:43.804
WAS APPARENTLY MORE EXTENSIVE

01:43.804 --> 01:46.006
THAN THE ASSAD REGIME LET ON.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.341
DIPLOMATIC SOURCES QUOTED BY

01:47.341 --> 01:48.942
REUTERS SAY TRACES OF SARIN AND

VX NERVE AGENT WERE DISCOVERED

01:50.777 --> 01:52.679
AT A MILITARY RESEARCH SITE THAT

01:52.679 --> 01:54.681
HAD NOT BEEN DISCLOSED BY SYRIAN

01:54.681 --> 01:55.816
AUTHORITIES.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.017
SYRIA PROMISED TO DESTROY ITS

01:57.017 --> 01:58.352
CHEMICAL WEAPONS STOCKPILE AFTER

01:58.352 --> 01:59.619
SIGNING A DEAL BROKERED BY

01:59.619 --> 02:01.555
RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES IN

02:01.555 --> 02:02.990
2013.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.458
IN IRAQ TODAY, DOZENS OF

02:04.458 --> 02:05.859
INMATES, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF

02:05.859 --> 02:07.327
CONVICTED TERRORISTS, ESCAPED

02:07.327 --> 02:08.228
FROM A PRISON 50 MILES NORTH OF

02:08.228 --> 02:09.930
BAGHDAD.

02:09.930 --> 02:11.365
THE ESCAPES OCCURRED AFTER A

02:11.365 --> 02:12.566
RIOT THAT LED TO THE DEATHS OF

02:12.566 --> 02:14.434
50 INMATES AND 12 GUARDS.

02:14.434 --> 02:15.369
AUTHORITIES THERE SAY THE

02:15.369 --> 02:16.870
INCIDENT BEGAN WHEN PRISONERS

02:16.870 --> 02:18.739
APPEARED TO BE FIGHTING WITH ONE

02:18.739 --> 02:19.473
ANOTHER.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.207
WHEN GUARDS INTERVENED,

02:20.207 --> 02:21.842
PRISONERS ATTACKED THEM AND

02:21.842 --> 02:23.477
STRIPPED THEM OF THEIR WEAPONS.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.412
ACCORDING TO THE BBC, ISIS

02:25.412 --> 02:27.214
CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY.

02:27.214 --> 02:28.648
RUSSIA TODAY MARKED THE 70th

02:28.648 --> 02:29.950
ANNIVERSARY OF THE DEFEAT OF

02:29.950 --> 02:31.651
NAZI GERMANY DURING WORLD WAR II

02:31.651 --> 02:34.121
BY STAGING A MILITARY PARADE IN

02:34.121 --> 02:35.722
RED SQUARE, THE LARGEST SINCE

02:35.722 --> 02:37.524
THE BREAKUP OF THE SOVIET UNION.

02:37.524 --> 02:38.725
THE EVENT WAS ATTENDED BY THE

02:38.725 --> 02:41.128
LEADER OF CHINA BUT BOYCOTTED BY

02:41.128 --> 02:42.763
MOST WESTERN NATIONS.

02:42.763 --> 02:43.530
DURING A SPEECH, RUSSIAN

02:43.530 --> 02:44.464
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN

02:44.464 --> 02:45.932
CRITICIZED THE UNITED STATES,

02:45.932 --> 02:48.835
BUT NOT BY NAME.

02:48.835 --> 02:50.037
>> (translated): THE BASIC

02:50.037 --> 02:51.471
PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL

02:51.471 --> 02:53.373
COOPERATION ARE INCREASINGLY

02:53.373 --> 02:55.342
IGNORED, PRINCIPLES WON AFTER

02:55.342 --> 02:57.077
THE HARDSHIP OF WAR.

02:59.780 --> 03:01.148
WE HAVE SEEN ATTEMPTS TO CREATE

03:01.148 --> 03:03.016
A UNIPOLAR WORLD.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.651
WE SEE A MILITARY BLOC-MENTALITY

03:04.651 --> 03:07.154
EXPANDING.

03:07.154 --> 03:07.854
>> Sreenivasan: THE FIRST

03:07.854 --> 03:08.989
TROPICAL STORM OF THE YEAR IS

03:08.989 --> 03:10.657
HEADED FOR THE CAROLINAS, THREE

03:10.657 --> 03:12.059
WEEKS BEFORE THE START OF THE

03:12.059 --> 03:13.593
ATLANTIC HURRICANE SEASON.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.062
TROPICAL STORM ANA IS EXPECTED

03:15.062 --> 03:16.730
TO HIT AROUND THE BORDER OF

03:16.730 --> 03:18.198
NORTH AND SOUTH CAROLINA EARLY

03:18.198 --> 03:19.032
TOMORROW MORNING.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.700
IT NOW HAS WINDS OF UP TO 60

03:20.700 --> 03:21.968
MILES AN HOUR, BUT IT IS

03:21.968 --> 03:23.570
EXPECTED TO WEAKEN BEFORE MAKING

03:23.570 --> 03:24.538
LANDFALL.

03:24.538 --> 03:25.806
CALIFORNIA HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE

03:25.806 --> 03:27.541
REPORTING A SHARP RISE IN HEROIN

03:27.541 --> 03:28.942
POISONING, COMMONLY FROM

03:28.942 --> 03:30.077
OVERDOSES.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.411
THEY SAY THE NUMBER OF YOUNG

03:31.411 --> 03:32.646
ADULTS TREATED IN HOSPITAL

03:32.646 --> 03:33.947
EMERGENCY ROOMS LAST YEAR

03:33.947 --> 03:36.049
INCREASED SIXFOLD DURING THE

03:36.049 --> 03:37.217
LAST TEN YEARS.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.351
THE NUMBERS WERE ALSO UP

03:38.351 --> 03:39.719
SIGNIFICANTLY IN OTHER AGE

03:39.719 --> 03:40.320
GROUPS.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.055
DEATHS NATIONALLY FROM HEROIN

03:42.055 --> 03:44.724
OVERDOSES TRIPLED BETWEEN 2010

03:44.724 --> 03:46.693
AND 2013, ACCORDING TO A RECENT

03:46.693 --> 03:48.128
REPORT BY THE CENTERS FOR

03:48.128 --> 03:49.629
DISEASE CONTROL.

03:49.629 --> 03:50.797
AND AUTHORITIES SAY A SIGNED

03:50.797 --> 03:52.866
FIRST EDITION COPY OF GABRIEL

03:52.866 --> 03:54.267
GARCIA MARQUEZ'S NOVEL, "ONE

03:54.267 --> 03:55.535
HUNDRED YEARS OF SOLITUDE,"

03:55.535 --> 03:58.438
VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $60,000,

03:58.438 --> 04:00.707
WAS RECOVERED TODAY AT A USED

04:00.707 --> 04:02.909
BOOK STALL IN BOGOTA, COLOMBIA.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.344
IT HAD BEEN STOLEN FROM A

04:04.344 --> 04:06.113
COLLECTOR WHILE ON DISPLAY AT

04:06.113 --> 04:07.547
THAT CITY'S INTERNATIONAL BOOK

04:07.547 --> 04:08.982
FAIR LAST WEEKEND.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.217
THERE WAS NO WORD OF ANY

04:10.217 --> 04:10.250
ARRESTS.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.385
THE AUTHOR DIED LAST YEAR.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.087
HE WAS 87.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.432
>> Sreenivasan: AS WE MENTIONED,

04:25.432 --> 04:26.933
THE CHINESE LEADER WAS IN MOSCOW

04:26.933 --> 04:28.468
TODAY AS RUSSIA PARADED ITS

04:28.468 --> 04:29.336
MILITARY HARDWARE THROUGH RED

04:29.336 --> 04:31.104
SQUARE.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.772
JUST YESTERDAY, THE TWO

04:32.772 --> 04:34.608
COUNTRIES SIGNED 32 AGREEMENTS

04:34.608 --> 04:36.243
INCLUDING WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED

04:36.243 --> 04:37.043
AS A NONAGGRESSION PACT IN

04:37.043 --> 04:39.045
CYBERSPACE.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.780
ALL THIS, AT A TIME OF SEVERELY

04:40.780 --> 04:42.349
STRAINED RELATIONS BETWEEN

04:42.349 --> 04:43.850
RUSSIA AND THE WEST.

04:43.850 --> 04:45.118
ARE WE GOING BACK TO THE FUTURE,

04:45.118 --> 04:45.852
WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA LINED UP

04:45.852 --> 04:47.053
AGAINST THE WEST?

04:47.053 --> 04:48.755
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED NOW FROM

04:48.755 --> 04:49.456
BERKELEY CALIFORNIA BY ORVILLE

04:49.456 --> 04:50.557
SCHELL.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.791
HE'S THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER

04:51.791 --> 04:52.826
ON U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS AT THE

04:52.826 --> 04:54.094
ASIA SOCIETY.

04:54.094 --> 04:56.163
SO, ORVILLE, WHAT IS THE

04:56.163 --> 04:58.598
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE FOR THE

04:58.598 --> 05:00.167
ALIGNMENT OF RUSSIA AND CHINA

05:00.167 --> 05:01.968
AGAIN?

05:01.968 --> 05:04.004
>> WELL, I THINK BOTH RUSSIA AND

05:04.004 --> 05:06.273
CHINA FIND THEMSELVES AT ODDS

05:06.273 --> 05:07.374
WITH THE WEST.

05:07.374 --> 05:10.177
OF COURSE, RUSSIA AND PUTIN IN

05:10.177 --> 05:12.812
THE CRIMEA AND THE UKRAINE, AND

05:12.812 --> 05:16.983
CHINA IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA,

05:16.983 --> 05:18.952
AND THE ISLANDS WITH JAPAN, SO

05:18.952 --> 05:21.755
THE TENDENCY, I THINK WHEN THEY

05:21.755 --> 05:23.690
FIND THEY MET WITH THIS WESTERN

05:23.690 --> 05:25.625
RESISTANCE IS TO TEAM UP.

05:25.625 --> 05:26.760
HOWEVER, ONE SHOULD BE CAREFUL

05:26.760 --> 05:28.428
TO NOTE THEY HAVE NOT ALWAYS HAD

05:28.428 --> 05:30.830
A VERY CLOSE AND FRIENDLY

05:30.830 --> 05:31.965
HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.467
>> SO, WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

05:34.467 --> 05:35.802
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES?

05:35.802 --> 05:37.103
IS THERE INVESTMENT OR POTENTIAL

05:37.103 --> 05:38.805
INVESTMENT BETWEEN CHINA AND

05:38.805 --> 05:40.140
RUSSIA, CHINA PUTTING MONEY INTO

05:40.140 --> 05:42.909
RUSSIA OR THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

05:42.909 --> 05:45.045
>> WELL, THE CHINESE HAVE A

05:45.045 --> 05:46.780
HABIT OF MOVING INTO VACUUMS

05:46.780 --> 05:49.082
WHERE THE WEST WILL SANCTION A

05:49.082 --> 05:52.252
COUNTRY, WHETHER IT IS SUDAN OR

05:52.252 --> 05:54.688
IRAN, OTHER SUCH COUNTRIES,

05:54.688 --> 05:56.456
VENEZUELA, BECAUSE IT IS AN

05:56.456 --> 05:57.757
OPPORTUNITY, AND I THINK THEY

05:57.757 --> 05:59.459
VIEW RUSSIA VERY MUCH THIS WAY.

05:59.459 --> 06:01.795
RUSSIA HAS ENERGY, CHINA NEEDS

06:01.795 --> 06:04.497
ENERGY, AND CHINA HAS NOW VERY,

06:04.497 --> 06:07.234
IS VERY KEEN TO BOTH SORT OF

06:07.234 --> 06:08.268
CONSOLIDATE THE RELATIONSHIP

06:08.268 --> 06:10.870
WITH PUTIN, GIVE HIM LOANS, MAKE

06:10.870 --> 06:12.239
OIL AND GAS DEALS.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.341
THEY SIGNED SOME DEALS FOR

06:14.341 --> 06:17.677
WEAPONS AND NEW S 400 MISSILE

06:17.677 --> 06:19.379
THAT RUSSIA IS NOW SELLING TO

06:19.379 --> 06:19.546
CHINA.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.414
SO THINGS ARE GETTING MUCH, MUCH

06:21.414 --> 06:23.683
CLOSER THAN THEY WERE BEFORE.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.752
>> EXPAND ON THE MILITARY

06:25.752 --> 06:26.486
RELATIONSHIP AS WELL.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.021
WHEN THESE TWO COUNTRIES DECIDE

06:28.021 --> 06:30.257
TO ALIGN, THERE IS THAT, NOT

06:30.257 --> 06:32.525
JUST AN ENEMY, A SPECIFIC ENEMY

06:32.525 --> 06:34.628
BUT AS LARGE THE EUROPEAN UNION

06:34.628 --> 06:36.062
AND THE UNITED STATES AND THE

06:36.062 --> 06:38.298
WEST SEEM TO BE IN A DIFFERENT

06:38.298 --> 06:41.101
CAMP, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF

06:41.101 --> 06:42.469
RUSSIA'S INTERVENTION IN THE

06:42.469 --> 06:42.702
UKRAINE.

06:42.702 --> 06:46.473
>> WELL, MILITARILY SPEAKING,

06:46.473 --> 06:49.609
THE WEST HAS NEVER SOLD ANY

06:49.609 --> 06:50.977
AMOUNT OF WEAPONRY TO CHINA.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.446
IT IS ALMOST ALL COMES FROM

06:53.446 --> 06:53.680
RUSSIA.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.383
SO THERE, ADVANCED FIGHTER JETS,

06:56.383 --> 06:58.351
THEIR MISSILE SYSTEMS, AVIONICS,

06:58.351 --> 06:59.786
THINGS LIKE THAT HAVE LARGELY

06:59.786 --> 07:01.821
COME FROM RUSSIA AND SOME FROM

07:01.821 --> 07:03.056
ISRAEL, NOW THEY ARE REALLY

07:03.056 --> 07:05.191
BEEFING UP THIS RELATIONSHIP,

07:05.191 --> 07:06.159
AND EACH HAS SOMETHING TO GIVE

07:06.159 --> 07:09.095
TO THE OTHER AND THEY SHARE

07:09.095 --> 07:09.863
5,000-MILE BORDER.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.364
THERE IS TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

07:11.364 --> 07:12.866
TRADE IN NATURAL RESOURCES

07:12.866 --> 07:14.834
COMING FROM RUSSIA AND CHINA SO

07:14.834 --> 07:16.136
THERE IS KIND OF A NATURAL

07:16.136 --> 07:17.137
SYMMETRY THERE.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.938
MORE THAN THAT THERE ALSO IS A

07:18.938 --> 07:21.041
PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMMETRY, BOTH

07:21.041 --> 07:23.610
FEEL THEY WERE BIG EMPIRES THAT

SOME OF THESE STREETS, YOU

08:56.469 --> 08:58.071
BETTER NOT WALK DOWN.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.005
OUT OF EVERYBODY THAT I GREW UP

08:59.005 --> 09:02.175
WITH, LET'S SEE, I CAN COUNT

09:02.175 --> 09:03.476
PROBABLY ABOUT FIVE OF THEM

09:09.516 --> 09:11.885
HIS FATHER HAD DIED, HIS MOM HAD

09:11.885 --> 09:13.920

09:20.894 --> 09:22.061
THING HE COULD SEE TO MAKE

09:22.061 --> 09:24.030
ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY THE BILLS.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.274
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

09:42.916 --> 09:43.983

10:27.694 --> 10:29.395

10:29.395 --> 10:31.564
COMPOUNDED BY A LEGACY OF RACISM

14:18.057 --> 14:19.392
THAT, THAT THEY'LL GET CAUGHT UP

14:19.392 --> 14:20.593
AND THEY WON'T BE AMBITIOUS AND

14:20.593 --> 14:21.761
THEY WON'T... SO, THAT'S WHY,

14:21.761 --> 14:22.795
WHEN THEY CAME HOME, IT WAS

14:22.795 --> 14:23.696
ALWAYS, "WASH YOUR HANDS, GET A

14:23.696 --> 14:24.464
SNACK, HOMEWORK."

14:24.464 --> 14:25.331
ALWAYS.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.275

14:37.710 --> 14:38.644

16:19.679 --> 16:21.681

16:21.681 --> 16:23.516
NOT THE HARDEST PART OF THIS;

16:23.516 --> 16:25.785

21:14.607 --> 21:15.774
BENEFITING FROM THE CURRENT

21:15.774 --> 21:16.842
FORMULA WANTS TO LEAVE IT LIKE

21:16.842 --> 21:18.777
IT IS, EVERYBODY THAT'S NOT

21:18.777 --> 21:22.248
BENEFITING WANTS TO CHANGE IT,

21:22.248 --> 21:24.250
AND YOU CAN FLIP IT EITHER WAY.

21:24.250 --> 21:24.950
THE DISTRICTS WILL SAY THEY

21:24.950 --> 21:25.851
DON'T BELIEVE IN OUR CURRENT

21:25.851 --> 21:27.253
DISTRIBUTION MODEL, THEY SAY

21:27.253 --> 21:28.721
THAT IT'S FLAWED; THEY'VE TAKEN

21:28.721 --> 21:30.623
THE STATE TO COURT AND SAID THE

21:30.623 --> 21:31.690
DISTRIBUTION MODEL IS NOT

21:31.690 --> 21:32.625
APPROPRIATE.

21:32.625 --> 21:33.359
>> Reporter: AS ALL INVOLVED

21:33.359 --> 21:34.193
WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE COURT WILL

21:34.193 --> 21:36.295
DECIDE, AUSTIN'S TEACHERS WATCH

21:36.295 --> 21:38.197
THEIR CITY GROW UP AROUND THEM

21:38.197 --> 21:39.465
AND FEAR THEY'LL BE PRICED OUT

21:39.465 --> 21:40.933
OF THE PROSPERITY.

21:40.933 --> 21:43.702
>> IF YOU MAKE MORE MONEY IN

21:43.702 --> 21:45.771
AUSTIN BUT YOU TURN AROUND AND

21:45.771 --> 21:47.673
HAND IT OVER TO YOUR LANDLORD

21:47.673 --> 21:50.342
YOU'RE LEFT WITH A VERY LEAN

21:50.342 --> 21:51.477
BUDGET.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.078
ELSEWHERE IN THE STATE THAT SAME

21:53.078 --> 21:55.514
SALARY GOES A LOT FURTHER

21:55.514 --> 21:56.849
BECAUSE THE CHECK YOU WRITE TO

21:56.849 --> 21:58.050
THE LANDLORD IS A WHOLE LOT

21:58.050 --> 21:58.551
SMALLER.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.786
>> TEACHERS ARE ALREADY USED TO

22:00.786 --> 22:02.721
LIVING ON A SHOESTRING.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.089
I DON'T OWN ANY CLOTHING THAT I

22:04.089 --> 22:05.524
DIDN'T GET FROM A THRIFT STORE

22:05.524 --> 22:07.526
AND NEITHER DO MY KIDS.

22:07.526 --> 22:08.727
WE KNOW HOW TO DO IT ON THE

22:08.727 --> 22:09.395
CHEAP.

22:09.395 --> 22:11.463
WE CAN'T DO IT ON THE NOTHING.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.335
THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:16.335 --> 22:17.603
SATURDAY.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.442
>> Sreenivasan: FROM ENGLAND,

22:23.442 --> 22:24.944
WORD TONIGHT OF PROGRESS BY

22:24.944 --> 22:26.212
SCIENTISTS TRYING TO DESIGN

22:26.212 --> 22:27.613
CUSTOMIZED TREATMENTS FOR

22:27.613 --> 22:29.582
CANCER, SPECIFICALLY TAILORED

22:29.582 --> 22:31.083
TREATMENTS BASED ON THE MAKEUP

22:31.083 --> 22:32.785
OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S TUMOR.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.453
ITV'S SCIENCE EDITOR TOM CLARK

22:34.453 --> 22:35.854
VISITED A LABORATORY AND MET

22:35.854 --> 22:36.755
WITH RESEARCHERS.

22:36.755 --> 22:39.191
HE HAS THE LATEST.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.926
>> INSIDE THE COZY CONFINES OF

22:40.926 --> 22:43.629
THIS INCUBATOR, HUMAN CELLS ARE

22:43.629 --> 22:45.064
GROWING.

22:45.064 --> 22:46.599
BUT THEY ARE NOT ANY OLD CELLS.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.000
THEY HAVE BEEN SPECIALLY GROWN

22:48.000 --> 22:51.003
FROM TUMORS DONATED BY 20 COLON

22:51.003 --> 22:53.372
CANCER PATIENTS AND WHAT IS

22:53.372 --> 22:54.773
REMARKABLE IS HOW THEY HAVE BEEN

22:54.773 --> 22:56.875
PERSUADED TO GROW INTO A

22:56.875 --> 22:58.244
MINIATURE VERSION OF THE

22:58.244 --> 23:00.179
ORIGINAL TUMOR.

23:00.179 --> 23:01.647
THESE AREN'T JUST CANCER CELLS

23:01.647 --> 23:03.182
SITTING IN A DISH.

23:03.182 --> 23:04.917
THEY ARE IN ESSENCE A REAL

23:04.917 --> 23:07.486
PATIENT'S TUMOR, NURTURED IN THE

23:07.486 --> 23:09.521
LABORATORY BECAUSE THEY HAVE ALL

23:09.521 --> 23:10.889
THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

23:10.889 --> 23:14.226
DEADLY CANCER INSIDE THEIR BODY.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.562
BY DOING THIS IN THIS WAY, THE

23:16.562 --> 23:19.031
RESEARCHERS CAN EXPLOIT EACH OF

23:19.031 --> 23:21.233
ITS INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS AND

23:21.233 --> 23:22.401
WEAKNESSES.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.136
IT IS A STEP TOWARDS

23:24.136 --> 23:27.239
PERSONALIZED CANCER TREATMENT.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.107
>> YOU CAN HAVE TEN DIFFERENT

23:28.107 --> 23:29.241
PATIENTS IN A ROOM AND GIVE

23:29.241 --> 23:30.943
THEM ALL THE SAME TREATMENT, AND

23:30.943 --> 23:31.744
THEY WILL ALL RESPOND VERY

23:31.744 --> 23:33.012
DIFFERENTLY, AND A LOT OF

23:33.012 --> 23:35.014
THIS COMES DOWN TO THE VARIATION

23:35.014 --> 23:36.448
IN EACH OF THE TUMORS THAT THE

23:36.448 --> 23:37.650
PATIENTS HAVE.

23:37.650 --> 23:39.084
>> IN THIS LATEST RESEARCH, THE

23:39.084 --> 23:40.986
TEAM HERE SCREEN THEIR CANCER

23:40.986 --> 23:43.689
ORGANS AGAINST 83 EXISTING

23:43.689 --> 23:45.691
AND EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.559
IT SHOWED THE LAB-GROWN CANCERS

23:47.559 --> 23:49.194
BEHAVED THE SAME AS THEIR REAL-

23:49.194 --> 23:52.097
LIFE COUNTERPARTS AND ALSO INTO

23:52.097 --> 23:54.233
THE POTENTIAL NEW TREATMENTS FOR

23:54.233 --> 23:56.835
SOME COLON CANCER TYPES.

23:56.835 --> 23:58.037
APPLIED MORE WIDELY, THE

23:58.037 --> 23:59.672
TECHNIQUE COULD BE A GOLD MINE

23:59.672 --> 24:01.273
FOR DRUG DISCOVERY.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.475
THE DAYS OF TRULY INDIVIDUAL

24:03.475 --> 24:05.411
CANCER TREATMENT ARE NOT QUITE

24:05.411 --> 24:07.446
UPON US, BUT THEY ARE COMING

24:07.446 --> 24:08.814
FAST.

24:23.262 --> 24:24.029
>> Sreenivasan: SOME MORE NEWS

24:24.029 --> 24:25.030
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU TONIGHT:

24:25.030 --> 24:26.398
IRAQI OFFICIALS NOW CONFIRM THAT

24:26.398 --> 24:28.767
ISIS WAS BEHIND THAT PRISON RIOT

24:28.767 --> 24:30.369
NORTH OF BAGHDAD TODAY THAT LED

24:30.369 --> 24:31.403
TO THE ESCAPE OF CONVICTED

24:31.403 --> 24:32.237
TERRORISTS.

24:32.237 --> 24:33.839
DOZENS DIED DURING THE INCIDENT.

24:33.839 --> 24:35.474
AND STORMY WEATHER HAS LED TO

24:35.474 --> 24:36.642
THE CANCELLATION OF MORE THAN

24:36.642 --> 24:38.377
140 FLIGHTS INTO AND OUT OF

24:38.377 --> 24:39.545
DALLAS TODAY.

24:39.545 --> 24:41.347
WE'LL BE BACK HERE AT KLRU IN

24:41.347 --> 24:42.948
AUSTIN AGAIN TOMORROW NIGHT.

24:42.948 --> 24:44.083
I'M HARI SREENIVASAN.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.184
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
