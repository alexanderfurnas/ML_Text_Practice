GWEN IFILL: The earth rumbled
today in North
Korea with a big bang that shook
capitals

00:04.771 --> 00:10.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around the world. The communist
regime declared
it had carried out a
thermonuclear explosion,

00:10.177 --> 00:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which, if it turns out to be
true, would represent
a quantum leap beyond anything
it's managed

00:16.183 --> 00:17.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

00:17.551 --> 00:23.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The nuclear news was trumpeted
on North Korean
state television.

00:23.790 --> 00:30.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
first hydrogen
bomb test was successfully
conducted at 10:00

00:30.797 --> 00:33.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on January 6, 2016.

00:33.200 --> 00:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: State TV also showed
photos of
the North Korean leader, Kim
Jong-un, signing

00:40.007 --> 00:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
orders for what it called a
hydrogen bomb
test. But the announcement
broadcast on big

00:47.080 --> 00:53.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
screens in the capital,
Pyongyang, was quickly
condemned around the world,
especially in

00:53.186 --> 00:55.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
China, the North's last major
ally.

00:55.822 --> 00:58.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HUA CHUNYING, Spokeswoman,
Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs (through
translator): Today,

00:58.792 --> 01:03.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea carried out a
nuclear bomb test
once again, despite the
international community's

01:03.497 --> 01:08.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
objections. The Chinese
government firmly
opposes this. To fulfill
denuclearization,

01:08.835 --> 01:15.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nuclear nonproliferation, peace
and stability
on the Korean Peninsula is
China's firm stance.

01:15.642 --> 01:21.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Whether it was
really a hydrogen
bomb was also widely questioned,
especially

01:21.081 --> 01:23.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in neighboring South Korea.

01:23.116 --> 01:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE CHEOL-WOO, South Korean
National Assembly
(through translator): Judging
from the measurements,

01:25.585 --> 01:29.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it probably falls short of being
a hydrogen
bomb, although North Korea
claims it is a

01:29.656 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hydrogen bomb.

01:31.525 --> 01:35.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In Washington, White
House spokesman
Josh Earnest said the U.S. is
skeptical too.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
The initial analysis that's been
conducted

01:38.732 --> 01:43.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the events that were reported
overnight
is not consistent with North
Korean claims

01:43.837 --> 01:49.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of hydrogen bomb test. There's
nothing that's
occurred in the last 24 hours
that's caused

01:49.743 --> 01:54.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the United States government to
change our
assessment of North Korea's
technical and

01:54.748 --> 01:56.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
military capabilities.

01:56.483 --> 02:00.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Meanwhile, Japan's
government
immediately sent an aircraft out
to collect

02:01.021 --> 02:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
air particles for radiation
analysis.

02:04.558 --> 02:09.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A working hydrogen bomb would be
hundreds
of times more powerful than what
North Korea

02:09.496 --> 02:16.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
detonated in three earlier
underground tests.
And, if miniaturized, it might
fit on a missile,

02:16.436 --> 02:19.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the communist regime claims.

02:19.306 --> 02:25.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pyongyang has long sought to
develop missiles
that could reach the Western
United States.

02:25.112 --> 02:30.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Security Council
branded the test
a clear threat to international
peace and

02:30.150 --> 02:34.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
security and it pledged to
pursue additional
sanctions.

02:34.721 --> 02:36.656 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon:

02:36.690 --> 02:40.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAN KI-MOON, United Nations
Secretary-General:
This act is profoundly
destabilizing for regional

02:40.994 --> 02:49.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
security and seriously
undermines international
nonproliferation efforts. I
condemn it unequivocally.

02:49.836 --> 02:55.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And U.S.
presidential candidates
weighed in, with Democrat
Hillary Clinton

02:55.342 --> 03:01.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calling for new sanctions as
well, and Republican
Ted Cruz saying the test showed
the folly

03:01.114 --> 03:03.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of failed Democratic policies.

03:03.650 --> 03:08.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A number of sanctions are
already in place
against North Korea, an isolated
nation with

03:08.321 --> 03:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than 12 million people
living in extreme
poverty.

03:12.692 --> 03:17.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will examine North Korea's
claims about
today's test, and what it all
means, after

03:17.564 --> 03:18.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the news summary.
