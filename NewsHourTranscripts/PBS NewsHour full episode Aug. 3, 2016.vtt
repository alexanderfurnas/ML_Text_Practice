GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.207 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:08.876 --> 00:11.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Republicans
reach for the reset button.

00:11.411 --> 00:17.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's unconventional
campaign's missteps
frustrate a GOP trying to keep
the focus on

00:17.217 --> 00:19.052 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

00:19.086 --> 00:23.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday,
I sit down with WikiLeaks
founder Julian Assange

00:23.657 --> 00:29.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk about the coming release
of more confidential
material on the Democratic Party
and Hillary

00:29.930 --> 00:31.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton's campaign.

00:31.298 --> 00:34.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JULIAN ASSANGE, Founder,
WikiLeaks: It's a
wide range of materials.

00:34.268 --> 00:36.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It covers a number of important
issues.

00:36.403 --> 00:42.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Plus: the enduring
nature of jellyfish
-- why these unusual creatures
are thriving

00:42.576 --> 00:44.945 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a world increasingly damaged
by humans.

00:44.978 --> 00:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN BAILEY, New England
Aquarium: They
seem to be capable of doing
things physiologically

00:50.350 --> 00:55.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can't be described by their
body plan,
by the structures that they
possess.

00:55.789 --> 00:59.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:59.660 --> 01:03.797 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:03.830 --> 01:16.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The presidential
campaign was
dominated today by reports that
Donald Trump

01:16.176 --> 01:19.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is taking on water, and may need
a rescue.

01:19.313 --> 01:23.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump brushed aside all talk of
internal division,
and of growing defections.

01:23.183 --> 01:25.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have a full report right
after the
news summary.

01:25.886 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: President
Obama commuted the prison
sentences of 214

01:31.525 --> 01:35.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal inmates, almost all of
them nonviolent
drug offenders.

01:35.762 --> 01:40.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House said it's the
largest number
of commutations in a single day
since at least

01:40.968 --> 01:42.736 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1900.

01:42.769 --> 01:47.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is also part of president's
effort to address
sentencing rules that he
considers overly

01:47.607 --> 01:49.443 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
harsh.

01:49.476 --> 01:53.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Kansas Congressman
Tim Huelskamp,
a Tea Party favorite, has lost
his Republican

01:53.080 --> 01:54.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
primary battle.

01:54.982 --> 01:59.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During his three terms in
office, he had feuded
repeatedly with GOP leaders, and
it cost him

01:59.086 --> 02:01.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his seat on the House
Agriculture Committee.

02:01.855 --> 02:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That boosted challenger Roger
Marshall, who
won 57 percent of the vote on
Tuesday.

02:06.927 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There is
reporting today that
the U.S. organized an airlift of
$400 million

02:12.899 --> 02:15.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in cash to Iran last January.

02:16.003 --> 02:21.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It came just as Tehran released
several jailed
Americans, and as the nuclear
agreement was

02:21.608 --> 02:23.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
being implemented.

02:23.343 --> 02:28.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Wall Street Journal reports
the money
was part of settling a disputed
1970s arms

02:28.682 --> 02:30.050 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
deal.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans called it ransom,
but the White
House rejected that.

02:32.686 --> 02:36.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
This all came to a head at the
same time because

02:36.957 --> 02:39.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we were addressing and resolving
longstanding
concerns with Iranian behavior.

02:39.760 --> 02:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The United States, under
President Obama,
has not paid a ransom to secure
the release

02:46.266 --> 02:48.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Americans unjustly detained
in Iran.

02:48.135 --> 02:50.003 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're not going to pay a
ransom.

02:50.037 --> 02:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Officials say the
payment had
to be made in cash because
international sanctions

02:54.341 --> 02:57.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on Iran barred any other
transfer method.

02:57.577 --> 03:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A U.N. commission
reports Islamic
State fighters in Syria are
still holding

03:02.349 --> 03:06.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thousands of minority Yazidis as
sex slaves
or fighters.

03:06.319 --> 03:09.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were captured two years ago
at Sinjar
in Iraq.

03:09.456 --> 03:14.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands more fled the city,
but the militants
killed 5,000 Yazidi men.

03:14.494 --> 03:17.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That, in part, prompted U.S.
airstrikes against
ISIS.

03:17.964 --> 03:22.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For the first
time, a U.S.
law enforcement officer is
facing federal

03:22.035 --> 03:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism charges for allegedly
trying to
aid ISIS.

03:26.073 --> 03:31.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A transit policeman in
Washington, Nicholas
Young, was charged today.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The FBI says he wanted to help
the group buy
mobile messaging apps.

03:34.848 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: North Korea drew new
condemnation
today for firing a ballistic
missile that

03:39.820 --> 03:41.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
landed in Japanese waters.

03:41.988 --> 03:47.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The missile flew more than 600
miles, and
part of it splashed down within
200 miles

03:47.260 --> 03:49.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Japan's coastline.

03:49.129 --> 03:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That prompted the U.N. Security
Council to
meet in emergency session this
afternoon in

03:53.300 --> 03:55.102 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York.

03:55.135 --> 03:58.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Eastern
Ukraine, new signs
of escalating combat between
Russian-backed

03:58.705 --> 04:01.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rebels and Ukrainian government
troops.

04:01.475 --> 04:06.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. human rights officials say
the casualties
in June were the highest in
nearly a year.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is despite peace accords
that called
for withdrawing heavy weapons.

04:10.917 --> 04:16.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Three hundred people
escaped with
their lives today in a
spectacular plane crash

04:16.156 --> 04:17.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Dubai.

04:17.924 --> 04:21.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were on an Emirates flight
from India
that slammed down on the runway
as it tried

04:21.928 --> 04:23.230 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to land.

04:23.263 --> 04:28.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The passengers got out just
before the plane
burst into flames.

04:28.401 --> 04:38.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: While landing, I think the
engine or
something burned, so the smoke
was coming

04:38.445 --> 04:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: While landing, I think the
engine or
something burned, so the smoke
was coming

04:43.984 --> 04:44.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
inside.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, immediately, they asked us
to evacuate.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we have escaped from the
emergency exit,
so we were jumping down.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One firefighter died
battling
the blaze, and traffic was
stopped for several

04:49.689 --> 04:51.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hours, but later returned to
normal.

04:51.591 --> 04:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the state
of Alabama refused parole for
Thomas Blanton

04:56.163 --> 05:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jr. in the murder of four young
black girls
half-a-century ago.

05:00.700 --> 05:06.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They died when Ku Klux Klansman
bombed their
Birmingham church in 1963.

05:06.339 --> 05:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Blanton was convicted in 2000
and sentenced
to life in prison, after the FBI
reopened

05:12.279 --> 05:14.080 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the case.

05:14.114 --> 05:17.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: The Obama
administration warned
Congress today that it will run
out of money

05:17.284 --> 05:20.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to fight the Zika virus by
month's end.

05:20.220 --> 05:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The warning came as government
researchers
said they have begun their first
clinical

05:24.391 --> 05:26.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
trial of a vaccine.

05:26.393 --> 05:32.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far, Congress has deadlocked
on the president's
request for $1.9 billion in
emergency spending.

05:32.432 --> 05:36.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Wall Street
managed to
break a losing streak today.

05:36.036 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 41
points to close at 18355.

05:42.042 --> 05:46.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 22 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added six.

05:46.546 --> 05:52.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Donald Trump
picks another fight with GOP
leadership; WikiLeaks

05:52.352 --> 05:58.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
founder Julian Assange on leaks
that target
the Democratic Party; why
jellyfish are filling

05:58.792 --> 06:02.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the oceans; and much more.

06:03.029 --> 06:16.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It has been a
whirlwind day for
the Trump campaign, which is now
in full damage

06:16.376 --> 06:18.144 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
control.

06:18.178 --> 06:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Lisa Desjardins reports, the
Republican
ticket is working to get back on
the offensive.

06:21.948 --> 06:27.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The assurances
came from
Donald Trump himself in Daytona
Beach, Florida.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The campaign is doing really
well.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's never been so well-united.

06:32.525 --> 06:38.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say, right now, it's the
best, in
terms of being united, than it's
been since

06:38.131 --> 06:39.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we began.

06:39.933 --> 06:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And more
affirmation came
from Paul Manafort, the man now
running Trump's

06:43.937 --> 06:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaign, during a FOX News
interview.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT, Trump Convention
Manager: The
campaign is focused.

06:47.941 --> 06:51.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The campaign is moving forward
in a positive
way.

06:51.044 --> 06:54.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only need we have for
interventions is
maybe with some media types who
keep saying

06:54.681 --> 06:56.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things that aren't true.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This after a
swirl of stories
looking at doubts within
Republican ranks

07:00.320 --> 07:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about Trump, and at possible
divisions within
the Trump campaign.

07:05.225 --> 07:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This morning, Trump ally and
former House
Speaker Newt Gingrich said the
candidate needs

07:09.296 --> 07:11.164 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to recalibrate.

07:11.197 --> 07:12.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH (R), Former
Speaker of the House:
I think some of what Trump has
done is just

07:12.465 --> 07:14.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very self-destructive.

07:14.334 --> 07:18.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And, last
night, Hewlett-Packard
CEO Meg Whitman, a major
fund-raiser, told

07:18.505 --> 07:23.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times that she's
voting for Democrat
Hillary Clinton, becoming one of
the highest-profile

07:23.843 --> 07:25.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republicans to do so.

07:26.012 --> 07:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also today, it was widely
reported that some
high-level Republicans,
including party Chairman

07:30.517 --> 07:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Reince Priebus, may meet with
the nominee
soon to talk about his approach
-- all this

07:35.955 --> 07:40.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
after a Washington Post
interview in which
Trump jumped between topics and
refused to

07:41.027 --> 07:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endorse House Speaker Paul Ryan
and Senator
John McCain, that on top of
Trump's weekend

07:46.933 --> 07:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interview with ABC News which
sparked controversy
about whether he thinks Russian
forces are

07:52.372 --> 07:57.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Ukraine, and about his
pushing back at
the Khan family, who lost their
son in the

07:57.644 --> 07:59.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
line of duty in Iraq.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Today, some damage control.

08:01.781 --> 08:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During a phone interview with
FOX News, Trump's
running mate, Indiana Governor
Mike Pence,

MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
I talked to Donald Trump this
morning about

08:11.324 --> 08:14.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my support for Paul Ryan, our
longtime friendship.

08:14.127 --> 08:17.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He strongly encouraged me to
endorse Paul
Ryan in next Tuesday's primary,
and I'm pleased

08:17.664 --> 08:19.532 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do it.

08:19.566 --> 08:24.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The swirling
splinters on
the right are fast fuel for
Trump's opposition.

LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South

have the temperament or judgment
to control

08:31.311 --> 08:32.278 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

MARCO RUBIO (R), Florida: We're
about to turn
over the nuclear codes of the
United States

08:34.814 --> 08:36.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to an erratic individual.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As for Hillary
Clinton herself,
she spent today in Colorado.

08:39.152 --> 08:43.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
And I'm thrilled to have this
chance to visit.

08:43.123 --> 08:47.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: While her
running mate, Virginia
Senator Tim Kaine, introduced
himself to North

08:47.694 --> 08:50.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carolina voters, talking up

08:52.399 --> 08:54.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
As we are looking at economic
plans, and I'm

08:54.768 --> 08:59.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out basically talking about
jobs, that we
focus on the growth of small
businesses.

08:59.639 --> 09:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: North Carolina
is a key battleground,
so, no coincidence, it's where
Mike Pence

09:04.978 --> 09:06.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will campaign tomorrow.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Lisa joins me at
the table
now.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, you have been talking to
folks all day
long.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Give me a sense.

09:13.119 --> 09:17.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How concerned really are
mainstream rank-and-file
Republicans about the state of
the campaign?

09:17.724 --> 09:20.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, one of
the questions
is, what is a mainstream
Republican these

09:20.293 --> 09:21.261 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days?

09:21.294 --> 09:22.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Right.

09:22.662 --> 09:24.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But I can say
Republican
leadership is concerned.

09:24.497 --> 09:28.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A high-level Republican Party
source told
me that Republican Party
Chairman Reince Priebus

09:28.668 --> 09:31.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is -- quote -- "furious" with
Donald Trump.

09:31.371 --> 09:35.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are not words that are
thrown around
in such a place.

09:35.575 --> 09:39.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a problem for Donald
Trump, because
he needs the RNC's operation to
get out the

09:39.512 --> 09:40.480 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.282 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Usually, candidates do.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also, calling members of
Congress -- we now
have more members of Congress
coming out and

09:44.517 --> 09:47.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying openly they are not
voting for Trump.

09:47.487 --> 09:51.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania, I
talked to
him on the phone extensively
today, and also

09:51.224 --> 09:52.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen.

09:52.926 --> 09:57.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, those are two very
significant members,
not just because they're
Republicans, but

09:57.130 --> 09:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're Republicans from swing
states that
Donald Trump wants.

09:59.599 --> 10:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But Trump came out
today and said
that the party is as united as
ever before.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do his supporters say?

10:04.537 --> 10:06.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

10:06.339 --> 10:07.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you talk to Donald Trump
supporters -- I
talked to one, the chairman of
his campaign

10:08.007 --> 10:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in South Carolina, Ed McMullen.

10:09.843 --> 10:14.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says this is all a complete
disconnect,
that the Washington Republican
establishment

10:14.080 --> 10:16.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't get what's happening on
the ground.

10:16.282 --> 10:20.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says Trump voters and the
voters they want
aren't talking about the Khan
family.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're thinking about their own
vacations.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're thinking about their own
jobs.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said he doesn't think
this is a long-term
hit for Donald Trump.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And yet he's doing
pretty well
in the money department this
month.

10:29.996 --> 10:31.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes, big news
from the Trump
campaign.

10:31.764 --> 10:34.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They raised $80 million in the
last month.

10:34.667 --> 10:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a little bit below the
Clinton toll,
which was $90 million, but it's
a huge improvement.

10:38.538 --> 10:41.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It shows that the Trump
campaign, along with
the RNC, can raise money.

10:41.908 --> 10:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK, Lisa Desjardins,
thank you.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Pleasure.

10:44.777 --> 10:48.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on the
splinters within
the Grand Old Party, we are
joined by Charlie

10:48.848 --> 10:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sykes, conservative talk show
host and editor
in chief of the Web site
RightWisconsin.com,

10:54.220 --> 10:57.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and Matthew Dowd, chief
political analyst
for ABC News.

10:57.056 --> 11:02.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is a former adviser to the
Republican National
Committee, and, in 2004, served
as President

11:02.328 --> 11:04.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
George W. Bush's chief
strategist.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to you, gentlemen.

11:07.166 --> 11:08.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Charlie Sykes, you're in
Wisconsin.

11:08.968 --> 11:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard, saw what happened
today with Paul
Ryan, Mike Pence going one way,
Donald Trump

11:14.340 --> 11:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going the other way, and Reince
Priebus caught
in the middle.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Should there be -- the word we
keep hearing
is intervention.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Should there be an intervention
under way?

11:22.815 --> 11:25.552 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
CHARLIE SYKES,
RightWisconsin.com: Yes, we
got to give credit to Matthew
Dowd because

11:25.585 --> 11:27.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he actually tweeted that out,
that it was
time for an intervention.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

11:28.588 --> 11:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SYKES: Yes, absolutely.

11:30.323 --> 11:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you have to understand is
that they were
trying to make a play for
Wisconsin.

11:33.459 --> 11:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reince Priebus, of course, is
the key to all
of.

11:36.195 --> 11:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was the one who brokered
the deal with
Ryan and Trump and got Scott
Walker to flip-flop

11:40.567 --> 11:42.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on all of this.

11:42.468 --> 11:47.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then Mike Pence is the
bridge to conservatives
in Wisconsin, where Donald Trump
has not done

11:47.974 --> 11:49.742 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

11:49.776 --> 11:54.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what did Donald Trump do
yesterday but
come right behind Mike Pence and
blow up that

11:54.347 --> 11:56.115 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bridge.

11:56.149 --> 12:02.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, obviously, you have this
sense that this
campaign is a dumpster fire
inside a nuclear

12:02.255 --> 12:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
meltdown, and they absolutely
need an intervention.

12:05.825 --> 12:09.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happened in Wisconsin,
where Donald
Trump is coming here on Friday,
and he's coming

12:09.662 --> 12:14.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
into very, very hostile
territory, almost
no leading Republican will be at
that rally,

12:14.467 --> 12:17.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and at some point, they're going
to have to
do a reset of some kind.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But -- Matthew Dowd,
but we saw
the fund-raising numbers.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's still doing well in some
situations.

12:23.309 --> 12:26.179 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We heard him today talk about
unity.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So where is he really?

12:27.614 --> 12:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this just people who never
liked him not
liking him anymore?

12:30.283 --> 12:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD, ABC News: Well,
this is less
U.S. Constitution and more
Articles of Confederation

12:34.654 --> 12:36.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
type of unity in the course of
this.

12:36.623 --> 12:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I don't see any unity at
this point
in time.

12:39.225 --> 12:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you get the sense that
there's a whole
bunch of Republicans.

12:42.195 --> 12:43.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can't force him off the
ballot.

12:43.663 --> 12:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is going to win.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there is a more of a
chance -- and
to Charlie's team, there's more
of a chance

12:47.934 --> 12:52.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Milwaukee Brewers winning
the World
Series this year than Donald
Trump getting

12:52.672 --> 12:54.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
off the ballot in this case.

12:54.907 --> 12:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think what could happen is
Republican
Senate candidates, Republican
congressional

12:59.012 --> 13:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates begin to basically
design all their
campaigns completely separate
and apart from

13:03.549 --> 13:04.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

13:04.550 --> 13:05.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think this is a big concern.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It comes at the worst possible
time for Donald
Trump.

13:08.021 --> 13:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It comes in the aftermath of the
two conventions.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People thought this was going to
be a slow
period, but it really, Gwen,
sets up the tone

13:14.093 --> 13:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for what is going to happen in
the fall.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.731 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it puts him at a huge
disadvantage in
the course of.

13:18.765 --> 13:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I feel bad for Mike Pence.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump ought to call Mike
Pence the
janitor, because he spends most
of his time

13:23.836 --> 13:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cleaning up the mess that's left
in aisle
one, two, three, four, and five.

13:27.674 --> 13:30.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think he has got to
straighten this
out, but I don't know if Donald
Trump has

13:30.843 --> 13:32.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it in him to straighten out.

13:32.612 --> 13:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Charlie Sykes, take
the long view
here.

13:34.414 --> 13:39.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What has Donald Trump been doing
right and
what has he not been doing as
right since

13:39.218 --> 13:40.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his convention?

13:40.653 --> 13:43.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLIE SYKES: Well, he's been
getting a lot
of attention, hasn't he?

13:43.289 --> 13:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What he's been doing wrong is
almost everything.

13:45.692 --> 13:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the last six days, rather
than going after
Hillary Clinton, he's what?

13:48.628 --> 13:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's gone after the Gold Star
moms.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's lied about the NFL letter.

13:52.031 --> 13:56.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's thrown crying babies out of
his rally,
and he's picked fights with
prominent Republicans.

13:56.536 --> 13:59.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that what you're
having -- and
I think Matthew is absolutely
right -- in

13:59.205 --> 14:04.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the last 24, 48 hours, there is
this growing
recognition that, you know what,
it's not

14:04.277 --> 14:05.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going to happen.

14:05.244 --> 14:06.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's not going to pivot.

14:06.312 --> 14:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not going to grow up.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's not going to become more
presidential.

14:09.716 --> 14:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Republicans had been
talking themselves
into thinking, OK, you know,
Donald Trump

14:14.721 --> 14:19.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was one way during the primary,
but he's absolutely
assured us and Reince Priebus
has assured

14:19.625 --> 14:24.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us that he's going to change his
ways, he's
going to become more
responsible, and it can't

14:24.630 --> 14:25.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
get any worse.

14:25.965 --> 14:30.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, on a daily basis, it's
gotten worse
and worse and worse.

14:30.036 --> 14:34.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the stories that you're
seeing about the
disillusion in the Republican
Party are absolutely

14:34.907 --> 14:36.676 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
true.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the stories you're hearing
out of the
Trump campaign have the ring of
truth because

14:39.178 --> 14:41.547 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it doesn't look like he's
listening to somebody.

14:41.581 --> 14:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the question is, how does a
70-year-old
man change his temperament and
his character

14:47.186 --> 14:48.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and his judgment?

14:49.021 --> 14:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can change the positions and
the language
of a campaign, but how do you
become somebody

14:53.326 --> 14:55.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
different than who you are?

14:55.261 --> 14:59.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what we're seeing is
who Donald
Trump is, and it's very, very
frightening

14:59.198 --> 15:00.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a lot of Republicans right
now.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Matthew, we saw him
come out today,
for instance, and talk about the
secret, or

15:05.972 --> 15:10.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whatever it was, shipment of
money to Iran
and make the connection between
what he said

15:10.409 --> 15:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a deal that had been cut for
a bad deal
and how Iran had benefited from
that.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That seemed like it was sticking
to message.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he is not incapable of
sticking to message.

15:19.719 --> 15:22.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: No, he's not
incapable of it.

15:22.355 --> 15:27.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he seems incapable of
sticking to a message
for more than 15 minutes or more
than 30 minutes

15:27.093 --> 15:28.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the course of.

15:28.394 --> 15:30.062 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Presidential campaigns are
stories.

15:30.096 --> 15:32.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're long narratives,
multi-chaptered stories.

15:32.398 --> 15:36.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have to build each
chapter in order
to convince voters at the end of
the story

15:36.202 --> 15:38.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they need to go with you,
as opposed
to the opposition.

15:38.671 --> 15:42.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The thing I think that
frustrates Republicans
most -- and I will pick up on
something Charlie

15:42.642 --> 15:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said -- is the fact this is an
eminently winnable
race against Hillary Clinton.

15:47.280 --> 15:52.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for Donald Trump, Hillary
Clinton is the
most unpopular, most untrusted
person to run

15:52.051 --> 15:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for office in an open seat ever
for the presidency.

15:54.520 --> 15:59.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, she's running
against somebody
more untrusted at this time, and
more disliked

15:59.492 --> 16:01.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at this time.

16:01.327 --> 16:04.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think what's really
causing the huge
concern, is, wow, this is a race
that we could

16:04.764 --> 16:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have won, even with Donald
Trump.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The funny thing is, even with
Donald Trump
and all the mistakes, he's only
five or six

16:10.269 --> 16:14.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
points behind in this
environment against
a candidate like Hillary
Clinton.

16:14.140 --> 16:18.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if he keeps doing this and
can't stay
with a message longer than a
half-hour or

16:18.578 --> 16:23.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
longer than an hour, Hillary
Clinton is going
to win a race that in most years
she should

16:23.649 --> 16:25.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be unable to win.

16:25.284 --> 16:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Charlie Sykes, a
squandered opportunity
to go after Hillary Clinton?

16:28.087 --> 16:29.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SYKES: Yes, very much.

16:29.956 --> 16:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, one top Republican told
me last night,
you know, if Donald Trump after
the convention

16:34.460 --> 16:39.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had just gone off to a desert
island and had
said nothing, he probably would
be ahead in

16:39.198 --> 16:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the polls, that what you have
here is Trump
is defeating Trump.

16:44.470 --> 16:48.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that's what is so
frustrating, because
Hillary Clinton has actually had
a very, very

16:48.341 --> 16:50.076 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bad week.

16:50.109 --> 16:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet you wouldn't know it,
because Donald
Trump has really masked her
problems.

16:53.913 --> 16:57.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I think you have is,
you have Republicans
trying to talk themselves into
thinking things

16:57.984 --> 17:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will get better, but that is
obviously at
this point the triumph of hope
over experience.

17:02.989 --> 17:07.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that's why you
might see
in the next three or four days
more and more

17:07.126 --> 17:10.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans either withdraw
their support,
distance themselves.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know how many you are
going to have
say that they are going to vote
for Hillary

17:12.565 --> 17:14.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

17:14.433 --> 17:17.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But once that starts -- and I
don't know what
Matthew thinks about this -- I
get the sense

17:17.136 --> 17:22.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it might be a dam breaking, that
once you
have one prominent Republican
backing away,

17:22.141 --> 17:25.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that others are going to see
this as permission
to say, you know what, we do not
want to be

17:25.845 --> 17:27.580 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
part of this.

17:27.613 --> 17:32.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do not want to go down with
the anchor
of Donald Trump, because right
now it's not

17:32.151 --> 17:33.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just the presidency.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is all the down-ballot races.

17:35.421 --> 17:38.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think you have a
Republican Party that's
looking into the abyss if they
cannot get

17:38.858 --> 17:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump to clean up his
act.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Matthew, you can
answer that question,
but I also want to you to answer
this.

17:43.262 --> 17:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw Paul Manafort, the
campaign chairman,
for all intents and purposes,
today say that

17:49.068 --> 17:52.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the person running this campaign
is Donald
Trump, he's the one who is in
control.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that a good or a bad thing?

17:54.941 --> 17:57.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW DOWD: Well, a physician
shouldn't
be your own doctor.

17:57.176 --> 18:00.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have been involved in a
lot of campaigns
where candidates start out
thinking that they

18:00.379 --> 18:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
should be the one running the
campaign.

18:02.181 --> 18:06.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They pretty much figure out very
quickly that's
impossible and they're going to
run a bad

18:06.152 --> 18:07.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, candidates run the
worst campaigns
in the course of this, because
they don't

18:09.255 --> 18:12.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the objectivity to look at
it and see
what you need to do.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To answer Charlie's question, I
agree with
him.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think you could see that
coming.

18:17.496 --> 18:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the first sign of you
seeing that
coming is there will begin to be
Republicans

18:21.434 --> 18:25.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start voting and start saying
they're going
to vote for Gary Johnson, the
Libertarian,

18:25.404 --> 18:27.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the ballot.

18:27.239 --> 18:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are going to begin to
see Republicans
saying Gary Johnson ought to be
included in

18:30.409 --> 18:32.178 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the debates.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think -- as Charlie
said, I don't
think you will see a bunch of
Republicans

18:34.947 --> 18:39.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to Hillary Clinton, because
they think
that's as dissatisfactory a
choice as Donald

18:39.318 --> 18:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump is, but I can see a lot of
Republicans
deciding that Gary Johnson is
the best place

18:44.190 --> 18:46.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to go against Donald Trump.

18:46.225 --> 18:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Matthew Dowd and
Charlie Sykes,
another 24 hours, and perhaps we
will even

18:50.763 --> 18:51.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get another storyline.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both very much.

18:53.899 --> 18:57.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the record, we did try to
reach out to
the Trump campaign, and they
declined to provide

18:57.236 --> 18:58.204 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a spokesman.

18:58.237 --> 18:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But thank you both very much.

18:59.705 --> 19:04.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW DOWD: Thank you.

19:04.777 --> 19:09.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SYKES: Thank you.

19:09.815 --> 19:16.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: While the
Republican Party
has seen its share of conflicts
this week,

19:16.255 --> 19:20.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
recent events have also
unearthed discord
within the ranks of the
Democrats as well.

19:20.826 --> 19:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hacking of Democratic
National Committee
e-mails, experts say by the
Russian government,

19:26.465 --> 19:31.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the posting of e-mails on
WikiLeaks, led
to the resignation of DNC
Chairwoman Debbie

19:31.804 --> 19:37.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wasserman Schultz and other top
officials,
and exposed rifts within the
party.

19:37.209 --> 19:42.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the revelation also caused
speculation
about how WikiLeaks got them and
why they

19:42.314 --> 19:44.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
released them.

19:44.050 --> 19:48.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we decided to talk to Julian
Assange,
the founder of WikiLeaks, from
the Ecuadorian

19:48.554 --> 19:53.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Embassy in London, where he has
been holed
up for four years to avoid
extradition to

19:53.926 --> 19:54.894 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the U.S.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.830 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I spoke with him a short while
ago.

19:57.863 --> 19:59.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Julian Assange, welcome.

19:59.698 --> 20:05.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You said this week that
WikiLeaks is going
to be releasing more of the
information that

20:05.137 --> 20:09.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was hacked from the Democratic
National Committee
in different batches.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So when will the next batch
come?

20:11.110 --> 20:13.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JULIAN ASSANGE, Founder,
WikiLeaks: I'm afraid
I must correct you, Judy.

20:13.679 --> 20:19.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't say that we would be
releasing information
that has been hacked from the
DNC.

20:19.351 --> 20:26.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We said that we have a
significant amount
of information, and the
information itself

20:26.225 --> 20:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is significant, and it pertains
to Hillary
Clinton's campaign.

20:31.864 --> 20:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be releasing it in
several batches
as we are finished with the
journalistic work

20:38.471 --> 20:40.206 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on each batch.

20:40.239 --> 20:44.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, are you
saying this is
different from what was hacked
from the DNC

20:44.877 --> 20:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Democratic Congressional
Committee?

20:47.980 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE: You have DNC
leaks, which
is what we do, and you have DNC
hacks, which

20:53.419 --> 20:57.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is an issue that goes back
several years.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's been a lot of confusion,
which has
been pushed by the Hillary
Clinton campaign

21:00.759 --> 21:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try and confuse hacking of
the DNC by a
wide variety of actors over the
last two years,

21:07.099 --> 21:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and our publication of 20,000
e-mails from
the DNC.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me just
pursue that,
though.

21:15.407 --> 21:21.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of what WikiLeaks has,
you have said
you're analyzing the material
and you're looking

21:21.247 --> 21:28.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at which media partners to work
with to get
-- I think you said maximum
uptake from it.

21:28.053 --> 21:31.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you tell us anything tonight
about what's
in that material?

21:31.524 --> 21:34.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE: It's a wide
range of material.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It covers a number of important
issues.

21:36.762 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a variety of natural
batches and some
thematic constellations that
we're working

21:43.369 --> 21:46.138 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's interesting material.

21:48.307 --> 21:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done enough work now
that we are comfortable
with the material's
authenticity.

21:56.115 --> 22:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so now it's a matter of
completing the
format, layout to make it easy
and accessible

22:03.422 --> 22:10.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so that journalists can
easily extract
material from it, extract
stories from it,

22:10.763 --> 22:12.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and also the general public.

22:12.331 --> 22:16.168 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would you
consider a successful
outcome from all this?

22:16.202 --> 22:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that already four top
officials from
the Democratic National
Committee have resigned.

22:21.440 --> 22:27.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What would you consider the
successful outcome,
the most damage that could be
done from this?

22:27.780 --> 22:31.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, WikiLeaks
began 10 years.

22:31.116 --> 22:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take leaks, principally from
whistle-blowers,
of material that is of
diplomatic, political,

22:37.590 --> 22:41.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ethical or historical
significance, typically
about corruption or war.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we verify it.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we publish it and we write
analysis about
it.

22:45.998 --> 22:53.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we also engineer
globe-spanning media
collaborations in order to get
the best understanding

22:53.672 --> 22:55.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that material.

22:55.674 --> 23:01.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we place it in our library,
which is available
to everyone, has more than 10
million documents

23:01.547 --> 23:06.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in it now which we feel that
otherwise would
not have come before the public,
and that

23:06.252 --> 23:11.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
performs an ongoing role leading
to great
works in investigative
journalism, successful

23:11.857 --> 23:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court cases, civil litigation,
criminal process,
and, of course, also contributes
to public

23:20.199 --> 23:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understanding during the moments
of political
competition.

23:24.136 --> 23:29.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about
that, about the -- what you
consider a successful

23:29.475 --> 23:35.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outcome here, because we know
you have made
clear your strong feelings about
Hillary Clinton.

23:35.347 --> 23:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You wrote back in February --
and I'm quoting
now -- "She's a war hawk who
gets an unseemly

23:40.719 --> 23:43.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
emotional rush out of killing
people.

23:43.856 --> 23:47.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She shouldn't be let near a gun
shop, much
less an army.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She certainly shouldn't become
president."

23:49.528 --> 23:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, why shouldn't the
American people
assume there's a political
motive here?

23:54.199 --> 23:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, let's flip
it the other
way around.

23:57.069 --> 24:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's say that I personally, the
editor -- my
personal opinion is different to
my function

24:04.443 --> 24:05.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as an editor.

24:05.644 --> 24:09.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let's say that, personally,
I loved Hillary
Clinton.

24:09.581 --> 24:11.350 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Would WikiLeaks still publish
this material?

24:11.383 --> 24:12.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Of course it would.

24:12.751 --> 24:14.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, we would be censoring
it.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's our mandate.

24:16.455 --> 24:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's actually interesting to
think about what
media organizations wouldn't
publish such

24:22.294 --> 24:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
material if it was given to
them.

24:24.830 --> 24:26.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think that's a very
interesting question.

24:26.865 --> 24:34.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, my position, as an analyst
is that, yes,
that Hillary Clinton is a war
hawk.

24:34.506 --> 24:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the statement was made
within the context
of the early phases of the
Democratic primaries.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is by no means an endorsement
of Donald
Trump.

24:44.116 --> 24:47.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you still
would oppose
her becoming president, which is
what you

24:47.920 --> 24:49.888 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wrote?

24:49.922 --> 24:57.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, I -- my
personal analysis
is that, if you are concerned
about U.S. foreign

24:57.663 --> 25:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy and getting into foolish
wars, then
Hillary Clinton is not your
woman.

25:06.071 --> 25:09.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, I mean
neither is Donald
Trump.

25:09.775 --> 25:15.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, bottom line,
why shouldn't
the American people look at this
and say,

25:15.414 --> 25:19.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is an effort to undermine
the Clinton
campaign, the Democratic Party?

25:19.685 --> 25:27.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE: Well, I can
reveal to you
the source of the information
today.

25:27.126 --> 25:31.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The source of the information is
the Democratic
Party.

25:31.730 --> 25:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is Debbie Wasserman Schultz.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It is the chief financial
officer.

25:34.800 --> 25:40.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It is the communications
officer, Luis Miranda,
in fact all these people who
have just been

25:40.572 --> 25:47.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired, and another (INAUDIBLE)
so that's the
source of the information that's
known.

25:47.846 --> 25:52.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As to who the intermediaries
are, that's another
question.

25:52.785 --> 26:02.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's also a little bit
concerning to see the
sort of McCarthyist attempt to
frame Trump

26:02.361 --> 26:05.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as some kind of Russian
conspirator.

26:05.097 --> 26:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think both presidential
candidates are extremely
problematic.

26:09.868 --> 26:16.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a kind of McCarthyist
hysteria, trying
to depict one of the candidates
as somehow

26:16.909 --> 26:20.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a Manchurian Candidate, I think
is a bit disturbing.

26:20.946 --> 26:24.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then also a push for
journalists to reveal
their sources, as a journalist,
it's disgusting.

26:24.883 --> 26:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I wanted to
give you
a chance to say what you
believe, Julian Assange.

26:30.489 --> 26:34.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But WikiLeaks, we know, argues
for transparency.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's part of your very mission.

26:36.962 --> 26:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so isn't this an extension
of that, transparency
about where this explosive
material came from,

26:43.235 --> 26:44.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how it fell into your hands?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE: As I said, we
know exactly
where it came from.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It came from materials that were
just published.

26:49.675 --> 26:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know exactly where it came
from.

26:51.877 --> 26:53.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It came from the DNC.

26:53.779 --> 26:57.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're saying the
future batches
will be material from Debbie
Wasserman Schultz,

26:57.216 --> 26:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the former head of the DNC, and
others?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that -- am I hearing you
correctly?

27:01.420 --> 27:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE: No, we haven't
said what it
is precisely that we are going
to publish.

27:05.891 --> 27:07.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're working on it.

27:07.826 --> 27:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We obviously want it to be a bit
of a surprise,
because it encourages public
uptake and interest,

27:14.700 --> 27:18.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is what all -- all
material seeks.

27:18.103 --> 27:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Julian Assange,
we thank you
for talking with us.

27:24.243 --> 27:31.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIAN ASSANGE: Thank you, Judy.

27:31.750 --> 27:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now that they have
won their respective
party nominations, Donald Trump
and Hillary

27:39.658 --> 27:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton are eligible to receive
classified
intelligence briefings.

27:43.795 --> 27:48.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Director of National
Intelligence James Clapper
indicated the offers for such
briefings are

27:48.200 --> 27:49.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going out this week.

27:49.801 --> 27:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what kind of secrets will
Trump and Clinton
become privy to?

27:53.405 --> 27:58.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some partisans have been
suggesting neither
candidate can be trusted with
that information.

27:58.043 --> 28:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Margaret Warner has been looking
at genesis
of those briefings, and she
joins me now.

28:01.179 --> 28:04.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Margaret, when did this become a
political
football?

28:04.216 --> 28:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Just in this
election, Gwen.

28:06.485 --> 28:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been going on ever
since Harry Truman
became president suddenly and
didn't even

28:10.856 --> 28:16.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know about the Manhattan Project
in 1945,
decided he didn't want any
president, future

28:16.728 --> 28:18.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president-elect to be faced with
this.

28:18.730 --> 28:19.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's just gone on.

28:19.865 --> 28:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And some candidates use it a
lot.

28:21.767 --> 28:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some candidates don't avail
themselves much.

28:24.403 --> 28:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this year, as you said,
partisans have
been attacking both candidates
as being untrustworthy

28:30.208 --> 28:31.977 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the information.

28:32.010 --> 28:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Aspen security conference
last week,
James Clapper, the head of --
the DNI, said

28:37.349 --> 28:42.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he had -- quote -- "no
hesitation" and, in
fact, that teams of
professionals had already

28:42.054 --> 28:44.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been assigned to each candidate.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there was a lot of
scuttlebutt.

28:46.258 --> 28:51.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were a lot of spooks and
former spooks,
as I like to describe them, at
this conference.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were quite a few
questions, frankly,
about whether Trump would even
avail himself

28:56.001 --> 28:59.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them, since he said, "I know
more about
ISIS than the generals."

28:59.271 --> 29:00.238 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
So...

29:00.272 --> 29:01.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How does it work?

29:01.473 --> 29:02.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, do they go to the CIA
and get the
briefing?

29:02.975 --> 29:04.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does the CIA come to them?

29:04.309 --> 29:06.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It's a combo of
both.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They try to make sure it's a
secure location.

29:08.380 --> 29:12.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of it depends on whether
they have asked
for the overview or a deep dive
on one topic.

29:12.851 --> 29:16.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, they might just make a hotel
room secure.

29:16.355 --> 29:20.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They might even set up what is
called a SCIF,
which is a special secure
facility, or just

29:20.192 --> 29:21.360 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sweep it.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other times, they have to go to
the local
FBI office.

29:24.796 --> 29:30.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the scope of the information
is really
broad, general intelligence
assessments.

29:30.569 --> 29:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no discussion of covert
operations,
for example.

29:33.572 --> 29:36.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if someone were to say, well,
who is your
source in the Iranian
government, I'm not

29:36.975 --> 29:38.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
allowed to say, sir.

29:38.610 --> 29:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That changes dramatically when
someone becomes
a president-elect.

29:43.081 --> 29:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then there are teams literally,
I'm told,
at the headquarters of each
candidate, and

29:48.320 --> 29:52.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the next morning is delivered to
him or her
the presidential daily brief.

29:52.491 --> 29:55.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which is really the
top-top-secret
documents.

29:55.060 --> 29:57.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That's covert
ops.

29:57.562 --> 29:58.530 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's a lot.

29:58.563 --> 29:59.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's sources and methods.

29:59.564 --> 30:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
None of that is going to be
revealed now.

30:01.633 --> 30:05.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Has it been ever
withheld from
anyone, this kind of briefing?

30:05.570 --> 30:08.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: No, never
withheld, but,
as I said, many don't avail
themselves.

30:09.007 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think Ronald Reagan had only
one.

30:10.709 --> 30:12.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Bill Clinton had only one.

30:12.544 --> 30:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is all according to a great
history log
that is written by John...

30:15.580 --> 30:16.815 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:16.848 --> 30:18.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why wouldn't you --
why wouldn't
avail yourself?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: As it's been
explained to
me, just think about what we
have got in the

30:20.519 --> 30:22.187 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next 98 days.

30:22.220 --> 30:24.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These men and women are focused
on winning.

30:24.790 --> 30:26.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're focused on the debates.

30:26.324 --> 30:28.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're focused on the money
raising.

30:28.093 --> 30:30.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're focused on the
state-by-state count.

30:30.562 --> 30:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their level of interest may not
be as high
as we think it should be.

30:35.901 --> 30:40.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Secondly, one senior
intelligence official,
actually Mike Hayden, a former
director and

30:40.038 --> 30:45.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deputy director of the CIA said
-- of the
NSA -- said, you know, they
don't really want

30:45.744 --> 30:49.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too know too much, because they
don't want
to be caught in the debate and
say, can I

30:49.681 --> 30:50.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
say that?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where did I get that
information?

30:52.284 --> 30:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Has that ever
happened, where
someone has inadvertently
blabbed?

30:53.852 --> 30:57.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: I asked that,
and apparently
not that anyone could think of.

30:57.689 --> 31:02.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, as Hayden said, they
know it's
akin to the death penalty to let
something

31:02.861 --> 31:04.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that slip.

31:04.096 --> 31:06.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there is -- if I may go
on...

31:06.631 --> 31:08.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Sure.

31:08.433 --> 31:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: ... there's a
huge difference
in the level of intelligence
that's given

31:10.368 --> 31:12.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at this stage.

31:12.170 --> 31:18.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Mike Morell, former deputy
director and
director temporary of the CIA,
had to brief

31:18.110 --> 31:20.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
McCain and Palin.

31:20.045 --> 31:24.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, so you walk in with
John McCain
from Armed Services Committee
and Intel Committee,

31:24.416 --> 31:29.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one of the great experts in the
Senate, immediately,
it's going very deep.

31:29.187 --> 31:30.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He knows a lot.

31:31.022 --> 31:35.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he said, you know, with a
Sarah Palin,
he said it's like national
security 101, and

31:35.827 --> 31:39.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's very broad and it's very
general, and
you have got to give a lot of
history.

31:39.197 --> 31:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that will probably apply
this time with
Trump and Secretary Clinton.

31:44.436 --> 31:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As one said to me, Secretary
Clinton, she
will probably walk in and say,
so, where were

31:49.007 --> 31:50.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we?

31:50.809 --> 31:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's learned these secrets for
a long, long
time, even though not in the
last two years.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do vice presidential
candidates
get them as well?

31:55.947 --> 31:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Yes, they do.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, the only person
of the four
who doesn't have Washington
experience would

32:00.652 --> 32:01.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be Donald Trump.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: That's right.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, therefore,
would be classified
briefing 101, as you put it.

32:05.223 --> 32:06.291 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:06.324 --> 32:08.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Margaret Warner,
thank you so
much.

32:08.727 --> 32:16.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: My pleasure.

32:16.034 --> 32:26.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A series of
federal court decisions
in the last few weeks could
change the rules

32:26.144 --> 32:29.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about how many Americans will be
casting votes
this November.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham has the latest
on these rulings.

32:31.983 --> 32:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Voting rights
supporters
have won a series of remarkable
victories

32:35.654 --> 32:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the last few weeks, what they
contend is
a much-needed pushback against
what they say

32:39.991 --> 32:42.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are discriminatory voter-I.D.
laws.

32:42.894 --> 32:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 2008, 10 states, almost
all governed
by Republican legislatures, have
passed laws

32:47.966 --> 32:52.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tightening the requirements for
the kinds
of I.D. you need in order to
vote, or made

32:52.170 --> 32:55.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other changes to when and how
votes get cast.

32:55.407 --> 32:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But several federal courts have
now ruled
that some of those laws are
discriminatory.

32:59.811 --> 33:04.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Monday, a federal judge
blocked North Dakota's
voter I.D. law, saying it
impinged on the

33:04.749 --> 33:06.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rights of Native Americans.

33:06.585 --> 33:10.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The judge wrote -- quote -- "No
eligible voter,
regardless of their station in
life, should

33:10.455 --> 33:13.058 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be denied the opportunity to
vote."

33:13.091 --> 33:17.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last Friday, a federal court
ruled that North
Carolina's new voting laws had
intentionally

33:17.529 --> 33:23.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been designed to discriminate
against minorities,
saying -- quote -- "These new
provisions target

33:23.201 --> 33:26.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-Americans with almost
surgical precision."

33:26.471 --> 33:31.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, in July, another court
ruled that
Texas' voter-I.D. laws also hurt
minority

33:31.843 --> 33:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voters, and they ordered the
laws be changed
before November, saying -- quote
-- "It would

33:36.047 --> 33:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be untenable to permit a law
with a discriminatory
effect to remain in operation
for that election."

33:42.187 --> 33:44.589 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me now to wade through
these changes
is U.C.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Irvine law Professor Richard
Hasen.

33:46.791 --> 33:48.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He writes what's called The
Election Law Blog.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, Professor, help me
understand this.

33:51.396 --> 33:54.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The courts have been saying, not
so fast,
states.

33:54.933 --> 33:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Generally speaking, what have
the states been
doing with their voting laws in
recent years?

33:59.237 --> 34:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK HASEN, University of
California, Irvine:
Well, most of these, but not all
of these

34:03.141 --> 34:07.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenges involve new strict
voter identification
laws.

34:07.812 --> 34:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every state has some way of
identifying voters,
but if you narrow the number of
identifications

34:14.386 --> 34:18.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are acceptable, and a lot
of people don't
have those I.D.s, you run the
risk of disenfranchising

34:18.657 --> 34:21.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people who are otherwise
eligible to vote.

34:21.226 --> 34:25.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so in cases out of
Wisconsin, North Carolina,
North Dakota, and Texas, just in
the last

34:25.263 --> 34:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
few weeks, we have seen those
laws struck
down, in the case of North
Carolina, or, in

34:30.335 --> 34:34.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the case of these other states,
softened so
that people who lack one of
these narrow forms

34:34.205 --> 34:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of I.D. can find a work-around,
a different
way to be able to prove their
identity and

34:38.743 --> 34:40.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cast a ballot.

34:40.478 --> 34:43.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We touched a
little bit
at this on the introduction, but
what is it

34:43.048 --> 34:45.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the courts have been saying
that these
laws do?

34:45.517 --> 34:47.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do they find so
objectionable about them?

34:47.919 --> 34:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK HASEN: Well, the rulings
are not all
the same.

34:51.589 --> 34:58.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In North Carolina, as you
mentioned, the court
thought that the law was
intentionally discriminatory

34:58.596 --> 35:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against African-Americans, that
is not necessarily
that the state of North Carolina
acted with

35:03.935 --> 35:07.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
racial hatred or racial animus,
but they knew
that this law was going to make
it harder

35:07.973 --> 35:13.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for African-Americans to vote,
and they did
that anyway, and in part doing
it knowing

35:13.845 --> 35:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that African-Americans tend to
vote for Democrats.

35:15.981 --> 35:19.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was a Republican
legislature, as
it was in all of the states that
you have

35:19.985 --> 35:24.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mentioned, passing the new
restrictive laws
in order to gain some political
advantage.

35:24.222 --> 35:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Supporters of
these laws
have been saying all along that
these were

35:28.693 --> 35:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
made to prevent voter fraud.

35:30.562 --> 35:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know, in the North Carolina
case, the judges
ruled that there was really no
evidence that

35:35.333 --> 35:36.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's happening.

35:36.935 --> 35:40.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there evidence that voter
fraud is happening
or is a problem in other states?

35:40.205 --> 35:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK HASEN: Well, you know, it
depends on
the kind of voter fraud that
you're talking

35:44.275 --> 35:46.044 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

35:46.077 --> 35:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The term is thrown around
loosely, but the
kind of voter fraud that a voter
identification

35:49.414 --> 35:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
law would target would be
impersonation fraud.

35:52.050 --> 35:54.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I go into the polls pretending
to be someone
else.

35:54.886 --> 35:57.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This turns out to be very, very
rare.

35:58.023 --> 36:02.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not the way that, when
elections are
manipulated, that it happens.

36:02.160 --> 36:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The kind of fraud that we tend
to see, which
is still rare, falls into one of
two categories.

36:07.265 --> 36:11.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Either it's election officials
doing something
to mess with the vote-counting,
or it's something

36:11.669 --> 36:16.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do with absentee ballots,
such as the sale
of absentee ballots.

36:16.274 --> 36:20.378 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somebody buys absentee ballots
and then votes
them how they want.

36:20.412 --> 36:26.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These kind of activities are not
at all addressed
by voter I.D. laws, which really
only provide

36:26.851 --> 36:31.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
identification in the polling
place to make
sure that someone who shows up
is who he or

36:31.623 --> 36:33.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she says he is.

36:33.491 --> 36:37.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But on this
issue of voter
fraud, you have probably been
hearing Donald

36:37.262 --> 36:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has been making noises
recently that
he believes this November
election could very

36:41.266 --> 36:43.401 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
well be stolen because of fraud.

36:43.435 --> 36:48.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says if people don't have an
I.D., what's
to stop them from going in and
voting 10 times?

36:48.506 --> 36:50.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the answer?

36:50.341 --> 36:52.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK HASEN: Well, that sounds
like someone
-- yes, that sounds like someone
who has never

36:52.243 --> 36:55.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been to a polling place, because
you just
can't go in and ask for a
ballot, and they

36:55.280 --> 36:56.247 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will just trust you.

36:56.281 --> 36:57.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is a voter roll.

36:57.282 --> 36:58.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There is a list.

36:58.450 --> 37:00.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every state identifies you
somehow.

37:00.819 --> 37:02.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It might be that you give your
signature.

37:02.754 --> 37:05.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it's that, then your
signature is on
the line.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.324 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're already voted.

37:06.357 --> 37:08.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You can't vote 10 times.

37:08.093 --> 37:11.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say it was a silly thing
to say, except
I think it's really dangerous to
call the

37:11.663 --> 37:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
integrity of our elections into
question,
because our very democracy
depends upon those

37:16.701 --> 37:19.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are on the losing side of
the election
having faith that the votes were
fairly and

37:19.704 --> 37:21.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
accurately counted.

37:21.473 --> 37:24.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Is there a
potential that
these recent changes could cause
confusion

37:24.209 --> 37:25.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on Election Day?

37:25.510 --> 37:28.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK HASEN: There is certainly
the potential
for confusion.

37:28.179 --> 37:33.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just now today, in Texas, the
state of Texas
and the plaintiffs agreed to a
set of rules

37:33.852 --> 37:38.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for how people who lack one of
the narrow
forms of I.D. would be able to
vote, by providing,

37:38.490 --> 37:42.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for example, a utility bill or a
different
kind of identification.

37:42.694 --> 37:47.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Wisconsin, they're still
litigating over
what the rules are going to be.

37:47.599 --> 37:51.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in North Carolina, North
Carolina indicated
today they may go as far as the
Supreme Court

37:51.669 --> 37:56.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to try to get their law, which
had been reversed,
put back on the books in time
for November.

37:57.008 --> 38:02.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I do think it's a real
danger that, as
we get closer to the election,
voters may

38:02.580 --> 38:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not know, for example, in Texas,
that if they
lack one of those narrow forms
of I.D., they

38:07.218 --> 38:10.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will still be eligible to vote
if they're
otherwise eligible to cast a
ballot.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Rick Hasen from
the U.C.

38:12.891 --> 38:16.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Irvine, thank you very much for
being here.

38:16.127 --> 38:23.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN: Thank you.

38:23.334 --> 38:30.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's that time of
year when many
folks are heading to the beach.

38:30.308 --> 38:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But along parts of the Southeast
Coast, vacationers
may run into some unwanted
visitors, as the

38:35.680 --> 38:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National Weather Service has
issued hazard
warnings caused by jellyfish
found in Myrtle

38:40.818 --> 38:42.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Beach, South Carolina.

38:42.754 --> 38:47.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's temporary, but what's not
are the persistent
numbers of the slimy creatures
populating

38:47.225 --> 38:49.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the waters of the ocean.

38:49.294 --> 38:53.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien reports,
just in time for the summer, for
our weekly

38:53.698 --> 38:57.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
series on the Leading Edge of
science and
technology.

38:57.235 --> 39:05.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: On beaches, in
harbors and
beneath bays all over the world,
jellies are

39:05.677 --> 39:07.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on a roll.

39:07.178 --> 39:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it appears it's a stinging
rebuke of us
from Mother Nature herself.

39:12.450 --> 39:15.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JENNY PURCELL, Western
Washington University:
Jellyfish are thriving in
environments that

39:15.653 --> 39:18.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are damaged by the human
activities.

39:18.823 --> 39:24.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Marine biologist
Jenny Purcell
is a research associate at
Western Washington

39:24.162 --> 39:26.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
University in Bellingham.

39:26.331 --> 39:33.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She studies huge aggregations,
or smacks,
of moon jellyfish that have
exploded in Puget

39:33.504 --> 39:34.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sound.

39:34.505 --> 39:36.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNY PURCELL: Human populations
have increased.

39:36.407 --> 39:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their pressure on the oceans
have increased.

39:40.144 --> 39:42.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the jellyfish populations
have increased.

39:42.680 --> 39:49.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's very hard to put a cause
and effect
on that, but the correlations
are certainly

39:49.554 --> 39:51.322 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

39:51.356 --> 39:53.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: There is plenty
of anecdotal
evidence that it's happening,
but arriving

39:53.658 --> 39:57.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at hard numbers is like nailing
jelly to a
wall.

39:57.228 --> 40:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNY PURCELL: Because there
have been so
few jellyfish scientists,
there's a critical

40:01.833 --> 40:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shortage of jellyfish data.

40:04.235 --> 40:08.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know how many jellyfish
or even what
jellyfish are there.

40:08.706 --> 40:15.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But at aquariums
all over the
country, there is plenty of
concrete proof

40:15.079 --> 40:16.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jellyfish fascinate us.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD: Cute, but dangerous.

40:18.583 --> 40:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They are nature's
lava lamp,
a morbidly mesmerizing marquee
attraction.

40:24.322 --> 40:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN BAILEY, New England
Aquarium: Penguins,
hard to beat penguins.

40:26.391 --> 40:27.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

40:27.392 --> 40:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEVEN BAILEY: Sharks, hard to
beat sharks.

40:29.360 --> 40:36.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I would say that jellies
come in a strong
third rather consistently.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.670 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is hour cold culture room.

40:38.703 --> 40:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Steven Bailey is
the curator
of fishes at the New England
Aquarium, smack

40:43.941 --> 40:46.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dab on Boston Harbor, if you
will.

40:46.911 --> 40:49.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bailey is a card-carrying
jellyhead.

40:49.080 --> 40:54.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN BAILEY: They seem to be
capable of
doing things physiologically
that can't be

40:54.652 --> 40:58.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
described by their body plan, by
the structures
that they possess.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This got me
intrigued.

41:00.692 --> 41:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS DOLLER, New England
Aquarium: This is
actually the fifth floor of the
aquarium,

41:04.362 --> 41:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
considered, like, sort of the
attic.

41:06.097 --> 41:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So I asked senior
aquarist
Chris Doller for a
behind-the-scenes tour.

41:10.034 --> 41:11.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where are we now?

41:11.269 --> 41:13.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS DOLLER: This area is
affectionately
known as Area X.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:15.673 --> 41:19.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Area X is the one
of the most
prolific jellyfish nurseries in
the nation.

41:19.577 --> 41:26.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They keep about 13 at the
aquarium, a varied
sampling of the 200 large and
800 small types

41:26.918 --> 41:28.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of jellyfish in the world.

41:28.586 --> 41:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are all cnidaria, in the
same phylum
as anemones and corals among
others.

41:34.759 --> 41:37.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRIS DOLLER: They're so simple,
yet so complex.

41:37.862 --> 41:39.564 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a huge variety of
jellies.

41:39.597 --> 41:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you can get very colorful
jellies.

41:41.265 --> 41:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can get very iridescent
jellies.

41:43.634 --> 41:45.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have some fluorescent
jellies.

41:45.503 --> 41:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: No brain, no
blood, no spinal
cord, just muscle, nerves and
stinging cells

41:52.210 --> 41:56.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to kill prey, and inadvertently
bother beach-loving
humans.

41:56.280 --> 41:57.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How often do you get stung?

41:57.648 --> 42:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS DOLLER: I try not to, but
it's almost
a daily occurrence.

42:02.086 --> 42:04.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So what does a
grizzled pro
use?

42:05.022 --> 42:06.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Warm water or vinegar.

42:06.557 --> 42:08.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS DOLLER: I think the worst
sting I ever
got was from a flower hat jelly.

42:08.593 --> 42:09.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Really?

42:09.594 --> 42:10.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS DOLLER: Yes.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Some jellies bear
more than
a resemblance to a plant.

42:13.431 --> 42:18.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The lagoon and upside down
jellyfish species
are among those that are
photosynthetic.

42:18.736 --> 42:23.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their tissue becomes a home for
algae, and
the jellies use it for energy.

42:23.641 --> 42:25.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All they need is sunshine to
stay alive.

42:25.643 --> 42:31.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS DOLLER: That brown that
you see in the
tissue, that's all algal cells,
so they are

42:31.649 --> 42:33.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
basically harvesting within
them.

42:33.818 --> 42:36.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, the plant is sort of living
in their
tissue.

42:36.754 --> 42:41.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jellyfish
reproduce sexually
and asexually.

42:41.192 --> 42:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most adults send sperm and eggs
into the water,
creating small larvae that grow
into polyps.

42:47.565 --> 42:52.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They reproduce by cloning over
and over and
over again.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Voila, a jellyfish smack.

42:54.605 --> 42:56.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not schooling in the
classic sense,
right?

42:56.741 --> 42:58.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS DOLLER: Right.

42:58.576 --> 43:02.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The way they bud off, it's just
pure numbers,
and then they're all sort of
drifting in the

43:02.313 --> 43:03.347 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
same current.

43:03.381 --> 43:04.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't migrate
intentionally.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just sort of go where the
ocean takes
them.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They go with the
flow.

43:07.251 --> 43:08.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS DOLLER: Go with the flow.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: On the move, they
are constantly
grazing.

43:10.354 --> 43:13.090 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So why are they thriving?

43:13.124 --> 43:18.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many jelly species reproduce
faster in warmer
water, so climate change has an
impact.

43:18.429 --> 43:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, researchers say
overfishing
is the biggest cause of the
jellyfish bonanza.

43:23.868 --> 43:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNY PURCELL: People have
fished out the
fisheries.

43:26.737 --> 43:29.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is more food left for the
jellyfish.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And they will eat
almost anything.

43:31.542 --> 43:36.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They also don't mind living in
troubled waters,
like the huge oxygen-starved
Dead Zone in

43:36.714 --> 43:38.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Gulf of Mexico.

43:38.216 --> 43:42.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is caused by nutrient-rich
fertilizer flowing
down the Mississippi.

43:42.787 --> 43:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It creates a lot of algae that
depletes underwater
oxygen levels.

43:46.357 --> 43:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means fewer fish and more
food for the
jellies.

43:49.861 --> 43:54.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, algae blooms and jellyfish
smacks go hand
in hand.

43:54.098 --> 43:58.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The guy who has that perfect
lawn right down
to the river, if you will, when
he goes to

43:58.903 --> 44:03.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the beach and he gets stung by a
jellyfish,
he actually has some
culpability.

44:03.975 --> 44:06.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN BAILEY: I would say that
that's rather
poetic, yes.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Maybe one
solution is to start
eating them more.

44:09.981 --> 44:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Florida, Georgia and the
Carolinas, a new
kind of fishing industry is
emerging.

44:15.920 --> 44:21.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Entrepreneurs are harvesting
cannonball jellies,
pickling them, and exporting
jelly balls to

44:21.893 --> 44:24.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Asia, where they are considered
a delicacy.

44:24.629 --> 44:26.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have you ever eaten a jellyfish?

44:26.097 --> 44:27.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRIS DOLLER: I have.

44:27.098 --> 44:28.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: How is it?

44:28.132 --> 44:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS DOLLER: Didn't enjoy it.

44:29.467 --> 44:30.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Really?

44:30.468 --> 44:32.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No surprise.

44:32.203 --> 44:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have no taste, are as chewy
as an eraser,
and pack precious little caloric
value.

44:35.973 --> 44:39.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I guess that means we can eat a
lot of them,
if we like.

44:39.277 --> 44:42.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is little concern we
might fish
these guys into oblivion.

44:42.647 --> 44:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNY PURCELL: I think the
jellyfish will
persist after the Armageddon.

44:47.318 --> 44:49.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

44:49.053 --> 44:53.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: They started on
Earth more
than 500 million years ago, so
why not go

44:53.057 --> 44:54.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for a billion?

44:54.992 --> 45:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cockroaches of the sea,
perhaps, but in
the smackdown for fans, the
jellies win, tentacles

45:04.101 --> 45:05.069 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Boston.

45:11.776 --> 45:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a new look
at the terrible
cost of slavery in America.

45:23.387 --> 45:29.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It comes in a work of fiction,
one that combines
gritty realism with a leap of
the imagination.

45:29.427 --> 45:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What if the Underground Railroad
was an actual
train?

45:32.630 --> 45:37.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, in fact, "The Underground
Railroad"
is the title of Colson
Whitehead's novel.

45:37.702 --> 45:42.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spoke with Jeffrey Brown
earlier this summer
at BookExpo America in Chicago.

45:42.640 --> 45:48.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me ask you to
sort of introduce
what you have done here.

45:48.212 --> 45:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a novel, but -- but...

45:50.014 --> 45:52.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD, Author, "The
Underground
Railroad": It starts off as a
traditional,

45:52.383 --> 45:54.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
realistic about slavery.

45:54.185 --> 45:57.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our main protagonist is a woman
named Cora.

45:57.989 --> 46:02.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's 16, 17 living on a cotton
plantation.

46:02.727 --> 46:08.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when conditions deteriorate,
she's convinced
to flee north on the Underground
Railroad.

46:08.566 --> 46:13.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I first came up with the
idea many years
ago, I thought, what if the
Underground Railroad

46:13.404 --> 46:16.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
was an actual railroad,
literally underneath
the earth?

46:16.240 --> 46:17.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:17.241 --> 46:18.509 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Well, let's explain that.

46:18.542 --> 46:20.945 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Underground Railroad was a
system, right,
I mean, an idea.

46:20.978 --> 46:24.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was people, places, and --
but not a real
railroad.

46:24.215 --> 46:31.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: No, there were
people who
were sympathetic to the slaves
and arranged

46:31.322 --> 46:38.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe havens and got people
north, hid them,
moved them station to station.

46:38.229 --> 46:40.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it wasn't a literal
Underground Railroad.

46:40.064 --> 46:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think a lot of people,
when they first
hear about it when they're kids,
at least

46:42.900 --> 46:44.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a few minutes, they think
it's an actual
subway.

46:44.869 --> 46:45.836 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:45.870 --> 46:47.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:47.738 --> 46:50.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: So, the
conceit is, what
if it actually was an
underground train system?

46:50.574 --> 46:51.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How would that work?

46:51.575 --> 46:52.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And then it...

46:52.843 --> 46:53.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you said this
came to you
many years ago?

46:53.678 --> 46:55.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: About 16 years
ago.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I knew if I tried it then,
it wouldn't
work.

46:58.015 --> 46:59.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I wasn't really up to the task.

46:59.617 --> 47:02.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It seemed a bit too big for me.

47:02.420 --> 47:07.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I figured, if I got a little
older, or
wiser, became a better writer, I
might be

47:07.358 --> 47:09.794 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
able to tackle it and give it
its due.

47:09.827 --> 47:15.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, every couple years, in
between books,
I would pull out my notes and
think, am I

47:15.266 --> 47:16.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ready?

47:16.267 --> 47:17.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And each time, it was, no.

47:17.535 --> 47:18.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I would do a different
book.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Why was the
answer no?

47:20.071 --> 47:21.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
In what way were you not ready?

47:21.706 --> 47:23.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: Well, the
subject is so
huge.

47:23.741 --> 47:29.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you wrap your head
around, completely
around the atrocity of slavery?

47:29.080 --> 47:32.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How can you make people that you
care about,
your characters, and put them
into this horrible

47:32.950 --> 47:36.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system and create a realistic
story?

47:36.887 --> 47:41.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, if I had tried it
16 years ago,
it would have been much
different.

47:41.192 --> 47:42.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Now I'm older.

47:42.226 --> 47:44.061 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have kids.

47:44.095 --> 47:51.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I actually know what it is
to contemplate
having your mother sold in front
of you, having

47:51.268 --> 47:58.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your children sold, seeing your
siblings,
your friends tortured, beaten.

47:58.175 --> 48:04.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think, now I'm in my
mid-40s, I have
more of an idea of what family
means, and

48:04.081 --> 48:08.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's very much important to
the character
in the book and creating a
realistic family

48:08.252 --> 48:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
structure for my plantation
characters.

48:11.255 --> 48:15.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I was wondering
if you were
worried or putting it off
because of the mix

48:15.359 --> 48:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of taking the horror of that
real history
and the reality of those real
lives, but then

48:21.899 --> 48:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
putting it into this kind of
"Gulliver's Travels,
where there is a kind of fantasy
aspect to

48:27.004 --> 48:27.972 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

48:28.005 --> 48:29.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: Well, yes.

48:29.940 --> 48:34.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, a couple years ago, the
fantasy would
have been much more pronounced
and much broader.

48:34.278 --> 48:38.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now I think the magic realism
dial is, like,
set on one, as opposed to 10 or
a "Spinal

48:38.849 --> 48:39.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Tap"-ian 11.

48:39.984 --> 48:41.752 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:41.786 --> 48:44.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: So, each state
she goes
through is a different sort of
state of American

48:44.822 --> 48:46.624 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possibility.

48:46.657 --> 48:54.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Carolina is a benevolent
paternalistic
state, where slaves are given
programs for

48:54.098 --> 48:55.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
racial uplifted.

48:55.833 --> 48:57.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
North Carolina is a white
supremacist state.

48:57.668 --> 49:01.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're -- so each stop is a
sort of island
in the "Gulliver's Travels"-type
sense.

49:01.539 --> 49:03.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One that you have
imagined.

49:03.407 --> 49:08.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: Yes, but it's
treated in
a very deadpan and
matter-of-fact way.

49:08.712 --> 49:13.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so while I am stretching the
truth or
tweaking reality, it is still
much grounded

49:13.951 --> 49:16.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in what we would call, you know,
the truth.

49:16.253 --> 49:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Once you opened
it up that
way, was it freeing as a writer?

49:23.594 --> 49:24.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: It was very
liberating.

49:24.595 --> 49:26.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes?

49:26.363 --> 49:31.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: Once you have
a literal
railroad, you're bringing a
fantasy element

49:31.101 --> 49:33.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that allows you to do different
things and
play with time.

49:33.270 --> 49:36.607 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I bring in the Tuskegee
experiments.

49:36.640 --> 49:41.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I bring in sort of Nazism and
white supremacy.

49:41.278 --> 49:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even though it takes place
in 1850, I'm
allowed to rove in these
different kind of

49:46.650 --> 49:50.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
modes and bring in a lot of
different aspects
of American history in a way
that I couldn't

49:50.988 --> 49:53.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if I was being -- if I was
sticking to the
facts.

49:53.057 --> 49:57.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because it's all
-- all of
it is fraught territory, right,
for, I mean,

49:57.428 --> 49:58.395 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today?

49:58.429 --> 49:59.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: It's fraught.

49:59.830 --> 50:04.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
People have asked, was I
inspired by Ferguson
or Black Lives Matter?

50:04.902 --> 50:12.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, the fact is that white
people in
authority have been abusing the
black body

50:13.010 --> 50:14.812 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for centuries.

50:14.845 --> 50:19.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't have to go -- look to
Ferguson to
find someone being gunned down
by policemen.

50:19.750 --> 50:25.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 1850s, before they had
kind of police
force in the South, the
authority was the

50:25.055 --> 50:26.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
slave patroller.

50:26.891 --> 50:30.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a slave patroller could stop
any black
person, free or slave, and
demand to see their

50:30.361 --> 50:32.229 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
papers.

50:32.263 --> 50:34.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you didn't have your
papers or an excuse
for being off the plantation,
you would be

50:34.698 --> 50:37.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beaten, put in jail, brought
back to your
master.

50:37.935 --> 50:42.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's analogous to stop and
frisk right
now.

50:42.473 --> 50:49.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was younger, I guess more
threatening-looking,
I would be stopped, I would be
searched.

50:49.680 --> 50:53.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"What are you doing in this
neighborhood?"

50:53.317 --> 50:57.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, I'm not addressing
contemporary ills.

50:57.788 --> 51:04.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm addressing the sort of
problems that have
been around since the beginning
of the country.

51:04.261 --> 51:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, hopefully, by the end, I
have learned
something in finishing the book.

51:09.066 --> 51:11.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You used to doubt
whether it
was ever going to be finished?

51:11.869 --> 51:13.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COLSON WHITEHEAD: Yes.

51:13.237 --> 51:16.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I think I had a concept
called the
get-hit-by-a-bus draft.

51:16.407 --> 51:22.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's like the draft you
want in case
you get hit by a bus an hour
later.

51:22.246 --> 51:24.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, will people understand
what you're trying
to do?

51:24.148 --> 51:26.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because you're working on a
novel for years,
and then if something happens to
you in the

51:26.283 --> 51:29.687 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
middle, no one is going to know
what you were
trying to do.
