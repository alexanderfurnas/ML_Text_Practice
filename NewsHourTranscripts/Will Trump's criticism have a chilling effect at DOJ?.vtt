JUDY WOODRUFF: Back to
President Trump's comments to
The New York Times yesterday.

00:04.300 --> 00:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The broadsides aimed at top
officials from the Justice
Department raise questions about

00:11.133 --> 00:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's
relationship with Attorney
General Jeff Sessions.

00:12.466 --> 00:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are joined by
Walter Dellinger.

00:15.000 --> 00:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He served in the Clinton
administration as
assistant attorney general
and acting solicitor

00:20.466 --> 00:21.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
general.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's now in private practice.

00:23.866 --> 00:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And former U.S. Ambassador
Douglas Kmiec, he
served as legal counsel
to Presidents Ronald

00:28.600 --> 00:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

00:30.733 --> 00:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is now a professor of
constitutional law at Pepperdine
University Law School.

00:36.900 --> 00:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome you both
back to the program.

00:38.633 --> 00:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Walter Dellinger, to you first.

00:40.766 --> 00:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How significant are the
president's criticisms of
top officials at Justice?

00:46.866 --> 00:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER, Former Acting
Solicitor General: Well, I
think they're unprecedented

00:49.566 --> 00:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in their inappropriateness.

00:52.066 --> 00:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A president shouldn't
be commenting on any
particular criminal
investigation, especially

00:58.866 --> 01:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he should not be commenting one
that involves people that are
close to him, potential family

01:03.100 --> 01:05.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
members.

01:05.600 --> 01:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet here the president
said that the attorney
general shouldn't have
recused himself and

01:11.066 --> 01:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shouldn't have been appointed
unless he had sort of committed
himself not to recuse, even

01:15.433 --> 01:17.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
though departmental
rules would call for it.

01:17.966 --> 01:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He then criticized the
deputy attorney general
for naming a special
counsel, which was clearly

01:22.566 --> 01:24.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
appropriate.

01:24.566 --> 01:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, he made it clear
that he thought that the special
counsel shouldn't inquire

01:30.066 --> 01:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into any financial dealings
that are outside of the scope
of the Russian campaign.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of those seem to be
inappropriate for a president,
unprecedented, and something

01:40.633 --> 01:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that certainly would send
a chill through the entire
Department of Justice.

01:42.766 --> 01:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Douglas Kmiec,
inappropriate and likely to send
a chill through the department?

01:47.000 --> 01:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC, Pepperdine
University Law School: I think
everything Walter said is true.

01:51.666 --> 01:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know of two things as a
result of that interview, one,
that he has a very intelligent

01:58.100 --> 02:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and beautiful granddaughter
who he's very proud of.

02:00.433 --> 02:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, I think, will
humanize the president for
people who read his interview.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we are very troubled by the
nature of how he understands
his role as president and

02:12.233 --> 02:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his ability to intercede into
particular investigations.

02:16.866 --> 02:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Judy, I think he
comes from the business world,
where his perception is where

02:21.366 --> 02:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyers are hired because
they're smart and clever and
they can get the best price on

02:26.233 --> 02:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
property and the best
title arrangements and
the best closing date,
and all these things

02:30.933 --> 02:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are subject to negotiation.

02:33.000 --> 02:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what he doesn't realize --
and it becomes plain at every
turn -- is that the Constitution

02:39.500 --> 02:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is designed to separate power,
to specify limits, to make sure
that nobody has the ability

02:44.766 --> 02:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to give favoritism
to their friends.

02:47.800 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is just something
he just doesn't grasp.

02:51.533 --> 02:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, he has a very
transactional view of the law,
and it's not the view that the

02:56.500 --> 02:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department of Justice has
to defend, as a matter
of the Constitution.

02:59.333 --> 03:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Walter
Dellinger, given if that's his
understanding of the role of

03:06.800 --> 03:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Justice Department,
what are the consequences
for the department in
terms of its ability

03:10.733 --> 03:12.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do its job?

03:12.800 --> 03:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: Well, I think,
outside the area of the Russia
investigation, the department

03:17.966 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will go forward.

03:20.533 --> 03:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the president's
reputation has suffered
enough that his criticism
of Attorney General

03:25.633 --> 03:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sessions is likely only to
enhance the attorney general's
standing within the department.

03:31.933 --> 03:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, I think that, in
terms of this particular
investigation, it will proceed.

03:38.900 --> 03:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, Robert Mueller, we
have to remember, is like James
Comey, a lifelong Republican,

03:45.500 --> 03:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
12 years as head of the FBI
under two presidents of two
different political parties.

03:52.500 --> 03:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Mueller is known to
law enforcement throughout the
United States and held in the

03:57.966 --> 04:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
highest possible regard, so
that -- and I certainly agree
with everything Doug Kmiec

04:03.000 --> 04:05.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
said.

04:05.066 --> 04:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the president were to make
a move to try to break through
the department and dismiss

04:11.000 --> 04:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Mueller, I think the
organized bar would find it
incumbent upon itself to take

04:16.000 --> 04:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whatever actions they
could in response to that.

04:18.433 --> 04:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Doug Kmiec,
at this point, the president
is saying he's not going to

04:22.700 --> 04:24.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do that.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he also seemed to send a
shot across the bow in saying
that, if it turns out that Mr.

04:30.633 --> 04:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mueller is looking into his
own financial dealings, any
financial dealings with Russia,

04:35.400 --> 04:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which may be the case, that he
would give it another thought.

04:39.100 --> 04:43.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, what does that mean
for Mr. Mueller and his
ability to go forward?

04:43.400 --> 04:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: Well, I don't
think Mr. Mueller will be
intimidated whatsoever.

04:47.366 --> 04:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Walter said, he's a straight
shooter, and he is being very
careful and very quiet as

04:53.633 --> 04:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he gathers his
information, as he should.

04:55.733 --> 05:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The concern I have is that
the president, if he thinks
that it's only a very narrow

05:02.766 --> 05:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question of whether there was
a contact with Russia, that
is just simply not plausible,

05:08.733 --> 05:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the real concern is
that the president somehow has
gotten himself into a difficult

05:15.500 --> 05:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
position with a foreign country,
where a foreign country has
some information, perhaps with

05:22.466 --> 05:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this disreputable memo that
talks about terrible practices
that the president allegedly was

05:28.833 --> 05:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
involved in, perhaps
something else.

05:31.700 --> 05:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To the extent that there is some
undue influence of a foreign
nation of his decision-making,

05:38.633 --> 05:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it strikes every aspect
of his job, foreign policy
and domestic policy.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's just simply
not going to be accepted.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so what is going to be
the answer if he objects?

05:50.400 --> 05:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the answer will be
a referral to the House of
Representatives for removal.

05:54.833 --> 05:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For
removal of the president?

05:58.900 --> 06:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: The
president, if I could just...

06:00.466 --> 06:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Of the president?

06:02.533 --> 06:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: I think
Doug was saying a referral for
impeachment proceedings, yes.

06:05.466 --> 06:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you know that every step
he's taking are further elements
of what might well be an

06:11.666 --> 06:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
obstruction of justice
against the president.

06:14.266 --> 06:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The very idea that he
would be trying to direct
the special counsel not
to inquire into certain

06:20.733 --> 06:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
areas involving the president's
own finances, even though the
president has a free speech

06:26.300 --> 06:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
right to do that and can
exercise the power of
his presidency, if he
does so for a corrupt

06:32.133 --> 06:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
motive, those can
certainly be elements of
an obstruction of justice.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: I think
that that is right.

06:36.566 --> 06:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

06:38.633 --> 06:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: The one thing
we might worry about that the
president might have helped

06:41.400 --> 06:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself, in an ironic sort of
way, in the interview, is how
profoundly he misunderstands

06:47.433 --> 06:49.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the law.

06:49.466 --> 06:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In an obstruction of justice
prosecution, an espionage
prosecution, all these things

06:56.200 --> 07:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Title 18 require bad intent
and specific bad intent.

07:03.100 --> 07:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And President Trump's knowledge
of how the law works is so
rudimentary and so different

07:09.033 --> 07:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than our history, where
Harry Truman was told
he couldn't seize the
steel mills, where Ronald

07:16.066 --> 07:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reagan was told he couldn't have
a line-item veto unless there
was a constitutional amendment,

07:21.300 --> 07:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where one administration after
another said to the president
of the United States, yes,

07:26.300 --> 07:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you are our chief executive, but
that means you must take care
that the laws are faithfully

07:29.966 --> 07:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
executed, not that you take
care that your objectives are
accomplished irregardless of

07:36.266 --> 07:38.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the law.

07:38.233 --> 07:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I just want
to come back to both of you
again, with less than a minute,

07:40.566 --> 07:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that is to clarify that
you believe that the job of the
attorney general, the deputy

07:47.633 --> 07:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attorney general, these other
individuals the president is
criticizing, that they can

07:52.266 --> 07:57.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do their jobs as usual,
that their authority
is not undermined after
these criticisms from

07:58.666 --> 08:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the president, Walter Dellinger?

08:00.833 --> 08:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: You know,
Judy, I don't, because I don't
think people take criticisms

08:07.766 --> 08:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Donald Trump the way
they would criticism
with any other president.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think that affects the
attorney general's standing
within the department.

08:15.733 --> 08:18.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: I agree.

08:18.300 --> 08:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also think that, as
Walter said, Jeff Sessions,
to the extent that he's
putting his nose down

08:25.566 --> 08:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the grindstone and getting
down to work and accomplishing
the other -- the vast number

08:32.600 --> 08:36.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of other tasks that
the department handles,
will be admired by those
people in the Justice

08:37.933 --> 08:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Department, as it should.

08:41.133 --> 08:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think Jeff Sessions
made a very important...

08:43.600 --> 08:45.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

08:45.066 --> 08:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALTER DELLINGER: You know,
I think he shouldn't...

08:45.866 --> 08:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead.

08:46.833 --> 08:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: Go ahead, Walter.

08:48.700 --> 08:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WALTER DELLINGER: I was
saying, Doug, I think
he shouldn't resign.

08:51.300 --> 08:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he shouldn't resign,
because that's exactly what
the president wants him to do,

08:55.100 --> 08:59.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so he can install some
non-recused loyalist
in the department.

08:59.866 --> 09:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUGLAS KMIEC: Exactly right.

09:01.966 --> 09:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Jeff Sessions, however
awkward it would be to continue
his service, is doing a service

09:07.900 --> 09:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to maintain the institution
of the Department of Justice.
