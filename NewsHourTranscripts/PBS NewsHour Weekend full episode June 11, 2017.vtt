17:57.900 --> 17:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AT THIS POINT, PEOPLE ARE

17:59.700 --> 18:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST KIND OF JUST RUNNING BACK

18:02.666 --> 18:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FORTH, NOT REALLY KNOWING

18:03.800 --> 18:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT TO DO.

18:06.200 --> 18:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DROPPED TO THE FLOOR BECAUSE I

18:07.233 --> 18:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

18:09.366 --> 18:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: CARTER, PARKER, AND

18:10.700 --> 18:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MURRAY ENDED UP HIDING TOGETHER

18:12.133 --> 18:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE CLUB'S BATHROOM.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN MINUTES MATEEN WOULD

18:14.466 --> 18:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOLLOW.

18:16.033 --> 18:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE WERE THE LAST FEW TO GET

18:17.566 --> 18:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THE BATHROOM STALL THAT WE

18:18.566 --> 18:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE IN.

18:19.333 --> 18:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE WAS ALREADY ABOUT

18:21.400 --> 18:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE, WHAT, 17-20 PEOPLE IN

18:24.900 --> 18:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT STALL ALREADY.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE CLOSED THE DOOR, AND THEN

18:27.533 --> 18:33.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE JUST SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

18:33.366 --> 18:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU COULD STILL HEAR PEOPLE

18:34.233 --> 18:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCREAMING IN OTHER PARTS OF THE

18:35.100 --> 18:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLUB.

18:36.700 --> 18:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THERE WAS A PERIOD OF

18:37.700 --> 18:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SILENCE.

18:39.066 --> 18:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WALKS IN, YOU COULD HEAR HIS

18:40.300 --> 18:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOOTSTEPS, AND THEN HE STARTS

18:41.700 --> 18:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOOTING INTO OUR BATHROOM.

18:43.533 --> 18:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HIS GUN GOT JAMMED, THAT'S

18:44.400 --> 18:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THE SHOOTING STOPPED.

18:46.233 --> 18:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: CARTER HAD BEEN

18:47.300 --> 18:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOT IN BOTH LEGS.

18:48.733 --> 18:50.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE LAID ON THE BATHROOM AND

18:50.300 --> 18:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRIED TO STAY QUIET.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT 2:35 A.M., SHE HEARD MATEEN

18:54.566 --> 18:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CALL THE POLICE AND PLEDGE

18:55.300 --> 19:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLEGIANCE TO ISIS.

19:03.800 --> 19:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S WHEN IT KIND OF

19:05.966 --> 19:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMED FOR ME THAT WE WEREN'T

19:08.633 --> 19:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO GET OUT OF HERE,

19:09.866 --> 19:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE HE HAD A MOTIVE, HE WAS

19:11.866 --> 19:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE FOR A REASON, AND HE WAS

19:13.466 --> 19:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO PROVE SOMETHING.

19:15.233 --> 19:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO AT THAT POINT I PRETTY MUCH

19:16.133 --> 19:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST GAVE UP.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: YOU THOUGHT YOU

19:18.133 --> 19:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE NEVER GOING TO GET OUT OF

19:19.000 --> 19:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE?

19:20.133 --> 19:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I ABSOLUTELY THOUGHT I WAS

19:21.000 --> 19:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEVER GOING TO GET OUT.

19:21.833 --> 19:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HONESTLY, YEAH.

19:26.133 --> 19:27.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I LOST HOPE VERY, VERY QUICKLY.

19:27.766 --> 19:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I JUST STARTED MAKING PEACE

19:28.900 --> 19:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH GOD.

19:31.933 --> 19:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: TWO-AND-A-HALF

19:33.200 --> 19:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOURS LATER, POLICE PLOWED

19:34.633 --> 19:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGH THE BATHROOM WALL IN AN

19:35.566 --> 19:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARMORED VEHICLE.

19:37.033 --> 19:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT BEFORE THAT, CARTER SAYS,

19:38.733 --> 19:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATEEN CAME INTO THE BATHROOM

19:40.500 --> 19:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STALL WHERE SHE WAS HIDING.

19:42.800 --> 19:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HE HAS HIS HANDGUN IN HIS

19:43.900 --> 19:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAND.

19:44.833 --> 19:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THIS POINT, MY FACE IS

19:46.466 --> 19:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURNING TO THE OTHER STALL,

19:48.133 --> 19:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE I REALLY JUST DIDN'T

19:50.233 --> 19:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO GET SHOT IN THE FACE.

19:51.666 --> 19:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I HEARD HIM SAY "HEY, YOU."

19:52.700 --> 19:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SHOT SOMEONE.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SHOT ANOTHER PERSON.

19:55.266 --> 19:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN RIGHT BEFORE THE POLICE

19:56.766 --> 19:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAME IN, HE SHOT THE PERSON THAT

19:58.566 --> 20:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS DIRECTLY BEHIND ME.

20:00.366 --> 20:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHEN THE WALL CAME DOWN,

20:01.533 --> 20:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE POLICE CAME THROUGH THE

20:02.700 --> 20:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALL.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE DEBRIS WAS PRETTY MUCH

20:05.133 --> 20:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL OVER MY FACE, BUT I COULD

20:06.266 --> 20:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THROUGH THIS ONE PEEPHOLE

20:08.233 --> 20:10.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGHOUT ALL THE DEBRIS, I SAW

20:10.166 --> 20:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LIGHTS, JUST THE SPARKS FROM

20:11.466 --> 20:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:14.566 --> 20:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:51.933 --> 20:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMOTIONALLY, I THINK, IT'S LIKE

20:53.800 --> 20:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY DAY IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF

20:54.866 --> 20:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRUGGLE.

21:00.266 --> 21:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HAPPENED.

21:05.366 --> 21:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
