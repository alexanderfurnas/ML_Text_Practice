CONFIDANTS -- THIS HAS NOTHING

06:05.733 --> 06:07.333
TO DO WITH THE BRIDGE OTHER THAN

06:07.333 --> 06:08.933
IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER STRONG ARM

06:08.933 --> 06:09.433
TACTIC

06:09.433 --> 06:12.300
>> TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE,

06:12.300 --> 06:16.700
HOW BADLY WAS THE CITY HIT

06:16.700 --> 06:19.633
>> 80% OF THE CITY WAS

06:19.633 --> 06:19.733
UNDERWATER

06:19.733 --> 06:22.000
THEY ARE RIGHT ON THE HUDSON

06:22.000 --> 06:25.433
RIVER ACROSS FROM MANHATTAN.

06:25.433 --> 06:28.233
50,000 PEOPLE IN THAT ONE MILE

06:28.233 --> 06:29.233
VERY DENSELY POPULATED

06:29.233 --> 06:36.967
IT WAS REALLY BADLY FLOODED.

06:46.567 --> 06:52.233
$100 MILLION AND GOT $342,000.

06:52.233 --> 06:54.433
THE CHRISTIE OFFICE IS DISPUTING

06:54.433 --> 06:55.467
EVERYTHING SHE SAYS AND SAYS

06:55.467 --> 06:58.100
THAT THEY ARE IN LINE TO GET $70

06:58.100 --> 06:58.433
MILLION.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.867
SOME REPORTING I HAVE SEEN SAY

07:00.867 --> 07:02.167
THAT'S MONEY FROM INSURANC

07:02.167 --> 07:04.433
COMPANIES TO HOMEOWNERS, NOT THE

07:04.433 --> 07:07.567
FEDERAL MONEY THAT CHRIS

07:07.567 --> 07:09.767
CHRISTIE FOUGHT SO HARD TO GET A

07:09.767 --> 07:10.567
YEAR AGO

07:10.567 --> 07:14.767
>> HE IS SUCH A NATIONAL FIGURE.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.967
HE HAS BEEN ON THE SHORT LIS

07:16.967 --> 07:18.800
FOR A POSSIBLE PRESIDENTIA

07:18.800 --> 07:19.067
CANDIDACY.

07:19.067 --> 07:21.033
HE IS EVEN IN FLORIDA THIS

WEEKEND RAISING MONEY FOR FELLOW

07:24.000 --> 07:24.367
REPUBLICANS.

07:24.367 --> 07:25.533
HOW DOES THIS PLAY

07:25.533 --> 07:27.300
HOW DO HIS SUPPORTERS THIN

07:27.300 --> 07:29.000
ABOUT ANOTHER ALLEGED SCANDA

07:29.000 --> 07:29.733
AFTER ANOTHER?

07:29.733 --> 07:31.333
>> THEY'RE WORRIED

07:31.333 --> 07:34.900
HIS BROTHER WAS ON FACEBOOK THIS

07:34.900 --> 07:38.567
MORNING ECHOING WHAT HIS PRESS

07:38.567 --> 07:40.200
SECRETARY SAID YESTERDAY

07:40.200 --> 07:47.933
THIS IS DEMOCRATIC PARTISAN GAME

07:47.933 --> 07:50.400
PLAYING AND THE MEDIA IS PLAYING

07:50.400 --> 07:50.933
INTO IT.

07:50.933 --> 07:52.533
THEY ARE REALLY CONCERNED.

07:52.533 --> 07:54.867
AND I THINK THE SECOND FRONT A

07:54.867 --> 07:57.167
MUCH AS IT'S JUST POLITICS A

07:57.167 --> 07:58.667
USUAL WE'RE NOT GOING TO GIV

07:58.667 --> 08:01.233
YOU THIS UNLESS YOU DO THAT, I

08:01.233 --> 08:02.967
DOESN'T LOOK GOOD BECAUSE IT

08:02.967 --> 08:12.200
PLAYS INTO THIS NOTION THAT.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.667
>> THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE

08:14.667 --> 08:17.600
VICTORY LAP HEADING INTO HIS

08:17.600 --> 08:19.800
INAUGURATION BUT INSTEAD HE HA

08:19.800 --> 08:23.933
TO DEFEND HIMSELF ABOUT THIS

08:23.933 --> 08:26.533
IS HIS POPULARITY IN NEW JERSE

08:26.533 --> 08:26.767
SUFFERING?

08:26.767 --> 08:29.733
>> NOT ACCORDING TO THE POLLS.

08:29.733 --> 08:31.367
BUT I THINK EVERYTHING ABOUT

08:31.367 --> 08:33.500
CHRIS CHRISTIE IS HANGING IN THE

08:33.500 --> 08:34.467
BALANCE HERE

08:34.467 --> 08:35.933
DEPENDING ON WHEN THIS PLAYS

08:35.933 --> 08:36.067
OUT.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.667
THERE ARE SOME WHO THINK HE'

08:37.667 --> 08:40.367
TOAST ALREADY AS A PRESIDENTIA

08:40.367 --> 08:40.600
CANDIDATE.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.200
I DON'T.

08:41.200 --> 08:45.100
I THINK HE CAN EXPLAIN -

08:45.100 --> 08:47.367
AWARENESS OF THE BRIDGE LANE

08:47.367 --> 08:49.200
CLOSURES DOES NOT RISE TOO FAR

08:49.200 --> 08:52.767
ABOVE WHERE IT IS RIGHT NOW, I

08:52.767 --> 08:54.300
THINK HE CAN RIDE THIS OUT AND

08:54.300 --> 08:56.300
THERE ARE SOME WHO THINK HE'

08:56.300 --> 08:58.100
LOOKING STRONG AND FIRM AN

08:58.100 --> 08:59.600
TOUGH IN DEALING WITH A CRISIS

08:59.600 --> 09:02.033
IF THAT RISES FURTHER OR I

09:02.033 --> 09:04.833
OTHER MAYORS START COMING OUT OF

09:04.833 --> 09:06.967
THE WOOD WORK SAYING HE PUNISHED

09:06.967 --> 09:08.700
ME IN THIS FASHION AND ME IN

09:08.700 --> 09:12.500
THIS FASHION, THIS COULD ALL B

09:12.500 --> 09:15.833
THE END OF CHRIS CHRISTIE'

NATIONAL AMBITION.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.900

09:40.900 --> 09:41.900
ATTACKS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

09:41.900 --> 09:44.100
MORE EXTENSIVE THAN WE CURRENTLY

09:44.100 --> 09:44.400
KNOW

09:44.400 --> 09:45.633
SOME BELIEVE THE BEST WAY TO

09:45.633 --> 09:47.700
FIGHT BACK IS TO USE THE SAM

09:47.700 --> 09:49.100

10:42.000 --> 10:44.467
THEY CAN STEAL YOUR CUSTOMER

10:44.467 --> 10:46.200
LIST AND YOUR INTERNAL ANALYSI

10:46.200 --> 10:48.400
OF WHAT THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS ARE

10:48.400 --> 10:49.233
IN YOUR PRODUCT.

10:49.233 --> 10:51.033
IT IS PRETTY SCARY

10:51.033 --> 10:53.133
>> THE BAD GUYS ARE MOSTLY

10:53.133 --> 10:55.800
WORKING FOR CHINA AND FORMER

10:55.800 --> 10:57.100
THEY ARE WELL TRAINED.

10:57.100 --> 10:59.400
SOME OF THEM ARE PROTECTED BY OR

10:59.400 --> 11:00.900
WORKING FOR THEIR GOVERNMENTS SO

11:00.900 --> 11:02.167
THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT GETTIN

11:02.167 --> 11:04.933
CAUGHT AND THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO

11:04.933 --> 11:06.167
DO EVEN MORE THAN STEA

11:06.167 --> 11:07.433
INFORMATION FROM BUSINESSES.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.833
SECURITY EXPERTS WORRY THAT THEY

11:09.833 --> 11:12.233
COULD CRIPPLE THE BANKING SYSTEM

11:12.233 --> 11:17.400
OR SHUT DOWN PARTS OF TH

11:17.400 --> 11:18.833
ELECTRIC GRID.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.200
THEY SAY AMERICAN BUSINESSES

11:20.200 --> 11:21.433
NEED A NEW MIND SET.

11:21.433 --> 11:23.933
>> I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT THE

11:23.933 --> 11:25.633
BEST DEFENSE IS AN OFFENSE

11:25.633 --> 11:27.367
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A

11:27.367 --> 11:28.633
OFFENSE, WE HAVE GOT TO HAVE

11:28.633 --> 11:30.633
PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY TALENTED

11:30.633 --> 11:32.067
DRAWN TO THAT FIELD.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.467
>> PEOPLE LIKE THESE

11:34.467 --> 11:36.000
UNDERGRADUATES WHO JUST MIGHT BE

11:36.000 --> 11:37.567
ABLE TO SAVE AMERICA'S

11:37.567 --> 11:38.200
CORPORATIONS AND GOVERNMENTS

11:38.200 --> 11:40.600
FROM THE BAD GUY HACKERS

11:40.600 --> 11:43.600
THEY ARE STUDENTS AT ONE OF TH

11:43.600 --> 11:45.133
NATION'S TOP COMPUTER SCIENC

11:45.133 --> 11:46.133
SCHOOLS AND THEY'RE LEARNING T

11:46.133 --> 11:48.033
FIGHT OFF THE BAD GUYS B

11:48.033 --> 11:49.933
THINKING THE SAME WAY THEY DO.

11:49.933 --> 11:51.733
THEY'RE LEARNING TO BE THE GOO

11:51.733 --> 11:52.600
GUY HACKERS.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.200
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND BE

11:54.200 --> 11:57.233
ABLE TO ANTICIPATE HOW ATTACKERS

11:57.233 --> 11:58.633
ARE GOING TO COME AT YOU

11:58.633 --> 12:00.533
IF YOU DON'T LOOK AT OFFENSE A

12:00.533 --> 12:02.667
ALL AND YOU'RE ALWAYS REACTING

12:02.667 --> 12:04.100
YOU'RE ALWAYS ONE STEP BEHIND.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.167
>> IS THAT A CHANGE IN THE WAY

12:06.167 --> 12:07.633
THAT THEY HAVE APPROACHED THIS

12:07.633 --> 12:09.167
>> TRADITIONALLY, YEAH

12:09.167 --> 12:11.433
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A LOT O

12:11.433 --> 12:13.367
EXPERTISE AND IT HAS NOT BEE

12:13.367 --> 12:14.833
TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY LEVEL

12:14.833 --> 12:17.433
>> WHAT AN ATTACKER WANTS TO D

12:17.433 --> 12:18.400
IS RUN A SHOW.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.767
>> IT'S TOUGH STUFF TO TEACH

12:20.767 --> 12:22.667
BECAUSE THE BRAND NEW CUTTIN

12:22.667 --> 12:24.467
EDGE CYBER ATTACK OF TODAY WIL

12:24.467 --> 12:26.967
BE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WITH

12:26.967 --> 12:28.900
WEB BROUSER BY NEXT WEEK

12:28.900 --> 12:31.100
>> WE DON'T HAVE TEXT BOOKS.

12:31.100 --> 12:32.533
EVERYTHING IS SO NEW WE HAVE T

12:32.533 --> 12:34.833
GO OUT AND LOOK AT WEBSITES AN

12:34.833 --> 12:36.833
THE LATEST THINGS FROM

12:36.833 --> 12:38.167
CONFERENCES AND TEACH FROM THAT.

12:38.167 --> 12:39.267
EVERY YEAR IT'S A SIGNIFICAN

12:39.267 --> 12:39.633
UPDATE

12:39.633 --> 12:42.000
>> IS IT EVER THE CASE THAT YO

12:42.000 --> 12:44.633
ACTUALLY HAVE A STUDENT DISCOVER

12:44.633 --> 12:45.633
SOMETHING THAT NOBODY KNEW ABOUT

12:45.633 --> 12:48.000
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEMESTER?

12:48.000 --> 12:49.967
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY A COURS

12:49.967 --> 12:50.233
REQUIREMENT.

12:50.233 --> 12:52.567
ONE OF THE THINGS WE ASK FOR I

12:52.567 --> 12:55.133
GO OUT AND FIND A VULNERABILITY,

12:55.133 --> 12:58.267
FIND OUT IF IT'S EXPLOITABLE AND

12:58.267 --> 12:59.433
REPORT IT ETHICALLY.

12:59.433 --> 13:01.333
>> THEY ARE SEEING IF THEY CAN

13:01.333 --> 13:02.600
BREAK INTO SOMEONE'S COMPUTE

13:02.600 --> 13:04.200
AND TELL THE PROGRAMMER HERE I

13:04.200 --> 13:04.833
A FLAW

13:04.833 --> 13:05.133
FIX IT

13:05.133 --> 13:08.467
>> ALL OF THE FLAWS THAT THE

13:08.467 --> 13:10.433
FIND DON'T NECESSARILY MEAN THAT

13:10.433 --> 13:14.467
THE SOFTWARE ON YOUR PC IS BADLY

13:14.467 --> 13:14.633
WRITTEN.

13:14.633 --> 13:16.067
ALMOST EVERY MACHINE, EVER

13:16.067 --> 13:18.933
PIECE OF SOFTWARE HA

13:18.933 --> 13:20.267
VULNERABILITIES THAT CAN B

13:20.267 --> 13:20.967
EXPLOITED FROM OUTSIDE

13:20.967 --> 13:22.633
WHEN A MACHINE IS CONNECTED TO

13:22.633 --> 13:24.833
THE INTERNET, IT'S ALMOS

13:24.833 --> 13:27.067
IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT PERFECTL

13:27.067 --> 13:27.367
SECURE

13:27.367 --> 13:29.367
WHAT'S MORE COMPARED TO 10 OR 20

13:29.367 --> 13:31.267
YEARS AGO, THERE ARE JUST SO

13:31.267 --> 13:33.367
MANY MORE COMPUTERS AND TABLET

13:33.367 --> 13:34.800
AND SMART PHONES

13:34.800 --> 13:37.400
ALL OF THEM CONNECTED AND ALL OF

13:37.400 --> 13:40.167
THEM VULNERABLE, WHICH MEANS

13:40.167 --> 13:45.000
WE'RE VULNERABLE, TOO.

13:45.000 --> 13:49.667
>> STUDENTS ARE SO GOOD THAT THE

13:49.667 --> 13:53.667
NSA ENLISTED THEM TO CREATE

13:53.667 --> 13:55.933
GAME TO TEACH ANTI-HACKING

13:55.933 --> 13:57.367
SKILLS TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR TH

14:13.633 --> 14:16.200
TEAM WON TOP HONORS AT

INTERNATIONAL CONTESTS THAT PI

DEMOLISHED THE COMPETITION I

14:23.933 --> 14:24.467
LAS VEGAS.

14:24.467 --> 14:29.433
>> IT'S LIKE A CYBER WAR THAT IS

14:29.433 --> 14:35.700
GOING ON

14:35.700 --> 14:38.567

THERE IS ALL SORTS OF GOVERNMENT

14:48.333 --> 14:49.500
CONTRACTORS THAT HAVE TEAMS THAT

14:49.500 --> 14:50.633
WE COMPETE WITH.

14:50.633 --> 14:58.833
THEY DO THIS PROFESSIONALLY.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.200
>> IT WAS ORIGINALLY MEANT A

15:01.200 --> 15:01.667
PRAISE

15:01.667 --> 15:02.833
THE STUDENTS SAY -

15:02.833 --> 15:04.800
>> WE DON'T THINK OF IT AS A BAD

15:04.800 --> 15:05.033
THING.

15:05.033 --> 15:06.767
WE THINK OF IT AS GETTING

15:06.767 --> 15:08.600
DEEPER UNDERSTANDING FOR HOW

15:08.600 --> 15:09.933
SOMETHING WORKS IN ORDER TO MAKE

15:09.933 --> 15:11.433
IT DO SOMETHING THAT MAYBE I

15:11.433 --> 15:14.467
WAS NOT INTENDED TO DO BUT I

15:14.467 --> 15:15.600
CAPABLE OF

15:15.600 --> 15:16.933
>> AS YOUNG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

15:16.933 --> 15:19.433
THEY STARTED GOOFING AROUND WITH

15:19.433 --> 15:21.233
ELECTRONICS OR COMPUTERS AND

15:21.233 --> 15:23.167
FIGURING OUT HOW TO DO SIMPL

15:23.167 --> 15:24.867
ATTACKS AND HOW TO GET INSIDE OF

15:24.867 --> 15:25.300
A MACHINE.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.667
>> ANDREW IS A INVESTIGATIVE

15:27.667 --> 15:29.600
REPORTER WHO HAS WRITTEN DOZEN

15:29.600 --> 15:33.033
OF ARTICLES ABOUT HACKERS AN

15:33.033 --> 15:33.400
CYBER SECURITY

15:33.400 --> 15:35.233

15:35.233 --> 15:37.567
GOING TO BE A GOOD OR BAD HACKER

15:37.567 --> 15:39.333
AND THERE'S NOT THAT MUC

15:39.333 --> 15:41.600
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM IN TERMS

15:41.600 --> 15:44.267
OF THEIR ABILITIES BUT HUG

15:44.267 --> 15:45.133
DIFFERENCE IN MOTIVATIONS.

15:45.133 --> 15:46.833
>> THAT RAISES THE QUESTION OF

15:46.833 --> 15:49.267
HOW WISE IT IS TO TEACH THES

15:49.267 --> 15:50.800
ABILITIES TO STUDENTS BARELY OUT

15:50.800 --> 15:54.733
OF THEIR TEENS WITH UNKNOW

15:54.733 --> 15:54.967
MOTIVATIONS.

15:54.967 --> 15:56.667
A GRADUATE STUDENT SAYS NOT TO

15:56.667 --> 15:57.200
WORRY.

15:57.200 --> 16:00.700
>> IF YOU'RE FIGURING OUT HOW TO

16:00.700 --> 16:02.733
ATTACK THINGS, IS IT POSSIBL

16:02.733 --> 16:04.333
THAT SOMEBODY WHO COMES OUT OF

16:04.333 --> 16:05.633
HERE ISN'T GOING TO DO IT FO

16:05.633 --> 16:07.400
THE RIGHT REASONS?

16:07.400 --> 16:09.167
>> IF THAT PERSON IS MOTIVATED

16:09.167 --> 16:10.733
THEY CAN FIND IT OUT ON THEI

16:10.733 --> 16:11.100
OWN.

16:11.100 --> 16:14.200
THIS IS NOT HIDDEN INFORMATION

16:14.200 --> 16:17.500
A PERSON CAN TAKE NORMAL COURSES

16:17.500 --> 16:19.700
AND ADD THE HOW AM I GOING T

16:19.700 --> 16:21.900
RUIN THE WORLD MIND SET TO IT.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.233
IT'S THE SAME WAY A LOCK SMITH

16:24.233 --> 16:27.100
WHO KNOWS HOW TO FIX LOCKS CAN

16:27.100 --> 16:27.700
BREAK INTO THEM.

16:27.700 --> 16:30.000
>> SOMETIMES IT MAKES SENSE FO

16:30.000 --> 16:31.867
A COMPANY THAT HAS BEEN TH

16:31.867 --> 16:33.733
TARGET TO ENGAGE IN A LITTLE

16:33.733 --> 16:35.900
DIGITAL BREAKING AND ENTERING OF

16:35.900 --> 16:36.633
ITS OWN.

16:36.633 --> 16:37.633
TO HACK BACK

16:37.633 --> 16:39.933
HE THINKS IT COULD BE AN

16:39.933 --> 16:42.933
IMPORTANT WEAPON IN THE CYBE

16:42.933 --> 16:43.967
SECURITY ARSENAL

16:43.967 --> 16:47.400
IT IS NOT ALWAYS SO CLEAR CU

16:47.400 --> 16:48.400
BECAUSE IT CAN VIOLATE FEDERAL

16:48.400 --> 16:49.000
SECURITY LAWS.

16:49.000 --> 16:52.433
>> I HAVE BEEN MAKING IT VER

16:52.433 --> 16:57.267
PUBLIC ARGUMENT THAT WE SHOULD

16:57.267 --> 17:00.767
ALLOW THIS

17:00.767 --> 17:02.933
>> WHAT IF THIS IS OUTSIDE THE

17:02.933 --> 17:03.533
U.S.

17:03.533 --> 17:06.367
IS THAT STILL A VIOLATION IN THE

17:06.367 --> 17:06.700
ACT?

17:06.700 --> 17:08.500
>> GOOD GUY HACKERS WHO HAVE

17:08.500 --> 17:09.867
HACKED BACK HAVE LEARNED THA

17:09.867 --> 17:11.300
CYBER CRIMINALS ARE NOT ALWAYS

17:11.300 --> 17:13.233
AS CLEVER AS THEY SEEM TO BE

17:13.233 --> 17:16.033
TAKE THE EXAMPLE OF A HACKER WHO

17:16.033 --> 17:17.267
BROKE INTO LAW ENFORCEMENT

17:17.267 --> 17:19.167
COMPUTERS, COPIED PERSONAL

17:19.167 --> 17:20.333
INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICERS AND

17:20.333 --> 17:21.567
POSTED IT ONLINE

17:21.567 --> 17:24.167
HE ALSO LEFT A PROVOCATIVE

17:24.167 --> 17:25.733
PICTURE OF HIS GIRLFRIEND AS A

17:25.733 --> 17:27.100
CALLING CARD, WHICH TURNED OUT

17:27.100 --> 17:28.333
TO BE A MISTAKE.

17:28.333 --> 17:33.300
>> THEY TOOK THE PICTURE WITH AN

17:33.300 --> 17:33.900
iPHONE

17:33.900 --> 17:38.867
AND THAT MEANT THAT SOMEBODY HAD

17:38.867 --> 17:41.000
HOPEFULLY INCLUDED THE

17:41.000 --> 17:42.400
GEOGRAPHIC COORDINATES WHERE THE

17:42.400 --> 17:43.733
PICTURE WAS TAKEN.

17:43.733 --> 17:45.233
SO THE FBI FINDS THE GIRLFRIEN

17:45.233 --> 17:54.333
OF THE HACKER AND WENT AND

17:54.333 --> 17:55.333
BUSTED THE GUY

17:55.333 --> 17:58.967
>> THE HACKER PLEADED GUILTY

17:58.967 --> 18:01.500
RECEIVED A SENTENCE OF 27 MONTHS

18:01.500 --> 18:02.633
IN PRISON.

18:02.633 --> 18:04.500
STEWART BAKER SAYS THAT'S TH

18:04.500 --> 18:06.767
KIND OF OUTCOME HE WOULD LIKE TO

18:06.767 --> 18:08.033
SEE FROM GOOD GUY HACKERS LIKE

18:08.033 --> 18:13.633
THE STUDENTS HERE.

18:13.633 --> 18:15.433
>> HERE ARE THE STUDENT HACKER

18:15.433 --> 18:17.000
WHO MAKE UP THE PLAID PARLIAMENT

18:17.000 --> 18:21.600
OF PONING.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.567
>> WE WANT TO RETURN NOW TO TH

18:23.567 --> 18:26.167
BATTLE BEING WAGED AGAINST A

18:26.167 --> 18:27.200
QAEDA FORCES

18:27.200 --> 18:31.133
FOR MORE WE ARE JOINED NOW VIA

18:31.133 --> 18:31.267
SKYPE.

18:31.267 --> 18:34.700
I KNOW IT'S ABOUT 60 MILES AWAY.

18:34.700 --> 18:35.233
WHAT'S THE SCENE IN THOSE AREA

18:35.233 --> 18:39.500
NOW?

18:39.500 --> 18:41.600
>> WELL, IN TALKING TO PEOPLE ON

18:41.600 --> 18:43.233
THE GROUND TODAY, WHAT WE AR

18:43.233 --> 18:47.833
HEARING THIS MORNING IS RAMADI

18:47.833 --> 18:52.233
THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL WAS PUT

18:52.233 --> 18:53.567
ON LOCK DOWN

18:53.567 --> 18:54.867
PEOPLE WERE TOLD NOT TO LEAV

18:54.867 --> 18:55.833
THEIR HOMES.

18:55.833 --> 18:59.067
AND A LARGE ASSAULT WAS LAUNCHED

18:59.067 --> 19:03.400
TO RETAKE POCKETS OF THE CIT

19:03.400 --> 19:05.267
THAT ARE STILL UNDER CONTROL O

19:05.267 --> 19:06.500
REBEL GROUPS

19:06.500 --> 19:15.167
AND FIGHTERS AFFILIATED WITH THE

19:15.167 --> 19:17.900
LOCAL AL QAEDA AFFILIATE

19:17.900 --> 19:21.033
MOST OF RAMADI ALREADY WAS UNDER

19:21.033 --> 19:24.267
CONTROL OF PRO GOVERNMEN

19:24.267 --> 19:26.333
TRIBESMEN, SO SOME POCKETS WER

19:26.333 --> 19:27.633
OUT OF THEIR CONTROL

19:27.633 --> 19:30.167
SO THIS IS A LARGE OFFENSIVE

19:30.167 --> 19:34.033
BACKED BY HELICOPTERS TRYING T

19:34.033 --> 19:35.000
REGAIN THEIR CITY.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.700
>> THESE ARE MOSTLY SUNN

19:38.700 --> 19:39.567
TRIBESMEN?

19:39.567 --> 19:40.133
>> Reporter: YES

19:40.133 --> 19:44.333
IT IS A LARGELY SUNNI PROVINCE

19:44.333 --> 19:47.433
IRAQ IS LARGELY SHIA, BUT THIS
