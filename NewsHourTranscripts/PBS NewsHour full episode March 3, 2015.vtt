THAT'S THE OUTLINE OF A DEAL    
THAT I THINK THE PRIME MINISTER 

15:15.093 --> 15:16.722
THAT'S THE OUTLINE OF A DEAL    
THAT I THINK THE PRIME MINISTER 
SAID PAVES THE WAY TO A BOMB.   

15:16.725 --> 15:20.387
THAT I THINK THE PRIME MINISTER 
SAID PAVES THE WAY TO A BOMB.

ABILITY TO SELL THE DEAL AT

15:57.901 --> 15:59.298
THAT MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR
THEM TO NEGOTIATE.              
AND I THINK THE IRANIANS CAN    

15:59.300 --> 16:01.930

THERE IS AN OPPORNITYTU FOR A

I THINK IT IS STILL THE CASE    

16:44.341 --> 16:46.271
DEAL HERE.                      
I THINK IT IS STILL THE CASE    
THAT IN SOME SENSE THE          

16:46.273 --> 16:49.503
I THINK IT IS STILL THE CASE    
THAT IN SOME SENSE THE          
ALTERNATIVES FOR BOTH PARTIES   

16:49.505 --> 16:49.902
THAT IN SOME SENSE THE          
ALTERNATIVES FOR BOTH PARTIES   
ATTRACTIVE.                     

16:49.905 --> 16:51.402
ALTERNATIVES FOR BOTH PARTIES   
ATTRACTIVE.                     
I THINK IT WILL BE A CHALLENGE  

16:51.404 --> 16:52.768
ATTRACTIVE.                     
I THINK IT WILL BE A CHALLENGE  
FOR THE UNITED STATES TO KEEP   

16:52.770 --> 16:54.600
I THINK IT WILL BE A CHALLENGE  
FOR THE UNITED STATES TO KEEP   
SANCTIONS IN PLACE, AND, OF     

16:54.602 --> 16:56.332
FOR THE UNITED STATES TO KEEP   
SANCTIONS IN PLACE, AND, OF     
COURSE, WITHOUT A DEAL IRAN DOES

16:56.334 --> 16:58.864
SANCTIONS IN PLACE, AND, OF     
COURSE, WITHOUT A DEAL IRAN DOES
NOT GET POTENTIALLY RELAXATION  

16:58.866 --> 16:59.863
COURSE, WITHOUT A DEAL IRAN DOES
NOT GET POTENTIALLY RELAXATION  
OF SANCTIONS.                   

16:59.865 --> 17:01.729
NOT GET POTENTIALLY RELAXATION  
OF SANCTIONS.                   
SO I THINK THERE'S STILL A      

17:01.731 --> 17:03.262
OF SANCTIONS.                   
SO I THINK THERE'S STILL A      
REASONABLE CHANCE THAT WE WILL  

17:03.264 --> 17:05.027
SO I THINK THERE'S STILL A      
REASONABLE CHANCE THAT WE WILL  
GET AN AGREEMENT.               

17:05.029 --> 17:08.359
REASONABLE CHANCE THAT WE WILL  
GET AN AGREEMENT.               
THE QUESTION IS: CAN THE        

17:08.361 --> 17:09.192
GET AN AGREEMENT.               
THE QUESTION IS: CAN THE        
CONGRESS... WILL THE PRESIDENT  

17:09.194 --> 17:10.224
THE QUESTION IS: CAN THE        
CONGRESS... WILL THE PRESIDENT  
OF THE UNITED STATES BE ABLE TO

WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THEY CAN BE
ACHIEVED?

17:20.554 --> 17:21.917
ACHIEVED?                       
>> I THINK CHANCES ARE NARROW.  
I THINK THERE IS A CHANCE THEY  

17:21.919 --> 17:26.748

I THINK THERE IS A CHANCE THEY  
AGREE TO SOME KIND OF A FORMULA 

17:26.750 --> 17:29.180
I THINK THERE IS A CHANCE THEY  
AGREE TO SOME KIND OF A FORMULA 
THAT WOULD EXTEND THE           

17:29.182 --> 17:30.413
AGREE TO SOME KIND OF A FORMULA 
THAT WOULD EXTEND THE           
NEGOTIATIONS AND GIVE GAINS TO  

17:30.415 --> 17:32.345
THAT WOULD EXTEND THE           
NEGOTIATIONS AND GIVE GAINS TO  
BOTH SIDES, BUT AGAIN, THE      

17:32.347 --> 17:36.176
NEGOTIATIONS AND GIVE GAINS TO  
BOTH SIDES, BUT AGAIN, THE      
DILEMMA IS THAT THE WAY IT'S    

17:36.178 --> 17:39.074
BOTH SIDES, BUT AGAIN, THE      
DILEMMA IS THAT THE WAY IT'S    
HAPPENING NOW IS THAT THE       

17:39.076 --> 17:40.373
DILEMMA IS THAT THE WAY IT'S    
HAPPENING NOW IS THAT THE       
IRANIANS, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

HAPPENING NOW IS THAT THE       
IRANIANS, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

HAVE TO DECIDE.                 

18:05.661 --> 18:06.891
THEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL   
HAVE TO DECIDE.
