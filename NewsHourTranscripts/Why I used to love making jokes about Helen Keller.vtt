GEORGINA KLEEGE, LECTURER,
UC BERKELEY DEPARTMENT
OF ENGLISH: It's a common
experience for people

00:11.966 --> 00:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with disabilities to feel that
they are being stared at or to
notice they are being stared

00:12.500 --> 00:14.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at.

00:14.500 --> 00:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in fact, blind people
can feel that, too, a kind of
collective intake of breath even

00:16.100 --> 00:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if nobody says anything, you can
tell when you attract attention.

00:22.733 --> 00:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am legally blind, I
became legally blind, I was
diagnosed when I was 11.

00:33.166 --> 00:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I probably lost my vision
gradually over a few years.

00:36.733 --> 00:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember feeling that I
wasn't supposed to feel anything
about it, because there wasn't

00:42.633 --> 00:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anything anybody could do.

00:44.500 --> 00:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My complicated relationship
with Helen Keller
came from childhood.

00:48.233 --> 00:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She was held up as this
role model that she
was deaf and blind, but
she was always cheerful

00:54.733 --> 00:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and she did well in school and
you never heard her complain.

00:58.066 --> 00:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I took this very personally.

00:59.600 --> 01:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I took this as a
reproach towards me.

01:04.100 --> 01:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I hated Helen Keller and I
loved Helen Keller jokes and
I, you know, told them with

01:12.033 --> 01:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relish in the schoolyard.

01:14.766 --> 01:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started to wonder if I
had been unfair to Helen
Keller when I was a child.

01:21.933 --> 01:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I ended up writing a book
about her, which is a series
of letters by me, to her, and

01:28.333 --> 01:30.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she doesn't write back
because she's dead.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's basically me asking
questions about different
moments in her life
and calling her out and

01:39.600 --> 01:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
asking her to explain herself.

01:42.366 --> 01:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so, it was a way for me to
enter her life imaginatively.

01:47.233 --> 01:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I tell my students all the
time that they should tell
their friends not to text while

01:54.233 --> 01:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
walking because I am always
bumping into people who
are texting while walking.

02:00.366 --> 02:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then they make themselves
a hazard to blind people,
because I am counting on all

02:04.800 --> 02:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the other pedestrians to pay
attention, to see me coming
and to get out of my way.

02:13.166 --> 02:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think there is still
discrimination in
all sorts of arenas.

02:17.700 --> 02:22.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's problems with access
to Web sites and electronic
media and so on and so forth,

02:24.166 --> 02:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
captioning, audio description.

02:26.166 --> 02:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The technology exists, people
know how to do this, but
it's not as if everything is

02:31.633 --> 02:33.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
made accessible.

02:33.766 --> 02:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem is that
people's understanding of
blindness is very limited.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's the sort of
joke scenario of a blind
person coming to an
intersection and somebody

02:46.633 --> 02:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grabbing their arm and leading
them across the street when
in fact they wanted to go

02:49.966 --> 02:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a different direction.

02:53.200 --> 02:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's never happened to me
and I think part of it is jus
that I tend to look like I know

02:59.133 --> 03:01.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
where I'm going.

03:01.033 --> 03:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I
would agree with that.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

03:06.133 --> 03:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KLEEGE: My name is Georgina
Kleege and this is my brief but
spectacular take on blindness.

03:11.433 --> 03:14.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(END VIDEOTAPE)

03:14.133 --> 03:19.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

thank you, Georgina.
