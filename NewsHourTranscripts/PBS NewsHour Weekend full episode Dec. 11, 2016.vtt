04:44.600 --> 04:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FED HAS TO BE MUCH MORE

04:45.900 --> 04:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINDFUL OF BOTH OF THOSE

04:48.033 --> 04:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:49.333 --> 04:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ABOUT THE FED ACCUSED IT BEING

04:57.567 --> 04:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:09.600 --> 05:11.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE RECORD LET'S FACT CHECK

05:11.267 --> 05:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FED IS NOT A POLITICAL

05:14.400 --> 05:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATION, CORRECT?

05:18.100 --> 05:19.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE FED IS AN INDEPENDENT

05:19.767 --> 05:20.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

APPOINTED BY THE PRESIDENT AND

05:23.200 --> 05:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMED BY CONGRESS.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEY ARE INTENTIONALLY

INSULATED FROM SHORT TERM

05:28.333 --> 05:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL PRESSURE AND THERE IS

05:29.567 --> 05:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY OF THEIR

05:30.933 --> 05:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECISION MAKING IS THE RESULT OF

05:32.900 --> 05:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL PRESSURE.

05:34.000 --> 05:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

END OF HER TERM.

05:47.100 --> 05:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DONALD TRUMP WILL BE ABLE TO

05:50.100 --> 05:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILL TWO SEATS, BUT

05:51.533 --> 05:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS

05:52.533 --> 05:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFUSED TO HOLD HEARINGS ON

05:53.933 --> 05:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE NOMINATIONS SO THOSE TWO

05:56.033 --> 05:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VACANCIES ARE STILL THERE.

05:57.033 --> 05:58.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INTERESTING QUESTION IS WHO

05:58.167 --> 05:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WANTS ON THE FED.

05:59.700 --> 06:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP IS BY

06:01.133 --> 06:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATURE AND BY HIS LONG CAREER A

06:02.800 --> 06:03.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BORROWER.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE KIND OF GUY WHO GENERALLY

06:05.200 --> 06:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE THOUGHT TO FAVOR LOWER

06:07.300 --> 06:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEREST RATES.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE NOW LEADS THE PARTY OF

06:10.133 --> 06:11.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LENDERS, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,

06:11.367 --> 06:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH HAS LONG THOUGHT THAT

06:12.733 --> 06:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FISCAL AND MONETARY POLICY

06:14.000 --> 06:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULD BE A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER.

06:15.633 --> 06:17.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT WOULD TEND TO ARGUE FOR

06:17.167 --> 06:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TYPE OF GOVERNOR WHO MIGHT

06:20.100 --> 06:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO RAISE INTEREST RATES A

06:21.800 --> 06:22.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE MORE QUICKLY.

06:22.667 --> 06:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HOW THAT BALANCE PLAYS OUT

06:25.100 --> 06:26.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BETWEEN WHO DONALD TRUMP IS AS A

06:26.467 --> 06:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
