>> Sreenivasan: TOMORROW, U.S.

00:01.568 --> 00:02.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS ARE

00:02.569 --> 00:04.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTED TO BEGIN FOUR DAYS OF

00:04.237 --> 00:05.872 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONWIDE RAIDS TARGETING

00:05.872 --> 00:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TEENAGERS SUSPECTED OF BELONGING

00:08.541 --> 00:09.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GANGS.

00:09.743 --> 00:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PLAN IS OUTLINED IN A

00:10.977 --> 00:12.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY

00:12.512 --> 00:14.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOCUMENT SEEN BY REUTERS.

00:14.614 --> 00:16.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTER JULIA EDWARDS AINSLEY

00:16.116 --> 00:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROKE THE STORY AND JOINS ME NOW

00:17.150 --> 00:17.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM WASHINGTON.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN AND HOW IS

00:19.252 --> 00:20.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS DIFFERENT?

00:20.653 --> 00:22.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE DOCUMENT OUTLINES SEVERAL

00:22.555 --> 00:24.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEY DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS THEY WANT

00:24.391 --> 00:26.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE TARGETED IN THESE RAIDS BY

00:26.393 --> 00:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I.C.E. AGENTS.

00:27.794 --> 00:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONE THAT WAS THE MOST

00:29.596 --> 00:31.464 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRIKING DEPARTURE FROM POLICY

00:31.464 --> 00:32.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE SAW UNDER THE PREVIOUS

00:32.565 --> 00:34.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION IS THE TARGETING

00:34.501 --> 00:36.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF 16- AND 17-YEAR-OLDS WHO ARE

00:36.469 --> 00:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPECTED OF GANG ACTIVITY.

00:38.938 --> 00:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. IMMIGRATIONS TOLD ME THAT

00:40.907 --> 00:42.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN MEET TWO OR MORE

00:42.609 --> 00:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITERIA.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE CRITERIA COULD BE THINGS

00:45.111 --> 00:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE A GANG TATTOO, WEARING GANG

00:46.946 --> 00:49.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPAREL, OR JUST HANGING OUT IN

00:49.149 --> 00:50.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN AREA THAT'S FREQUENTED BY

00:50.350 --> 00:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GANGS.

00:51.284 --> 00:53.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO OF COURSE THERE ARE A NUMBER

00:53.086 --> 00:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF IMMIGRATION LAWYERS AND CIVIL

00:54.821 --> 00:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHTS AND CIVIL LIBERTIES

00:56.122 --> 00:57.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAWYERS WHO ARE SAYING THAT IS

00:57.323 --> 01:01.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ENOUGH TO FIND SOMEONE -- TO

01:01.094 --> 01:02.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKE SOMEONE A TARGET FOR

01:02.729 --> 01:04.898 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTATION, ESPECIALLY A MINOR.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: HOW DIFFERENT IS

01:06.332 --> 01:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS FROM THE OBAMA

01:07.600 --> 01:09.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION'S INTERESTS?

01:09.436 --> 01:10.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS THE THRESHOLD THERE

01:10.837 --> 01:13.073 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERSUS WHAT THIS IS?

01:13.073 --> 01:13.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO IT'S INTERESTING, AS I

01:13.973 --> 01:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WENT BACK AND I READ THE

01:14.574 --> 01:17.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOVEMBER 2014 PRIORITIES FOR

01:17.243 --> 01:20.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPORTATION THAT OBAMA SET OUT.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT DID MENTION 16- AND

01:21.748 --> 01:23.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
17-YEAR-OLDS, BUT THEY WERE

01:23.116 --> 01:25.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN CONVICTED OF

01:25.251 --> 01:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A GANG-RELATED CRIME.

01:26.853 --> 01:28.121 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS HIS WAY OF SAYING THAT

01:28.121 --> 01:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTHOUGH THESE PEOPLE ARE

01:30.590 --> 01:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MINORS, THEY'VE ENTERED ANOTHER

01:32.625 --> 01:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CATEGORY BY COMMITTING A CRIME,

01:34.427 --> 01:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE WHEN WE SEE A JUVENILE GETS

01:36.362 --> 01:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AN ADULT KIND OF SENTENCE IN

01:37.630 --> 01:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURT.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS CHANGES THAT, OF COURSE,

01:40.100 --> 01:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THESE ARE PEOPLE JUST

01:41.067 --> 01:42.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPECTED OF GANG ACTIVITY.

01:42.635 --> 01:44.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IF YOU ARE IN

01:44.070 --> 01:45.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEIGHBORHOODS, BECAUSE YOU

01:45.438 --> 01:47.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIVE THERE, THAT ALREADY KIND OF

01:47.207 --> 01:48.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHECKS OFF ONE OF THE BOXES,

01:48.708 --> 01:49.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT?

01:49.576 --> 01:50.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO BASICALLY YOU CAN'T ESCAPE

01:50.977 --> 01:52.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEIGHBORHOOD AND MOVE

01:52.412 --> 01:53.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEWHERE ELSE TOMORROW TO GET

01:53.980 --> 01:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY FROM THESE RAIDS.

01:55.682 --> 01:56.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I KNOW, I THINK THAT WAS

01:56.416 --> 01:58.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY THE MOST STRIKING THING

01:58.384 --> 01:59.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT I SAW ON THAT LIST, WAS

01:59.886 --> 02:01.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HANGING OUT IN THESE PLACES

02:01.955 --> 02:03.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOTORIOUS FOR GANG ACTIVITY.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THAT COULD BE A

02:04.958 --> 02:05.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHOOLYARD, THAT COULD BE RIGHT

02:05.525 --> 02:07.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUTSIDE OF YOUR PUBLIC SCHOOL.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COULD BE A PARKING LOT OF A

02:08.661 --> 02:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROCERY STORE WHERE YOUR FAMILY

02:10.530 --> 02:11.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD FREQUENT.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE'S

02:12.599 --> 02:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY NO WAY TO GET AROUND

02:13.700 --> 02:15.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS I WAS TOLD, THERE ARE A

02:16.703 --> 02:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF PEOPLE, PARTICULARLY

02:18.171 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE WHO HAVE FLED VIOLENCE, IN

02:19.439 --> 02:21.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACES LIKE EL SALVADOR WITH THE

02:21.207 --> 02:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOTORIOUS MS-13 GANG, THAT HAS

02:23.376 --> 02:24.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRONG ROOTS IN THE UNITED

02:24.344 --> 02:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES, A LOT OF TIMES THOSE

02:25.778 --> 02:27.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE COME HERE, LIVE IN

02:27.447 --> 02:28.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITIES OF OTHER EL

02:28.848 --> 02:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SALVADORANS, WITH PEOPLE WITH

02:30.316 --> 02:31.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRONG TIES TO THAT GANG.

02:31.951 --> 02:33.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

02:33.353 --> 02:34.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET A TATTOO, OR THEIR LIVES

02:34.754 --> 02:36.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE THREATENED.

02:36.823 --> 02:37.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: APPAREL, I MEAN,

02:37.524 --> 02:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT GOES

02:38.591 --> 02:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK TO, BACK WHEN THIS

02:39.826 --> 02:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVERSATION WAS BETWEEN THE

02:41.127 --> 02:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRIPS AND THE BLOODS IN L.A., IN

02:42.862 --> 02:44.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE '80s AND '90s.

02:44.397 --> 02:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OH, WHAT ARE THE COLORS, WHAT'S

02:45.632 --> 02:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNIFORM.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT.

02:48.201 --> 02:49.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DO ACTUALLY REMEMBER BEING IN

02:49.369 --> 02:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHERE THERE

02:50.503 --> 02:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A RULE IN MY PUBLIC SCHOOL,

02:52.272 --> 02:53.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK, AGAINST WEARING ALL

02:53.339 --> 02:54.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLUE OR ALL RED, BECAUSE THOSE

02:54.574 --> 02:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE DAYS WHERE THAT WAS SEEN AS

02:56.342 --> 02:57.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A GANG AFFILIATION.

02:57.777 --> 02:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THIS ALSO COULD HAVE

02:58.811 --> 02:59.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGED.

02:59.712 --> 03:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF GANGS THAT

03:00.713 --> 03:02.182 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREN'T AS OVERT.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THESE AREN'T

03:03.183 --> 03:04.684 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGAL DEFINITIONS OF WHAT MAKES

03:04.684 --> 03:06.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEONE A GANG MEMBER, AND IT'S

03:06.085 --> 03:07.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT EVEN ILLEGAL TO BE A GANG

03:07.320 --> 03:08.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEMBER.

03:08.488 --> 03:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AT THIS POINT, I.C.E.-- U.S.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS

03:11.558 --> 03:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENFORCEMENT, CAN WRITE THE RULES

03:13.459 --> 03:15.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER WHOEVER THEY WANT TO TARGET

03:15.195 --> 03:17.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY A CRIME TO

03:17.230 --> 03:18.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE IN THE UNITED STATES

03:18.565 --> 03:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ILLEGALLY, AND SO THEREFORE THEY

03:20.366 --> 03:21.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN COME UP WITH DIFFERENT

03:21.768 --> 03:23.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CATEGORIES OF WHO THEY WANT TO

03:23.102 --> 03:25.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TARGET THAT REALLY ISN'T BASED

03:25.004 --> 03:26.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON U.S. CRIMINAL CODE IN ANY

03:26.306 --> 03:27.574 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: JULIE EDWARDS

03:28.441 --> 03:29.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AINSLEY OF REUTERS, THANKS SO

03:29.309 --> 03:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH.

03:30.143 --> 03:33.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
