PLAN IS TOO SIMILAR TO OBAMACARE

01:27.300 --> 01:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WON'T DO ENOUGH TO BRING

01:28.933 --> 01:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

RESPONSE IS THAT THE HOUSE BILL

>> WE'RE TAKING ONE ENTITLEMENT

01:57.733 --> 01:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIX.

02:20.633 --> 02:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE, NOT

02:22.300 --> 02:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COVERAGE THEY CAN AFFORD, BUT

TO THE DOCTOR.

02:28.533 --> 02:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WON'T REDUCE OUT OF POCKET COSTS

02:41.033 --> 02:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR MOST AMERICANS AND WILL CUT

KIND OF A DOUBLE EDGED SWORD.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

COULD MOVE THINGS QUICKLY

12:18.233 --> 12:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HAVE THE CRISIS OF 9/11.

THE WAY THAT THEY USED

ADMINISTRATION THINKING THAT WE

13:16.733 --> 13:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE JUST NOW TAPPED INTO A

WHOLE NEW CHAPTER OF INFORMATION

13:19.200 --> 13:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WAYS IN WHICH THE DIGITAL AGE

13:22.267 --> 13:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE TRANSFORMING THE WHOLE

13:25.500 --> 13:26.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SECRECY DOESN'T WORK IN THE

13:26.667 --> 13:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THESE DAYS.

13:34.533 --> 13:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT'S MUCH HARDER TO KEEP

13:35.933 --> 13:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING HIDDEN FOR VERY LONG.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT ENDS UP HAPPENING IS

13:39.300 --> 13:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE PRESIDENT CEDES

13:41.667 --> 13:43.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADERSHIP TO HIS OPPONENTS AND

13:43.267 --> 13:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THE MEDIA.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

REPRESENTATIVE FORM WE SO OFTEN

14:05.933 --> 14:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BORN OUT OF UNPLANNED SECRECY.

>> THAT'S SO TRUE.

14:13.033 --> 14:14.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION

14:14.567 --> 14:16.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS HELD BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.

14:16.800 --> 14:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DELEGATES CERTAINLY FELT

14:19.733 --> 14:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT HAD TO BE HELD BEHIND

14:22.133 --> 14:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSED DOORS BECAUSE THEY HAD

14:24.100 --> 14:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN ASKED BY CONGRESS ONLY TO

TWEAK WHAT WERE THEN CALLED THE

ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION.

14:30.533 --> 14:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ONCE THEY DECIDED THAT THEY

14:32.133 --> 14:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD CONSIDER AN ENTIRELY

14:33.567 --> 14:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT FORM OF GOVERNMENT, IT

14:35.100 --> 14:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY WAS AN ILLICIT MEETING IN

15:08.233 --> 15:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:12.933 --> 15:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

A YEAR-AND-A-HALF.

15:23.667 --> 15:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT DURING MUCH OF THAT TIME, HE

15:25.200 --> 15:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS STILL QUITE WEAK BUT WHAT

15:28.100 --> 15:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAME THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR

15:30.533 --> 15:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY IS THAT HE BECAME

15:31.633 --> 15:33.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRRATIONAL.

15:33.167 --> 15:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:34.133 --> 15:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASN'T UNTIL THE COLD WAR, THAT

15:35.367 --> 15:35.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRECY BECAME

15:35.867 --> 15:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CREATION OF THE CENTRAL

15:40.667 --> 15:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE AGENCY ORIGINATED

15:42.433 --> 15:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIMPLY WITH A QUEST FOR A

15:43.233 --> 15:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVENIENT DELIVERY OF

15:44.133 --> 15:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFORMATION.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ON HIS DESK EVERY MORNING,

15:48.033 --> 15:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE STACKS AND STACKS OF

15:49.533 --> 15:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY CABLES, WHICH WAS THE

15:52.100 --> 15:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEST EFFORT AT THE TIME TO GIVE

15:53.933 --> 15:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WAS

15:54.700 --> 15:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING ON IN THE WORLD.

15:57.033 --> 15:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE FOUND THEM VERY

15:57.600 --> 16:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRUSTRATING.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT HE ASKED AN AIDE TO DO

16:01.167 --> 16:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH SEEMED VERY SIMPLE AT THE

16:02.867 --> 16:05.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME WAS JUST TO FORM A SMALL

16:05.067 --> 16:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUP IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT

16:07.033 --> 16:09.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD DIGEST THOSE CABLES AND

16:09.067 --> 16:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVE HIM A FEW TYPE-WRITTEN

16:10.500 --> 16:11.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAGES EVERY MORNING TELLING HIM

16:11.667 --> 16:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS THE IMPORTANT

16:13.033 --> 16:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO HE BORROWED 15 EMPLOYEES

16:17.700 --> 16:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM ELSEWHERE IN THE GOVERNMENT

16:19.467 --> 16:20.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE CALLED THAT THE CENTRAL

16:20.167 --> 16:22.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE GROUP.

16:22.467 --> 16:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: LESS THAN TWO YEARS

16:23.700 --> 16:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATER, THIS GROUP, WHICH HAD

16:24.833 --> 16:26.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVOLVED INTO WHAT IS NOW CALLED

16:26.067 --> 16:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY,

16:27.633 --> 16:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD BEEN GRANTED THE RIGHT TO

16:29.067 --> 16:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEEP ITS SPENDING SECRET AND

16:30.500 --> 16:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPERATE WITH LITTLE OVERSIGHT.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AS HARRY TRUMAN SAID LATER,

16:34.067 --> 16:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO BE A

16:35.400 --> 16:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOAK AND DAGGER OPERATION.

16:36.600 --> 16:37.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE JUST SUPPOSED TO

16:37.267 --> 16:38.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GATHER INTELLIGENCE.

16:38.867 --> 16:39.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY WERE GATHERING

16:39.767 --> 16:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTELLIGENCE.

16:40.867 --> 16:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT FROM A VERY EARLY STAGE,

16:41.667 --> 16:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE ALSO CONDUCTING THESE

16:43.133 --> 16:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COVERT OPERATIONS THAT INVOLVED

16:46.033 --> 16:49.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIBING FOREIGN OFFICIALS.

16:49.767 --> 16:52.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATER ON BY THE '60S, IT

16:52.267 --> 16:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INVOLVED ASSASSINATION PLOTS AND

16:54.333 --> 16:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURVEILLANCE OF AMERICANS, EVEN

16:56.233 --> 16:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUGH IT WAS NOT, THE C.I.A.

16:58.533 --> 16:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE IN THAT

16:59.500 --> 17:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS.

17:01.167 --> 17:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: WITH VIETNAM AND

WATERGATE, LYNDON JOHNSON AND

17:08.633 --> 17:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRONICALLY, AS A SENATOR,

17:10.167 --> 17:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHNSON FOUGHT FOR INCREASED
