00:05.906 --> 00:09.743
JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff. Gwen Ifill is
away.

00:09.743 --> 00:14.081
On the "NewsHour" tonight: As
world leaders gather at the
United Nations, from the U.S.

00:14.081 --> 00:19.720
to Russia, how to end the war
in Syria tops the agenda.

00:19.720 --> 00:22.923
Also ahead, Margaret Warner
talks with the president of
Egypt on how to bring down the

00:22.923 --> 00:23.657
Islamic State.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.259
Plus:

00:25.259 --> 00:30.097
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: There will be major
tax reductions.

00:30.097 --> 00:36.003
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's Politics
Monday. Donald Trump unveils his
tax plan. And Hillary Clinton

00:36.003 --> 00:40.641
keeps on answering questions
about her handling of e-mails.

00:40.641 --> 00:45.946
Then: NASA solves one of the
greatest mysteries of Mars,
discovering rivers of water on
the

00:45.946 --> 00:47.414
Red PlanetMD-BO .

00:47.414 --> 00:54.154
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:54.154 --> 00:58.558
(BREAK)

00:58.558 --> 01:07.634
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
and Russian President Vladimir
Putin went to the United

01:07.634 --> 01:13.140
Nations today, where they laid
out starkly different visions on
the future of Syria.

01:13.140 --> 01:18.612
The two men addressed world
leaders, disagreeing openly on
whether Syrian President Bashar

01:18.612 --> 01:24.451
al-Assad must go or stay. Later,
they met privately. We will get
a full report on developments

01:24.451 --> 01:30.090
at the start of this big week at
the U.N. after the news summary.

01:30.090 --> 01:36.663
In other news, Wall Street had a
bad Monday over new signs of
weakness in China's economy

01:36.663 --> 01:43.637
and falling oil prices. The Dow
Jones industrial average lost
nearly 313 points to close back

01:43.637 --> 01:51.244
near 16000, down about 2
percent. The Nasdaq fell 142
points, or 3 percent. And the
S&P

01:51.244 --> 01:56.149
500 dropped 49, 2.5 percent.

01:56.149 --> 02:03.323
As the U.S. focused on Syria at
the U.N., the Taliban scored a
major coup in Afghanistan.

02:03.323 --> 02:08.261
Hundreds of fighters attacked
and captured the city of Kunduz,
a provincial capital in

02:08.261 --> 02:13.667
the north. The Taliban militants
took cell phone video of
themselves after this seizure

02:13.667 --> 02:20.340
of a major Afghan city for the
first time since the U.S.
invasion in 2001.

02:20.340 --> 02:25.312
MAN (through translator): This
is our hope. We want to build a
religious school, to build

02:25.312 --> 02:28.982
a bridge, a road, a Sharia-based
government. This is why we came
out and this is what we

02:28.982 --> 02:32.786
fought for, so that Sharia
law is enforced here.

02:32.786 --> 02:36.656
JUDY WOODRUFF: For more on the
fall of Kunduz and its
significance, I spoke earlier
this

02:36.656 --> 02:40.894
evening to freelance journalist
Sune Engel Rasmussen in Kabul.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.663
Sune, welcome.

02:43.663 --> 02:47.134
Tell us what happened. How did
the Taliban pull this off?

02:47.134 --> 02:49.903
SUNE ENGEL RASMUSSEN, Freelance
Journalist: Well, this is an
attack that started around

02:49.903 --> 02:54.007
3:00 a.m. in the morning, and
the Taliban attacked the city of
Kunduz from four different

02:54.007 --> 02:58.912
districts, three different
directions around, surrounding
the city.

02:58.912 --> 03:04.718
And around mid-morning, they
captured the regional hospital
in the city. And early in

03:04.718 --> 03:09.289
the afternoon, they'd taken the
intelligence service
headquarters, they had taken and
released

03:09.289 --> 03:13.260
hundreds of prisoners. And they
had also set fire to a U.N.
building.

03:13.260 --> 03:18.298
So, this seems to be a very
concerted effort by militant
groups from not just Kunduz, but

03:18.298 --> 03:20.967
different provinces as well, and
something that had been weeks,
if not months, in the

03:20.967 --> 03:22.202
making.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.906
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why was Kunduz
in such a vulnerable position?

03:25.906 --> 03:31.812
SUNE ENGEL RASMUSSEN: That's a
good question, but mainly -- one
of the main reasons is the

03:31.812 --> 03:37.184
withdrawal of foreign troops.
The German troops were the main
force up there. They pulled

03:37.184 --> 03:42.489
out two years ago. And, since
then, the government has had a
really hard time establishing
authority

03:42.489 --> 03:48.895
and getting people on their
side, not least -- Kunduz is a
place where a lot of the
opposition,

03:48.895 --> 03:56.269
militant opposition to the
Taliban relies on militia
leaders and former warlords, who

03:56.269 --> 03:59.473
don't necessarily have a lot of
backing from their population,
because they have a reputation

03:59.473 --> 04:02.576
of abusing the local population.

04:02.576 --> 04:08.315
And that is something that
creates a fertile ground for an
insurgency like the Taliban.

04:08.315 --> 04:11.918
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, quickly, how
much a threat does this pose to
the central government in

04:11.918 --> 04:13.520
Kabul?

04:13.520 --> 04:18.058
SUNE ENGEL RASMUSSEN: Well, that
depends on how long the Taliban
is able to hold Kunduz.

04:18.058 --> 04:23.263
And I'll be surprised if the
government forces are not able
to push them out relatively
quickly.

04:23.263 --> 04:28.468
But, that said, Kunduz is a
strategically important city.
It's at a crossroads between

04:28.468 --> 04:35.542
the northern provinces and is a
gateway to Tajikistan. And it
also has highways connecting

04:35.542 --> 04:40.347
the province to Kabul and to
Mazar, north of those two
cities. So, it is a
strategically

04:40.347 --> 04:42.782
very important province.

04:42.782 --> 04:47.053
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sune Engel
Rasmussen, reporting for us from
Kabul, we thank you.

04:47.053 --> 04:49.923
SUNE ENGEL RASMUSSEN:
You're welcome.

04:49.923 --> 04:55.462
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Yemen,
security officials charged that
airstrikes led by Saudi Arabia

04:55.462 --> 05:00.567
killed at least 38 people at a
wedding party today. It happened
in a town near the port

05:00.567 --> 05:05.939
city of Mocha on the country's
southwestern coast. The Saudis
are running an air campaign

05:05.939 --> 05:10.343
against Shiite rebels in Yemen,
but they denied hitting a
wedding party. A spokesman said,

05:10.343 --> 05:14.614
"This is totally false news."

05:14.614 --> 05:19.986
Pope Francis is back in Rome
after his U.S. visit, but he
kept making news even as he

05:19.986 --> 05:26.092
flew home last night. Speaking
to reporters in Italian, he
condemned bishops who helped

05:26.092 --> 05:30.363
hide the sexual abuse
of children by priests.

05:30.363 --> 05:34.768
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through translator):
When a priest abuses a child,

05:34.768 --> 05:39.973
it is very bad. He crushes them
with evil. And for that reason,
it is almost a sacrilege.

05:39.973 --> 05:44.411
He has betrayed his vocation,
the call of God. And, also, one
shouldn't cover it up.

05:44.411 --> 05:47.747
The ones who covered these
things up are also guilty.

05:47.747 --> 05:53.186
JUDY WOODRUFF: The pope also
defended the consoling words he
offered to U.S. bishops

05:53.186 --> 05:56.356
last week over the abuse
scandal. He said he wanted to
acknowledge that they had
suffered,

05:56.356 --> 05:58.825
too.

05:58.825 --> 06:04.764
Prosecutors in Germany today
opened a fraud investigation of
Volkswagen's former CEO over

06:04.764 --> 06:10.904
cheating on emission tests.
Martin Winterkorn resigned last
week as the scandal burst to

06:10.904 --> 06:14.307
life. Separately, German
government officials insisted
that they had been unaware that
V.W.'s

06:14.307 --> 06:17.677
data was falsified.

06:17.677 --> 06:22.015
Back in this country, the U.S.
Senate voted to break a deadlock
over funding government

06:22.015 --> 06:29.089
operations into December. That's
after Republicans gave up trying
to pass a bill that also denied

06:29.089 --> 06:34.361
funding for Planned Parenthood.
The House is expected to follow
suit this week.

06:34.361 --> 06:40.600
Royal Dutch/Shell is abandoning
its search for oil in Alaska's
Arctic waters, at least

06:40.600 --> 06:47.474
for now. The company spent $7
billion on drilling in the
Chukchi Sea, but says it didn't
find

06:47.474 --> 06:51.811
enough oil to make it
worthwhile. Environmentalists
had condemned the project,
saying that a spill

06:51.811 --> 06:56.149
would devastate
wildlife in the region.

06:56.149 --> 07:01.054
And there's hopeful news for
women in the early stages of
breast cancer. The National

07:01.054 --> 07:07.761
Cancer Institute reports that a
gene test can determine which
patients are helped more

07:07.761 --> 07:13.400
by hormone therapy. Those who
skipped traditional
chemotherapy, based on that
test, had less

07:13.400 --> 07:18.805
than a 1 percent chance of their
cancer recurring over five
years.

07:18.805 --> 07:24.444
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
world leaders grapple with what
to do in Syria; Margaret

07:24.444 --> 07:29.983
Warner sits down with the
president of Egypt; Donald Trump
unveils his tax plan; NASA finds

07:29.983 --> 07:45.932
rivers of water on
Mars, and much more.

07:45.932 --> 07:51.204
How to end the war in Syria,
that was the key question today
at the United Nations.

07:51.204 --> 07:56.676
It's a conflict that's left
thousands dead, displacing
millions more, with ripple
effects

07:56.676 --> 08:00.280
across the Middle
East and Europe.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.484
Our chief foreign affairs
correspondent, Margaret Warner,
is there, and she has this
report.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.521
MARGARET WARNER: One hundred and
sixty world leaders filled the
General Assembly hall this

08:08.521 --> 08:12.892
morning to celebrate the 70th
anniversary of the organization
dedicated to preserving

08:12.892 --> 08:15.762
peace in the world.

08:15.762 --> 08:20.400
But the speeches of President
Obama and Russian President
Vladimir Putin only highlighted

08:20.400 --> 08:23.837
the ongoing tensions between
two of its founding members.

08:23.837 --> 08:26.239
Mr. Obama spoke first,
with an ominous warning.

08:26.239 --> 08:30.877
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: We come together
today knowing that the march

08:30.877 --> 08:40.587
of human progress never travels
in a straight line, that our
work is far from complete,

08:40.587 --> 08:45.125
that dangerous currents risk
pulling us back into a darker,
more disordered world.

08:45.125 --> 08:49.429
MARGARET WARNER: It was an
indirect reference, both to the
rise of the Islamic State and

08:49.429 --> 08:54.934
to what the U.S. sees as
adventuresome by Russia, Syria
and Iran.

08:54.934 --> 08:58.538
He rejected the Russian argument
that supporting Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad is the price

08:58.538 --> 09:00.840
for fighting ISIS.

09:00.840 --> 09:05.945
BARACK OBAMA: The United States
is prepared to work with any
nation, including Russia

09:05.945 --> 09:13.653
and Iran, to resolve the
conflict. But we must recognize
that there cannot be, after

09:13.653 --> 09:20.560
so much bloodshed, so much
carnage, a return to the prewar
status quo.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.831
MARGARET WARNER: Later, Putin,
who appeared at the U.N. event
for the first time in a

09:24.831 --> 09:28.601
decade, flatly disagreed. He
said there's only one way to end
the brutal conflict in

09:28.601 --> 09:31.671
Syria and defeat ISIS.

09:31.671 --> 09:36.709
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
We think it is an enormous
mistake

09:36.709 --> 09:41.147
to refuse to cooperate with the
Syrian government and its armed
forces, who are valiantly
fighting

09:41.147 --> 09:46.352
terrorism face to face. We
should finally acknowledge that
no one but President Assad's

09:46.352 --> 09:49.422
armed forces and Kurd militia
are truly fighting the Islamic
State and other terrorist
organizations

09:49.422 --> 09:51.558
in Syria.

09:51.558 --> 09:56.729
MARGARET WARNER: Putin is
already engaged in a major
military buildup in Syria, and

09:56.729 --> 10:02.869
he's now struck an
intelligence-sharing deal with
Syria, Iran and Iraq, which came
as a

10:02.869 --> 10:07.707
surprise to the White House. He
called today for a broad global
coalition against terror,

10:07.707 --> 10:12.645
and he rejected criticism of
Russia's new activism on the
world stage.

10:12.645 --> 10:16.950
VLADIMIR PUTIN (through
translator): I must note that
such an honest and direct
approach

10:16.950 --> 10:21.921
of Russia has been recently used
as a pretext to accuse it of
growing ambitions, as if those

10:21.921 --> 10:26.392
who say it had no ambitions at
all. However, it is not the
matter of Russia's ambitions,

10:26.392 --> 10:28.728
but the recognition of the fact
that we can no longer tolerate
the current state of affairs

10:28.728 --> 10:30.997
in the world.

10:30.997 --> 10:36.202
MARGARET WARNER: Iranian
President Hassan Rouhani
likewise defended his country's
actions

10:36.202 --> 10:41.040
in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran
is actively aiding Assad, and he
blamed American policy

10:41.040 --> 10:44.944
for forcing Iran to act.

10:44.944 --> 10:49.148
HASSAN ROUHANI, Iranian
President (through translator):
We must not forget that the
roots

10:49.148 --> 10:54.120
of today's destruction can be
found in the occupation,
invasion and military
intervention

10:54.120 --> 10:59.659
of yesterday. If we didn't have
the U.S. military invasion of
Afghanistan and Iraq, the
terrorists

10:59.659 --> 11:03.263
wouldn't have an excuse for the
justification of their crimes.

11:03.263 --> 11:10.837
MARGARET WARNER: The flash point
in Ukraine also figured large in
the dueling speeches.

11:10.837 --> 11:15.141
President Obama condemned Russia
for flagrantly violating
Ukraine's sovereignty.

11:15.141 --> 11:20.146
BARACK OBAMA: If that happens
without consequence in Ukraine,
it could happen to any nation

11:20.146 --> 11:27.387
gathered here today. That is the
basis of the sanctions that the
United States and our

11:27.387 --> 11:31.991
partners impose on Russia. It is
not a desire to return to a cold
war.

11:31.991 --> 11:36.696
MARGARET WARNER: But Putin shot
back that the root of the
problem is American arrogance.

11:36.696 --> 11:42.101
VLADIMIR PUTIN (through
translator): We all know that,
after the end of the Cold War,

11:42.101 --> 11:46.272
a single center of domination
emerged in the world. And then
those who found themselves

11:46.272 --> 11:49.442
at the top of that pyramid were
tempted to think that, if we are
so strong and exceptional,

11:49.442 --> 11:52.879
then we know better
than anyone what to do.

11:52.879 --> 11:57.216
MARGARET WARNER: Obama and
Putin's speeches were a public
preview of a private meeting

11:57.216 --> 12:01.287
later, their first direct
sit-down in nearly a year.

12:01.287 --> 12:05.091
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Margaret
Warner joins me now.

12:05.091 --> 12:09.495
So, Margaret, how far apart are
these two powerful leaders in
how they approach the

12:09.495 --> 12:11.731
world?

12:11.731 --> 12:17.070
MARGARET WARNER: Well, I think
quite different, Judy, even
though if you just arrived from

12:17.070 --> 12:19.672
Mars and you read their
speeches, you would think both
were talking about having a very

12:19.672 --> 12:23.076
orderly and cooperative world.

12:23.076 --> 12:27.313
But not only as you heard in the
speeches did they have very
different views of Ukraine

12:27.313 --> 12:32.085
and Syria, how we got to the
point where we are in both
countries, but, you know, what

12:32.085 --> 12:39.125
the solutions are. The
difference was that President
Obama talked a lot about how a
strong

12:39.125 --> 12:45.365
nation is actually forced to do
diplomacy abroad, and, at home,
its citizens to its

12:45.365 --> 12:50.970
freedoms -- or accepts the facts
that its citizens have freedoms,
and it's a weak leader

12:50.970 --> 12:55.775
and a weak country that asserts
itself abroad sort of
unilaterally and represses
dissent

12:55.775 --> 12:57.977
at home.

12:57.977 --> 13:02.915
It was an obvious dig at Putin.
And he said, in the end, that is
a recipe for essentially

13:02.915 --> 13:09.022
a disorderly world. Now, Putin
didn't talk at all of course
about human rights or any

13:09.022 --> 13:17.497
sort of broad topics like that.
He also talked about wanting to
cooperate, but he just didn't,

13:17.497 --> 13:23.603
I would say, try to offer an
alternative vision, other than
vague statements about
cooperation.

13:23.603 --> 13:28.207
And, in fact, they clearly, in
their actions, are dealing very
differently with almost every

13:28.207 --> 13:30.843
conflict you see
around the world.

13:30.843 --> 13:36.883
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know, as
you just mentioned, Putin's --
has forces. He's beefing

13:36.883 --> 13:42.922
up his forces in Syria. But in
addition, we now know the
Russians have arranged this
intelligence

13:42.922 --> 13:52.098
gathering arrangement with Iran
and with Assad in Syria. What is
the U.S. saying about that?

13:52.098 --> 13:55.134
MARGARET WARNER: Well,
they're very concerned.

13:55.134 --> 13:59.472
And the other player in this, by
the way, Judy, is Iraq. So,
those four countries are

13:59.472 --> 14:05.344
going to share intelligence on
ISIS. And when this first came
out yesterday, the United

14:05.344 --> 14:10.917
States was completely
blindsided. They had no idea. No
one alerted them. So, it was
clearly

14:10.917 --> 14:14.787
-- it's like Putin and the rest
of them are trying to set up a
rival sort of anti-ISIS

14:14.787 --> 14:17.924
coalition.

14:17.924 --> 14:21.928
And what worries the United
States is, it adds to the U.S.
worries, which is, what is

14:21.928 --> 14:27.834
Putin really up to? In other
words, has he sent forces to
Syria to fight ISIS, or is

14:27.834 --> 14:32.138
it really to prop up Assad and
help Assad wipe out all internal
opposition, whether

14:32.138 --> 14:35.108
they're terrorists or not?

14:35.108 --> 14:39.846
So this just adds to the sort of
basket of worries that the
United States has about the

14:39.846 --> 14:44.317
situation in Syria. Now, others
would argue of course that
President Obama declined to

14:44.317 --> 14:49.655
get very involved in Syria, and
Russia has stepped into a void,
essentially, a sort of

14:49.655 --> 14:56.496
external leadership. Wherever
you come down on that argument,
the U.S. is very, very
concerned.

14:56.496 --> 15:03.402
Now, to us, members of the
administration said, oh, well.
One said to me very low-level

15:03.402 --> 15:09.475
intelligence officers. And
another side, oh, Iraq is a
sovereign country. They can do
whatever

15:09.475 --> 15:13.312
they want, even though the U.S.
is in there really trying to
save Iraq's bacon, retraining

15:13.312 --> 15:17.383
its military, giving them air
support in their attacks on
ISIS.

15:17.383 --> 15:23.790
But, I mean, those ring a little
hollow. I mean, the United
Kingdom as an ally wouldn't

15:23.790 --> 15:29.529
do something like this without
telling Washington, for example.
So, Iraq may be a sovereign
country,

15:29.529 --> 15:35.201
but I think that's what stunned
them the most, the U.S.
officials, that Iraq is part of
this.

15:35.201 --> 15:38.638
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Margaret,
given all this, what were the
expectations going into this

15:38.638 --> 15:42.642
meeting between President Obama
and Putin? We assume it's still
going on.

15:42.642 --> 15:45.178
MARGARET WARNER: Yes.

15:45.178 --> 15:49.148
And, apparently I mean, I wasn't
there, and just a couple of
reporters and photographers.

15:49.148 --> 15:55.488
They have a stony handshake. The
expectations were low, very low
on the U.S. part, because

15:55.488 --> 16:01.394
meetings between Secretary Kerry
and Prime Minister Lavrov had
not yielded -- including

16:01.394 --> 16:06.332
here in New York -- had not
yielded any greater insight into
what the Russians are up to.

16:06.332 --> 16:12.305
When they use words like frank,
you know what that means. And
nor have there been any really

16:12.305 --> 16:16.676
private assurances. And then, of
course, there was no sense of
give, except that President

16:16.676 --> 16:21.614
Obama said in his speech today,
we are willing to work with
Russia and Iran.

16:21.614 --> 16:27.854
So, in that sense, you have seen
the U.S. move a little -- you
know, open the door,

16:27.854 --> 16:30.957
that they would like to have
Russia part of this anti-ISIS
coalition. But their
expectations

16:30.957 --> 16:33.726
were quite low going into it.

16:33.726 --> 16:37.864
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, a lot to
watch, Margaret Warner, who will
be in New York the rest of

16:37.864 --> 16:40.499
the week following the goings-on
at the U.N. Thank you.

16:40.499 --> 16:53.045
MARGARET WARNER:
Thank you, Judy.

16:53.045 --> 17:07.393
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump
announces his plan to cut taxes,
Hillary Clinton embarks

17:07.393 --> 17:12.598
on a new campaign strategy, and
Speaker Boehner steps down, but
the problems of Congress still

17:12.598 --> 17:16.903
remain, a perfect time
for Politics Monday.

17:16.903 --> 17:21.841
I'm joined by Tamara Keith of
NPR and Amy Walter of The Cook
Political Report.

17:21.841 --> 17:24.443
And welcome to you both.

17:24.443 --> 17:31.717
So, let's start with Donald
Trump. He did, finally today,
unveil this tax reform plan.

17:31.717 --> 17:36.989
Eliminate taxes for, what,
millions of people, cut taxes
for some of the highest income
earners.

17:36.989 --> 17:40.126
Let's listen to a little bit of
what he said at this
announcement today.

17:40.126 --> 17:42.028
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: We will run this
country properly. There is

17:42.028 --> 17:52.104
so much money to be saved. We're
reducing taxes, but, at the same
time, if I win, if

17:52.104 --> 18:06.786
I become president, we will be
able to cut so much money. And I
have a better fact. We

18:06.786 --> 18:07.720
won't be losing anything, other
than we will be balancing
budgets and getting them where

18:07.720 --> 18:09.555
they should be.

18:09.555 --> 18:12.792
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Amy, what was
the reaction to this today in
political and economic circles?

18:12.792 --> 18:17.163
Is this a plan that is likely to
gain him support from voters?

18:17.163 --> 18:20.700
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well, I have dubbed this
the Oprah tax plan. It's

18:20.700 --> 18:23.202
a little bit like, you get a tax
cut and you get a tax cut and
you get a tax cut. Everybody

18:23.202 --> 18:25.905
gets something.

18:25.905 --> 18:29.575
But, unlike Oprah, we don't
really know where the money is
coming from. I know Oprah can

18:29.575 --> 18:34.981
pay for all the things that she
gives away. This is a tax plan,
though, that did get some

18:34.981 --> 18:41.787
conservatives with a thumbs-up,
people like David Norquist, who
is a very influential

18:41.787 --> 18:48.394
Republican conservative
tax-fighter, just doesn't want
to see any tax increases ever.

18:48.394 --> 18:51.497
Even the Club for Growth, who
has come out and criticized
Donald Trump, saying that they

18:51.497 --> 18:55.101
don't think he's conservative
enough, that he has hiked taxes
in the past or at least

18:55.101 --> 18:59.005
-- I'm sorry -- he has advocated
hiking taxes, even they had to
concede.

18:59.005 --> 19:04.410
I think Donald Trump is doing
two things here. The first is,
he's pushing back on the
argument

19:04.410 --> 19:08.614
against him that he is not
strong enough on policy, he's
not doing enough to talk
specifics,

19:08.614 --> 19:13.652
and, number two, pushing back on
this theme that people like Club
for Growth have argued

19:13.652 --> 19:17.056
that he's not a serious
conservative, that he's not a
real Republican. This tax plan

19:17.056 --> 19:20.126
helps to push back on both.

19:20.126 --> 19:24.030
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we know part
of it, a lot of tax cuts, but
there is taking away the

19:24.030 --> 19:28.934
so-called carried interest favor
that's been given to some of the
hedge funds folks in

19:28.934 --> 19:30.936
New York.

19:30.936 --> 19:35.007
But, Tamara, how does this
compare to what other
Republicans have been saying
about what

19:35.007 --> 19:36.575
they would do about taxes?

19:36.575 --> 19:40.379
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: In some ways, it's on
steroids.

19:40.379 --> 19:46.552
It's like the Jeb plan on
steroids. He is lowering the
business tax rate, the corporate

19:46.552 --> 19:53.459
tax rate to 15 percent, and in
addition to cutting it from the
35 percent that it currently

19:53.459 --> 19:59.331
is, he also would take freelance
income, he would take small
businesses that currently

19:59.331 --> 20:03.769
pay taxes at the individual tax
rate, all of that would get
pushed over and put on the

20:03.769 --> 20:08.607
corporate tax rate at 15
percent, which Grover Norquist,
the anti-tax crusader, said was

20:08.607 --> 20:11.544
ambitious and bold.

20:11.544 --> 20:18.918
And the reality is, this is a
pretty specific plan. It
includes a lot of details, new
tax

20:18.918 --> 20:28.260
code, new tax brackets on the
personal income side, a zero
percent bracket where he -- in

20:28.260 --> 20:31.230
the plan itself, it says that
there will be a page that you
just fill out that says, "I

20:31.230 --> 20:31.831
win."

20:31.831 --> 20:33.666
(LAUGHTER)

20:33.666 --> 20:37.603
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we do now
know a little bit more, Amy,
about where he's coming from

20:37.603 --> 20:41.741
on economics from this, right?
At least it fills in some of
that picture.

20:41.741 --> 20:46.812
AMY WALTER: Yes, sure. It says
he wants to give everybody a
little bit of something.

20:46.812 --> 20:50.483
He says he's going to pay for it
by closing these tax loopholes,
which most economists

20:50.483 --> 20:53.786
say is not going to be possible.

20:53.786 --> 20:57.656
But we also know that he wants
to do a lot of other spending,
but we also don't know

20:57.656 --> 21:02.962
where that's coming from,
building a wall across the
border of Mexico, humanely
rounded

21:02.962 --> 21:07.766
up immigrants, as he said the
other night, having a health
care plan that's not Obamacare,

21:07.766 --> 21:10.703
but will cover everybody. It's
not clear where that money is
coming from.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.238
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, well,
let's talk -- we have talked
about Donald Trump, one

21:12.238 --> 21:14.240
of the Republicans.

21:14.240 --> 21:18.677
Let's talk about Hillary
Clinton. Tamara, he was -- she
was -- I guess her campaign

21:18.677 --> 21:23.315
has decided she's going to give
more interviews. We have seen
her popping up on different news

21:23.315 --> 21:27.353
programs. And everywhere she
goes, she's being asked about
the e-mails. It was no different

21:27.353 --> 21:30.122
yesterday on "Meet the Press."
Chuck Todd asked her some
questions.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.925
Here's part of that exchange.

21:32.925 --> 21:36.395
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: There
are some things about this that
I just

21:36.395 --> 21:41.967
can't control. I can't control
the technical aspects of it. I
am not by any means a technical

21:41.967 --> 21:47.373
expert. I relied on people who
were. My assumption was anything
that I sent to a dot-gov account

21:47.373 --> 21:49.542
would be captured.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.911
CHUCK TODD, Moderator, "Meet the
Press": But that's very
difficult to capture all of your

21:51.911 --> 21:55.714
e-mails by going to perhaps
thousands of people in their
dot-gov accounts. It would have
a

21:55.714 --> 21:58.384
lot been easier if it was
sent to your dot-gov account.

21:58.384 --> 22:02.655
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Well,
but when you communicate with
people in other parts of

22:02.655 --> 22:05.591
the government, you're not
sending it to the
StateDepartment.gov. And that
would have been

22:05.591 --> 22:08.561
true either way.

22:08.561 --> 22:14.133
Look, I think I have done all
that I can to take
responsibility, to be as
transparent

22:14.133 --> 22:16.702
as possible.

22:16.702 --> 22:20.506
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tamara, he
didn't -- what I know people are
saying about this interview

22:20.506 --> 22:23.709
is, she doesn't seem as
impatient with these questions
as she has in the past.

22:23.709 --> 22:26.178
TAMARA KEITH: She looks very
relaxed, like I'm going to sit
here...

22:26.178 --> 22:27.680
JUDY WOODRUFF: Almost happy
to be getting questions.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.182
TAMARA KEITH: ... and I
am going to be relaxed.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.350
(LAUGHTER)

22:31.350 --> 22:35.087
TAMARA KEITH: And she was.

22:35.087 --> 22:40.659
But Chuck asked her at some
point, is this just a drip,
drip, drip? And she said, yes,

22:40.659 --> 22:44.530
this is a drip, drip, drip. And
this is going to drip, drip,
drip. There's going to be
another

22:44.530 --> 22:49.235
release of e-mails of the State
Department later this week on
Wednesday.

22:49.235 --> 22:54.139
And then come October 22, there
is going to be this big Benghazi
committee hearing. And

22:54.139 --> 22:56.508
there is no telling whether
that's really going to be the
end of it. Odds are it won't

22:56.508 --> 22:59.011
really be the end of it.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.547
JUDY WOODRUFF: But does her
campaign, Amy, think they just
have to slog through this

23:01.547 --> 23:03.682
no matter what?

23:03.682 --> 23:06.385
AMY WALTER: Yes, it's the -- and
you saw it both MD+IT MDNM in
her body language

23:06.385 --> 23:11.123
and when she acknowledged the
drip, drip, drip. There is this
resignation to her fate,

23:11.123 --> 23:15.694
that I don't control this, I
don't know what's going to come
of it.

23:15.694 --> 23:19.265
All she can hope is two things,
one, that this stays in the
political realm. It doesn't

23:19.265 --> 23:25.671
go in the legal realm, we don't
start talking about real serious
repercussions. And, two,

23:25.671 --> 23:31.677
that eventually the media and
voters and the public get bored
with this story and it goes

23:31.677 --> 23:35.414
away. But that's not anytime
soon, and certainly not before
the end of October.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.950
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I can't let
the two of you get away without
asking about the big

23:37.950 --> 23:41.820
news of last Friday. House
Speaker John Boehner announced
he is stepping down.

23:41.820 --> 23:44.556
Yesterday , he did an interview
one of the Sunday shows with
John Dickerson on "Face

23:44.556 --> 23:47.559
the Nation."

23:47.559 --> 23:51.263
And we heard Boehner here spell
out who some of these
conservatives are who led to
this

23:51.263 --> 23:53.666
decision. Here's part of that.

23:53.666 --> 23:54.933
REP. JOHN BOEHNER (R-OH),
Speaker of the House: The Bible
says, beware of false prophets.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.302
And there are people out there
spreading noise about how much
can get done. I mean, this

23:56.302 --> 23:55.701
whole idea that we were going to
shut down the government to get
rid of Obamacare in

23:55.701 --> 23:56.635
2013, this plan
never had a chance.

23:56.635 --> 23:59.405
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tamara, we
hear what the speaker is saying.
He's been pretty blunt

23:59.405 --> 24:04.043
there about -- is Kevin McCarthy
or somebody else -- who, by the
way, announced today he's

24:04.043 --> 24:07.012
running for the speakership,
confirmed it. Are things going
to be different under his

24:07.012 --> 24:08.447
leadership?

24:08.447 --> 24:12.451
TAMARA KEITH: He's going to have
the same math problem that John
Boehner had, which

24:12.451 --> 24:19.391
is, in the House, Republicans
can get what they want if they
all agree with each other.

24:19.391 --> 24:22.094
Otherwise, they're going to have
to have some Democratic help.

24:22.094 --> 24:27.299
And then it gets over to the
Senate, and they can't blast
through a filibuster. And then

24:27.299 --> 24:31.136
it would go through the
Democratic president. And
there's no way a Democratic
president

24:31.136 --> 24:37.843
is going to defund Planned
Parenthood or eliminate
Obamacare. So, they still have
the same fundamental

24:37.843 --> 24:40.913
problem. Kevin McCarthy, I
think, has better relationship
with some of the most
conservative

24:40.913 --> 24:43.048
members, but I don't know
how far that will go.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.617
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
what changes, Amy?

24:45.617 --> 24:49.988
AMY WALTER: We just change --
literally, we change chairs, and
that's really about it.

24:49.988 --> 24:54.927
I don't think we're going to see
much more out of a McCarthy
speakership than we would

24:54.927 --> 25:02.234
out of a Boehner speakership.
The one question is, how much
does he accede to that
conservative

25:02.234 --> 25:06.372
base? Does he say, fine, yes,
let's shut the government down
over the debt ceiling in
December,

25:06.372 --> 25:13.145
yes, fine, let's go take more
stringent positions, force the
president's hand, which could
create,

25:13.145 --> 25:17.216
of course, more gridlock, more
-- and we could have another
government shutdown, and we
could

25:17.216 --> 25:21.019
get to the place where
Republicans, especially those
who want to win the White House
back,

25:21.019 --> 25:23.822
say, this is damaging
us beyond repair.

25:23.822 --> 25:25.224
JUDY WOODRUFF: But there is no
sign he's going to do some of
those things?

25:25.224 --> 25:26.091
(CROSSTALK)

25:26.091 --> 25:27.292
AMY WALTER: We don't know
what he's going to do.

25:27.292 --> 25:29.094
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

25:29.094 --> 25:31.130
Well, that's why we have you
two here to explain it for us.

25:31.130 --> 25:31.530
(CROSSTALK)

25:31.530 --> 25:33.132
AMY WALTER: That's right.

25:33.132 --> 25:36.001
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, thank you both.

25:36.001 --> 25:41.740
TAMARA KEITH: Thanks, Judy.

25:41.740 --> 25:47.179
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.

25:47.179 --> 25:49.081
Stay with us.

25:49.081 --> 25:54.520
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
fight for girls to get a modern
education in the birthplace

25:54.520 --> 26:01.527
of voodoo; and Miles O'Brien
helps us unravel a major mystery
of Mars.

26:01.527 --> 26:07.966
But, first, Margaret Warner's
interview with Egyptian
President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.

26:07.966 --> 26:14.873
In 2013, when he was in charge
of Egypt's armed forces, Sisi
removed Egypt's first
democratically

26:14.873 --> 26:21.046
elected president. He himself
was then elected to the post
last year. Egypt's struggles are

26:21.046 --> 26:27.386
many, amid almost five years of
turmoil since the revolution
began in January 2011.

26:27.386 --> 26:30.322
Margaret spoke with Sisi
yesterday morning in New York.

26:30.322 --> 26:34.560
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. President,
thank you for joining us.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.964
This past week, the big news was
that you released 100 political
prisoners, including

26:38.964 --> 26:44.436
two prominent Al-Jazeera
journalists. Was the timing of
that dictated by the fact you

26:44.436 --> 26:47.639
were coming here to the U.N.
General Assembly, to quiet all
the international criticism
there

26:47.639 --> 26:50.275
has been of that?

26:50.275 --> 26:53.979
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI, Egyptian
President (through translator):
The idea is very simple. Once

26:53.979 --> 26:57.015
the legal procedures are over
and there is a possibility for
me to intervene and to issue

26:57.015 --> 27:00.319
a pardon, I didn't hesitate.

27:00.319 --> 27:05.057
MARGARET WARNER: In your system,
does a legal pardon mean that
you have concluded that the

27:05.057 --> 27:07.960
charges -- that they were
innocent of the charges?

27:07.960 --> 27:11.697
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): Once those are
over, the legal party allows

27:11.697 --> 27:16.235
the president to intervene to
bring an end to this issue and
to this legal issue.

27:16.235 --> 27:21.039
MARGARET WARNER: Well, now there
are still 18 journalists being
held, and, by conservative

27:21.039 --> 27:28.313
estimates, 20,000 or more
political prisoners, many of
whom had been brought in on what
are

27:28.313 --> 27:31.116
said to be trumped-up
terrorism charges.

27:31.116 --> 27:35.554
Could you act and will you act
as swiftly once the legal
process is over?

27:35.554 --> 27:37.422
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): It is very
important to stop at the word of

27:37.422 --> 27:40.626
under detention.

27:40.626 --> 27:43.829
There is no legal formality that
allows me to do so, but there
are court procedures force

27:43.829 --> 27:46.431
that we can deal
with these cases.

27:46.431 --> 27:50.836
MARGARET WARNER: So, the big
issue here at the U.N. General
Assembly is going to be the

27:50.836 --> 27:55.941
fight against Islamic State,
and, in particular, focused on
Syria right now.

27:55.941 --> 28:03.482
Now, the anti-ISIL coalition, of
which Egypt is a member, you
have been at it for a full

28:03.482 --> 28:08.587
year, and yet ISIS has grown, if
anything, more powerful.
Something like 30,000 new
fighters,

28:08.587 --> 28:12.658
foreign fighters, have
entered Syria. Why is that?

28:12.658 --> 28:17.062
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): It's the idea that
we can fight ISIS only

28:17.062 --> 28:22.334
militarily. This means the
strategy is incomplete. We need
a holistic approach that would
include

28:22.334 --> 28:27.439
security dimensions, an economic
dimension, social and cultural
dimensions as well.

28:27.439 --> 28:33.645
MARGARET WARNER: Egypt has not
been involved, except to bomb in
Libya, where some ISIS militants

28:33.645 --> 28:40.786
have killed so many Christian
Copts from Egypt. Is Egypt going
to step up its military
engagement?

28:40.786 --> 28:45.724
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): Egypt is one member
of the coalition. It has

28:45.724 --> 28:50.429
been very clear since the onset
of the coalition that the
Egyptian role is confined now in

28:50.429 --> 28:55.534
fighting terrorism in Sinai and
on the borders with Libya that
extends over 1,200 kilometers.

28:55.534 --> 28:58.570
MARGARET WARNER: So more
in your neighborhood?

28:58.570 --> 29:00.706
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): Yes, yes.

29:00.706 --> 29:04.076
MARGARET WARNER: One more
question about the bigger
picture.

29:04.076 --> 29:11.416
Do you share the view of Russia
and Iran that now is not the
time to unseat President Bashar

29:11.416 --> 29:17.589
al-Assad or his government, as
long as the fight, the number
one fight is against ISIL?

29:17.589 --> 29:23.495
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): We are for a
political solution, not a
military

29:23.495 --> 29:27.866
solution, in Syria. We want to
preserve the integrity of the
Syrian territory and preserve

29:27.866 --> 29:31.737
the Syrian national army.

29:31.737 --> 29:36.608
We must confront the extremists
organizations and ISIS in Syria
to bring stability to the

29:36.608 --> 29:43.315
situation. We must reconstruct
Syria to accommodate the
refugees back into their homes
now.

29:43.315 --> 29:47.886
MARGARET WARNER: But do you
think that President Assad can
be part of the political
transition?

29:47.886 --> 29:52.090
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): We need to focus on
the real threat, the extremism

29:52.090 --> 29:56.495
and terrorism and its negative
ramifications and the huge
instability that can dominate

29:56.495 --> 30:00.899
the Middle East and can spill
over to other regions as well.

30:00.899 --> 30:06.004
MARGARET WARNER: But now there
is a big question about whether
Bashar Assad and his continued

30:06.004 --> 30:11.743
presence and the way he's
treating all of his own people
is fueling ISIS. Do you agree

30:11.743 --> 30:13.412
with that?

30:13.412 --> 30:16.415
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): I believe that the
negotiations between the

30:16.415 --> 30:20.552
Syrian opposition and the regime
should conclude that. We cannot
just be judgmental while we

30:20.552 --> 30:22.754
are from the outside.

30:22.754 --> 30:29.861
MARGARET WARNER: So, the
insurgency in Sinai, I recall,
when you came into power, after

30:29.861 --> 30:36.134
President Morsi, you vowed that
you would clean that up in
months, that you're a military

30:36.134 --> 30:41.239
man, that you would know how to
do this. And, instead, it is
growing. Why is that?

30:41.239 --> 30:45.243
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): This is what
terrorism is, and this is not

30:45.243 --> 30:50.315
a simple thing to confront. And
I guess the United States has a
long experience in countering

30:50.315 --> 30:54.820
terrorism in many countries. And
despite all the capabilities of
the United States, the

30:54.820 --> 30:59.925
United States took years in
trying to defeat these
terrorists.

30:59.925 --> 31:04.429
But if we can compare the
security situation two years ago
and today, we find a lot of

31:04.429 --> 31:10.135
improvement. But the question
is, will the flow of weapons and
foreign fighters across

31:10.135 --> 31:16.341
the borders from Libya be
stopped? This flow poses threats
to us and a challenge to us.

31:16.341 --> 31:21.379
MARGARET WARNER: Secretary Kerry
said this publicly in Cairo.
Senator John McCain has

31:21.379 --> 31:32.390
said it, that the crackdown on
the Brotherhood in your country,
the further repression and

31:32.390 --> 31:38.029
jailing of many, many dissidents
has, in fact, worsened this
problem and has radicalized

31:38.029 --> 31:39.564
people in a way they
weren't before.

31:39.564 --> 31:42.801
What do you say to that?

31:42.801 --> 31:46.138
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): You cannot forget
that Egypt has been in a

31:46.138 --> 31:50.008
state of revolution for five
years, and the Egyptian
resources are limited.

31:50.008 --> 31:55.714
The state of affairs in Egypt
witnessed two revolutions in two
years. These have been

31:55.714 --> 32:03.088
very difficult times for
Egyptians. And we have 90
million people. They need to
live.

32:03.088 --> 32:07.192
At the end of the day, Egyptians
want to find their basic needs
provided and a better chance

32:07.192 --> 32:12.464
for life. This cannot be
achieved while there is a state
of chaos. The standards that you

32:12.464 --> 32:15.801
live by do not necessarily have
to apply to the standards that
we live in, in our own

32:15.801 --> 32:17.669
countries.

32:17.669 --> 32:21.439
We need some time in order to
reach the standards that you
live by.

32:21.439 --> 32:28.313
MARGARET WARNER: I understand
that, but my question is, has
the crackdown really, ever

32:28.313 --> 32:32.684
since you came into office,
including now under the
anti-terrorism law, actually
fueling

32:32.684 --> 32:35.554
the insurgency in Egypt?

32:35.554 --> 32:39.124
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): Undoubtedly, the
crackdown on the insurgents

32:39.124 --> 32:41.760
and the terrorist members
decreased the insurgent
operations.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.329
MARGARET WARNER: Decreased?

32:44.329 --> 32:48.099
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): Decreased,
undoubtedly decreased the
terrorist

32:48.099 --> 32:53.438
operations and terrorist
incidents. I'm saying to you,
terrorism cannot defeat a
country,

32:53.438 --> 32:59.144
especially if its people are
unified in confrontation of
terrorism. This is what we find
in Egypt.

32:59.144 --> 33:02.814
MARGARET WARNER: But, in fact,
the number of attacks has
increased, has it not?

33:02.814 --> 33:05.684
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): No. This is not
true.

33:05.684 --> 33:08.753
MARGARET WARNER: So you don't
think these critics could be
right?

33:08.753 --> 33:12.757
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): Everybody has the
right to criticize. Everybody

33:12.757 --> 33:18.096
has to present their own view.
But I'm just offering you our
perspective.

33:18.096 --> 33:23.268
The reality is, if we turned to
Syria, Iraq or Libya, the
situation would have been much

33:23.268 --> 33:29.441
more dangerous for the region
and for Europe. Of our 90
million people, 60 million are
young

33:29.441 --> 33:34.012
people. Imagine if we are
suffering from that state of
chaos. What would the situation
be?

33:34.012 --> 33:38.850
MARGARET WARNER: There is also
concern in Congress that
military equipment given to

33:38.850 --> 33:43.788
Egypt, whether Apache
helicopters, Hellfire missiles,
are being used in these
anti-terrorist

33:43.788 --> 33:47.459
operations, but in fact are
vaporizing entire villages in
Sinai, the attack on the Mexican

33:47.459 --> 33:51.630
tourists in the Western Desert.

33:51.630 --> 33:55.834
Can you ensure U.S. taxpayers
that in fact their gifts to
Egypt are not being used in

33:55.834 --> 33:58.503
this way in the future?

33:58.503 --> 34:02.540
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): Let me respond
about the incident, the
unfortunate

34:02.540 --> 34:07.979
incident of the Mexican
tourists. That was a mistake.
They were in an off-limit area

34:07.979 --> 34:12.217
very close to the border area
with Libya, dangerous areas,
where smugglers used to
infiltrate

34:12.217 --> 34:15.287
with weapons and
foreign fighters.

34:15.287 --> 34:20.492
As for Sinai, I want to assure
you that Egypt will never use
weapons or force against
innocent

34:20.492 --> 34:25.230
civilians, because we will not
allow ourselves to kill innocent
civilians.

34:25.230 --> 34:30.502
MARGARET WARNER: Let me turn to
Egypt-U.S. relations, because
the U.S. recently -- lift

34:30.502 --> 34:36.841
the ban on military hardware to
Egypt. Is it back on track now,
the relationship? Do

34:36.841 --> 34:39.177
you feel it has improved?

34:39.177 --> 34:42.314
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): In comparison to
the last months, yes, it

34:42.314 --> 34:43.782
has improved.

34:43.782 --> 34:46.418
MARGARET WARNER: And what
more would you like to see?

34:46.418 --> 34:49.287
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): We have started a
strategic dialogue with

34:49.287 --> 34:52.757
the United States to review our
strategies and try to find ways
how to handle issues

34:52.757 --> 34:55.593
of common interest
in a better way.

34:55.593 --> 34:59.297
MARGARET WARNER: And do you
trust the United States as a
reliable ally?

34:59.297 --> 35:02.968
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): Me? Undoubtedly. It
goes without saying. The

35:02.968 --> 35:05.770
United States has never let us
down throughout the past years.

35:05.770 --> 35:08.039
MARGARET WARNER: That's
quite a statement.

35:08.039 --> 35:11.109
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): I just want to say
to you, though, that the

35:11.109 --> 35:15.146
last two years presented a real
test of the endurance and
strength of the U.S.-Egyptian

35:15.146 --> 35:16.881
strategic relationship.

35:16.881 --> 35:22.721
MARGARET WARNER: Let me go back,
finally, to the state internally
in Egypt.

35:22.721 --> 35:27.993
Can you explain to the American
people why so many young
pro-democracy activists have

35:27.993 --> 35:33.832
been rounded up and put in
prison, sometimes for violating
the law that allows them --
doesn't

35:33.832 --> 35:37.736
allow them to protest? It's hard
for Americans to understand.

35:37.736 --> 35:41.840
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): It is true that
Americans won't understand

35:41.840 --> 35:45.610
that easily, because they look
at us from the American
perspective.

35:45.610 --> 35:50.482
But let me explain to them that
we didn't stop protests in
Egypt. We only regulated

35:50.482 --> 35:55.453
the right of protesting in
Egypt. Many countries do. We do
not ban it, and we will not. We

35:55.453 --> 35:58.757
only regulated it.

35:58.757 --> 36:03.061
Why? Because we need stability.
We are not a rich country. This
country cannot afford

36:03.061 --> 36:06.064
a state of instability.

36:06.064 --> 36:08.867
MARGARET WARNER: And so you
think these young liberal
pro-democracy activists are a
threat

36:08.867 --> 36:10.902
to that?

36:10.902 --> 36:13.872
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI (through
translator): It is not a threat
to the country. They just

36:13.872 --> 36:18.143
need to know that we cannot
leave in this state of affairs
forever. We need our country

36:18.143 --> 36:22.814
to progress. We need to build
our country after years of
stagnant waters.

36:22.814 --> 36:26.017
We have complete respect for the
liberal young people, but this
cannot be the only way people

36:26.017 --> 36:28.486
judge Egypt.

36:28.486 --> 36:32.557
MARGARET WARNER: People of every
age and stripe who got out in
Tahrir Square four years ago

36:32.557 --> 36:36.561
and inspired the world, calling
for more openness, greater right
of dissent, greater right to

36:36.561 --> 36:40.231
participate say it's
worse than ever.

36:40.231 --> 36:42.100
Has the dream of Tahrir died?

36:42.100 --> 36:45.336
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI
(through translator): Never.

36:45.336 --> 36:50.008
The dream of Tahrir still holds.
And I want to tell you that
there is no Egyptian president

36:50.008 --> 36:55.046
who can continue political
leadership against the will of
the Egyptians. This is a
fundamental

36:55.046 --> 37:00.852
change now, only the
presidential term, one or two
terms, and the president has to
go.

37:00.852 --> 37:04.956
This is the normal thing. And
this is a very good development
that Egypt is witnessing.

37:04.956 --> 37:08.793
And it is going to be a
remarkable experience.

37:08.793 --> 37:14.365
This is what I dream of. And
this is my determination and
political will. And this is what
I hope

37:14.365 --> 37:18.837
for my country, that it can only
be ruled by the will, by the
will and the choice of

37:18.837 --> 37:21.940
the Egyptians, not
against their free will.

37:21.940 --> 37:25.877
MARGARET WARNER: Mr. President,
thank you very much.

37:25.877 --> 37:37.222
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI: Thank
you very much, indeed.

37:37.222 --> 37:43.528
JUDY WOODRUFF: This past
weekend, the U.N. met to take
stock of the millennium promise

37:43.528 --> 37:48.600
of guaranteeing a basic
education for all children by
2015.

37:48.600 --> 37:54.706
In a message Saturday,
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon
noted that, around the world, 59
million

37:54.706 --> 38:01.646
children are not in school, and
250 million children are not
learning the basics.

38:01.646 --> 38:06.851
Over the past 12 years, PBS has
been chronicling the education
of six children in separate

38:06.851 --> 38:12.323
countries for WNET's
documentary "Time for School."

38:12.323 --> 38:18.630
Tonight, we travel to the tiny
African country of Benin, where,
in 2003, one in four children

38:18.630 --> 38:23.334
were out of school,
most of them girls.

38:23.334 --> 38:31.209
NARRATOR: Nine-year old Nanavi
Todeenou (ph) lives in Koutagba,
a remote village in the

38:31.209 --> 38:37.348
tiny West African country of
Benin, where voodoo was born.

38:37.348 --> 38:45.890
Nanavi and her village are
participating in a nationwide
campaign to educate the girls

38:45.890 --> 38:52.297
of Benin. The voodoo priest
calls for celebration because he
has just agreed to allow one
girl

38:52.297 --> 38:56.834
from each family to attend
school, instead of being
initiated into the faith.

38:56.834 --> 39:02.473
BALAKOU, Voodoo Priest (through
translator): I want Nanavi to go
to school. But all the

39:02.473 --> 39:07.212
girls can never go to school.
There will always be those
who'll go to the convent. No one

39:07.212 --> 39:11.049
can force me to release
all of them for school.

39:11.049 --> 39:15.353
NARRATOR: Nearly half of the
girls in Benin have had no
formal education and often marry

39:15.353 --> 39:17.455
very young.

39:17.455 --> 39:21.092
WOMAN (through translator): Now
that your daughters are going to
school, aren't you

39:21.092 --> 39:23.661
happy?

39:23.661 --> 39:26.998
WOMAN (through translator):
You're not going to overwhelm
your daughters with all the
household

39:26.998 --> 39:30.835
chores, are you?

39:30.835 --> 39:36.641
NARRATOR: Regina Guedou has a
key role in Benin's girls
education initiative, traveling

39:36.641 --> 39:40.445
from village to village on a
state-supported mission to
persuade parents of the value of

39:40.445 --> 39:43.181
letting girls go to school.

39:43.181 --> 39:49.954
REGINA GUEDOU, Benin (through
translator): If there are too
many illiterate people, the

39:49.954 --> 39:54.759
country can't develop. We need
these children of tomorrow, so
that the country can change.

39:54.759 --> 40:04.369
But this will be a long fight.

40:04.369 --> 40:14.646
MAKDUE KOFFI ADAPKO, Benin
(through translator): The
changes that girls education
will bring

40:14.646 --> 40:23.888
to the village are huge. The
girls who attend school learn
about hygiene. For instance,

40:23.888 --> 40:30.128
she won't let her baby go
without vaccination against
diseases. She can help her
mother

40:30.128 --> 40:36.534
count the money they
made at the market.

40:36.534 --> 40:44.742
NARRATOR: The oldest of four
children, Nanavi is the biggest
help on the family's modest

40:44.742 --> 40:50.448
farm. But for her mother, an
education was worth the
sacrifice.

40:50.448 --> 40:55.887
WOMAN: (through translator): I
hope that she will become
something great, like a doctor.

40:55.887 --> 41:05.129
If I had gone to school, I
would have had a better life.

41:05.129 --> 41:10.001
NARRATOR: In 2005, Nanavi
suffered a tragic loss.

41:10.001 --> 41:20.311
NANAVI, Benin (through
translator): When my father
died, I felt like dying too. He
used

41:20.311 --> 41:25.249
to play with me. If I didn't
come back from school and it was
getting dark, my father

41:25.249 --> 41:28.286
would pick me up in the village.

41:28.286 --> 41:33.358
NARRATOR: Before passing,
Nanavi's father made one last
wish.

41:33.358 --> 41:45.036
NANAVI (through translator): My
father told me to go to school
and not to rest.

41:45.036 --> 41:54.445
This is my middle school. This
is the sixth grade. And this is
my classroom.

41:54.445 --> 41:58.082
CLASS: Good morning, teacher.

41:58.082 --> 42:03.688
NARRATOR: With the help of
Regina and the girls initiative,
Nanavi made it to middle

42:03.688 --> 42:07.892
school, one of the select 11
percent of Benin's girls who
even make it this far.

42:07.892 --> 42:11.028
TEACHER: OK, now, class,
look at it. Is it correct?

42:11.028 --> 42:11.796
CLASS: Yes!

42:11.796 --> 42:13.264
TEACHER: Is it correct?

42:13.264 --> 42:14.699
CLASS: Yes!

42:14.699 --> 42:18.069
TEACHER: Now you clap
for Nanavi, please.

42:18.069 --> 42:22.907
MAN (through translator): I
believe that Nanavi can make it.
As we say, with a valiant heart,

42:22.907 --> 42:26.010
nothing is impossible.

42:26.010 --> 42:33.951
NANAVI (through translator): I
actually love being in middle
school. I want to be a doctor,

42:33.951 --> 42:52.703
so I can give people shots. I
want to go to school until I
become something great.

42:52.703 --> 43:05.516
My little boy's name is Adaou
Fortune (ph). He was born on May
28, 2015. He's 2 months

43:05.516 --> 43:09.153
old.

43:09.153 --> 43:15.193
NARRATOR: In 2010, Nanavi left
her village to go to boarding
school in the city, where

43:15.193 --> 43:19.764
Regina and her mother believed
she would receive a better
education. But the demands of
her

43:19.764 --> 43:24.902
new school overwhelmed her and
she wasn't able to keep up with
other students.

43:24.902 --> 43:29.207
She moved to the capital,
Cotonou, to attend yet another
school and lived with her aunt

43:29.207 --> 43:32.810
and uncle. But they physically
abused her, she says, so she ran
away before completing

43:32.810 --> 43:37.181
the seventh grade.

43:37.181 --> 43:42.720
She now lives in the city of
Bohicon, the third largest trade
center in Benin, and had

43:42.720 --> 43:46.891
her son with Alphonse, an older
married man already the father
of four, who makes a living

43:46.891 --> 43:50.228
building auto parts
out of rubber.

43:50.228 --> 43:57.668
NANAVI (through translator): I
have to stay with him because we
already have a son together.

43:57.668 --> 44:11.015
And I love him, too. I would've
preferred to stay in school.
School helped me a lot.

44:11.015 --> 44:19.156
For example, if you don't go to
school, you can't read, you
can't speak French, and you

44:19.156 --> 44:25.162
wouldn't be able to
study photography.

44:25.162 --> 44:33.337
NARRATOR: No longer in school,
Nanavi is apprenticing at a
local photography studio, in the
hope

44:33.337 --> 44:36.741
of being able to eventually
support her family.

44:36.741 --> 44:42.613
NANAVI (through translator): Hi.
I'm training to be a
photographer. Mind if I take
your

44:42.613 --> 44:45.249
picture?

44:45.249 --> 44:52.890
RODRIGUE NOGI, Benin (through
translator): As soon as she
started, she was very dedicated

44:52.890 --> 45:01.899
to the work. She's diligent. She
gave it her all. She definitely
has all the right qualities

45:01.899 --> 45:05.269
to become a good reporter.

45:05.269 --> 45:13.077
ALPHONSE ADAOU, Benin (through
translator): It's clear that she
really enjoys this work.

45:13.077 --> 45:21.352
I have to help her. She has to
finish her apprenticeship. And
it will help support us.

45:21.352 --> 45:31.329
NANAVI (through translator): It
pains me that I couldn't stay in
school, and that's why

45:31.329 --> 45:40.371
my son will do what I wasn't
able to. He will study. He will
go further than I was able

45:40.371 --> 45:44.742
to go.

45:44.742 --> 45:53.117
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
additional videos of the "Time
for School" documentary

45:53.117 --> 46:08.299
project on WNET's Web site.
That's Thirteen.org.

46:08.299 --> 46:11.802
Finally tonight: big
news from outer space.

46:11.802 --> 46:17.408
NASA today announced that it has
found evidence of liquid water
on Mars, at least during certain

46:17.408 --> 46:22.947
seasons of the Martian year. The
discovery was made through
satellite images, which revealed

46:22.947 --> 46:28.719
darkly shaded streaks on slopes
of craters and hillsides. They
darken and lighten over

46:28.719 --> 46:33.257
time as water seeps across the
surface, and then evaporates.

46:33.257 --> 46:36.994
For more on what it all might
mean, I'm joined by science
correspondent Miles O'Brien.

46:36.994 --> 46:38.162
Hello again.

46:38.162 --> 46:40.531
MILES O'BRIEN: Judy,
good to see you.

46:40.531 --> 46:44.268
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how do they
know it's water, Miles? They
don't -- there hasn't been a
human

46:44.268 --> 46:47.938
there to look at it. They're
looking through satellites. What
-- how do they know?

46:47.938 --> 46:52.009
MILES O'BRIEN: The HiRISE
instrument, which is on the
orbiting Mars Reconnaissance
Orbiter,

46:52.009 --> 46:56.113
is a very sophisticated
instrument and has the ability
to do spectral analysis.

46:56.113 --> 47:01.318
So, it can actually look at how
light moves through whatever is
flowing there. And it

47:01.318 --> 47:07.124
gives unique signatures of water
and in this case a lot of salt.
It's the salt that is

47:07.124 --> 47:11.595
the key here, because Mars is
cold and has an atmosphere which
is almost nonexistent.

47:11.595 --> 47:15.299
So, the idea of water flowing
there is hard to imagine.

47:15.299 --> 47:18.402
JUDY WOODRUFF: But this flies in
the face of what scientists
thought for a long time,

47:18.402 --> 47:20.938
or have they been
building up to this?

47:20.938 --> 47:24.675
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, there is a
huge body of evidence that Mars
at one time was warm

47:24.675 --> 47:28.646
and wet, and we think probably
a cushy birth for life.

47:28.646 --> 47:34.418
So, we have been looking for
evidence of ancient life,
fossils, for example. There has
always

47:34.418 --> 47:39.190
been this thought that maybe the
water is underneath in an
aquifer. Could it somehow

47:39.190 --> 47:43.527
rise to the surface on certain
occasions in certain ways?
That's been a big question.

47:43.527 --> 47:48.232
They first spotted these streaks
back in 2010. It sure looked
like water. But what would

47:48.232 --> 47:52.236
keep it following? And the key
was, they found these
percolates, these salts in
there. It's

47:52.236 --> 47:56.240
extremely salty water. Think of
why do -- how do we get snow off
our roads in the winter?

47:56.240 --> 47:57.007
We use salt. Right?

47:57.007 --> 47:58.876
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

47:58.876 --> 48:01.712
So, it's not the same. And let's
talk about these streaks. We
have got great images here

48:01.712 --> 48:02.913
to look at.

48:02.913 --> 48:04.949
MILES O'BRIEN:
They're spectacular.

48:04.949 --> 48:10.454
And this is essentially a cliff.
And what you see is this --
those dark streaks are

48:10.454 --> 48:16.227
the water, the briny water that
percolate in fused water flowing
downward. So, the question

48:16.227 --> 48:19.663
is, where did the water come
from? Is it from an underground
aquifer?

48:19.663 --> 48:24.401
It's kind of problematic,
because it's starting at the top
of the peak. That's unusual.
Could

48:24.401 --> 48:30.040
it be somehow that there is a
humidity component to it? Mars
is very dry, but, under
certainly

48:30.040 --> 48:34.612
circumstances, could there be
what amounts to kind of dew or
fog which is causing this?

48:34.612 --> 48:37.548
We don't know the
answer to that yet.

48:37.548 --> 48:40.151
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you keep
using the word briny, very
salty, so it's not like the
water

48:40.151 --> 48:41.685
we have on Earth?

48:41.685 --> 48:44.355
MILES O'BRIEN: You wouldn't
want to drink it, for sure.

48:44.355 --> 48:50.060
But because it's so filled with
the salt, it stays in liquid
form where it would otherwise

48:50.060 --> 48:54.131
freeze. And so the key is, is it
so salty that it can support
life? That's the real

48:54.131 --> 48:56.801
debate among
scientists right now.

48:56.801 --> 48:59.436
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what do they
think? I mean, how are they
thinking about that?

48:59.436 --> 49:04.708
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, flowing
water has been kind of the Holy
Grail on Mars, and because

49:04.708 --> 49:07.745
wherever we look on this planet,
where we see liquid water, we
see life. It's a prerequisite

49:07.745 --> 49:11.115
for life as we know it.

49:11.115 --> 49:17.054
The question is, though, could
this be water that sustains
life? And could -- when you

49:17.054 --> 49:22.860
think about salt, it was used as
a preservative for a long time
on voyages, because it kills

49:22.860 --> 49:26.730
microbes. So, there might be so
much salt there that there is
nothing living there.

49:26.730 --> 49:31.502
But where is the water coming
from, and could it be fresher
and could it thus sustain life?

49:31.502 --> 49:33.304
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how do they
do further investigation?

49:33.304 --> 49:37.074
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, I think
it's going to beg for a mission,
you know?

49:37.074 --> 49:40.711
And I think NASA will start
thinking about the architecture
for a mission. Let's go to

49:40.711 --> 49:45.616
a place -- it's very difficult
to get there because it's on
these cliffs. How would you

49:45.616 --> 49:49.620
gather up that water? Or would
it be smarter to try to find a
place where it's a little

49:49.620 --> 49:53.691
more accessible, maybe go down
to the aquifer beneath, drill
down, and see if there are

49:53.691 --> 49:55.826
some microscopic Martians
there. Who knows?

49:55.826 --> 49:58.295
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who knows?

49:58.295 --> 50:01.699
It's fascinating, Miles, but for
those people who are watching
and saying, how does it really

50:01.699 --> 50:05.569
matter? There's water on Mars.
Are we ever really going to
really get there to find out?

50:05.569 --> 50:07.571
MILES O'BRIEN: I think it's a
question worth asking. Are we
alone in the universe is a

50:07.571 --> 50:09.740
good question.

50:09.740 --> 50:13.811
And this -- we have looked at
our neighbor and we are getting
closer and closer by hunting

50:13.811 --> 50:20.084
after the water to possibly
finding evidence of life,
ancient or maybe existing. And
how

50:20.084 --> 50:24.221
exciting would that be? The next
second question is, though, is
it a second genesis? Or is

50:24.221 --> 50:25.756
it -- Mars and Earth
have been swapping...

50:25.756 --> 50:26.457
(CROSSTALK)

50:26.457 --> 50:28.259
JUDY WOODRUFF: Another
form of human...

50:28.259 --> 50:29.260
MILES O'BRIEN: Exactly,
or we could be Martians.

50:29.260 --> 50:30.494
(LAUGHTER)

50:30.494 --> 50:31.862
JUDY WOODRUFF: Or we could
have come from there.

50:31.862 --> 50:32.763
MILES O'BRIEN: Exactly.

50:32.763 --> 50:33.831
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this is
what Earth looked like.

50:33.831 --> 50:36.000
MILES O'BRIEN: Exactly.

50:36.000 --> 50:39.937
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how excited
-- I read today that scientists
are debating. How excited

50:39.937 --> 50:42.740
are they about this,
the folks you talk to?

50:42.740 --> 50:45.943
MILES O'BRIEN: This is Holy
Grail kind of stuff. It's great
science.

50:45.943 --> 50:50.714
It puts them in a space where
they can start making an
argument for missions that look

50:50.714 --> 50:59.423
beneath the surface. And it's
what this steady stream of NASA
and European and other missions

50:59.423 --> 51:03.928
to Mars have been all about,
following the water, kind of a
divining rod, if you will,

51:03.928 --> 51:08.866
a high-tech divining rod, and
hoping at the end that the pot
of gold will be maybe
microscopic

51:08.866 --> 51:10.434
life.

51:10.434 --> 51:13.871
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's just
extraordinary. I mean, the
pictures are extraordinary.

51:13.871 --> 51:18.275
MILES O'BRIEN: Well, it
literally puts you in another
place, doesn't it? And it's
spectacular

51:18.275 --> 51:22.379
to think we have the kind of
imagery that gets us that level
of detail on a satellite

51:22.379 --> 51:24.748
that's been orbiting
that planet.

51:24.748 --> 51:28.118
JUDY WOODRUFF: Miles O'Brien,
every time you come here, we
have another surprise.

51:28.118 --> 51:29.053
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes. It's fun.

51:29.053 --> 51:30.120
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

51:30.120 --> 51:32.423
MILES O'BRIEN: You're
welcome, Judy.

51:32.423 --> 51:37.127
JUDY WOODRUFF: And speaking of
space, that brings us to our
"NewsHour" Shares of the

51:37.127 --> 51:41.498
day, something that caught our
eye which might be of interest
to you, too.

51:41.498 --> 51:49.473
From Russia to Paris to Las
Vegas, stargazers around the
world were treated to an
uncommon

51:49.473 --> 51:56.413
astronomical event last evening:
a total lunar eclipse that
occurred during a rare so-called

51:56.413 --> 52:03.153
supermoon. The phenomenon
happens when the sun, Earth and
moon perfectly align as the

52:03.153 --> 52:07.858
moon's orbit brings it closest
to Earth. This made the moon
appear bigger and brighter than

52:07.858 --> 52:10.160
usual.

52:10.160 --> 52:15.866
And sunlight refracting around
the Earth bathed it in an eerie
reddish glow, giving it the

52:15.866 --> 52:23.440
name blood moon. This double
feature has not occurred since
1982. And whether or not clouds

52:23.440 --> 52:28.679
obscured your view, you will
have to wait until 2033 to see
it again.

52:28.679 --> 52:31.715
Wow.

52:31.715 --> 52:37.421
On the "NewsHour" online: For
many retirees, navigating the
Social Security system can

52:37.421 --> 52:42.760
take all the peace out of
retirement. Luckily, we have our
benefits guru, Laurence
Kotlikoff,

52:42.760 --> 52:48.899
as a guide. Today on Ask Larry,
he addresses widows and veterans
benefits. You can read

52:48.899 --> 52:56.306
his advice, and submit your own
question, on our home page.
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:56.306 --> 52:59.676
And tune in later tonight on
"Charlie Rose": more of his
exclusive interview with Russian

52:59.676 --> 53:02.212
President Vladimir Putin.

53:02.212 --> 53:04.348
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:04.348 --> 53:07.918
On Tuesday, Margaret Warner
continues her reporting from the
United Nations.

53:07.918 --> 53:10.454
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:10.454 --> 53:13.924
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow evening. For all
of us at the "PBS NewsHour,"

53:13.924 --> 53:13.891
thank you, and good night.
