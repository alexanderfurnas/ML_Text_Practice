CITY, LARGELY FIRST-AND SECOND-

04:42.800 --> 04:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERATION IMMIGRANTS.

04:44.433 --> 04:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW CRITICAL WAS THAT TO THIS

04:46.233 --> 04:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY THAT YOU TELL ABOUT THEIR

04:47.266 --> 04:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDICTMENT?

04:48.733 --> 04:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT WAS KEY.

04:50.366 --> 04:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS A KIND OF PROFOUND

04:51.900 --> 04:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSENSITIVITY TO THE WAYS IN

04:53.966 --> 04:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH BANKING HAPPENS IN

04:57.066 --> 04:58.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES, NOT JUST

04:58.466 --> 04:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHINESE-AMERICAN, BUT EVEN

04:59.866 --> 05:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HISTORICALLY, ARE USUALLY LIVING

05:02.066 --> 05:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A CASH ECONOMY, ESPECIALLY IN

05:04.166 --> 05:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE EARLY GENERATIONS.

05:06.333 --> 05:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS THE REALITY OF LIFE IN

05:09.433 --> 05:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICA FOR THESE COMMUNITIES.

05:11.633 --> 05:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO CLIMB

05:13.100 --> 05:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR WAY UP THE LADDER, SO TO

05:14.633 --> 05:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEAK, AND GET MORTGAGES AND

05:16.233 --> 05:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
START BUSINESSES, IT'S DONE

05:17.833 --> 05:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENTLY.

05:20.033 --> 05:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS

05:21.166 --> 05:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ABACUS UNDERSTOOD AS A

05:22.433 --> 05:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BANKING INSTITUTION.

05:24.433 --> 05:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: THE SUNG FAMILY

05:25.733 --> 05:26.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPENT $10-MILLION DOLLARS ON ITS

05:26.466 --> 05:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFENSE.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FILM SHOWS NOT ONLY THE

05:29.100 --> 05:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGAL STRUGGLE BUT ALSO THE

05:30.300 --> 05:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSONAL TOLL OF GOING TO TRIAL.

05:33.933 --> 05:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY MADE A DECISION THAT

05:35.200 --> 05:36.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE NOT GOING TO PLEAD

05:36.900 --> 05:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUILTY TO SOMETHING, THAT THEY

05:38.200 --> 05:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID NOT FEEL THE BANK WAS NOT

05:39.266 --> 05:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUILTY OF.

05:40.733 --> 05:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS A COURAGEOUS CHOICE AND

05:42.433 --> 05:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S AN EXPENSIVE CHOICE.

05:44.966 --> 05:45.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS A DAUNTING TASK TO FIGHT

05:45.900 --> 05:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GOVERNMENT.

05:48.966 --> 05:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IF THEY'RE FOUND GUILTY, IT

05:50.500 --> 05:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SURELY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE END

05:51.500 --> 05:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE BANK.

05:52.833 --> 05:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSONALLY THOUGH, THE STAKES

05:54.833 --> 05:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE EVEN, I THINK, HIGHER FOR

05:56.366 --> 05:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FAMILY-- THIS BANK REALLY

05:57.266 --> 05:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPRESENTED THEM.

05:59.066 --> 06:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS THEIR LEGACY.

06:00.933 --> 06:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE WITH THE SUNGS DURING

06:01.600 --> 06:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ORDEAL.

06:04.466 --> 06:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND YOU GET AN UP-CLOSE AND VERY

06:06.900 --> 06:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSONAL LOOK AT THE STRESS AND

06:08.966 --> 06:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRAIN AND THE CLOSENESS AND THE

06:11.533 --> 06:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BICKERING THAT GOES ON AS THEY

06:14.133 --> 06:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACE THIS.

06:18.466 --> 06:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SUNGS ARE JUST THIS SORT OF

06:19.800 --> 06:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WONDERFULLY CLOSE AND VERY FUNNY

06:22.033 --> 06:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILY IN A LOT OF WAYS.

06:23.566 --> 06:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY NEVER KIND OF LOST

06:24.900 --> 06:25.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR SENSE OF HUMOR EVEN AT

06:25.600 --> 06:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIMES IN THE MIDST OF THIS.

06:27.700 --> 06:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Reporter: WHAT DO YOU HOPE

06:28.900 --> 06:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PEOPLE TAKE AWAY FROM THIS

06:30.266 --> 06:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILM?

06:31.900 --> 06:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK IT'S A FILM ABOUT A

06:33.133 --> 06:35.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY THAT IS NOT KNOWN TO

06:35.100 --> 06:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES IN THIS

06:37.233 --> 06:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HISTORICALLY, PERHAPS

06:42.033 --> 06:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OF HAVING COME FROM

06:45.033 --> 06:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAINLAND CHINA AND MORE OF A

06:47.033 --> 06:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLICE STATE, THEY HAVE DONE

06:49.500 --> 06:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO AVOID ANY

06:51.933 --> 06:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCRUTINY OR ANY INVOLVEMENT OR

06:53.733 --> 06:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENGAGEMENT WITH THE POWERS THAT

06:54.866 --> 06:58.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE.

06:58.433 --> 07:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS A CASE WHERE THIS

07:00.200 --> 07:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILY SAID, "NO, WE ARE GOING

07:01.466 --> 07:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO FIGHT BACK."

07:03.766 --> 07:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR

07:05.033 --> 07:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BANK THAT IS A PILLAR WITHIN

07:05.700 --> 07:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT COMMUNITY.
