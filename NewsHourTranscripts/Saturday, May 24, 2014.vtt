13:30.467 --> 13:32.167
ONE STORY AFTER ANOTHER.

13:32.167 --> 13:34.067

TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING O

14:21.867 --> 14:23.167
HERE, YOU SHOULD NOTE TW

14:23.167 --> 14:23.733
THINGS

14:23.733 --> 14:25.467
FIRST, EVEN THOUGH THIS FAMILY

14:25.467 --> 14:31.767
COMES FROM COLUMBIA.

14:31.767 --> 14:34.167
NORMANDY IS NAMED AFTER ONE OF

14:34.167 --> 14:37.600
THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENTS I

14:43.767 --> 14:44.767
THAT HE WANTED TO HAVE HIS

FAMILY CARRY A NAME THAT

14:46.500 --> 14:49.067
REFERRED TO A NEW DAWN AND S

14:49.067 --> 14:51.833
THE FIRST BORN IN THE FAMILY

14:51.833 --> 14:52.633

14:52.633 --> 14:55.200
>> THAT FIRST BORN WAS THIS MAN.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.633
NORMANDY SENIOR.

14:56.633 --> 15:01.800
SENIOR WOULD ALSO HEAR SOMETHING

15:01.800 --> 15:04.100
AMERICAN THAT WOULD INSPIRE HIM.

15:19.867 --> 15:21.333
>> HE NEVER FORGOT THAT.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.767
>> IT STUCK IN HIS HEAD.

15:23.767 --> 15:25.233
STUCK WITH HIM FOREVER

15:25.233 --> 15:28.500

15:38.567 --> 15:42.400
RESPECT FOR PUBLIC SERVICE AND

15:42.400 --> 15:45.667

ROOMS DEPENDING ON THE FAMILY'

16:02.467 --> 16:03.267
CIRCUMSTANCES.

16:03.267 --> 16:06.167
>> BECAUSE THE CREDENTIALS

16:06.167 --> 16:07.500
DIDN'T TRANSFER HIS MOTHER WOULD

BELIEVE WE COULD DO SOMETHIN

16:55.400 --> 16:55.567
BETTER HERE.

16:55.567 --> 16:58.700

INCIDENT, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN THA

17:33.333 --> 17:33.533
WAY.

17:33.533 --> 17:35.433
HE WAS ALMOST KILLED IN

17:35.433 --> 17:35.800
BICYCLE ACCIDENT

17:35.800 --> 17:38.367

17:41.133 --> 17:43.133
WHEN HE FINALLY WOKE UP, H

17:43.133 --> 17:44.700
COULDN'T SEE WELL OR THINK

17:44.700 --> 17:47.500
CLEARLY AND HE ATTACKED HI

17:47.500 --> 17:48.333
REHABILITATION WITH SUCH

17:48.333 --> 17:50.367
DETERMINATION THAT HIS FATHER,

17:50.367 --> 17:53.967
PERHAPS, THE STRONGEST MAN H

KNEW BEGAN CALLING HIM A

17:57.900 --> 17:59.300
TRUCADOR, THE FIGHTER.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.367
SO HE ENTERED COLLEGE ON TIME.

18:01.367 --> 18:03.533
A FULL YEAR BEFORE DOCTORS

18:03.533 --> 18:04.267
THOUGHT HE COULD DO IT

18:04.267 --> 18:06.800
>> HE'S ONE OF THE MOST PEOPLE I

18:06.800 --> 18:07.967
ADMIRE IN THIS WORLD

18:07.967 --> 18:09.567
HE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

18:09.567 --> 18:12.433
>> FIVE WEEKS AFTER I MET HIM,

18:12.433 --> 18:15.800
HE GRADUATED FROM HARVAR

18:15.800 --> 18:16.067

18:16.067 --> 18:17.967
THE FOURTH IN HIS FAMILY TO EARN

18:17.967 --> 18:19.833
AN IVY LEAGUE EDUCATION.

18:19.833 --> 18:23.533
THEY HAD DONE IT WITH SCHOLA

18:23.533 --> 18:24.367
SHIPS OF COURSE.

18:24.367 --> 18:26.167
WHEN I ASKED HIM HOW HIS PARENTS

18:26.167 --> 18:29.067
COULD AFFORD THE TRIP FOR TH

18:29.067 --> 18:30.733
GRADUATION, HE SAID SOME GUY

18:30.733 --> 18:31.767
SENT US $3,000

18:31.767 --> 18:33.967
WHEN I ASKED WHO, HE SHOWED ME

18:33.967 --> 18:36.000
THE GUY.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.667

18:52.067 --> 18:53.700
GATES MESSAGE TO ALL THE

18:53.700 --> 18:56.267
SCHOLARS SOUNDED IDENTICAL T

18:56.267 --> 18:57.867
WHAT HIS GRANDFATHER AND FATHE

18:57.867 --> 18:59.233
HAD SAID

18:59.233 --> 19:00.700
LIVE LIVES OF SERVICE.

19:00.700 --> 19:02.400
>> I HOPE YOU WILL JUDGE

19:02.400 --> 19:04.133
YOURSELF NOT ON YOUR

19:04.133 --> 19:06.767
PROFESSIONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS

19:06.767 --> 19:10.633
ALONE, BUT ALSO ON HOW WELL YO

19:10.633 --> 19:12.367
TREATED PEOPLE THE WORLD AWA

19:12.367 --> 19:14.467
WHO HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WIT

19:14.467 --> 19:19.033
YOU BUT THEIR HUMANITY

19:19.033 --> 19:21.400
GOOD LUCK.

19:21.400 --> 19:28.300
>> SO THAT'S WHAT NORMANDY AND

19:28.300 --> 19:31.533
HIS SIBLINGS WILL DO, SERVICE IN

19:31.533 --> 19:32.933
PUBLIC HELP AND THE LAW.

19:32.933 --> 19:35.400
BY THE WAY, WHEN HIS FATHER WENT

19:35.400 --> 19:38.133
TO HARVARD FOR THE GRADUATION HE

19:38.133 --> 19:39.767
VISITED THE KENNEDY SCHOOL O

19:39.767 --> 19:40.767
GOVERNMENT THERE AND FOUND THE

19:40.767 --> 19:42.967
WORDS THAT LAUNCHED HIS AMERICAN

19:42.967 --> 19:45.033
DREAM SO MANY YEARS AGO WRITTE

19:45.033 --> 19:45.300
IN STONE

19:45.300 --> 19:47.433
>> ASK WHAT YOU CAN DO FOR YOU

19:47.433 --> 19:48.200
COUNTRY.

19:48.200 --> 19:52.233
>> SO YOU CAN MAYBE UNDERSTAND

19:52.233 --> 19:56.033
WHY MY SEAT MATES GRADUATION

19:56.033 --> 19:57.500
PARTY WAS SOMETHING NOT TO B

19:57.500 --> 19:58.533
MISSED

19:58.533 --> 20:00.300
BEFORE I LEFT HE AND HIS FAMILY,

20:00.300 --> 20:01.333
THERE WAS ONE MORE CELEBRATION

20:01.333 --> 20:05.133
WHEN THEY TOOK ME ON A FAVORIT

20:05.133 --> 20:06.833
FIELD TRIP

20:06.833 --> 20:09.100
>> A SYMBOL OF LIBERTY AND

20:09.100 --> 20:09.433
OPPORTUNITY.

20:09.433 --> 20:11.400
>> THE STATUE OF LIBERTY JUST

20:11.400 --> 20:13.833
COUPLE OF MILES FROM THEIR

20:13.833 --> 20:15.200
APARTMENT WAS A YEARLY

20:15.200 --> 20:16.400
DESTINATION FOR THIS FAMILY.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.333
AND IT'S AS GOOD A PLACE AS AN

20:18.333 --> 20:27.000
TO END THIS STORY.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.433
NORMANDY'S FATHER HAD NOTHING

20:29.433 --> 20:32.367
DO WITH MAKING BIG MONEY

20:32.367 --> 20:33.433
THEY HAD THAT.

20:33.433 --> 20:36.033
IT ALL HAD TO DO WHAT HIS FATHER

20:36.033 --> 20:39.667
HEARD IN THE GUNS OF NORMANDY AN

20:39.667 --> 20:43.667
WHAT HE HEARD AT JFK

20:43.667 --> 20:44.800
WHEN YOU MEET THEM AND

20:44.800 --> 20:47.167
UNDERSTAND THEIR SACRIFICE, YO

20:47.167 --> 20:48.567
CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER IF MAYBE

20:48.567 --> 20:52.067
THE GREAT LADY'S GAZE IS NOT

20:52.067 --> 20:53.367
SCANNING THE HORIZON FOR

20:53.367 --> 20:55.100
OPPORTUNITY AS MANY BELIEVE BU
