00:01.535 --> 00:05.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now we return to the tensions
between
Saudi Arabia and Iran I'm joined
by

00:05.472 --> 00:10.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
volleying Nasr dean of the Johns
Hopkins
School of Advanced International
Studies

00:10.110 --> 00:16.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Rhonda sleeve of the Middle
East
Institute and we welcome you
both want

00:16.416 --> 00:20.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to seem to you first why did the
saudi
execute this cleric whom they
had

00:20.954 --> 00:26.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imprisoned already for several
years
this is a crisis that need to be
looked

00:26.927 --> 00:33.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at in the context of an ongoing
rivalry
for power between Saudi Arabia
and Iran

00:33.967 --> 00:41.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and this execution is a message
from the
saudis to Iran but also it's a
message

00:41.241 --> 00:46.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to its own domestic constituency
but I
think the crisis that has been
you know

00:46.513 --> 00:51.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caused by this execution is
primarily
driven by domestic factors we
have two

00:51.785 --> 00:55.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
teams in this case in Saudi
Arabia and
Iran that they are acting out of
fear

00:55.822 --> 01:01.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and out of feelings of
insecurity about
the long-term stability of the
regime

01:01.295 --> 01:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they are using this crisis
as a way
to consolidate power and support

01:07.501 --> 01:11.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
internally and to send messages
or so

01:11.605 --> 01:16.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regionally so Vali Nasr the
saudis had
to know that this would inflame
and

01:16.743 --> 01:22.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anger Iran yes they did and this
came
after another crisis which
followed a

01:22.282 --> 01:27.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kid the death of several hundred
Iranian
pilgrims during a tragedy in
Mecca last

01:27.754 --> 01:32.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year the relations got very
tense both
sides accuse one another of bad

01:32.826 --> 01:38.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
intentions and Iran had also
warned
about the killing of this this
cleric

01:38.665 --> 01:42.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so had the united states and
the
killing of a cleric particularly
Shiite

01:42.903 --> 01:47.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Islam is not a trifle too
trivial matter
and the saudis knew that this is
killing

01:47.808 --> 01:52.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Shiite clerics is not killing
like
killing any other Shiite
activists and i

01:52.512 --> 01:57.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think is absolutely correct that
there
was domestic factor this
execution came

01:57.718 --> 02:02.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two days after the saudis
announce their
first austerity package
internally as a

02:02.322 --> 02:07.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consequence of production of oil
prices
it also came regionally right
after the

02:07.427 --> 02:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
United States first included

02:09.196 --> 02:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running the Vienna process and
then they
shared government in Iraq with
American

02:12.899 --> 02:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Iranian support recaptured
Ramadi it
looked like Iranians are
actually on a

02:17.637 --> 02:22.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a much more of an upswing in
the
region than than than the saudis
were so

02:22.242 --> 02:25.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's also a signal in addition
to the
domestic policy the signal to
the United

02:25.612 --> 02:27.214 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
States as well

02:27.247 --> 02:32.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fair to say there's more
animosity on
the part of the saudis toward
Iran than

02:32.219 --> 02:38.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other way around I think
look the
Iranian threat has all been
private era

02:38.625 --> 02:45.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
prioritized by the Saudi
political
establishment and untie Iran
feelings

02:45.532 --> 02:50.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anti-shock feelings are also
prevalent
among large segments of the
Saudi

02:50.437 --> 02:56.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
population but I agree with my
friend
Valley but there is also on the
Iranian

02:56.576 --> 03:02.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
side there are certain
hardliners inside
the Iranian regime that have
approved of

03:02.949 --> 03:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the attacks against the Saudi
embassy
and the Saudi consulate and
these are

03:06.787 --> 03:14.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the members of the Iraqi regime
that are
feeling very concerned cared
about the

03:14.828 --> 03:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
consequences of the iran deal
about Iran
opening to the outside world and
how

03:19.666 --> 03:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is going to affect their
own hold
on political and economic power
and they

03:24.805 --> 03:31.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are using this this crisis as as
a way
to wrap up support and
consolidate that

03:31.411 --> 03:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
camp ahead of the upcoming
elections in
Iran in February so you're so
violates

03:37.384 --> 03:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some elements in iran using this
to
bolster their own case against

03:43.023 --> 03:46.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
normalizing or even coming close
to
normal

03:46.626 --> 03:50.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rising relations with the west
might
agree with it would run

03:50.530 --> 03:54.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there is at action in Iran which
is not
happy with the nuclear deal is
not happy

03:54.301 --> 03:58.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a change of Iran status in
the
global affairs and also wants to
defeat

03:59.005 --> 04:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Rohani on and and and
his
moderates in the upcoming
elections and

04:04.044 --> 04:09.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the side the saudi
action is
much like when republicans in
congress

04:09.349 --> 04:13.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
posture with new sanctions
against Iran
the conservatives immediately
take

04:13.987 --> 04:18.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advantage of it in order to
muddy the
water embarrass the president
and try to

04:18.825 --> 04:22.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prove that opening to the west
has
actually been a mistake and that
Iran

04:22.162 --> 04:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would do a lot better by taking
a hard
line position having settled its
Rhonda

04:26.766 --> 04:31.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slim what are the consequences
and we
know there's the war in Syria
there is

04:32.005 --> 04:37.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Indian nuclear deal with
iran and
aus what happens to that nuclear
deal

04:37.511 --> 04:39.179 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going forward

04:39.212 --> 04:44.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look this is happening at the
time when
tensions specialist sectarian
tensions

04:44.117 --> 04:48.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the region that they are
already at
it high pitch so it's like
pouring

04:48.221 --> 04:55.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gasoline on a fire and the
fallout for
example in terms of the
implications for

04:55.328 --> 04:59.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the negotiations in Syria or the
UN
sponsored negotiations that were
to be

04:59.900 --> 05:03.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
launched at the end of this
month in
Syria as well as un attempts to

05:03.770 --> 05:08.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establish a permanent cease-fire
in
Yemen I think we can we can
further you

05:08.141 --> 05:13.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know we can say that these
efforts are
have now been dealt a very
severe blow

05:13.580 --> 05:17.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are on life support and I
don't
know whether the upcoming
negotiations

05:17.584 --> 05:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria will take place now
neither
Saudi Arabia note Iran are
incentivized

05:24.191 --> 05:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to make concessions to pressure
their
Syrian proxies to make the
session but

05:29.029 --> 05:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then there is also a broader
regional
fallout I'm very concerned about
whether

05:33.233 --> 05:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bahrain will follow Saudi Arabia
Sudan
to ramp up its security approach
in its

05:37.938 --> 05:43.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into dealing with its own Shiite
opposition the fallout with the
security

05:43.577 --> 05:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Lebanon Lebanon where if Iran
or
Saudi Arabia tries to pressure
their

05:48.782 --> 05:53.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
respective proxies in Lebanon to
take
sides how this will impact
already high

05:53.320 --> 05:57.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regional sectarian tension and
violence
or how do you see the
repercussions

05:57.891 --> 06:02.262 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going forward well i i agree
with
everything that Rhonda said

06:02.295 --> 06:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also it's important to note
that the
united states and its
international

06:06.299 --> 06:10.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
allies have their own interest
in the
region which is fighting I says
ending

06:10.870 --> 06:15.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the war in Syria making the
Iranian
nuclear deal successful it's
very clear

06:15.208 --> 06:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the hard-liners in Iran and
Saudi
regime have a different agenda
here and

06:19.913 --> 06:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sectarianism serves at the
agenda
Saudi Arabia did not want Iran
to be

06:24.417 --> 06:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
included in the regional process
sees it
does not want Iran to be
normalize

06:30.624 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relations with the west from the
very
early on he rejected the nuclear
deal

06:34.494 --> 06:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he tied the nuclear deal to
regional
issues and also saudi arabia is
much

06:39.699 --> 06:44.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more interested in seeing the
problem in
the Middle East is iran not Isis
well as

06:44.037 --> 06:49.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the west is now Isis going
forward
in 2016 if the united states
wants to

06:49.109 --> 06:53.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get ahead of the ISIS issue if
it wants
to find a way to end the war in
Syria

06:53.747 --> 06:56.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which I'm I agree with you on
that is
not very difficult to see how
they've

06:56.583 --> 07:02.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been a process that will get us
there it
has to be it has to essentially
be very

07:02.822 --> 07:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear about what it expects of
both
sides in terms of cooperation
serious

07:07.227 --> 07:08.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
repercussions everywhere you
look

07:08.862 --> 07:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
filing officer Rhonda slim we
thank you
both
