JUDY WOODRUFF: And for more
on the latest documents in
the Russia investigation, we

00:04.133 --> 00:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turn to the vice chairman on
the Senate Select Committee on
Intelligence, Mark Warner of

00:08.000 --> 00:09.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Virginia.

00:09.000 --> 00:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins us from Capitol Hill.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Senator Warner, thank
you for being here.

00:12.566 --> 00:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of
this latest story?

00:14.266 --> 00:16.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ÑMD-BOÑSEN.

00:16.300 --> 00:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia: Well,
Judy, again, I have said this
a couple of times, that you

00:19.000 --> 00:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can't make some
of this stuff up.

00:21.033 --> 00:25.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It would -- it
strains credibility.

00:25.133 --> 00:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This bothers me on
a variety of levels.

00:27.100 --> 00:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, it bothers me that this
is a continuing series of
individuals affiliated with the

00:33.900 --> 00:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump campaign or the Trump
administration who say they
have had no meetings or contacts

00:39.866 --> 00:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Russians, until there is
proof of those meetings, and
then they have to recant or,

00:43.900 --> 00:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the case of General Flynn,
the national security adviser,
he got fired, or the attorney

00:48.266 --> 00:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
general had to recuse himself.

00:50.966 --> 00:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's particularly, I
think, significant about these
last 48 hours is, this is the

00:55.233 --> 01:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first time the public is seeing
now in black and white what we
have heard from the intelligence

01:02.166 --> 01:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community, that there was an
organized effort by the Russian
government to interfere to

01:05.733 --> 01:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help one candidate, Donald
Trump, to hurt another
candidate, Hillary Clinton.

01:12.766 --> 01:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what is so particularly
disturbing is that we have
now got the president's son,

01:15.300 --> 01:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president's son-in-law and
the president's campaign manager
at the time all being willing

01:22.366 --> 01:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take the meeting that this
so-called Russian agent, or at
least has been represented as

01:27.466 --> 01:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of this Russian government
effort to discredit Clinton,
and that they were anxious

01:30.233 --> 01:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to receive this
kind of information.

01:32.800 --> 01:37.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I find that -- and there
would be folks like
special counsel Mueller
who will have to determine

01:39.833 --> 01:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether that meets a legal
standard of criminality,
but it sure does make
it very important that

01:44.600 --> 01:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we in the Senate investigating
committee get a chance
to talk to all three
of these individuals,

01:48.300 --> 01:49.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which we plan to do.

01:49.933 --> 01:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
you mentioned -- you
used the word collusion.

01:51.700 --> 01:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You said that's what this
investigation has been about.

01:56.333 --> 02:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of your Democratic
colleagues on the Intelligence
Committee, Senator Wyden
of Oregon, said today

02:02.700 --> 02:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this proves there was at
least an attempt at collusion.

02:04.966 --> 02:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that how you see it?

02:05.966 --> 02:08.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:08.133 --> 02:10.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK WARNER: Well, Judy,
I feel like my job in
this investigation is to
keep this investigation

02:10.266 --> 02:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bipartisan, working
along with Chairman Burr.

02:13.033 --> 02:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to reserve my final
judgments until we get a chance
to talk to all of the witnesses,

02:18.033 --> 02:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get all of the information that
we're continuing to collect.

02:21.600 --> 02:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it sure as heck bothers me
that there is this continuing
pattern of individuals

02:28.933 --> 02:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the Trump campaign and
the Trump administration
denying these contacts
with Russians, and

02:32.566 --> 02:37.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then, when the proof comes
out, they dodge or dance
or amend their filings.

02:39.600 --> 02:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, now, in a particular case,
we're asked to believe that the
president's son and son-in-law

02:45.633 --> 02:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had information that was part
of a Russian government effort
to discredit their opponent,

02:52.666 --> 02:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that somehow that was
never shared with their
father or father-in-law.

02:54.633 --> 02:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, I will accept that their
word until we get a chance
to talk to them in person.

02:59.466 --> 03:03.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Senator,
how do you, though, interpret
their evolving explanations?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:05.700 --> 03:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: It is -- frankly,
it strains credibility that
this administration continues

03:11.600 --> 03:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to say there's no there there,
yet we have seen this pattern,
not with one, two, three,

03:17.366 --> 03:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but literally I think it was
close to a dozen individuals
that have either been affiliated

03:20.100 --> 03:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the information or in a
case of certain spokespeople
who said, for example, that Jim

03:27.133 --> 03:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comey was fired because of his
bad performance with handling
the Hillary Clinton e-mails,

03:32.700 --> 03:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only to be corrected by the
president himself when he called
James Comey a nutjob in front

03:38.966 --> 03:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Russians and said it
was all about the Russian
investigation itself.

03:41.400 --> 03:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have this constant
pattern where this
administration doesn't
come clean on these

03:48.133 --> 03:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
items involving Russia until
the proof comes out, and then
we hear fairly feeble excuses.

03:53.433 --> 03:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I hear
you saying, Senator,
you're not prepared to
pronounce whether there

03:56.200 --> 03:58.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was collusion.

03:58.300 --> 04:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You're not prepared to
say whether there was
illegality, but you have
been around politics

04:01.066 --> 04:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now for a number of years.

04:03.700 --> 04:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you judge, how do you
weigh the -- at least the facts
on the table at this point?

04:10.300 --> 04:12.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:12.333 --> 04:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Well, Judy, I
have heard some of the people
coming to the defense of the

04:17.700 --> 04:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president's son that this
was a rookie mistake.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't accept that.

04:21.566 --> 04:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think anyone of any kind
of basic knowledge would know
that you don't take information

04:30.633 --> 04:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from a foreign power, and
particularly a foreign power
that's an adversary like Russia.

04:35.466 --> 04:40.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, clearly, what was laid
out in the e-mail in black and
white was that this was part

04:41.933 --> 04:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a Russian government effort
to help then candidate Trump.

04:44.566 --> 04:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you see, not only was there
no pushback on that, but in
terms of reading the e-mail,

04:51.600 --> 04:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump Jr. said, that's
great, and wouldn't it be great
if we got that information late

04:54.300 --> 04:56.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the summer?

04:56.366 --> 04:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you follow the timeline
-- I'm sure all your audience
hasn't followed this quite

04:59.633 --> 05:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as closely as I have -- but
it was late in the summer that
more and more of these DNC

05:06.633 --> 05:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mails were released, where
then Trump confidant Roger Stone
first started tweeting about the

05:12.333 --> 05:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that he had contact with
a Russian cutout, Guccifer 2.0,
and that it would soon be John

05:17.266 --> 05:19.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Podesta's turn in
the so-called barrel.

05:19.333 --> 05:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sure enough, it was John
Podesta's e-mails that were
subsequently leaked as well.

05:23.700 --> 05:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the timing, in terms of
what Donald Trump Jr. was hoping
and then what came to pass

05:29.566 --> 05:31.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is also a little bit curious.

05:31.566 --> 05:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator, finally,
how do you view the likelihood
that the president himself

05:33.833 --> 05:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
didn't know about this?

05:35.200 --> 05:37.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The White House is
saying he did not know.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you take them at their word?

05:38.433 --> 05:39.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I will take them
at their word at this point.

05:41.933 --> 05:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the idea that the
president's son and son-in-law
had this kind of outreach from

05:47.733 --> 05:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what appears to be an agent of
the Russian government, and that
there was a Russian government

05:49.800 --> 05:54.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
- - knowledge of an
effort to help candidate
Trump, I'm surprised
at least -- and, again,

05:56.666 --> 06:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will take them at their
word -- but surprised at
least that this wouldn't
come up over dinner

06:00.500 --> 06:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
conversation at some point
over the ensuing months.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But can we
assume that's a question
you will be asking?

06:04.900 --> 06:06.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:06.933 --> 06:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: You can
assume darn right that's a
question I will be asking.

06:09.500 --> 06:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator
Mark Warner, vice chairman
of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence,

06:12.733 --> 06:13.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we thank you.

06:13.733 --> 06:14.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:14.733 --> 06:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Thank you, Judy.
