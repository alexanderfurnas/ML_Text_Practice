00:47.981 --> 00:49.416
"SIGNIFICANT GAPS" REMAIN.

00:49.416 --> 00:50.784
A GREEK OFFICIAL SAID THE E.U.'S

00:50.784 --> 00:51.985
INSISTENCE THAT PENSIONS BE CUT

00:51.985 --> 00:53.420
REMAINS A MAJOR STICKING POINT.

00:53.420 --> 00:54.621
GREECE COULD DEFAULT ON ITS

00:54.621 --> 00:56.556
DEBTS BY THE END OF THE MONTH.

00:56.556 --> 00:57.758
THE E.U. SAYS IT WILL ONLY SEND

00:57.758 --> 00:59.026
MONEY IF GREECE CUTS SPENDING BY

00:59.026 --> 01:00.627

GERMAN VICE CHANCELLOR SIGMAR

01:05.399 --> 01:07.167
GABRIEL SAID TODAY THE REPEATED

01:07.167 --> 01:11.104
NEGOTIATIONS MAKE THE PROCESS

01:11.104 --> 01:12.039
LOOK "RIDICULOUS" AND THAT "AN

01:12.039 --> 01:13.106
EVER GREATER NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:13.106 --> 01:16.410
FEEL AS IF THE GREEK GOVERNMENT

01:16.410 --> 01:17.511
IS GIVING THEM THE RUN AROUND".

01:17.511 --> 01:18.578
THE ISRAELI GOVERNMENT TODAY

01:18.578 --> 01:19.746
ISSUED A REPORT CALLING ITS

01:19.746 --> 01:21.081
CONDUCT DURING LAST YEAR'S WAR

01:22.149 --> 01:23.216
LAWFUL" AND SAYING IT HAD DONE

01:23.216 --> 01:24.651
ALL IT COULD TO AVOID CIVILIAN

01:24.651 --> 01:25.953
CASUALTIES.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.421
ISRAEL ACCUSED HAMAS OF USING

01:27.421 --> 01:28.822
ITS OWN PEOPLE AS HUMAN SHIELDS

01:28.822 --> 01:30.290
DURING THE SEVEN-WEEK CONFLICT

01:30.290 --> 01:31.725
WHICH CLAIMED MORE 2,200

01:31.725 --> 01:33.060
PALESTINIAN LIVES.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.135
WHOEVER WANTS TO CONTINUE WITH

BASELESS BLAMING OF THE STATE OF

01:43.503 --> 01:44.771
ISRAEL, LET THEM WASTE TIME

01:44.771 --> 01:46.440
READING THE REPORT BY THE U.N.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.674
COMMISSION.

01:47.674 --> 01:49.176
WE, FOR OUR PART, WILL CONTINUE

PROTECTING OUR SOLDIERS.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.578

IMPENDING RELEASE OF A SEPARATE

01:56.984 --> 01:58.352
REPORT BY THE U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS

01:58.352 --> 01:59.553

01:59.553 --> 02:00.787
WHETHER ISRAEL COMMITTED WAR

02:00.787 --> 02:01.722
CRIMES DURING THE SEVEN-WEEK

02:01.722 --> 02:03.290
CONFLICT.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.624
ISRAEL HAS ACCUSED THE U.N. OF

02:04.624 --> 02:06.793
HAVING A PRO-PALESTINIAN BIAS.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.462
HAMAS SAID TODAY THAT ISRAEL IS

02:08.462 --> 02:10.330
TRYING, IN ITS WORDS, TO CONTROL

02:10.330 --> 02:11.531
THE INTERNATIONAL NARRATIVE IN

02:11.531 --> 02:15.002
ANTICIPATION OF THE U.N. REPORT.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.770
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S POINT MAN IN

02:16.770 --> 02:18.238
THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS SAID

02:18.238 --> 02:19.673
TODAY THAT THE ISLAMIC MILITANT

02:19.673 --> 02:21.208
GROUP POSES AN UNPRECEDENTED

02:21.208 --> 02:22.876
THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES, BUT

02:22.876 --> 02:24.745
HE SAID PRO-WESTERN FORCES ARE

02:24.745 --> 02:26.179
MAKING GAINS AGAINST THE ISLAMIC

02:26.179 --> 02:27.647
EXTREMIST GROUP.

02:27.647 --> 02:28.982
PRESIDENTIAL ENVOY BRETT MCGURK

02:28.982 --> 02:31.385
SPOKE ON MEET THE PRESS.

02:31.385 --> 02:32.652
>> IN NORTHERN SYRIA, AS WE

02:32.652 --> 02:34.588
SPEAK THE KURDS WITH ARAB, FREE

02:34.588 --> 02:36.023
SYRIAN ARMY FIGHTERS AN SOME

02:36.023 --> 02:37.657
CHRISTIAN ORGANIZED UNITS, THEY

02:37.657 --> 02:39.126
ARE TAKING, THEY ARE REALLY

02:39.126 --> 02:40.394
GIVING A BEATING TO ISIS AND

02:40.394 --> 02:41.795
THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO CUTTING

02:41.795 --> 02:43.497
OFF THE MAIN SUPPLY ROUTE THAT

02:43.497 --> 02:45.132
ISIS HAS INTO ITS CAPITAL OF

02:45.132 --> 02:46.033
RAQQAH.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.167
SO THERE IS A LOT GOING ON

02:47.167 --> 02:48.335
CHUCK.

02:48.335 --> 02:49.369
I THINK WATCH THE EUPHRATES

02:49.369 --> 02:50.237
VALLEY OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS

02:50.237 --> 02:51.004
FROM RAQQAH TO RAMADI TO

02:51.004 --> 02:51.905
FALLUJAH.

02:51.905 --> 02:53.540
WE'RE GONNA BE FOCUSED THERE.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.641
>> Sreenivasan: AND NOW TO

02:54.641 --> 02:55.742
AMERICAN POLITICS.

MIAMI DADE COLLEGE, JEB BUSH IS

02:59.212 --> 03:00.480
EXPECTED TO FORMALLY ANNOUNCE

03:00.480 --> 03:01.748
HIS CANDIDACY FOR THE REPUBLICAN

03:01.748 --> 03:03.550
NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT.

03:03.550 --> 03:05.919
TODAY, ON TWITTER, HE RELEASED

03:05.919 --> 03:08.021
HIS CAMPAIGN LOGO, JEB 2016.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.556
DURING AN INTERVIEW BROADCAST

03:09.556 --> 03:10.857
TODAY ON CNN, JEB BUSH WAS ASKED

03:10.857 --> 03:12.059
TO DEFINE HIMSELF.

03:12.059 --> 03:13.627
HE ANSWERED THIS WAY:

03:13.627 --> 03:15.529
>> WHO IS JEB BUSH?

03:15.529 --> 03:18.231
>> WELL, JEB IS DIFFERENT THAN

03:18.231 --> 03:19.433
GEORGE; JEB IS WHO HE IS.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.268
MY LIFE STORY'S DIFFERENT.

03:21.268 --> 03:22.569
>> Sreenivasan: FROM CALIFORNIA

03:22.569 --> 03:23.737
TONIGHT, A REPORT THAT

03:23.737 --> 03:25.172
ACCIDENTAL GUNSHOTS BY LOS

03:25.172 --> 03:26.440
ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF'S

03:26.440 --> 03:27.307
DEPUTIES HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED

03:27.307 --> 03:30.210
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS.

03:30.210 --> 03:30.877
THIS ACCORDING TO THE LOS

03:30.877 --> 03:31.745
ANGELES TIMES.

03:31.745 --> 03:32.579
THE NUMBER OF INCIDENTS

03:32.579 --> 03:33.547
REPORTEDLY JUMPED FROM TWELVE IN

03:33.547 --> 03:34.614
2012 TO THIRTY LAST YEAR.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.049
THE INCREASE COINCIDES WITH THE

03:36.049 --> 03:37.551
DEPARTMENT'S SWITCH TO A NEW

03:37.551 --> 03:38.785
KIND OF HANDGUN THAT DOES NOT

03:38.785 --> 03:40.454
HAVE A SAFETY LEVER AND THAT

03:40.454 --> 03:42.255
REQUIRES LESS PRESSURE TO PULL

03:42.255 --> 03:44.191
THE TRIGGER.

03:44.191 --> 03:45.559
ALSO IN LOS ANGELES THIS

03:45.559 --> 03:46.893

03:51.932 --> 03:53.133
INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO $15

03:53.133 --> 03:54.034

03:54.034 --> 03:55.068
THE CURRENT MINIMUM WAGE THERE

03:55.068 --> 03:56.236
IS $9 AN HOUR.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.637
AN ESTIMATED 600,000 PEOPLE IN

03:57.637 --> 03:58.905
LOS ANGELES EARN THE MINIMUM

03:58.905 --> 04:00.240
WAGE, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM

04:00.240 --> 04:01.775
MINORITIES.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.110
THE INCREASES WILL BE PHASED IN

04:03.110 --> 04:04.578
BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN 25

04:04.578 --> 04:06.213
EMPLOYEES WILL ROLL OUT THE

04:06.213 --> 04:08.748
INCREASES MORE SLOWLY.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.117
AND GOOD NEWS FROM SPACE TODAY.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.718
THE FIRST ROBOT EVER TO LAND ON

04:13.386 --> 04:15.622
FALLING SILENT FOR ALMOST SEVEN

04:15.622 --> 04:17.624
MONTHS.

04:17.624 --> 04:18.925
THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENCY'S"

04:18.925 --> 04:20.360
PHILAE" PROBE LANDED ON THE

04:20.360 --> 04:21.728

04:21.728 --> 04:22.929
STOPPED COMMUNICATING TWO DAYS

04:22.929 --> 04:24.364
LATER.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.465
YESTERDAY, GERMAN RESEARCHERS

04:25.465 --> 04:26.600
CAPTURED A SIGNAL THAT LASTED 85

04:26.600 --> 04:29.369
SECONDS, LONG ENOUGH FOR THE

04:29.369 --> 04:31.304
PROBE TO SEND A NEW BATCH OF

04:31.304 --> 04:33.840
CHEMICAL DATA FROM THE COMET'S

04:33.840 --> 04:42.682
SURFACE.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.384
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE RUSSIAN

04:44.384 --> 04:45.986
FORCES ANNEXED CRIMEA LAST YEAR,

04:45.986 --> 04:47.354
THE UNITED STATES IS REPORTEDLY

04:47.354 --> 04:49.122
POISED TO SEND HEAVY MILITARY

04:49.122 --> 04:50.323
EQUIPMENT INTO SEVERAL EASTERN

04:50.323 --> 04:53.860
EUROPEAN AND BALTIC NATIONS NEAR

04:53.860 --> 04:54.995
RUSSIA.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.463
IT'S MEANT TO REASSURE AMERICAN

04:56.463 --> 04:58.632
ALLIES AND TO DETER RUSSIAN

04:58.632 --> 04:59.666
PRESIDENT VLADIMIR PUTIN FROM

04:59.666 --> 05:01.501

05:05.172 --> 05:06.706
JOINS ME NOW FROM WASHINGTON

05:06.706 --> 05:07.974
D.C. TO EXPLAIN THE PENTAGON'S

05:07.974 --> 05:11.411
POSSIBLE PLAN.

05:11.411 --> 05:12.312
SO WHAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT ARE WE

05:12.312 --> 05:13.313
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.449
>> WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A

05:16.449 --> 05:17.984
BRIGADE'S WORTH OF HEAVY

05:17.984 --> 05:19.686
EQUIPMENT THAT WOULD INCLUDE

05:19.686 --> 05:21.388
TANKS, ARMORED VEHICLES

05:21.388 --> 05:22.822
ARTILLERY PIECES AND SO FORTH.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.057
>> AND WHERE WOULD THIS BE

05:24.057 --> 05:25.225
STATIONED?

05:25.225 --> 05:27.160
>> WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING TO DO IS

05:27.160 --> 05:29.396
TO DEPLOY IT IN SEVERAL OF THE

05:29.396 --> 05:31.131
NATO ALLIES, A BULK OF IT WOULD

05:31.131 --> 05:34.034
BE IN A PLACE LIKE POLAND, THEY

05:34.034 --> 05:36.836
ARE LOOKING AT BULGARIA ROWE

05:36.836 --> 05:42.943
MAIN APP YAH -- ROMANIA, AND

05:42.943 --> 05:44.678
BALTIC NATION THAT ARE SEEN AS

05:44.678 --> 05:46.012
THE MOST VULNERABLE TO RUSSIAN

05:46.012 --> 05:47.180
ATTACK.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.316
>> HAVE THESE COUNTRIES BEEN

05:49.316 --> 05:50.483
ASKING FOR IT?

05:50.483 --> 05:51.685
WHAT IS THEIR SENSE ON THE

05:51.685 --> 05:52.953
GROUND OF WHY THEY NEED THIS

05:52.953 --> 05:53.386
EQUIPMENT NOW?

05:53.386 --> 05:56.456
>> THEY HAVE BEEN ASKING,

05:56.456 --> 05:56.856
ACTUALLY.

05:56.856 --> 06:00.894
AND IT'S OTHER NATO MEMBERS WHO

06:00.894 --> 06:02.896
ARE A LITTLE BIT RELUCTANT.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.264
INCLUDING THE U.S.

06:04.264 --> 06:08.702
NATO DIDN'T LOOK AT RUSSIA AS AN

06:08.702 --> 06:12.973
ADVERSARY BUT NOW THE CRIMEA AND

06:12.973 --> 06:15.775
EASTERN UKRAINE THEY'RE LOOKING

06:15.775 --> 06:17.410
TO REASSURE THE ALLIES ABOUT THE

UNITED STATES THE ALLIANCE'S

06:20.347 --> 06:22.315
WILLINGNESS TO DEFEND THESE

06:22.315 --> 06:23.283
COUNTRIES.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.719
SINCE THE ANNEXATION OF CRIMEA

06:25.719 --> 06:27.254
LAST YEAR NATO HAS BEEN STEPPING

06:27.254 --> 06:29.389
UP A NUMBER OF EXERCISES THEY

06:29.389 --> 06:31.858
HAVE BEEN DOING, TRAINING

06:31.858 --> 06:32.859
MISSIONS AND SO FORTH.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.427
YOU SEE A LOT OF INCREASED

06:34.427 --> 06:35.762
ACTIVITY.

06:35.762 --> 06:39.899
EVERY TIME THE UNITED STATES

06:39.899 --> 06:45.505
PARTICIPATES, THEY HAVE TO BRING

06:45.505 --> 06:50.076
THE TANKS, A ENORMOUS LOGISTICAL

06:50.076 --> 06:51.778
LIFT.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.980
TO HAVE THAT EQUIPMENT

06:53.980 --> 06:55.081
PREPOSITIONED IN THE PLACE WREST

06:55.081 --> 06:57.484
THESE TROOPS WILL ROTATE MORE

06:57.484 --> 06:58.885
AND MORE FREQUENTLY AND FOR THE

06:58.885 --> 06:59.419
TIME BEING.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.256
>> SO HOW FAR ALONG IS THE IS

07:03.256 --> 07:05.892
PLAN TO DEPLOY THESE WEAPONS,

07:05.892 --> 07:06.393
THIS EQUIPMENT?

07:06.393 --> 07:09.029
>> THE PENTAGON HAS BEEN WORKING

07:09.029 --> 07:10.630
ON THIS FOR A NUMBER OF MONTHS

07:10.630 --> 07:13.266
NOW AND IT'S EXPECTED THAT THE

07:13.266 --> 07:17.070
SECRETARY ASHTON CARTER WILL

07:17.070 --> 07:18.538
PRESENT THIS TO THE NATO DEFENSE

07:18.538 --> 07:19.806
MINISTERS WHEN THEY MEET LATER

07:19.806 --> 07:21.641
THIS MONTH.

07:21.641 --> 07:25.111
>> IS IT IN ANTICIPATION TO AN

07:25.111 --> 07:26.780
INCREASED AMOUNT OF

07:26.780 --> 07:27.580
AGGRESSION FROM RUSSIA?

07:27.580 --> 07:33.453
>> I THINK IT'S IN RESPONSE TO

07:33.453 --> 07:34.020
AGGRESSION.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.924
RUSSIAN EXERCISES ON THE BORDERS

07:37.924 --> 07:39.359
IN THE BALTIC AREA PARTICULARLY

07:39.359 --> 07:40.794
BUT ALSO IN THE SOUTH AROUND

07:40.794 --> 07:42.095
OBVIOUSLY EASTERN UKRAINE AND

07:42.095 --> 07:43.663
THE I THINK THAT THE NATO

07:43.663 --> 07:44.798
ALLIES, NATO COMMANDERS ARE

07:44.798 --> 07:47.801
LOOKING AT THIS AS A WAY TO

07:47.801 --> 07:51.037
BUILD UP ASSURANCE A TRIP WIRE

07:51.037 --> 07:54.140
IF YOU WILL, THAT YOU KNOW, ANY

07:54.140 --> 07:55.842
MOVE AGAINST

07:55.842 --> 07:57.577
ANY OF THESE NATO ALLIES VERY

07:57.577 --> 08:00.914
QUICKLY AMERICAN MILITARY

08:00.914 --> 08:03.650
EQUIPMENT AND THE TROOPS WHO

08:03.650 --> 08:05.352
COULD QUICKLY RESPOND AND

08:05.352 --> 08:07.387
FALLING ON IT.

08:07.387 --> 08:08.321
>> ONE COUNTRY'S PREPOSITIONING

08:08.321 --> 08:09.389
COULD BE ANOTHER COUNTRY'S WHAT

08:09.389 --> 08:10.490
IS THE RESPONSE FROM THE KREMLIN

08:10.490 --> 08:12.692
OR HAS THERE BEEN ONE YET?

08:12.692 --> 08:15.061
>> THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE, AND

08:15.061 --> 08:16.663
THERE'S NO QUESTION THEY'LL VIEW

08:16.663 --> 08:19.065
THIS AS AN AGGRESSIVE ACT.

08:19.065 --> 08:20.500
PUTIN FOR A LONG TIME HAS BEEN

08:20.500 --> 08:24.971
COMPLAINING THAT NATO

08:24.971 --> 08:26.072
SPECIFICALLY THE AMERICAN

08:26.072 --> 08:28.641
MILITARY IS ENCROACHING CLOSER

08:28.641 --> 08:33.213
AND CLOSE ARE TO RUSSIA'S

08:33.213 --> 08:35.849
BORDERS.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.283
AND IN FACT THE UNITED STATES

08:37.283 --> 08:38.718
HASN'T BUT SINCE THE EVENTS OVER

08:38.718 --> 08:41.388
THE LAST YEAR IT HAS BECOME MORE

08:41.388 --> 08:44.157
AND MORE A REALITY WHAT PUTIN

08:44.157 --> 08:46.659
FEARED MOST.

08:46.659 --> 08:47.994
I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF

08:47.994 --> 08:49.429
STATES THAT DON'T WANT TO SEE US

08:49.429 --> 08:50.797
BACK RESPONSE AND COUNTER

08:50.797 --> 08:52.632
RESPONSE TIT-FOR-TAT BUILDUP BUT

08:52.632 --> 08:55.902
THE FACT IS WITH YOU KNOW SO

08:55.902 --> 08:57.971
MANY RUSSIAN TROOPS SO

08:57.971 --> 09:02.475
CLOSE TO NATO'S BORDERS WITH THE

09:02.475 --> 09:04.444
BALTIC STATES THAT YOU KNOW THE

09:04.444 --> 09:06.546
PENTAGON IS CONSIDERING

09:06.546 --> 09:07.680
BELIEVES IT NECESSARY TO SHOW A

09:07.680 --> 09:08.615
LITTLE BIT MORE RESOLVE FOR THE

09:08.615 --> 09:09.682
ALLIANCE.

09:09.682 --> 09:13.319
>> ALL RIGHT, STEVEN LEE MYERS

09:13.319 --> 09:18.024
OF THE NEW YORK TIMES, THANK YOU

09:18.024 --> 09:26.266
VERY MUCH.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.667
>> Sreenivasan: INVESTIGATORS

09:27.667 --> 09:28.601
WARNED EARLIER THIS MONTH THAT

09:28.601 --> 09:29.702
QATAR COULD LOSE THE 2022 WORLD

09:29.702 --> 09:30.503
CUP IF IT IS PROVEN THAT

09:30.503 --> 09:31.671
OFFICIALS FROM THAT PERSIAN GULF

09:31.671 --> 09:32.705
NATION BRIBED INTERNATIONAL

09:32.705 --> 09:33.706
SOCCER OFFICIALS TO GET TO HOST

09:33.706 --> 09:34.474
THE GAMES.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.508
THAT COUNTRY HAS ALREADY STARTED

09:35.508 --> 09:36.443
WORK ON NEW STADIUMS, HOTELS,

09:36.443 --> 09:37.544
HIGHWAYS, SHOPPING MALLS AND

09:37.544 --> 09:38.611
AIRPORTS, HUGE CONSTRUCTION

09:38.611 --> 09:39.646
PROJECTS SAID TO BE WORTH

09:39.646 --> 09:41.581
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.

09:41.581 --> 09:42.816
IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR FOREIGN

09:42.816 --> 09:45.418
WORKERS SEEKING HIGHER WAGES.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.353
AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

09:47.353 --> 09:50.490
NEPALESE HAVE MADE THE 21-

09:50.490 --> 09:52.225
HUNDRED MILE TRIP IN SEARCH OF

09:52.225 --> 09:52.992
WORK THERE.

09:52.992 --> 09:53.993
BUT AS I.T.V.'S INTERNATIONAL

09:53.993 --> 09:55.261
CORRESPONDENT JOHN IRVINE

09:55.261 --> 09:56.296
REPORTS, ONCE THEY GET THERE,

09:56.296 --> 09:59.165
MANY ARE LIVING IN SQUALID

09:59.165 --> 09:59.699
CONDITIONS.

09:59.699 --> 10:08.541
AND SOME ARE EVEN DYING.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.643
>> QATAR AIRWAYS HAS THREE

10:10.643 --> 10:14.948
FLIGHTS A DAY INTO KATHMANDU.

10:14.948 --> 10:19.219
KATHMANDU.

10:19.219 --> 10:22.388
THIS WOMAN WAITS FOR HER HUSBAND

10:22.388 --> 10:28.127
BUT FOR MINA WHEN HE LEFT FOR

10:28.127 --> 10:29.596
QATAR SIX MONTHS AGO, SHE WAS

10:29.596 --> 10:30.864
HIS WIFE.

10:30.864 --> 10:36.202
TODAY SHE'S HIS WIDOW.

10:36.202 --> 10:37.971
A SAD SIGHT, THE AUTHORITIES

10:37.971 --> 10:40.373
DIDN'T WANT US TO FILM.

10:40.373 --> 10:44.844
THE HUSBAND'S COFFIN

10:44.844 --> 10:46.980
27-YEAR-OLD SHEVA TAMANG DIED ON

10:46.980 --> 10:48.314
A BUILDING SITE ACCIDENT ON

10:48.314 --> 10:51.985
APRIL THE 19th.

10:51.985 --> 10:56.322
TO COMBINE HIS WIDOW'S GRIEF,

10:56.322 --> 10:58.458
THESE PEOPLE BELIEVE IN FUNERALS

10:58.458 --> 11:05.832
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER DEATH.

11:05.832 --> 11:06.766
THE DELAY FLIGHTS CONVENTION

11:06.766 --> 11:11.938
HERE.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.306
AS IF A SINGLE COFFIN WASN'T BAD

11:13.306 --> 11:14.307
ENOUGH THERE WERE TWO OTHERS ON

11:14.307 --> 11:15.241
THE SAME FLIGHT.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.342
AGAIN THE BODIES WERE THOSE OF

11:16.342 --> 11:17.544
YOUNG MEN, ONE HAD DIED IN A

11:17.544 --> 11:19.012
TRAFFIC ACCIDENT, THE OTHER FROM

11:19.012 --> 11:25.418
A SUDDEN HEART ATTACK.

11:25.418 --> 11:32.158
CARDIAC ARREST IS THE AMOUNTED

11:32.158 --> 11:34.093
TO BEING WORKED TO DEATH.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.695
BUT HE DISAGREED, SAYING IT WAS

11:35.695 --> 11:41.868
AN ORIENTATION PROBLEM.

11:41.868 --> 11:47.240
>> WHEN THEY FINISH THE JOB THEY

11:47.240 --> 11:49.042
COME BACK TO THEIR ROOM AND THEN

11:49.042 --> 11:50.476
THEY OPEN THE AIR CONDITIONER.

11:50.476 --> 11:51.311
SO THAT IS WHY IN THAT CASE,

11:51.311 --> 11:52.045
THEY HAVE LIKE A HEART ATTACK

11:52.045 --> 11:52.745
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

11:52.745 --> 11:53.713
SO THAT'S WHY WE NEED A GOOD

11:53.713 --> 11:58.718
ORIENTATION.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.053
>> WITH NO WORK AVAILABLE AT

12:00.053 --> 12:01.821
HOME THESE BE NEPALESE MEN ARE

12:01.821 --> 12:05.792
QUEUING FOR PERMITS TO GO TO

12:05.792 --> 12:07.694
THE GULF COUNTRIES INCLUDING

12:07.694 --> 12:09.128
QATAR.

12:09.128 --> 12:14.567
I HAVE CONCERNS BUT I HAVE TO

12:14.567 --> 12:15.602
FEED MY FAMILY SAID THIS MAN.

12:15.602 --> 12:16.869
LAST YEAR WE WERE INVITED TO

12:16.869 --> 12:18.571
QATAR TO LOOK AT A NEW

12:18.571 --> 12:19.606
ACCOMMODATION TO BLOCK MIGRANT

12:19.606 --> 12:22.108
HOUSING WORKERS.

12:22.108 --> 12:23.710
BUT WE FOUND THESE OTHER SQUALID

12:23.710 --> 12:29.215
QUARTERS CRAMMED FULL OF

12:29.215 --> 12:30.783
NEPALESE LABORERS, SLEEPING 18

12:30.783 --> 12:31.651
TO A

12:31.651 --> 12:33.252
ROOM.

12:33.252 --> 12:38.157
OTHER BRITISH JOURNALISTS WERE

12:38.157 --> 12:39.192
FOLLOWED, ARRESTED AND

12:39.192 --> 12:40.526
INTERROGATED.

12:40.526 --> 12:43.529
THE QATARIS CLAIM THAT

12:43.529 --> 12:44.631
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT HAS BEEN

12:44.631 --> 12:48.768
MADE IN IMPROVING THE LOSS OF BE

12:48.768 --> 12:53.840
WORKERS BUT SHE DISAGREES.

12:53.840 --> 12:55.241
>> WE HAVEN'T SEEN ANY MARKED

12:55.241 --> 12:58.277
CHANGES IN THE WAY THE WORKER

12:58.277 --> 13:00.580
ARE FARING IN QATAR TODAY, AS

13:00.580 --> 13:03.116
OPPOSED TO FIVE YEARS EARLIER.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.117
>> SO THE WORLD CUP IS NOT THE

13:04.117 --> 13:04.884
CATALYST FOR CHANGE THAT YOU HAD

13:04.884 --> 13:06.152
HOPED FOR?

13:06.152 --> 13:11.758
>> I DON'T THINK SO, NO.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.393
>> THE BODY WAS TAKEN FROM

13:13.393 --> 13:21.901
KATHMANDU AIRPORT FOR CREMATION.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.671
AS MONKS PERFORM RITUALS, HIS

13:24.671 --> 13:25.705
WIDOW PASSED OUT AND HIS MOTHER

13:25.705 --> 13:27.407
WAILED.

13:27.407 --> 13:28.908
THE QATAR WORLD CUP IS NOW UNDER

13:28.908 --> 13:32.245
INVESTIGATION.

13:32.245 --> 13:34.881
THE FBI AND THE SWISS ARE

13:34.881 --> 13:35.982
COUNTING THE ALLEGED COST IN

13:35.982 --> 13:38.618
BRIBES.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.319
NEPAL IS COUNTING THE ACTUAL

13:40.319 --> 13:52.932
COST IN LIVES.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.367
>> Sreenivasan: IT HAS BEEN

13:54.367 --> 13:55.735
ALMOST A YEAR NOW SINCE WE FIRST

13:55.735 --> 13:57.170
SAW THE VIDEO SHOWING THE

13:57.170 --> 13:58.638
CHOKING DEATH OF ERIC GARNER AS

13:58.638 --> 13:59.806
HE WAS BEING ARRESTED ON STATEN

13:59.806 --> 14:01.007
ISLAND HERE IN NEW YORK.

14:01.007 --> 14:04.377
THAT EVENT, ALONG WITH THE

14:04.377 --> 14:06.612
POLICE SHOOTING IN FERGUSON,

14:06.612 --> 14:07.780
MISSOURI, OF MICHAEL BROWN,

14:07.780 --> 14:08.748
TRIGGERED NATIONWIDE PROTESTS.

14:08.748 --> 14:09.849
WE'RE NOW LEARNING MUCH MORE

14:09.849 --> 14:10.850
ABOUT THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED

14:10.850 --> 14:11.517
TO GARNER'S DEATH.

14:11.517 --> 14:18.391
REPORTER BENJAMIN MUELLER IS

14:18.391 --> 14:18.925
US WITH THE LATEST.

14:18.925 --> 14:21.360
ONE OF THE FIRST REPORTS POLICE

14:21.360 --> 14:23.196
MADE ABOUT THE INCIDENT

14:23.196 --> 14:24.030
MADE NO REFERENCE TO ACTUALLY

14:24.030 --> 14:25.098
ANYBODY'S HANDS BEING ON HIS

14:25.098 --> 14:26.966
NECK OR HIS ARMS ANYTHING BEING

14:26.966 --> 14:28.434
ON HIS NECK OR HIS ARMS ANYTHING

14:28.434 --> 14:29.368
BEING AROUND HIS NECK YET YOU

14:29.368 --> 14:30.870
QUOTE THE AUTOPSY AS SAYING ON

14:30.870 --> 14:32.004
EXTERNAL EXAMINATION OF THE NECK

14:32.004 --> 14:33.239
THERE ARE NO VISIBLE INJURIES ON

14:33.239 --> 14:34.107
THE INSIDE WERE TELL STALE SIGNS

14:34.107 --> 14:38.745
OF CHOKING.

14:38.745 --> 14:39.545
WHY THIS DISCREPANCY?

14:39.545 --> 14:40.880
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.014
THIS IS AN INTERNAL POLICE

14:42.014 --> 14:43.783
DOCUMENT PREPARED SOON AFTER HIS

14:43.783 --> 14:49.822
DEATH AND SOON AFTER THE

14:49.822 --> 14:50.656
PIVOTAL VIDEO CAME OUT THAT

14:50.656 --> 14:51.958
IS SHOWED THE CHOKE HOLD.

14:51.958 --> 14:55.394
IT CAME OUT FROM SUPERVISORS ON

14:55.394 --> 14:56.929
THE SCENE AND SHOWED NO CONTACT

14:56.929 --> 14:59.966
WITH ERIC GARNER'S NECK.

14:59.966 --> 15:01.734
SHE SAW A CHOKE HOLD AND TOLD US

15:01.734 --> 15:03.736
THAT SHE TOLD THE POLICE

15:03.736 --> 15:04.937
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS WHO

15:04.937 --> 15:06.239
INTERVIEWED HER THAT DAY THAT

15:06.239 --> 15:08.908
SHE SAW A CHOKE HOLD TOO.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.376
THE STATEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO HER

15:10.376 --> 15:11.711
IS DIFFERENT THAN THE ONE SHE

15:11.711 --> 15:13.079
SAID SHE GAVE THEM.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.580
>> SO IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT

15:14.580 --> 15:15.581
VIDEO THERE WAS A CHANCE THAT

15:15.581 --> 15:16.616
VERSION OF THE TRUTH COULD BE

15:16.616 --> 15:18.317
THE RECORD.

15:18.317 --> 15:20.353
SHE'S ALSO BEHIND THE SECOND

15:20.353 --> 15:22.288
VIDEO THAT SHOWS HOW THE

15:22.288 --> 15:23.756
EMERGENCY RESPONDERS, THE

15:23.756 --> 15:30.463
AMBULANCE FOLKS CAME IN THE

15:30.463 --> 15:34.534
MEDICAL TECHNICIANS.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.368
SUPPOSED TO BE TAKEN TO THE

15:35.368 --> 15:36.335
HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY.

15:36.335 --> 15:37.770
WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CASE?

15:37.770 --> 15:38.938
>> FROM THE START THE EMTS WHO

15:38.938 --> 15:41.474
RESPONDED KNEW VERY LITTLE WHAT

15:41.474 --> 15:42.542
THEY WERE RESPONDING TO.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.276
THE CALL CAME IN AS UNKNOWN, LOW

15:43.276 --> 15:44.277
PRIORITY.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.411
THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT POLICE

15:45.411 --> 15:46.445
OFFICERS WERE INVOLVED, THEY

15:46.445 --> 15:49.315
DIDN'T KNOW ERIC GARNER'S

15:49.315 --> 15:50.583
CONDITION WAS, ALL CONDITIONS

15:50.583 --> 15:53.119
THAT HELPED THEM PREPARE.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.654
THERE WERE COMMUNICATIONS

15:54.654 --> 16:01.093
BREAKDOWNS.

16:01.093 --> 16:02.695
THE OXYGEN SUPPLIES WERE NOT

16:02.695 --> 16:04.297
KEPT BY HIS SIDE, IN FACT THEY

16:04.297 --> 16:05.431
ARE CARRIED AWAY FROM HIS SIDE

16:05.431 --> 16:06.365
BY AN EMT TRAINEE WHO WAS ON THE

16:06.365 --> 16:08.000
SCENE.

16:08.000 --> 16:14.507
THERE ARE NO FIRE DEPARTMENT

16:14.507 --> 16:16.642
SUPERVISORS WHO ARE ASSISTING,

16:16.642 --> 16:17.844
BUT THIS DIDN'T START AS THAT

16:17.844 --> 16:18.945
LEVEL OF SERIOUSNESS.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.446
>> WHAT HAPPENS HAPPENED SINCE?

16:20.446 --> 16:25.151
THERE ARE STILL INVESTIGATION

16:25.151 --> 16:26.552
UNDERWAY, THEY HAVEN'T WRAPPED

16:26.552 --> 16:27.653
UP BUT ARE THERE POLICE

16:27.653 --> 16:28.521
DEPARTMENT CHANGES THAT

16:28.521 --> 16:29.622
HAVE BEEN CREATED BECAUSE OF

16:29.622 --> 16:40.166
THIS?

16:40.166 --> 16:42.168
>> THEY HAVE CREATED A NEW

16:42.168 --> 16:46.672
CENTRALIZED UNIT TO INVESTIGATE

16:46.672 --> 16:52.445
DEATHS BY SHOOTING BY POLICE

16:52.445 --> 16:53.045
OFFICERS.

16:53.045 --> 16:53.779
IT IS NOT SURELY HOW THAT WAS

16:53.779 --> 16:54.547
CONNECTED TO THE GARNER INCIDENT

16:54.547 --> 16:55.281
BUT SURELY THAT IS THE STRING OF

16:55.281 --> 16:56.282
DEATHS OF UNARMED BLACK MEN

16:56.282 --> 16:58.551
AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT SET OFF

16:58.551 --> 17:00.386
CALLS FOR A FORUM.

17:00.386 --> 17:01.520
>> BENJAMIN MUELLER, THANK YOU

17:01.520 --> 17:06.959
VERY MUCH.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.060
>> Sreenivasan: HOW CAN THE

17:08.060 --> 17:08.895
OFTEN FRAUGHT RELATIONSHIP

17:08.895 --> 17:09.795
BETWEEN POLICE AND MINORITY

17:09.795 --> 17:10.730
COMMUNITIES BE IMPROVED?

17:10.730 --> 17:11.631
WATCH OUR INTERVIEW WITH TWO

17:11.631 --> 17:12.565
FORMER POLICEMEN FROM EARLIER

17:12.565 --> 17:13.566
THIS YEAR.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.634
VISIT pbs.org/newshour.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.801
THIS WEEKEND IN HAWAII, A GROUP

17:15.801 --> 17:16.802
OF THREE MEN AND THREE WOMEN

17:16.802 --> 17:17.937
COMPLETED THE LONGEST SPACE

17:17.937 --> 17:23.609
SIMULATION EVER CONDUCTED BY THE

17:23.609 --> 17:24.877
IDEA WAS TO SIMULATE CONDITIONS

17:24.877 --> 17:25.978
ASTRONAUTS WOULD FACE LIVING IN

17:25.978 --> 17:27.179
CRAMPED QUARTERS DURING A

17:27.179 --> 17:30.483
PROSPECTIVE MISSION TO MARS IN

17:30.483 --> 17:31.684
THE 2030s.

17:31.684 --> 17:32.518
THE NEWSHOUR'S SASKIA DE MELKER

17:32.518 --> 17:33.185
HAS OUR REPORT.

17:33.185 --> 17:34.287
>> Reporter: HIGH ON THE SLOPES

17:34.287 --> 17:36.389
OF THE MAUNA LOA VOLCANO IN

17:36.389 --> 17:37.790
HAWAII, SIX PEOPLE, THREE MEN

17:37.790 --> 17:39.292
AND THREE WOMEN, HAVE BEEN

17:39.292 --> 17:40.760
LIVING INSIDE THIS DOME,

17:40.760 --> 17:42.028
COMPLETELY ISOLATED FOR THE LAST

17:42.028 --> 17:44.130
EIGHT MONTHS.

17:44.130 --> 17:46.098
NASA AND THE UNIVERSITY OF

17:46.098 --> 17:47.967
HAWAII ARE FUNDING AND LEADING

17:47.967 --> 17:49.936
THE PROJECT KNOWN AS THE HAWAII

17:49.936 --> 17:52.238
SPACE EXPLORATION ANALOG AND

17:52.238 --> 17:54.774
SIMULATION OR HI-SEAS FOR SHORT.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.542
THE ULTIMATE GOAL?

17:56.542 --> 17:57.576
TO STUDY SOCIAL INTERACTION

17:57.576 --> 17:59.779
AMONG CREW ON LONG TERM SPACE

17:59.779 --> 18:01.013
MISSIONS, LIKE THE ONE TO MARS

18:01.013 --> 18:05.418
THAT NASA HOPES TO LAUNCH IN THE

18:05.418 --> 18:06.218
2030s.

18:06.218 --> 18:07.420
AND DRIVING UP TO THE SITE ON

18:07.420 --> 18:08.421
MAUNA LOA, IT'S EASY TO SEE WHY

18:08.421 --> 18:10.523
THEY CHOSE THIS LOCATION.

18:10.523 --> 18:12.325
>> THE SITE IS VERY GEOLOGICALLY

18:12.325 --> 18:13.926
SIMILAR TO A YOUNG MARS.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.294
THERE'S NO SIGNS OF HUMAN LIFE,

18:15.294 --> 18:18.831
THERE'S NO SIGNS OF ANIMAL LIFE,

18:18.831 --> 18:20.299
VERY LITTLE PLANT OR INSECT

18:20.299 --> 18:21.267
LIFE.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.335
>> Reporter: KIM BINSTED IS THE

18:22.335 --> 18:23.269
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE

18:23.269 --> 18:24.437
HI-SEAS STUDY.

18:24.437 --> 18:25.237
WE CAUGHT UP WITH HER VIA SKYPE

18:25.237 --> 18:26.138
FROM HER HOME ON THE BIG ISLAND

18:26.138 --> 18:27.573
OF HAWAII.

18:27.573 --> 18:29.809
>> NASA CERTAINLY HAS A LOT OF

18:29.809 --> 18:31.677
TECHNICAL CONCERNS TO CONSIDER

18:31.677 --> 18:32.979
BUT ALSO THERE'S PROBLEMS TO DO

18:32.979 --> 18:34.313
WITH THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE

18:34.313 --> 18:35.348
EQUATION AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

18:35.348 --> 18:36.782
TRYING TO ADDRESS.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.451
SO THINGS LIKE HOW DO YOU PICK A

18:38.451 --> 18:40.686
CREW SO THAT THEY'LL CONTINUE TO

18:40.686 --> 18:43.656
WORK TOGETHER WELL OVER THE 2.5

18:43.656 --> 18:44.256
TO THREE YEARS OF A MARS

18:44.256 --> 18:45.024
MISSION.

18:45.024 --> 18:45.925
AND HOW DO YOU SUPPORT THEM SO

18:45.925 --> 18:46.792
THAT, TO BE HONEST, THEY DON'T

18:46.792 --> 18:47.727
WANT TO END UP WANTING TO KILL

18:47.727 --> 18:49.161
EACH OTHER.

18:49.161 --> 18:50.596
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A LOT OF

18:50.596 --> 18:52.064
PRIVACY AND PERSONAL TIME AND WE

18:52.064 --> 18:53.666
ALL HAVE SO MUCH GOING ON.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.667
>> Reporter: TO TEST THEIR

18:54.667 --> 18:55.968
INDIVIDUAL AND TEAM BEHAVIOR,

18:55.968 --> 18:57.136
THE CREW COMPLETED NUMEROUS

18:57.136 --> 18:58.738
DAILY SURVEYS, TASKS, AND

18:58.738 --> 19:00.906
COMPUTER GAMES.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.542
THEY ALSO WORE DEVICES CALLED

19:03.542 --> 19:04.410
SOCIO-METERS THAT MEASURE THE

19:04.410 --> 19:05.544
DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM AND THE

19:05.544 --> 19:08.180
VOLUME OF THEIR VOICES.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.448
>> IF TWO PEOPLE ARE STANDING

19:09.448 --> 19:10.950
VERY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER, THE

19:10.950 --> 19:12.018
VOLUME OF THEIR VOICES IS VERY

19:12.018 --> 19:13.319
HIGH, YOU MIGHT ASSUME THEY'RE

19:13.319 --> 19:14.353
HAVING A FIGHT.

19:14.353 --> 19:16.322
AND SIMILARLY IF TWO PEOPLE HAVE

19:16.322 --> 19:17.690
NEVER COME NEAR EACH OTHER, THEN

19:17.690 --> 19:18.557
MAYBE THEY'RE AVOIDING EACH

19:18.557 --> 19:19.959
OTHER.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.460
THOSE MIGHT BE WARNING SIGNS FOR

19:21.460 --> 19:22.561
A PROBLEM THAT IS DEVELOPING

19:22.561 --> 19:23.863
AMONGST THE CREW.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.064
>> Reporter: THEIR COMMUNICATION

19:25.064 --> 19:26.399
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD WAS

19:26.399 --> 19:27.767
LIMITED AND ON A 20 MINUTE TIME

19:27.767 --> 19:29.568
DELAY.

19:29.568 --> 19:30.803
BUT THE CREW DID MAKE AND SHARE

19:30.803 --> 19:31.904
PERIODIC VIDEO DIARIES OF THEIR

19:31.904 --> 19:33.639
EXPERIENCES.

19:33.639 --> 19:34.907
>> SO ONE DISADVANTAGE WOULD BE

19:34.907 --> 19:36.075
THE FOOD.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.176
>> Reporter: THEY WERE FACED

19:37.176 --> 19:38.277
WITH A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS

19:38.277 --> 19:39.412
SIMILAR TO THOSE THAT ASTRONAUTS

19:39.412 --> 19:41.247
ENCOUNTER ON SPACE MISSIONS.

19:41.247 --> 19:42.782
>> SO HERE FOR EXAMPLE IS THE

19:42.782 --> 19:43.916
GREEN AND RED BELL PEPPER AND

19:43.916 --> 19:45.251
THEN WE JUST PUT HOT WATER AND

19:45.251 --> 19:46.118
SOAK THEM FOR A WHILE TO

19:46.118 --> 19:47.586
REHYDRATE.

19:47.586 --> 19:48.888
>> Reporter: THEY COULD ONLY EAT

19:48.888 --> 19:49.922
FREEZE DRIED AND SHELF STABLE

19:49.922 --> 19:51.090
FOODS.

19:51.090 --> 19:53.492
>> ON THIS SIDE WE HAVE ONE OF

19:53.492 --> 19:54.994
EACH OF OUR MEATS.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.462
SO WE HAVE SAUSAGE, BEEF,

19:56.462 --> 19:58.831
CHICKEN, TURKEY.

19:58.831 --> 19:59.932
>> HERE WE HAVE OUR ELECTRICAL

19:59.932 --> 20:00.966
SYSTEM FOR THE HAB.

20:00.966 --> 20:02.234
>> Reporter: LIFE IN THE DOME IS

20:02.234 --> 20:02.968
POWERED BY SOLAR PANELS, AND

20:02.968 --> 20:03.936
RESOURCES, INCLUDING WATER, WERE

20:03.936 --> 20:06.038
RESTRICTED.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.873
>> SO WE HAVE A TIMER HERE THAT

20:07.873 --> 20:09.175
HELPS US KEEP TRACK OF HOW MANY

20:09.175 --> 20:11.143
SECONDS AND MINUTES WE SPEND IN

20:11.143 --> 20:12.578
THE SHOWER

20:12.578 --> 20:14.180
>> Reporter: EACH PERSON WAS

20:14.180 --> 20:15.548
ALLOWED JUST EIGHT MINUTES OF

20:15.548 --> 20:17.416
SHOWER TIME A WEEK.

20:17.416 --> 20:19.051
>> MISSION SUPPORT THIS IS HI-

20:19.051 --> 20:20.052
SEAS ENGINEER ZAK AND I'M

20:20.052 --> 20:21.587
REQUESTING ASSISTANCE.

20:21.587 --> 20:22.721
>> Reporter: ON THE RARE

20:22.721 --> 20:23.956
OCCASIONS WHEN THEY WENT

20:23.956 --> 20:25.391
OUTSIDE, CREW MEMBERS HAD TO

20:25.391 --> 20:26.926
FIRST REQUEST APPROVAL FROM

20:26.926 --> 20:28.027
GROUND CONTROL AND WEAR

20:28.027 --> 20:29.662
SPACESUITS WHILE EXPLORING THE

20:29.662 --> 20:32.565
VOLCANO'S MARS LIKE LANDSCAPE.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.100
MOST OF THE TIME THOUGH THEY

20:34.100 --> 20:36.168
WERE CONFINED TO THE ONE

20:36.168 --> 20:38.237
THOUSAND SQUARE FEET DOME.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.738
>> HERE YOU HAVE THE ONLY WINDOW

20:39.738 --> 20:41.373
OF THE HABITAT.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.075
>> WE'RE DOING A TYPE OF

20:43.075 --> 20:44.243
COMPOSTING THAT'S CALLED

20:44.243 --> 20:45.377
BOKASHI.

20:45.377 --> 20:46.779
>> Reporter: EACH PERSON HAD

20:46.779 --> 20:52.818
THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL PROJECT TO

20:52.818 --> 20:53.819
KEEP THEM BUSY: FROM RESEARCH ON

20:53.819 --> 21:01.393
MICROBIOLOGY AND HYDROPONICS.

21:01.393 --> 21:02.128
TO WORK ON ROBOTICS

21:02.128 --> 21:03.095
AND 3D PRINTING.

21:03.095 --> 21:04.029
AND THEN THERE WERE DAILY GROUP

ROUTINES INCLUDING EXERCISING

21:04.964 --> 21:05.898
TOGETHER.

21:05.898 --> 21:06.999
>> BESIDES DINNERS WE ALSO MAKE

21:06.999 --> 21:08.334
EXCELLENT DESSERTS.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.435
>> Reporter: COOKING TOGETHER.

21:09.435 --> 21:10.669
PERHAPS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE

21:10.669 --> 21:12.371
FOR CREW MEMBERS WASN'T BEING

21:12.371 --> 21:13.606
SEPARATED FROM THE REST OF THE

21:13.606 --> 21:15.307
WORLD, BUT THE INABILITY TO

21:15.307 --> 21:17.943
SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER.

21:17.943 --> 21:18.711
>> THERE IS REALLY NO PLACE IN

21:18.711 --> 21:19.745
THE HAB WHERE YOU CAN STAND AND

21:19.745 --> 21:21.780
NOT BE HEARD.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.617
>> ZAK, HOW'S MY COFFEE COMING?

21:24.617 --> 21:25.684
>> IT'S NOT QUITE READY YET BUT

21:25.684 --> 21:26.852
DO YOU WANT CREAM OR SUGAR?

21:26.852 --> 21:29.755
>> BOTH PLEASE.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.123
>> Reporter: YESTERDAY THE

21:34.760 --> 21:36.695
JUMP "BACK TO EARTH".

21:36.695 --> 21:38.931
AND, THEY'RE ALL STILL SMILING.

21:38.931 --> 21:41.734
>> EVEN WHEN YOU CHOOSE VERY LOW

21:41.734 --> 21:44.336
DRAMA PEOPLE AND WE'RE NOT A

21:44.336 --> 21:46.305
REALITY SHOW, WHAT WE'RE LOOKING

21:46.305 --> 21:48.507
FOR IS NOT A WAY TO ELIMINATE

21:48.507 --> 21:50.109
ALL PROBLEMS FROM HAPPENING BUT

21:50.109 --> 21:51.644
A WAY TO CHOOSE PEOPLE AND TO

21:51.644 --> 21:53.179
TRAIN PEOPLE SO THAT THEY KNOW

21:53.179 --> 21:54.213
HOW TO RESPOND TO CONFLICT AND

21:54.213 --> 21:55.648
CAN DO THAT IN A REALLY

21:55.648 --> 21:57.650
RESILIENT WAY.

21:57.650 --> 22:01.987
>> Reporter: IT WILL TAKE SOME

22:01.987 --> 22:02.922
TIME TO SYNTHESIZE ALL THE

OBSERVATIONS AND DATA COLLECTED

22:03.856 --> 22:04.890
DURING THE STUDY.

22:04.890 --> 22:05.658

22:05.658 --> 22:06.859
WILL BE STARTING SOON.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.093
IN AUGUST A NEW CREW OF SIX WILL

22:08.093 --> 22:09.728
ENTER THE DOME.

THOUGHTFULNESS.

23:15.227 --> 23:18.397
IT'S REALLY THINKING ABOUT HOW
