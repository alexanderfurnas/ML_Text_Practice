JUDY WOODRUFF: Now: a look at
how artists captured Detroit's
turbulent history in the

00:05.166 --> 00:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
civil rights era.

00:07.233 --> 00:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This week marks the 50th
anniversary of major
civil unrest in the
Motor City, and a unique

00:13.200 --> 00:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
series of exhibitions are
chronicling that moment.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown went to
Michigan to see them.

00:17.900 --> 00:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A fiery red sky,
people trapped in a burning
city, charred remains from the

00:24.900 --> 00:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1967 Detroit riots, a painting
by Yvonne Parks Catchings in an
exhibition titled Say It Loud:

00:33.166 --> 00:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Art, History, Rebellion, at
the Charles H. Wright Museum
of African-American History.

00:40.266 --> 00:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Striking images of
confrontation, and consequences,
in works by national
and local artists from

00:46.433 --> 00:48.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the 1960s on.

00:48.133 --> 00:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Curator Patrina Chatman:

00:50.600 --> 00:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRINA CHATMAN, Curator,
Charles H. Wright Museum
of African-American
History: You see

00:52.566 --> 00:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the emotions of the
artists, describing history
from their perspective.

00:55.300 --> 00:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I see the politics.

00:56.833 --> 01:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I see the social concerns
that people had in it.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I see their pain.

01:02.300 --> 01:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I see and I feel their
pain, and I think other
people will feel it as well.

01:09.366 --> 01:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: July, 1967,
five days of violence,
fear and destruction in
a major American city

01:18.266 --> 01:23.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that would leave 43 dead, some
7,200 arrested, and more than
2,000 buildings destroyed.

01:26.466 --> 01:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Fifty years later, some
of the city's leading
cultural institutions
are asking questions:

01:31.266 --> 01:33.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Was it a riot?

01:33.633 --> 01:34.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A rebellion?

01:34.800 --> 01:36.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Even a revolution?

01:36.966 --> 01:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And using art to
look back and ahead.

01:41.333 --> 01:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the Detroit Historical
Museum, which, for
the record, has been a
funder of the "NewsHour"

01:46.066 --> 01:51.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and which spearheaded
the citywide effort, old
TVs play news footage.

01:51.033 --> 01:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A replica of a National Guard
tank has been turned into an
audiovisual experience, with

01:57.166 --> 02:00.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
oral histories
told by Detroiters.

02:00.966 --> 02:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Detroit Institute of Art
weighs in with an exhibition
titled Art of Rebellion: Black

02:07.833 --> 02:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Art of the Civil Rights Movement
with works by individuals,
including leading figures

02:14.600 --> 02:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
such as Romare Bearden and
Sam Gilliam, and so-called
collectives formed in the 1960s

02:20.033 --> 02:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and after by artists seeking
a greater voice in society.

02:23.300 --> 02:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VALERIE MERCER, Curator,
Detroit Institute of Art: The
civil rights movement and the

02:30.233 --> 02:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black power movement
emboldened a lot of the
African-American artists.

02:35.833 --> 02:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Most of the mainstream
art museums didn't
provide many opportunities
to African-American

02:40.733 --> 02:43.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
artists during
the '60s and '70s.

02:43.266 --> 02:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They were also very
uncomfortable dealing
with racial, social
and political issues,

02:50.366 --> 02:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so they avoided that work.

02:52.100 --> 02:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now things are
changing, fortunately.

02:54.400 --> 02:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Several local
artists attended the opening,
including Allie McGhee, who told

03:00.900 --> 03:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me of his encounters with the
National Guard 50 years ago.

03:03.433 --> 03:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALLIE MCGHEE, Artist: I had
people drive up because I was
out past curfew, and have a

03:10.500 --> 03:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young man who's like 17 or
18 scared to death, stick
a bayonet in your ribcage.

03:15.800 --> 03:19.166 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You don't forget
stuff like this.

03:19.166 --> 03:24.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: For this
exhibition, McGhee contributed a
painting from 1968 titled Black

03:25.533 --> 03:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Attack, and a later abstract
work titled Apartheid.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Since then, his art has gone
well beyond such subjects.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It just took him a while to
get past what he'd witnessed.

03:35.533 --> 03:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALLIE MCGHEE: It
wasn't something you
could walk away from.

03:38.700 --> 03:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for me, it sort of like
was a dominant subject matter
for maybe 15 or 20 years.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You couldn't
get it out of your head
or your mind or your work?

03:49.900 --> 03:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLIE MCGHEE: No, you can't.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yes, the subtleties
of it kept recurring.

03:53.233 --> 03:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I had to work that out of
my painting experience.

03:59.266 --> 04:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not good to be angry.

04:01.833 --> 04:04.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It lowers the
intellectual level.

04:04.466 --> 04:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You don't accomplish a lot.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're blinded by it.

04:08.333 --> 04:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Rita Dickerson's
painting commemorates the terror
and killings of three black men

04:14.866 --> 04:18.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the Algiers Hotel,
one of the most harrowing
episodes of those July days.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she also adds the names
of young black men and women
killed in police shootings more

04:24.466 --> 04:25.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
recently.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dickerson grew up on
Detroit's East Side.

04:27.266 --> 04:29.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RITA DICKERSON, Artist:
We had two bakeries.

04:29.233 --> 04:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We had a hardware
store, two pharmacies.

04:32.933 --> 04:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Everything was there
within one block, and we
could walk every place.

04:39.100 --> 04:41.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And during the riot,
all that burned down.

04:41.366 --> 04:44.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And 50 years later,
it has not returned.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's still desolate.

04:45.933 --> 04:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it breaks my
heart, breaks my heart.

04:48.433 --> 04:53.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In so many
of Detroit's neighborhoods,
on so many blocks, the
abandoned homes and

04:54.566 --> 04:56.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
empty lots remain.

04:56.566 --> 04:59.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there are signs of
life in Detroit today.

04:59.833 --> 05:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The youngest artist in the
exhibition, 29-year-old
Mario Moore, is literally
a product of the

05:06.200 --> 05:07.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
museum.

05:07.200 --> 05:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His parents met here.

05:09.266 --> 05:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIO MOORE, Artist: So, it's
my grandmother holding images
of her living sons, right,

05:12.033 --> 05:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the sense of protection,
like, these are mine, you
can't have them, right?

05:16.733 --> 05:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: His
grandmother, Helen Moore,
is a longtime Detroit
activist, and the subject

05:22.466 --> 05:23.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Mario's work here.

05:23.700 --> 05:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It addresses violence
and how it's portrayed.

05:26.466 --> 05:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIO MOORE: As soon as you
turn on the news, what tends to
happen is they show the mourning

05:30.866 --> 05:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black mother, right, the mother
that's crying about the recent
death of her son, her husband,

05:35.700 --> 05:37.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her daughter.

05:37.166 --> 05:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's
the narrative, the story.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARIO MOORE: That's
the narrative you get.

05:41.433 --> 05:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel like it was something
that began out of a way to
kind of find compassion for

05:48.500 --> 05:50.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the other, right?

05:50.566 --> 05:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But once that gets used over
and over and over and over
again, it loses its value.

05:56.133 --> 05:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nobody really cares anymore.

05:57.833 --> 06:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And, for me, the women
in my family have a very
different perspective.

06:01.700 --> 06:04.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I feel like they're
very protective,
they're very powerful.

06:04.700 --> 06:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Different
perspectives on Detroit's
past and future, through
exhibitions around

06:10.566 --> 06:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the city over the coming months.

06:12.966 --> 06:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Jeffrey Brown in Detroit.
