A NEW NATIONAL ASSEMBLY THAT

00:04.704 --> 00:07.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD REWRITE ITS CONSTITUTION.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTIES THAT OPPOSE BELEAGUERED

00:08.575 --> 00:09.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO ARE

00:09.843 --> 00:11.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOYCOTTING THE VOTE, BECAUSE

00:11.244 --> 00:13.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SAY IT'S A SCHEME BY MADURO

00:13.046 --> 00:15.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO EXPAND HIS EXECUTIVE POWERS.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MADURO'S SOCIALIST PARTY HAS

00:17.183 --> 00:18.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDED OVER A SEVERE ECONOMIC

FOOD AND MEDICINE.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS, AS VENEZUELA'S MOST

00:26.326 --> 00:27.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT EXPORT, OIL

DECLINE.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR MORE ON THE CONTROVERSIAL

00:30.630 --> 00:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE, I AM JOINED VIA SKYPE BY

00:31.831 --> 00:33.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REUTERS REPORTER BRIAN ELLSWORTH

FROM THE VENEZUELAN CAPITAL OF

00:35.268 --> 00:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARACAS.

00:35.969 --> 00:38.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRIAN, WE ARE ALMOST TALKING

00:38.171 --> 00:40.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE VOTE AS A MATTER OF

00:40.206 --> 00:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE, HERE, TOMORROW.

00:42.275 --> 00:43.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW THE OUTCOME, BECAUSE THE

00:43.576 --> 00:45.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION'S NOT PUTTING UP ANY

00:45.378 --> 00:46.312 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATES.

00:46.312 --> 00:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, THAT'S RIGHT.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN EFFECT, THE VOTE WILL TAKE

00:49.215 --> 00:50.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE TOMORROW, AND THE

00:50.617 --> 00:51.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION PARTIES ARE NOT

00:51.651 --> 00:53.420 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICIPATING, WHICH MEANS THAT

00:53.420 --> 00:56.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS 545-SEAT ASSEMBLY WILL GO

00:56.423 --> 00:58.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENTIRELY TO ALLIES OF THE

00:58.124 --> 00:59.325 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOCIALIST PARTY.

00:59.325 --> 01:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE NEXT WEEK AT

01:00.860 --> 01:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME POINT, THERE WILL LIKELY BE

01:02.896 --> 01:05.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME DIVISIONS THAT WILL EMERGE,

01:05.165 --> 01:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT GROUPS SORT OF SEEKING

01:06.966 --> 01:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CONTROL LEADERSHIP OF THE

01:08.334 --> 01:09.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTITUTION.

01:09.402 --> 01:10.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT AS YOU SAY, YES, THERE IS NO

01:10.804 --> 01:12.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION PARTICIPATION, SO

01:12.172 --> 01:13.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ISN'T A LOT OF SUSPENSE AS

01:13.706 --> 01:15.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO WHO WILL WIN.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WELL, FOR PEOPLE

01:16.142 --> 01:17.143 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO DON'T FOLLOW THE INTERNAL

01:17.143 --> 01:18.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICS OF VENEZUELA, WHAT DOES

01:18.411 --> 01:19.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS-- WHAT'S THE POWER THAT

01:19.612 --> 01:20.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS NATIONAL ASSEMBLY WILL

01:20.914 --> 01:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY HAVE?

01:22.015 --> 01:24.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE CONSTITUTION HAS

01:24.017 --> 01:25.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE ARTICLE THAT GIVES VERY

01:25.552 --> 01:27.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VAGUE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THIS

01:27.187 --> 01:28.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BODY DOES.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT SAYS ALMOST NOTHING,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT IT CAN

01:31.024 --> 01:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REWRITE THE CONSTITUTION, AND IT

01:32.525 --> 01:33.927 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANNOT BE CHALLENGED OR

01:33.927 --> 01:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERRULED BY ANY OTHER

01:35.161 --> 01:36.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOVERNMENT AGENCY.

01:36.329 --> 01:37.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH MEANS THAT NEITHER THE

01:37.831 --> 01:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURTS, NOR ANY EXECUTIVE BRANCH

01:40.967 --> 01:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POWERS, OR ANYONE ELSE, CAN TELL

01:43.303 --> 01:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ASSEMBLY NOT TO DO

01:44.170 --> 01:44.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING.

01:44.537 --> 01:45.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST TIME THIS WAS DONE IN

01:45.505 --> 01:47.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1999, THERE WAS A VERY CLEAR

01:47.507 --> 01:48.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANDATE TO REWRITE THE

01:48.575 --> 01:49.843 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTION.

01:49.843 --> 01:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THE CONSTITUTION ALREADY

01:51.344 --> 01:52.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GIVES QUITE A BIT OF GENEROUS

01:52.679 --> 01:54.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXECUTIVE POWER TO THE

01:54.047 --> 01:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT, BUT THEY COULD, FOR

01:55.448 --> 01:57.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE, DISSOLVE THE

01:57.016 --> 01:58.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION-RUN CONGRESS.

01:58.818 --> 02:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY COULD FIRE THE PROSECUTOR,

02:01.421 --> 02:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CHIEF PROSECUTOR, WHO HAS

02:02.722 --> 02:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN INCREASINGLY CRITICAL OF

02:03.723 --> 02:05.024 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MADURO GOVERNMENT.

02:05.024 --> 02:07.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, IT EFFECTIVELY CREATES A

02:07.627 --> 02:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPERBODY, THAT WILL HAVE

02:10.530 --> 02:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNLIMITED POWERS, WITH VERY

02:12.532 --> 02:13.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCLEAR CONSEQUENCES AS TO WHAT

02:13.967 --> 02:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD MEAN.

02:14.667 --> 02:15.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO THIS COULD

02:15.368 --> 02:16.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY KEEP MADURO IN POWER

02:16.369 --> 02:18.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDEFINITELY, KIND OF SLIDING

02:18.805 --> 02:21.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY FROM DEMOCRACY INTO A

02:21.007 --> 02:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DICTATORSHIP.

02:21.541 --> 02:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WOULD

02:23.276 --> 02:24.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY DO.

02:24.177 --> 02:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE CURRENT ELECTORAL

02:25.812 --> 02:28.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCHEDULE HAS MADURO'S TERM

02:28.381 --> 02:30.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENDING IN EARLY 2019, AND THE

02:30.483 --> 02:32.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEXT ELECTIONS TAKING PLACE IN

02:32.018 --> 02:33.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LATE 2018.

02:33.386 --> 02:34.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THEY

02:34.287 --> 02:35.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD DO IS, NOT ONLY ALTER THE

02:35.488 --> 02:36.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME FRAME FOR WHEN THE

02:36.856 --> 02:38.358 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS WOULD HAPPEN, BUT THEY

02:38.358 --> 02:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD ALSO ALTER THE WAY THE

02:39.659 --> 02:41.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUAL VOTES ARE TAKING PLACE.

02:41.427 --> 02:42.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH, IF YOU NOTE, IN THIS

02:42.829 --> 02:44.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION, THIS IS BEING--

02:44.697 --> 02:45.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE SEATS ARE BEING

02:45.832 --> 02:47.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISTRIBUTED BY MUNICIPALITY,

02:47.467 --> 02:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH BASICALLY OVER-REPRESENTS

02:49.002 --> 02:50.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RURAL AREAS, AND IN EFFECT,

02:50.770 --> 02:52.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER-REPRESENTS THE GOVERNMENT.

02:52.372 --> 02:53.406 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH WAS THE MAIN OPPOSITION

02:53.406 --> 02:54.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARGUMENT FOR SAYING, "WE'RE NOT

02:54.474 --> 02:55.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS."

02:55.842 --> 02:57.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY COULD DO SIMILAR THINGS,

02:57.644 --> 03:00.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ORDER TO JUGGLE THE BASIC

03:00.547 --> 03:02.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTORAL FUNCTIONING, IN AN

03:02.782 --> 03:04.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE

03:04.184 --> 03:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOCIALIST PARTY BASICALLY CANNOT

03:05.952 --> 03:07.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIN AN ELECTION, DUE TO THE

03:07.453 --> 03:08.188 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTREME ECONOMIC CRISIS.

03:08.188 --> 03:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WELL, HOW DO THE

03:08.922 --> 03:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD--

03:10.056 --> 03:11.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DOES THE UNITED STATES WEIGH

03:11.124 --> 03:12.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ON THIS?

03:12.392 --> 03:13.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE UNITED STATES HAS ALREADY

03:13.226 --> 03:14.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANCTIONED-- LAST WEEK ANNOUNCED

03:14.694 --> 03:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANCTIONS AGAINST 13 HIGH-

03:16.329 --> 03:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RANKING SOCIALIST PARTY

03:17.964 --> 03:19.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICIALS.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY HAVE SAID MORE SWIFT

03:20.600 --> 03:21.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANCTIONS ARE ON THE WAY, IF

03:21.935 --> 03:23.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS VOTE GOES THROUGH.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT IMMEDIATELY EVIDENT

03:24.337 --> 03:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THOSE SANCTIONS WOULD BE,

03:25.405 --> 03:26.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT COULD INVOLVE BLOCKING

03:26.940 --> 03:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SALE OF VENEZUELAN OIL TO

03:28.741 --> 03:30.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES, OR FINANCIAL

03:30.410 --> 03:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANCTIONS THAT WOULD PREVENT

03:32.278 --> 03:33.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VENEZUELA FROM COLLECTING ON THE

03:33.780 --> 03:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OIL THAT IT SELLS.

03:34.647 --> 03:35.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: EVEN AFTER THIS

03:35.381 --> 03:37.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE TOMORROW, IS THE CONDITION

03:37.717 --> 03:39.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF LIFE LIKELY TO GET ANY BETTER

03:39.385 --> 03:40.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE PEOPLE OF VENEZUELA THAT

03:40.553 --> 03:41.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN SUFFERING OVER THE

03:41.554 --> 03:42.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST TWO MONTHS, THAT WE'VE BEEN

03:42.488 --> 03:43.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRONICLING?

03:43.523 --> 03:44.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS IS ANOTHER OF THE

03:44.958 --> 03:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENTS AGAINST

THE ASSEMBLY, IS THAT THE

03:47.860 --> 03:49.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIMARY CONCERN OF ANY

03:49.329 --> 03:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VENEZUELAN THAT YOU SPEAK TO ON

03:50.496 --> 03:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STREET TODAY IS THAT THERE

03:51.931 --> 03:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISN'T FOOD, THERE ISN'T

03:53.066 --> 03:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICINE, AND PRICES ARE

03:54.334 --> 03:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SKYROCKETING.

03:55.768 --> 03:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ASSEMBLY, AS PROPOSED, MAKES

03:58.738 --> 04:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO EVIDENT-- DOES NOTHING, IN

04:01.374 --> 04:04.410 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFECT, TO CHANGE ANY OF THAT.

04:04.410 --> 04:05.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REFORMS THAT THEY NEED TO

04:05.778 --> 04:07.080 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO, WHICH WILL BE PAINFUL TO

04:07.080 --> 04:08.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE THIS, FROM A SORT OF

04:08.481 --> 04:09.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOCIALIST, STATE-CONTROLLED

04:09.916 --> 04:11.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY INTO A MARKET ECONOMY,

04:11.985 --> 04:12.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE REPEATEDLY AVOIDED

04:12.919 --> 04:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING.

04:14.020 --> 04:15.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE IS NO SUGGESTION THAT

04:15.154 --> 04:16.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ASSEMBLY IS READY TO DO

04:16.289 --> 04:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS, AND THERE IS NOTHING,

04:17.924 --> 04:19.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PER SE, ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY THAT

04:19.359 --> 04:21.060 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD CHANGE THIS SITUATION.

04:21.060 --> 04:22.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT LIKE MONDAY, OR

04:22.729 --> 04:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:24.097 --> 04:25.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SEE FOOD ON THE SHELVES.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE

04:27.000 --> 04:28.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIMARY ARGUMENTS AGAINST IT,

04:28.668 --> 04:31.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS THINGS STAND, IT'S NOT

04:31.271 --> 04:33.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAR THAT IT IS GOING TO CHANGE

04:33.206 --> 04:33.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

04:33.873 --> 04:34.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
