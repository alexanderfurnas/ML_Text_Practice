WEBVTT

00:05.239 --> 00:05.639
GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:05.639 --> 00:08.175
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.175 --> 00:13.614
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: the election upset in
Canada, as the Liberal Party

00:13.614 --> 00:19.519
claims a stunning victory
promising higher taxes on the
wealthy to boost a sluggish
economy.

00:19.519 --> 00:23.757
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Tuesday, what prompted one
teacher to tell students they

00:23.757 --> 00:27.461
shouldn't take some
of their tests?

00:27.461 --> 00:33.734
GWEN IFILL: And rock legend
Patti Smith reveals what
inspires her, from poetry to
CSI.

00:33.734 --> 00:39.339
PATTI SMITH, Author, "M Train":
I'm interested in the mind of
the detective and his process,

00:39.339 --> 00:42.476
which to me is a lot
like the artist.

00:42.476 --> 00:45.112
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:45.112 --> 00:51.151
(BREAK)

00:51.151 --> 01:04.932
JUDY WOODRUFF: Canada's 35
million people woke today to a
new political era, ushering

01:04.932 --> 01:09.369
out almost a decade of
Conservative leadership. The
Liberal Party won an outright
majority

01:09.369 --> 01:13.307
in Parliament in
Monday's election.

01:13.307 --> 01:18.979
The results mean that
43-year-old Justin Trudeau will
be the country's new prime
minister.

01:18.979 --> 01:22.215
President Obama called Trudeau
today to congratulate him. We
will look at how the Liberals
did

01:22.215 --> 01:24.685
it after the news summary.

01:24.685 --> 01:30.123
GWEN IFILL: Here at home, the
presidential field shrank by one
today. Former Virginia

01:30.123 --> 01:35.062
Senator Jim Webb dropped out of
the Democratic contest. Webb
failed to gain traction in the

01:35.062 --> 01:39.232
polls, and now says he's not
sure he will stay a Democrat.

01:39.232 --> 01:43.837
JIM WEBB (D), Former U.S.
Senator: I fully accept that my
views on many issues are not

01:43.837 --> 01:49.476
compatible with the power
structure or the nominating base
of the Democratic Party. That

01:49.476 --> 01:54.948
party is filled with millions of
dedicated, hardworking
Americans, but its hierarchy is

01:54.948 --> 02:00.487
not comfortable with many of the
policies that I have laid forth,
and, frankly, I'm

02:00.487 --> 02:03.423
not that comfortable
with many of theirs.

02:03.423 --> 02:08.462
GWEN IFILL: Webb left the door
open for a possible run as an
independent.

02:08.462 --> 02:12.866
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republicans in
the House of Representatives
convened this evening to mull

02:12.866 --> 02:19.639
their choice for speaker. It
came amid reports that Paul Ryan
of Wisconsin is edging closer

02:19.639 --> 02:25.746
to running. He was the party's
vice presidential nominee in
2012. A conservative faction
pressured

02:25.746 --> 02:30.951
Speaker John Boehner to resign,
and then drove Kevin McCarthy
from the race to succeed him.

02:30.951 --> 02:34.755
The party caucus plans to
meet again tomorrow night.

02:34.755 --> 02:39.526
GWEN IFILL: The United States
and Russia signed an agreement
today to limit the risk of
incidents

02:39.526 --> 02:44.731
in the skies over Syria.
Warplanes from both countries
are carrying out airstrikes, and

02:44.731 --> 02:48.435
there've been reports of
several close encounters.

02:48.435 --> 02:52.472
At the Pentagon, spokesman Peter
Cook said the agreement doesn't
include sharing target

02:52.472 --> 02:56.276
information, but it does
lay out safety procedures.

02:56.276 --> 02:59.379
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: These protocols
include maintaining professional

02:59.379 --> 03:04.418
airmanship at all times, the use
of specific communication
frequencies, and the
establishment

03:04.418 --> 03:08.121
of a communication line on the
ground. The U.S. and Russia will
form a working group

03:08.121 --> 03:12.092
to discuss any implementation
issues that follow.

03:12.092 --> 03:18.398
GWEN IFILL: In Syria, Russian
airstrikes overnight killed at
least 45 people, including a
rebel

03:18.398 --> 03:24.337
commander. A monitoring group in
London says the strikes hit
coastal Latakia province,

03:24.337 --> 03:28.608
the stronghold of President
Bashar al-Assad. The monitors
also reported three Russians

03:28.608 --> 03:33.513
were killed fighting alongside
Syrian army troops. The Kremlin
denied it.

03:33.513 --> 03:38.985
JUDY WOODRUFF: The top U.S.
military officer is playing down
chances that Iraq will ask

03:38.985 --> 03:44.291
for Russian airstrikes against
Islamic State fighters. General
Joseph Dunford offered that

03:44.291 --> 03:50.497
opinion today on his first trip
to Iraq since becoming chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

03:50.497 --> 03:54.868
Dunford met first with the head
of the Kurdish regional
government in Irbil. Later, he
conferred

03:54.868 --> 03:58.405
with the Iraqi defense
minister in Baghdad.

03:58.405 --> 04:04.344
GWEN IFILL: U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon
made a surprise visit to
Jerusalem today,

04:04.344 --> 04:09.983
hoping to halt a wave of
violence. He arrived as
Palestinians clashed with
Israeli soldiers

04:09.983 --> 04:13.653
in Ramallah in the West Bank.
Elsewhere, two Palestinians were
killed following separate

04:13.653 --> 04:15.755
attacks on Israelis.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.558
That brought this
appeal from Ban:

04:18.558 --> 04:24.164
BAN KI-MOON, United Nations
Secretary-General: No society
should have to live in fear. No

04:24.164 --> 04:32.672
society can afford to see its
youth suffer in hopelessness. If
we do not act fast, the

04:32.672 --> 04:38.478
dynamics on the ground may only
get worse, with serious
repercussions in and beyond
Israel

04:38.478 --> 04:41.014
and Palestine.

04:41.014 --> 04:45.652
GWEN IFILL: Ban is slated to
meet with Palestinian President
Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime

04:45.652 --> 04:48.855
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
during his trip.

04:48.855 --> 04:53.960
JUDY WOODRUFF: For the first
time, officials in Japan have
confirmed a case of cancer that

04:53.960 --> 04:59.166
may be linked to the Fukushima
plant nuclear disaster. The
plant was heavily damaged by

04:59.166 --> 05:05.872
an earthquake and tsunami in
March 2011. The patient
announced today had installed
covers

05:05.872 --> 05:10.710
on damaged reactors there. The
man also worked at other nuclear
sites, but most of his radiation

05:10.710 --> 05:13.847
exposure came at Fukushima.

05:13.847 --> 05:19.920
GWEN IFILL: And on Wall Street,
weak earnings reports from IBM
and others kept stocks down.

05:19.920 --> 05:27.494
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 13 points to close at
17217. The Nasdaq fell 24
points,

05:27.494 --> 05:31.765
and the S&P 500
slipped about three.

05:31.765 --> 05:36.803
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a political comeback for
Canada's Liberal Party; the
number

05:36.803 --> 05:41.875
of migrants flooding into Europe
tops a half-million; North
Dakota's oil boom brings back a
lost

05:41.875 --> 05:47.480
sports tradition, and much more.

05:47.480 --> 06:02.762
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to that
stunning victory for the Liberal
Party in Canada, and an incoming

06:02.762 --> 06:07.934
prime minister with politics
in his blood, Justin Trudeau.

06:07.934 --> 06:14.874
The Liberals won a resounding
majority with 184 seats out of
338, increasing their vote

06:14.874 --> 06:21.748
share in every province since
the last election in 2011.
Conservative seats dropped below

06:21.748 --> 06:29.189
100, losing ground in every
province except Quebec, and the
New Democrats won 44 seats.

06:29.189 --> 06:34.327
Forty-three-year-old Justin
Trudeau, a teacher and the son
of the late Canadian prime
minister

06:34.327 --> 06:38.064
Pierre Trudeau, watched the
election results with his young
family.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.701
Later, he addressed his
supporters in Montreal.

06:41.701 --> 06:46.139
JUSTIN TRUDEAU, Canadian Prime
Minister-Elect: Canadians have
spoken. You want a government

06:46.139 --> 06:53.647
with a vision and an agenda for
this country that is positive
and ambitious and hopeful.

06:53.647 --> 06:58.451
Well, my friends I promise you
tonight that I will lead that
government.

06:58.451 --> 07:01.588
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

07:01.588 --> 07:09.729
JUSTIN TRUDEAU: I will make that
vision a reality. I will be that
prime minister.

07:09.729 --> 07:12.499
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

07:12.499 --> 07:17.304
JUDY WOODRUFF: Outgoing
Conservative Prime Minister
Stephen Harper conceded his loss

07:17.304 --> 07:22.709
in Calgary last night. He also
quit as leader of the
Conservative Party.

07:22.709 --> 07:26.079
For more on the Canadian vote,
I'm joined by John Northcott of
the Canadian Broadcasting

07:26.079 --> 07:27.147
Corporation.

07:27.147 --> 07:27.747
John Northcott, welcome.

07:27.747 --> 07:29.816
So, this was a surprise.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.585
JOHN NORTHCOTT, Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation: Yes,
very much so.

07:32.585 --> 07:37.824
The polls had it neck and neck
for a while, and then in the few
days before the election,

07:37.824 --> 07:41.995
there was a suggestion there
might be a minority one way or
the other, either for the
Conservatives

07:41.995 --> 07:47.000
or for the Liberals. Very few,
though, even in the hours up to
Election Day, and the results

07:47.000 --> 07:51.805
coming in last night, really
thought that Justin Trudeau
could get, if not a majority,

07:51.805 --> 07:55.508
then the majority that he got,
the resounding majority,
effectively quintupling his
results

07:55.508 --> 07:57.677
from before.

07:57.677 --> 08:01.681
No party has ever gone from what
is effectively third-party place
to a resounding majority

08:01.681 --> 08:03.283
like that in Canadian
electoral history.

08:03.283 --> 08:05.785
JUDY WOODRUFF: What happened
last night? What changed?

08:05.785 --> 08:08.254
JOHN NORTHCOTT: Well, a
number of things changed.

08:08.254 --> 08:14.561
It was the longest campaign in
modern Canadian electoral
history. It allowed the
electorate

08:14.561 --> 08:18.732
to get to know the candidates,
in the case of the incumbent
prime minister, Stephen Harper,

08:18.732 --> 08:23.570
perhaps got to know him a little
too well, to the point where
dislike became a sharpened

08:23.570 --> 08:26.840
point of hate in some cases.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.511
As for Justin Trudeau, the
public didn't know him that
well. He had been the subject of

08:31.511 --> 08:38.818
long, withering attack campaign
from the Conservatives even long
before the election was called.

08:38.818 --> 08:44.624
Effectively, what they did,
arguably, was lower expectations
to the point where he had

08:44.624 --> 08:48.161
to only exceed them. The joke is
made that he only had to show up
for the debates wearing

08:48.161 --> 08:52.599
pants and he'd make a
positive impression.

08:52.599 --> 08:57.036
He did show up. He did wear
pants. And he had very few
missteps. Many are saying that

08:57.036 --> 09:03.243
he ran a very smart campaign.
He's young. He's energetic. And
over time, over those

09:03.243 --> 09:06.946
11 weeks -- and I know that's
short by American standards, but
it's very long by Canadian

09:06.946 --> 09:09.416
standards -- the public decide
that he deserved a chance.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.118
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why was
Harper so unpopular?

09:12.118 --> 09:15.422
JOHN NORTHCOTT: Well, it was a
variety of things. He'd been in
power a long time and

09:15.422 --> 09:19.325
the sense of a familiarity
breeding contempt there.

09:19.325 --> 09:25.965
But at the same time, he had a
number of policies that, group
by group, the opposition added

09:25.965 --> 09:31.304
up against him. At various
times, he has not fared well
with veterans. He has not fared

09:31.304 --> 09:36.443
well with farmers. He has not
fared well with the elderly.
This, as you can imagine, is

09:36.443 --> 09:41.247
a core constituency for a
party on the far right.

09:41.247 --> 09:46.920
And over time, people grew sick
of him, and in the last days of
the campaign, what appeared

09:46.920 --> 09:53.226
to be a number of desperation
members -- movements, rather,
including showing up at an event
with

09:53.226 --> 09:57.230
Rob Ford, you will remember, the
disgraced former mayor of
Toronto, admitted crack user

09:57.230 --> 10:04.237
and heavy drinker, many saw that
as a final desperation move by
Harper to garner last

10:04.237 --> 10:07.740
votes. And there was blood in
the water, and people at that
point really decided that they

10:07.740 --> 10:10.276
had had enough right
across the country.

10:10.276 --> 10:14.681
JUDY WOODRUFF: I read that it
was also his positions on
climate change, on foreign
military

10:14.681 --> 10:18.918
intervention. And what is it
about this dispute about Muslim
women wearing the face veil,

10:18.918 --> 10:21.821
the niqab? What was
that all about?

10:21.821 --> 10:27.227
JOHN NORTHCOTT: Yes. That, too,
sparked a lot of concern in the
final days of the campaign.

10:27.227 --> 10:32.632
Effectively, his party has
argued that women shouldn't be
allowed to show up for the
citizenship

10:32.632 --> 10:37.770
swearing-in ceremony wearing the
niqab. Now, you have to present
yourself. You have to

10:37.770 --> 10:45.178
reveal yourself to a female
officer, and identify yourself
with proper documentation.

10:45.178 --> 10:50.183
But for the public swearing-in
ceremony, there was a raging
debate that ended up in the
courts,

10:50.183 --> 10:54.120
with the government of Stephen
Harper saying, no, these women
had to show their faces, the

10:54.120 --> 10:58.191
women saying, no, they didn't
feel comfortable showing their
faces in a public way in the

10:58.191 --> 11:01.761
ceremony. They won in court and
where actually one in particular
was sworn in and managed

11:01.761 --> 11:05.031
to vote on Election Day.

11:05.031 --> 11:10.937
That had a lot of people, some
of the hard right, they were
attracted by that position,

11:10.937 --> 11:14.040
but Harper went on to say he
might even consider bringing in
this sort of thing in the
federal

11:14.040 --> 11:20.046
civil service with public
displays of religion. And a lot
of people had thought of, say,
for

11:20.046 --> 11:22.815
example, the Jewish skullcap,
the Sikh turban, and they
started thinking, you know what?

11:22.815 --> 11:25.051
This is going too far.

11:25.051 --> 11:30.356
And it became a battle in the
last few days over values,
Canadian values, what do we hold

11:30.356 --> 11:33.393
dear, the ability to come to
this country, to immigrate to
this country and to be free

11:33.393 --> 11:35.194
to be yourself.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.298
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me just
quickly ask you in the end, what
do people expect Trudeau

11:38.298 --> 11:41.968
to do differently? What is he
saying he's going to change?

11:41.968 --> 11:43.903
JOHN NORTHCOTT: Well, the
Liberals have a long tradition
of running from the left and

11:43.903 --> 11:46.306
governing from the right.

11:46.306 --> 11:50.710
So, you are not going to see a
niqab debate. That's for sure.
You're going to see some

11:50.710 --> 11:56.115
spending on infrastructure. Many
parts of Canada, major cities,
need things like increased

11:56.115 --> 11:58.484
transit and better roads, so
you're going to see some
spending and some job creation

11:58.484 --> 12:01.387
there as well.

12:01.387 --> 12:06.726
But as far as the business
community, as far as dealing
with our largest trading partner

12:06.726 --> 12:11.064
across the border in the United
States, you are going to see
someone who is pro-trade,

12:11.064 --> 12:15.768
someone who is pro-pipeline in
terms of the controversial
Keystone XL pipeline moving

12:15.768 --> 12:19.138
through the United States and
going into the Gulf of Mexico.
And you are going to see someone

12:19.138 --> 12:23.710
who wants to do business with
the world, despite being called
-- quote, unquote -- as "a
liberal."

12:23.710 --> 12:27.113
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Northcott of
the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation, getting used to

12:27.113 --> 12:37.223
a new prime minister,
we thank you.

12:37.223 --> 12:46.132
GWEN IFILL: There was little
relief today from the wave of
migrants pouring into Eastern

12:46.132 --> 12:48.801
Europe. As officials on the
ground struggled to cope,
governments ratcheted up their
war

12:48.801 --> 12:50.670
of words.

12:50.670 --> 12:54.207
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Malcolm Brabant reports.

12:54.207 --> 12:59.145
MALCOLM BRABANT: All day, they
kept coming in the thousands, as
Slovenian police on horseback

12:59.145 --> 13:03.516
tried to herd them to
packed reception centers.

13:03.516 --> 13:08.821
Slovenia says nearly 20,000
migrants have entered the
country from Croatia since
Friday.

13:08.821 --> 13:13.259
And, today, Parliament
considered sending additional
troops to help prevent illegal

13:13.259 --> 13:17.363
crossings. Officials talked of
more drastic action as well.

13:17.363 --> 13:22.135
BOSTJAN SEFIC, State Secretary,
Slovenian Interior Ministry
(through translator): I

13:22.135 --> 13:26.539
don't know what the future will
bring. And you know that
Slovenia had a restrained
attitude

13:26.539 --> 13:30.543
so far. But we cannot rule out
the possibility of using
physical barriers to secure
border

13:30.543 --> 13:32.445
crossings.

13:32.445 --> 13:37.183
MALCOLM BRABANT: In addition,
Slovenia's president traveled to
Brussels, asking the European

13:37.183 --> 13:42.255
Union to help police the
frontier. The new influx began
when Hungary closed the last

13:42.255 --> 13:46.259
of its southern border
posts in recent days.

13:46.259 --> 13:51.798
That forced refugees reaching
Croatia, to take the new route
toward Slovenia. The Slovenians

13:51.798 --> 13:57.837
complained again today that
Croatia is dumping throngs of
people on its border without
control.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.974
But Croatia said, in turn, that
thousands are stranded in
mud-caked fields along its

14:01.974 --> 14:05.278
southern border with Serbia.

14:05.278 --> 14:08.681
The Croatian interior minister
said Slovenia must take at least
half of those arriving

14:08.681 --> 14:11.384
in order to keep
the line moving.

14:11.384 --> 14:19.125
MAN: What we are expecting here
now is that they're able to
handle the 5,000 people. If

14:19.125 --> 14:24.330
we are receiving 10,000, then
5,000 people have to be
transited to Slovenia.

14:24.330 --> 14:28.568
MALCOLM BRABANT: All of this as
arrivals at the southern end of
the refugee route have

14:28.568 --> 14:34.407
reached new records. Some 8,000
crossed from the Eastern Aegean
Sea from Turkey to Greece

14:34.407 --> 14:40.046
yesterday alone. The voyage to
islands like Lesbos is far
shorter and relatively safer

14:40.046 --> 14:43.149
during the summer an the
crossing from North Africa to
Italy, but it is still a
perilous

14:43.149 --> 14:45.184
undertaking.

14:45.184 --> 14:50.623
It's estimated that more than
3,000 people have drowned so far
this year. And the U.N.

14:50.623 --> 14:54.460
refugee office in Greece
fears more will die.

14:54.460 --> 14:58.297
RON REDMOND, UNHCR: Well, as
winter approaches, people are
desperate and they're still
going

14:58.297 --> 15:03.503
to keep trying. They might wait
for a calm day. But if it's not,
the smugglers give them

15:03.503 --> 15:08.708
a discount. And they will -- as
much as, say, 40 or 50 percent,
if they will take a boat

15:08.708 --> 15:11.577
in stormy weather. And
some people do it.

15:11.577 --> 15:15.681
MALCOLM BRABANT: It's been one
of those days that has really
emphasized the fickle nature

15:15.681 --> 15:21.654
of the Aegean Sea. A boat full
of refugees landed in Lesbos
today and the people on board

15:21.654 --> 15:27.059
told volunteers that the boat
directly behind them had
disappeared. Their story has
been

15:27.059 --> 15:30.363
confirmed by Greek coast guard
tonight, who said there have
been drownings inside Turkish

15:30.363 --> 15:32.498
waters.

15:32.498 --> 15:37.303
But, tonight, the Coast Guard
off the island of Lesbos have
been in action. They have
rescued

15:37.303 --> 15:41.974
60 people. The sea was flat
calm, yet all of these people
were in danger of drowning.

15:41.974 --> 15:45.978
The weather is about to change,
which creates a real dilemma for
those people in Turkey

15:45.978 --> 15:54.353
who want to rush to Europe
before more borders close.

15:54.353 --> 15:58.858
Those who do make it across the
Aegean may face an increasingly
hostile reception. Last

15:58.858 --> 16:04.564
night, 15,000 to 20,000
anti-immigration protesters
gathered in Dresden, Germany,
which, up to

16:04.564 --> 16:09.068
now, has been one of the most
receptive countries to migrants.

16:09.068 --> 16:14.540
And in Sweden, where more than
150,000 refugees are expected to
arrive this year, a fourth

16:14.540 --> 16:19.378
building housing asylum seekers
was torched overnight in a
suspected arson attack.

16:19.378 --> 16:34.827
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Athens.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.296
Stay with us.

16:37.296 --> 16:42.668
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
teacher's stance against
standardized testing; an oil
boom

16:42.668 --> 16:47.440
becomes a boon for high school
football; and a professor's take
on why talented girls still

16:47.440 --> 16:50.142
aren't becoming scientists.

16:50.142 --> 16:54.747
GWEN IFILL: But, first, we will
turn to a pair of health stories
getting a lot of attention

16:54.747 --> 16:59.285
today. In a moment, we explore
why one of the most important
voices in cancer research,

16:59.285 --> 17:03.389
the American Cancer Society, is
changing its guidelines for
mammograms.

17:03.389 --> 17:09.662
But, first, we turn to a
landmark study that could change
the way schizophrenia is
treated.

17:09.662 --> 17:14.901
More than two million Americans
have this chronic and sometimes
severe brain disorder.

17:14.901 --> 17:19.739
Symptoms can include
hallucinations, delusions and
hearing voices, and problems
with memory,

17:19.739 --> 17:22.508
fatigue and depression.

17:22.508 --> 17:27.513
For years, this has been treated
with high level -- high levels
of potent antipsychotic

17:27.513 --> 17:30.316
drugs. But a new study finds
lower doses, combined with
therapy and support, can be

17:30.316 --> 17:32.852
more effective.

17:32.852 --> 17:36.088
Dr. Robert Heinssen is with the
National Institute of Mental
Health, which funded the
six-year

17:36.088 --> 17:36.522
study.

17:36.522 --> 17:37.990
Welcome.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.159
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN, National
Institute of Mental Health: Good
evening.

17:40.159 --> 17:43.162
GWEN IFILL: First, define for
people what schizophrenia
actually is. People know what

17:43.162 --> 17:45.998
they know from TV and movies.

17:45.998 --> 17:50.403
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN: So,
schizophrenia is a condition
that affects the way the person

17:50.403 --> 17:56.575
interacts with the world. They
can experience an altered sense
of perception. Their thinking

17:56.575 --> 18:02.548
can be impaired. It also affects
the kind of emotional
experiences they have.

18:02.548 --> 18:09.021
So, people may withdraw from
those around them. They may lose
opportunities to pursue

18:09.021 --> 18:14.994
their education or to get a job.
So, it's -- it affects the
quality of their thinking,

18:14.994 --> 18:18.497
the quality of their emotional
life, and their relationships in
general.

18:18.497 --> 18:21.400
GWEN IFILL: And how has it
been treated typically?

18:21.400 --> 18:26.472
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN: Well, in
the United States, we have
tended to have a treatment
system

18:26.472 --> 18:32.445
that focuses on the latter
stages of the disorder. So,
sometimes, people are ill for
several

18:32.445 --> 18:37.616
years before they come to the
attention of the health care
system. And once they do come

18:37.616 --> 18:42.755
into the health care system, the
focus is on managing the
psychotic symptoms that are

18:42.755 --> 18:45.891
distressing to the individual,
their family, and are often the
calls of drawing negative

18:45.891 --> 18:48.761
attention to the person.

18:48.761 --> 18:55.101
GWEN IFILL: So, a big part of
this finding is that early
treatment is necessary, I
assume,

18:55.101 --> 18:58.404
since you're saying that so much
of this is diagnosed late, but
also talk therapy instead

18:58.404 --> 19:01.207
of drug therapy. Explain
the difference.

19:01.207 --> 19:06.946
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN: So, what we
know about the needs of people
with schizophrenia are

19:06.946 --> 19:11.951
that there are multiple areas of
impairment, their psychotic
symptoms, their social
functioning.

19:11.951 --> 19:18.491
There's cognition in terms of
thinking and memory and so
forth. And there's also
functional

19:18.491 --> 19:25.464
capability, school and work.
Medications do a very, very good
job with psychotic symptoms.

19:25.464 --> 19:28.467
They can give people relief from
the psychotic symptoms, but they
don't necessarily touch

19:28.467 --> 19:31.437
the other areas of impairment.

19:31.437 --> 19:36.876
For that, we need therapies that
can engage the person's
interests, their motivation,

19:36.876 --> 19:42.515
their curiosity, give them a
pathway to recovery, and then
support them in that process,
where

19:42.515 --> 19:48.320
they can learn and be
reinforced, acquire more
adaptive stances.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.756
GWEN IFILL: It sounds like the
support is more than just
treatment. It's also family

19:50.756 --> 19:54.493
support and support in
the workplace as well.

19:54.493 --> 19:59.865
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN: So, the
experience of psychosis is very
traumatic for the family.

19:59.865 --> 20:04.336
Very often, the people closest
to the individual with
schizophrenia are at a loss.
What is

20:04.336 --> 20:07.573
going on? How can we help?

20:07.573 --> 20:13.012
So this treatment takes that
into account, emphasizes
education for family members,
support

20:13.012 --> 20:17.850
for family members, and really
engaging them as active partners
in helping the person recover.

20:17.850 --> 20:21.587
GWEN IFILL: Two of the things
that leap to mind as you think
about schizophrenia, or

20:21.587 --> 20:26.392
any disease like this, is the
side effects of drug therapy and
whether that also caused

20:26.392 --> 20:30.229
you to search for an
alternative, and also the cost
of drug therapy, or of talk
therapy,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.565
which is more expensive.

20:32.565 --> 20:37.269
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN: So, in
terms of the side effects, you
know, we know that people in

20:37.269 --> 20:42.341
the early stages of psychosis
are very responsive to
antipsychotic medications.

20:42.341 --> 20:47.480
They actually get a much more
robust response than people who
have been ill for years. But

20:47.480 --> 20:53.819
they're also more vulnerable to
side effects. So it's a very --
it's a balancing act to

20:53.819 --> 20:59.558
find a therapeutic window where
you're getting good benefit, but
minimizing the side effects,

20:59.558 --> 21:04.196
because some of the side effects
include things like weight gain
that actually then put the

21:04.196 --> 21:09.902
person at risk for medical
conditions like diabetes, heart
disease, and so forth.

21:09.902 --> 21:16.408
So, in this treatment, there's
very, very careful attention to
the dose of the medications,

21:16.408 --> 21:21.180
how the person is experiencing
that dose in terms of relief,
what kinds of side effects

21:21.180 --> 21:26.619
they may be developing, and then
a careful integration of medical
and psychiatric care

21:26.619 --> 21:31.323
to make sure that we're not
compounding the problems of
psychosis with medical problems

21:31.323 --> 21:32.525
that have their own burden.

21:32.525 --> 21:34.894
GWEN IFILL: And as
far as expense?

21:34.894 --> 21:39.165
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN: Well, you
know, there will be a
cost-effectiveness analysis that

21:39.165 --> 21:42.868
will follow the study
that was reported today.

21:42.868 --> 21:49.041
But our initial sense of this
is, is that, yes, there are more
up-front costs in terms

21:49.041 --> 21:54.446
of outpatient treatment, the
individual therapy, the family
treatment, the supported
employment

21:54.446 --> 22:00.986
and education, which is key to
getting the person back on the
path to meaningful work.

22:00.986 --> 22:09.161
But we really think that these
up-front costs will be offset,
both by reduced reliance on

22:09.161 --> 22:15.534
emergency and crisis care,
in-patient hospitalizations and
emergency room visits, but also,
because

22:15.534 --> 22:21.807
people have a much greater
opportunity to become employed,
become citizens who are fully

22:21.807 --> 22:28.981
engaged in the work force,
making contributions, that those
factors will be included in the

22:28.981 --> 22:33.485
cost-effectiveness and probably
will show us that, in the long
run, this is well worth

22:33.485 --> 22:36.355
the investment, the investment
in these young people's future.

22:36.355 --> 22:39.525
GWEN IFILL: So there's a payback
in other ways, is what you're
saying?

22:39.525 --> 22:42.061
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN: Well, I
think there's a payback to our
society, that we get fully

22:42.061 --> 22:44.196
functioning citizens
who are -- yes.

22:44.196 --> 22:45.598
(LAUGHTER)

22:45.598 --> 22:48.567
GWEN IFILL: Who are
fully functioning.

22:48.567 --> 22:51.136
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN: Who are
fully functioning and fully
contributing, which is what they

22:51.136 --> 22:53.105
want, as a society,
what we should want.

22:53.105 --> 22:54.807
GWEN IFILL: Right.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.508
Dr. Robert Heinssen of the
National Institute of Mental
Health, thank you very much.

22:56.508 --> 22:58.477
DR. ROBERT HEINSSEN: Thank you.

22:58.477 --> 23:03.148
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to the
details of the breast cancer
news.

23:03.148 --> 23:09.121
The American Cancer Society's
revised mammogram guidelines
recommend that women with an
average

23:09.121 --> 23:15.761
risk of cancer start annual
screenings at age 45. That's
five years later than the
society's

23:15.761 --> 23:21.667
prior guidelines that
recommended starting at age 40.
There have been years of debate

23:21.667 --> 23:26.472
and numerous studies questioning
the value of these screenings
and the age at which they

23:26.472 --> 23:31.677
should begin, often forcing
women to weigh the risk of false
diagnoses and overtreatment

23:31.677 --> 23:36.181
vs. early treatment that
can save a woman's life.

23:36.181 --> 23:40.786
Here to explain the new
guidelines, and the shift in
thinking they represent, is Dr.
Richard

23:40.786 --> 23:45.157
Wender. He's the chief cancer
control officer with the
American Cancer Society.

23:45.157 --> 23:48.627
Dr. Wender, thank you
for being with us.

23:48.627 --> 23:56.935
Why is 45 now the magic number,
not 40, not 50, which some
organizations still recommend?

23:56.935 --> 24:01.006
DR. RICHARD WENDER, American
Cancer Society: Well, there
actually is no magic number.

24:01.006 --> 24:07.079
What our guideline group found
is that the risk of breast
cancer increases as a woman

24:07.079 --> 24:11.717
ages. And that's really what
determines the balance of
benefits and harm. So, we
actually

24:11.717 --> 24:18.324
recommend that all women start
the discussion about mammography
at 40, and we absolutely

24:18.324 --> 24:22.995
endorse women having the choice
to begin screening at age 40.

24:22.995 --> 24:29.702
But we state that, by age 45,
the benefits substantially
outweigh the harms for the
entire

24:29.702 --> 24:35.341
population. And that's the age
where all women should be
starting regular annual
mammography,

24:35.341 --> 24:38.143
assuming they have not
started before age 45.

24:38.143 --> 24:43.582
JUDY WOODRUFF: So what is the
new information that has come
in, in the last six years, since

24:43.582 --> 24:48.987
the American Cancer Society said
it was most comfortable telling
women to start at age

24:48.987 --> 24:53.092
40? What makes you now
comfortable to say that it's 45?

24:53.092 --> 24:56.829
DR. RICHARD WENDER: Well,
actually, our last full
guideline for average risk was
written

24:56.829 --> 24:59.865
way back in 2003.

24:59.865 --> 25:07.039
So, back then, there was no
expectation that guideline
groups would balance the
benefits

25:07.039 --> 25:11.677
and the drawbacks of screening.
That now is a standard. We also
have some new data about

25:11.677 --> 25:15.848
the interval for screening
before menopause and after
menopause.

25:15.848 --> 25:21.854
And there are also some new
observational trials that
actually tell us just how
valuable

25:21.854 --> 25:28.227
mammography is. The goal of this
new guideline is to highlight
the populations who are at

25:28.227 --> 25:34.032
-- most likely to benefit, most
likely to have the greatest
benefit, but, at the same

25:34.032 --> 25:40.339
time, giving women a choice to
begin screening earlier and to
continue screening more
regularly

25:40.339 --> 25:45.411
beyond menopause based on her
personal values and her
preferences.

25:45.411 --> 25:49.848
But it's important to understand
that the risk of developing
breast cancer at age 40

25:49.848 --> 25:54.653
is actually still quite small,
and that's why there's a greater
likelihood that a woman

25:54.653 --> 26:00.092
will experience a false positive
and a lower likelihood that she
will get actual benefit.

26:00.092 --> 26:05.130
But many women place great value
on the opportunity to prevent a
breast cancer death. And we
expect

26:05.130 --> 26:10.769
many women will want to continue
starting at 40. But our message
is very clear, that

26:10.769 --> 26:17.476
if you haven't already started,
please start regular mammography
at 45, because this guideline

26:17.476 --> 26:21.647
really proves that the most
effective thing that a woman can
do to reduce her chances

26:21.647 --> 26:24.850
of dying of breast cancer are
to have regular mammograms.

26:24.850 --> 26:30.022
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
it is a striking shift in the
eyes of those who read what the

26:30.022 --> 26:33.892
American Cancer Society was
saying some years ago.

26:33.892 --> 26:39.965
We found an opinion column that
Dr. Otis Brawley, who was the
chief medical officer for the

26:39.965 --> 26:45.971
Cancer Society -- he wrote this
in 2009. He said, not only
should women start having
mammograms,

26:45.971 --> 26:51.076
most women, at age 40. He said
not doing so could be fatal, he
said, for many women. He

26:51.076 --> 26:56.014
said turning the clock back will
add up to too many lives lost.

26:56.014 --> 27:01.453
DR. RICHARD WENDER: Well, the --
I think you said it well. This
will be seen as a dramatic

27:01.453 --> 27:03.822
shift.

27:03.822 --> 27:09.294
I think it's actually a nuanced
shift. This new guideline is
more personalized, it's more

27:09.294 --> 27:15.234
tailored. It helps women really
have a road map to follow
throughout her life in making

27:15.234 --> 27:20.672
screening decisions, helps her
understand that, when you hit
40, the likelihood of benefit

27:20.672 --> 27:25.177
is lower and it gradually keeps
going up because your risk of
breast cancer goes up and makes

27:25.177 --> 27:29.181
that clear statement at 45.

27:29.181 --> 27:35.420
We looked at this issue of 50,
and found that, actually, the
balance of benefits and harms

27:35.420 --> 27:42.694
of screening for women 45 to 49
is actually quite similar for
women 50 to 54. And we felt

27:42.694 --> 27:49.268
it was important that we give a
clear message that all women
should start by age 45.

27:49.268 --> 27:54.339
So, our last guideline was in
2003. The whole approach to
thinking about screening has
changed.

27:54.339 --> 28:00.412
There is a higher expectation
that women be informed, be
empowered to take into account

28:00.412 --> 28:04.216
their own personal values. And I
think this guideline does just
that.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.719
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Wender, what
do you say to women, though, who
may still be confused,

28:07.719 --> 28:11.657
because, as you know, there are
other respected groups out there
recommending different times?

28:11.657 --> 28:15.727
How do women make sense of all
this? What should they do?

28:15.727 --> 28:23.035
DR. RICHARD WENDER: Well, our
old guideline, annual screening
starting at 40, sounded very

28:23.035 --> 28:27.205
simple, but it wasn't
eliminating the confusion,
because it was forcing women and
clinicians

28:27.205 --> 28:28.874
to just make a choice, am I
going to follow this guideline
or am I going to follow the

28:28.874 --> 28:31.476
other guideline?

28:31.476 --> 28:37.182
This guideline actually takes a
person through her lifespan and
helps her get the information

28:37.182 --> 28:44.022
she needs to make a decision at
each point along that journey.
So, I think, although

28:44.022 --> 28:48.961
it is more complicated, it
actually will create greater
clarity.

28:48.961 --> 28:54.166
But it does mean three things. A
woman is going to have to work
hard to gather greater

28:54.166 --> 28:59.504
information to be more informed.
Two, it creates an obligation
for clinicians to really help

28:59.504 --> 29:04.476
women get this information and
help them conduct a shared
decision with their patients.
And,

29:04.476 --> 29:09.881
three, it creates an obligation
for organizations like the
American Cancer Society to make
sure

29:09.881 --> 29:14.386
that we have the information
available for clinicians, for
patients, and that we produce

29:14.386 --> 29:18.123
decision aids that can help
really people make this
decision.

29:18.123 --> 29:21.727
So, it is -- it's more nuanced,
personalized, a bit more
complicated, but we actually
think

29:21.727 --> 29:25.130
it's going to create greater
clarity, not greater confusion.

29:25.130 --> 29:33.138
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Dr. Richard
Wender with the American Cancer
Society, thank you.

29:33.138 --> 29:45.817
GWEN IFILL: Not long ago, I
traveled to Seattle to talk with
Bill and Melinda gates, the
Microsoft

29:45.817 --> 29:49.888
billionaires who have become
leading philanthropists for a
school reform movement that
champions

29:49.888 --> 29:53.525
testing for students
and teachers.

29:53.525 --> 29:58.530
But not everyone agrees with
that approach, not even in the
Gates Foundation's home town.

29:58.530 --> 30:02.668
While in Seattle, I talked with
one of the teachers leading the
opposition.

30:02.668 --> 30:06.972
The report is part of our
American Graduate series, a
public media initiative funded
by

30:06.972 --> 30:09.541
the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting.

30:09.541 --> 30:13.812
JESSE HAGOPIAN, Teacher,
Garfield High School: Think
about how this history relates
to your

30:13.812 --> 30:16.181
life, and we will come back to
the classroom and have a
discussion.

30:16.181 --> 30:18.483
GWEN IFILL: Jesse Hagopian
is a teacher on a mission.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.253
JESSE HAGOPIAN: You can
go at your own pace.

30:21.253 --> 30:25.991
GWEN IFILL: He wants his
Garfield High School students to
know their history, that Jimi

30:25.991 --> 30:31.363
Hendrix and Quincy Jones ones
walked these halls before the
students were even born.

30:31.363 --> 30:33.765
JESSE HAGOPIAN: Take a second
to read some of the history.

30:33.765 --> 30:38.870
GWEN IFILL: And he wants them to
know their choices, among them,
the right to opt out

30:38.870 --> 30:44.309
of the standardized tests
Washington State schools use to
gauge student performance.

30:44.309 --> 30:50.549
JESSE HAGOPIAN: Studies have
shown that kids will take some
113 standardized tests now

30:50.549 --> 30:58.223
in their K-12 career. It's just
become completely over the top.
It's become a
multibillion-dollar

30:58.223 --> 31:03.528
industry to sell exams to
children in order to rank and
sort them. And it's become
really

31:03.528 --> 31:06.431
a test-and-punish model.

31:06.431 --> 31:13.071
GWEN IFILL: The tests are part
of the Common Core standards
adopted by 24 states and the

31:13.071 --> 31:18.610
District of Columbia to improve
student achievement and teacher
performance. The program has
become

31:18.610 --> 31:21.680
a flash point for advocates on
both ends of the political
spectrum.

31:21.680 --> 31:25.984
JESSE HAGOPIAN: So who has
the most rushing yards?

31:25.984 --> 31:30.255
GWEN IFILL: Thirty-six-year-old
Hagopian, a married father of
two who cut his teeth

31:30.255 --> 31:35.494
as a Teach for America
instructor in Washington, D.C.,
returned to his alma mater in
2010 to

31:35.494 --> 31:37.729
teach history.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.399
JESSE HAGOPIAN: Today is going
to be all about trying to
connect your life to history.
What

31:41.399 --> 31:44.035
does history have to do with me?

31:44.035 --> 31:48.073
GWEN IFILL: By 2013, he was
leading a boycott of one of the
major tests mandated by the

31:48.073 --> 31:50.375
Seattle Public Schools.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.145
JESSE HAGOPIAN: I want you to
look at it through a whole
different lens.

31:53.145 --> 31:57.215
GWEN IFILL: The school
superintendent still supports
the tests, but they're not
required

31:57.215 --> 32:04.523
to graduate. And last month,
Seattle schoolteachers took that
protest a step further, walking

32:04.523 --> 32:09.060
off their jobs for the
first time in 30 years.

32:09.060 --> 32:13.198
The fight against what he calls
excessive testing pits Hagopian
against not only the

32:13.198 --> 32:15.801
U.S. Department of Education...

32:15.801 --> 32:17.936
JESSE HAGOPIAN: So, are you
going to speak some Spanish
today?

32:17.936 --> 32:21.306
GWEN IFILL: ... but also against
deep-pocketed school reformers
who push for the tests to

32:21.306 --> 32:23.809
measure progress.

32:23.809 --> 32:31.316
JESSE HAGOPIAN: Yes. The
corporate education reformers,
they have one view of
assessment,

32:31.316 --> 32:36.454
and that view of assessment is
informed by this: If you see a
kid with hypothermia, and

32:36.454 --> 32:42.327
he's shaking uncontrollably,
what you need to do is go take
his temperature. And then,

32:42.327 --> 32:44.563
once you have taken his
temperature, you take his
temperature again, and then you
take it

32:44.563 --> 32:48.233
again and again.

32:48.233 --> 32:53.238
And then the really
sophisticated thought is that
you actually should then use a
digital

32:53.238 --> 33:00.178
thermometer if you're in the
21st century. Our philosophy of
assessment is a lot different.

33:00.178 --> 33:06.218
If you see a kid shaking
uncontrollably because they're
cold, you wrap them in a
blanket.

33:06.218 --> 33:11.556
And you nurture them and you
give them the resources that
they would need to recover.

33:11.556 --> 33:16.027
GWEN IFILL: Garfield High School
is not new to social protest.
Stokely Carmichael and

33:16.027 --> 33:21.299
Martin Luther King Jr. both drew
thousands when they spoke here.
Decades later, Senator

33:21.299 --> 33:25.437
Barack Obama paid a visit as
well. And when it comes to
Common Core testing, both
teachers

33:25.437 --> 33:29.541
and students have
joined the boycott.

33:29.541 --> 33:33.812
Senior Shedrick Johnson has ever
intention of heading off to
college next year without

33:33.812 --> 33:38.216
taking the Measures of Academic
Progress test, known as MAP.

33:38.216 --> 33:42.254
SHEDRICK JOHNSON, Student: I
think it's a waste of time. We
already have the SATs, the

33:42.254 --> 33:46.057
ACTs. We have to have a certain
grade-point average to even get
into college, and we don't

33:46.057 --> 33:48.927
need another hindrance
in front of us.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.962
GWEN IFILL: Did your mother
think, wait a second, they said
you had to take a test,

33:50.962 --> 33:52.764
you have to take a test?

33:52.764 --> 33:57.369
SHEDRICK JOHNSON: She sure did.
She sure did. I had to really
explain it to her and explain

33:57.369 --> 34:01.339
that it's not a graduation
requirement. And when I broke
down the process to her, she

34:01.339 --> 34:04.910
said, OK, that's fine. Just let
me sign the slip and then you go
on back to class.

34:04.910 --> 34:08.046
GWEN IFILL: There are strange
bedfellows in this fight.

34:08.046 --> 34:11.816
JESSE HAGOPIAN: Sometimes, I get
accused of not liking tests,
but, in fact, I really find

34:11.816 --> 34:14.352
authentic assessment important.

34:14.352 --> 34:18.924
GWEN IFILL: Many conservatives,
including most Republican
presidential candidates, condemn

34:18.924 --> 34:23.662
the Common Core standards as
government overreach, while
liberals like Hagopian say they
promote

34:23.662 --> 34:25.730
inequality.

34:25.730 --> 34:31.636
JESSE HAGOPIAN: I think that we
are in the midst of the largest
uprising against high-stakes

34:31.636 --> 34:37.409
testing in U.S. history. Never
before have there been more
parents, students, and teachers

34:37.409 --> 34:42.747
resisting these exams and the
standards that they come
shrink-wrapped with, and it's
been

34:42.747 --> 34:45.684
breathtaking to watch.

34:45.684 --> 34:50.422
In New York State, there were
200,000 families alone that
opted their kids out of the
test.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.124
Have a good afternoon, you guys.

34:53.124 --> 35:00.332
Right here in Washington, we had
approaching 60,000 families opt
their kids out of the

35:00.332 --> 35:06.905
Common Core test this past year,
including over half of all
juniors in the state, an

35:06.905 --> 35:12.377
incredible uprising of parents
that want a much bigger vision
for the purpose of education

35:12.377 --> 35:15.180
and for understanding
what their kids know.

35:15.180 --> 35:18.316
Both brothers became active
in the black student union.

35:18.316 --> 35:23.388
GWEN IFILL: The protest is
catching on, at least in
Seattle. Last year, fewer than
60

35:23.388 --> 35:28.059
of the 3,000 10th graders who
sat for the test opted out. This
year, the number shot

35:28.059 --> 35:32.497
up to 500, including half
the students at Garfield.

35:32.497 --> 35:36.735
JUDY WOODRUFF: And an editor's
note about a story that aired on
the "NewsHour" last

35:36.735 --> 35:41.640
week from longtime education
reporter John Merrow.

35:41.640 --> 35:48.480
The story focused on school
policies for suspending very
young children. Eva Moskowitz,
CEO of

35:48.480 --> 35:54.419
the New York City-based charter
school Success Academy, has
since raised questions or
concerns

35:54.419 --> 35:59.724
that, during her interview, she
was asked questions only about
suspension policy in

35:59.724 --> 36:04.596
general, and not given an
opportunity to respond to a
family also interviewed in the
report.

36:04.596 --> 36:09.300
While the "NewsHour" stands by
the report, we regret that
decision.

36:09.300 --> 36:19.310
You can read Ms. Moskowitz's
response to the report and more
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

36:19.310 --> 36:29.154
JUDY WOODRUFF: High school
football is the center of life
for many small towns in rural

36:29.154 --> 36:31.256
America.

36:31.256 --> 36:35.960
Due to the oil and gas boom in
Western North Dakota, one town
is celebrating the return

36:35.960 --> 36:39.631
of that tradition for the first
time in over a quarter-century.

36:39.631 --> 36:45.070
Emily Guerin of Inside Energy, a
public media reporting project,
brings us the story from

36:45.070 --> 36:49.374
Alexander, North Dakota.

36:49.374 --> 36:54.746
EMILY GUERIN: It's the day
before the first game of the
season for the Alexander Comets.

36:54.746 --> 36:57.816
The players are really excited.

36:57.816 --> 37:00.085
JAYY MORGAN, Student: I can't
wait for tomorrow to come. My
head's going to explode right

37:00.085 --> 37:03.488
now if tomorrow doesn't
hurry up and get here.

37:03.488 --> 37:08.793
EMILY GUERIN: For 28 years,
Alexander didn't have a football
team. Now it does, thanks

37:08.793 --> 37:13.498
to new kids like Jayy
Morgan, number 34.

37:13.498 --> 37:15.633
Last year, Morgan's mom moved
from Bakersfield, California, to
North Dakota. She came for

37:15.633 --> 37:21.406
a job at a truck stop in
the Bakken oil field.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.607
KEVIN CLAUSEN, Football Coach,
Alexander Comets: Let's go from
the 30 all the way down. Now

37:22.607 --> 37:25.276
we can at least see
where we're at here.

37:25.276 --> 37:28.446
EMILY GUERIN: Football coach
Kevin Clausen says about half of
the kids on the team are

37:28.446 --> 37:31.116
here because of the oil fields.

37:31.116 --> 37:35.653
KEVIN CLAUSEN: But I feel like,
because of the oil boom, we now
have a football team.

37:35.653 --> 37:39.924
You know, it brought many
families to this school, which
increased the enrollment, and,

37:39.924 --> 37:44.762
you know, gave the school the
capability to actually do this.

37:44.762 --> 37:50.668
EMILY GUERIN: Before the oil
boom took off in 2008,
Alexander's single K-12 school
only

37:50.668 --> 37:59.010
had 55 kids, and there were no
varsity sports. Like so many
small towns on the Great Plains,

37:59.010 --> 38:03.381
Alexander was shrinking, as
young people moved away and
farms grew larger and more
mechanized.

38:03.381 --> 38:04.582
LESLIE BIEBER, Superintendent,
Alexander Public Schools: Well,
now, Brian, do you identify

38:04.582 --> 38:07.185
which muscle you injured?

38:07.185 --> 38:11.256
EMILY GUERIN: Superintendent
Leslie Bieber remembers what
that felt like.

38:11.256 --> 38:15.193
LESLIE BIEBER: I don't want to
say that it was bad. It wasn't,
because you still had

38:15.193 --> 38:21.633
that small community coming
together, and helping each other
out. But it was sad to

38:21.633 --> 38:24.402
see a community die.

38:24.402 --> 38:29.474
EMILY GUERIN: The Bakken oil
boom has changed all that. The
town has grown by 60 percent

38:29.474 --> 38:35.713
since 2008. And now there are
more than 200 kids in the
school, and the kids are still

38:35.713 --> 38:41.452
coming, despite low oil prices
and thousands of leaves. There's
finally enough students

38:41.452 --> 38:46.858
to bring back varsity sports,
including football -- well,
six-man football.

38:46.858 --> 38:51.196
The school is still too small
for 11-man, and yet Bieber says
people in town could not

38:51.196 --> 38:53.698
be more excited.

38:53.698 --> 38:59.404
LESLIE BIEBER: When we laid the
sod for the football field, it
was 90-some degrees. Community

38:59.404 --> 39:05.109
members came in the middle of
the afternoon to help lay the
sod when it was 90-some degrees.

39:05.109 --> 39:09.747
That doesn't happen unless you
are excited about bringing that
back.

39:09.747 --> 39:17.322
EMILY GUERIN: The Comets' first
football game took place during
Alexander's Old Settler

39:17.322 --> 39:23.962
phase, the town's annual
celebration of its farming and
ranching heritage.

39:23.962 --> 39:29.067
Before the game, everyone,
including the football team,
wandered over to the massive
barbecue

39:29.067 --> 39:35.873
pit. There, the men of Alexander
were digging up meat that had
been slow-cooked overnight.

39:35.873 --> 39:39.744
Working the meat-cutting table
is Jerry Hatter, the mayor of
Alexander. He also works for

39:39.744 --> 39:42.914
a drilling company.

39:42.914 --> 39:48.019
Hatter has a pretty complicated
relationship with the oil
fields, like many people I met

39:48.019 --> 39:52.423
here. On the one hand, he is
grateful for all the new
families moving into town. On

39:52.423 --> 39:54.826
the other hand,
it's overwhelming.

39:54.826 --> 39:57.729
JERRY HATTER, Mayor of
Alexander, North Dakota:
Everything grew so fast, and
there were so

39:57.729 --> 40:02.133
many people, and Western North
Dakota never had a lot of
people. And I think just the

40:02.133 --> 40:06.504
influx of all the people is what
really did it for a lot of
people.

40:06.504 --> 40:10.275
EMILY GUERIN: Alexander may have
been slowly dying before the oil
boom, but some people

40:10.275 --> 40:14.212
liked it that way.
Hatter is one of them.

40:14.212 --> 40:20.184
JERRY HATTER: I hate the fact
that I can drive down places
that there was never anything,

40:20.184 --> 40:25.623
and it's nothing but solid
pumping units and roads and
traffic. And it's changed the
landscape,

40:25.623 --> 40:29.994
but it's given me a lot. So...

40:29.994 --> 40:33.998
EMILY GUERIN: The oil boom is
really love-hate for people here
in Alexander, so that's why

40:33.998 --> 40:38.936
the return of football is so
important. It's something
everyone can be excited about,
no

40:38.936 --> 40:42.674
matter how they feel
about the oil field.

40:42.674 --> 40:52.850
After the barbecue, it was time
for the big game. The place was
packed. People drove their

40:52.850 --> 40:59.490
pickups right up to the edge of
the field. Both old and new
Alexander were there, locals

40:59.490 --> 41:04.896
like Mayor Jerry Hatter, people
who lived here long before the
boom got started, and

41:04.896 --> 41:09.000
newcomers, people
drawn here for work.

41:09.000 --> 41:13.671
Everyone was hoping the Comets
would win, but as the game went
on, that seemed like

41:13.671 --> 41:19.377
a long shot. The Grass
Range/Winnett Rangers from a
small high school in Eastern
Montana

41:19.377 --> 41:24.749
were bigger and more experienced
than the Comets. They
intercepted a lot of Comets'

41:24.749 --> 41:27.885
passes and scored a
lot of touchdowns.

41:27.885 --> 41:32.457
But unless you looked at the
scoreboard, you would have no
way of knowing the Comets were

41:32.457 --> 41:39.997
losing by a lot. The crowd
cheered at every tackle. People
were just happy to be there.

41:39.997 --> 41:45.703
This is the sense of community
that was missing those 28 years
that Alexander didn't have

41:45.703 --> 41:49.640
football. And bringing it back
is especially meaningful for
people like Leanna
Halvorson-Dean.

41:49.640 --> 41:54.045
LEANNA HALVORSON-DEAN, Resident
of Alexander, North Dakota: In
this community, farmers,

41:54.045 --> 41:57.048
ranchers, you get caught up in
your lives and you lose track.
And it's, let's give everybody

41:57.048 --> 41:58.716
back.

41:58.716 --> 42:03.321
EMILY GUERIN: Even if it wasn't
the glorious victory they hoped
for, just having football

42:03.321 --> 42:08.726
back is a win for Alexander.

42:08.726 --> 42:22.807
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Emily Guerin in Alexander, North
Dakota.

42:22.807 --> 42:29.747
GWEN IFILL: Forty years ago, a
poet and performer named Patti
Smith crashed onto the rock
scene

42:29.747 --> 42:34.986
with her debut album, "Horses."
Five years ago, she made another
kind of splash, winning

42:34.986 --> 42:40.191
the National Book Award for a
memoir titled "Just Kids" about
her early years in New York

42:40.191 --> 42:44.162
and her friendship with the
photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe.

42:44.162 --> 42:49.600
Now she's back with another book
titled "M Train." The M is for
memory, a trip through

42:49.600 --> 42:55.773
time to writers and artists who
influenced her and to her own
loved ones now gone.

42:55.773 --> 42:58.976
Patti Smith talked with Jeffrey
Brown recently at the George
Washington University Library

42:58.976 --> 43:01.212
for our "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

43:01.212 --> 43:03.314
JEFFREY BROWN: Patti
Smith, welcome to you.

43:03.314 --> 43:04.949
PATTI SMITH, Author,
"M Train": Thank you.

43:04.949 --> 43:11.756
JEFFREY BROWN: One theme that I
saw is where art comes from and
how it's transmitted, because

43:11.756 --> 43:16.661
so much what you're writing
about is going to authors who
have inspired you, artists

43:16.661 --> 43:21.966
who have influenced you, and it
sounds like you were thinking
about that transmission.

43:21.966 --> 43:27.605
PATTI SMITH: Well, I'm always
thinking about that. I have
thought about that my while
life.

43:27.605 --> 43:35.079
I thought about that when we
recorded "Horses" 40 years ago,
when we wrote songs in memory

43:35.079 --> 43:41.285
of Jim Morrison and Jimi
Hendrix. But I didn't have any
particular design. It just
happened

43:41.285 --> 43:45.723
that I was ruminating on these
things. And, like you said, it's
a natural course of my

43:45.723 --> 43:48.926
life. And I think a lot
of it is about process.

43:48.926 --> 43:51.796
JEFFREY BROWN: A lot of it
unfolds literally in a cafe,
right?

43:51.796 --> 43:53.764
PATTI SMITH: Yes.

43:53.764 --> 43:56.434
JEFFREY BROWN: Sitting in a
cafe. And it's interesting,
because there's a point where

43:56.434 --> 43:59.871
you write about how there were
no cafes in your childhood.

43:59.871 --> 44:06.043
PATTI SMITH: I was raised in
South Jersey. I had read about
them in books about French

44:06.043 --> 44:15.219
poets, seen lots of photographs
of mostly French or Moroccan
writers in cafes. And I

44:15.219 --> 44:19.891
was beguiled by them. But I
didn't see them in person until
I went to New York City.

44:19.891 --> 44:24.395
JEFFREY BROWN: Many of the
vignettes here are about people
who have influenced you.

44:24.395 --> 44:28.065
PATTI SMITH: Well, yes, I mean,
it's a way of identification,
but also showing gratitude,

44:28.065 --> 44:28.933
I think.

44:28.933 --> 44:31.402
JEFFREY BROWN: Gratitude
for their work?

44:31.402 --> 44:36.007
PATTI SMITH: Yes. I'm grateful
all the time that Louisa May
Alcott wrote "Little Women."

44:36.007 --> 44:41.646
I'm grateful the New Testament
was written. I love books, and I
love what the hand of

44:41.646 --> 44:47.418
mankind produces, whether
painting or music, opera.

44:47.418 --> 44:50.888
I just think it's wonderful
that we have that in our life.

44:50.888 --> 44:53.357
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, there's the
high and there's the low. Right?
There's television.

44:53.357 --> 44:58.462
You love to watch "CSI" and you
love to watch PBS mystery shows.

44:58.462 --> 45:01.933
PATTI SMITH: Oh, yes, I
love "Masterpiece Theater."

45:01.933 --> 45:08.706
And when I was a kid, I loved
Sherlock Holmes. I'm not
interested in crimes. I'm
interested

45:08.706 --> 45:15.646
in the mind of the detective and
his process, which to me is a
lot like the artist.

45:15.646 --> 45:20.618
JEFFREY BROWN: And the other
thing that comes out in the book
and in your life is the
photography,

45:20.618 --> 45:28.059
right, photographs of a table, a
chair of a writer that you love,
or the bed of an artist

45:28.059 --> 45:29.560
like Frida Kahlo.

45:29.560 --> 45:31.862
What are they, these objects?

45:31.862 --> 45:37.668
PATTI SMITH: They're like
relics, really. Because I travel
so much, I might one day

45:37.668 --> 45:43.341
see the grave of James Joyce and
the other day see the typewriter
of Hermann Hesse, just

45:43.341 --> 45:49.146
day after day, seeing such
wondrous things, and that I want
to remember, but I also want

45:49.146 --> 45:51.782
to share with others.

45:51.782 --> 45:57.355
JEFFREY BROWN: You refer in the
book to these influences as
portals, windows. To what?

45:57.355 --> 46:04.028
PATTI SMITH: Well, you know, I
can hold my father's favorite
coffee cup, and I'm transported

46:04.028 --> 46:08.399
to the atmosphere of my father.

46:08.399 --> 46:14.071
The other day at the New York
Public Library, I saw the very
humble dipping pen of Charles

46:14.071 --> 46:22.046
Dickens. And holding these
things, I could almost sense the
scratching of the pen over

46:22.046 --> 46:28.786
the paper. It doesn't have to be
a profound thing. It's just a
moment of clarity or a

46:28.786 --> 46:34.358
moment feeling a sense of
the owner of these things.

46:34.358 --> 46:38.763
JEFFREY BROWN: For those of us
who grew up listening to you and
thinking of you as rock

46:38.763 --> 46:41.232
'n' roller, this love of books
was there first, I guess, right,
for you?

46:41.232 --> 46:44.368
PATTI SMITH: Oh, absolutely.

46:44.368 --> 46:50.574
When I was a little girl, my
parents read voraciously, and
there was always books
everywhere,

46:50.574 --> 46:55.613
and I was very curious about
them, so I learned to read quite
early. And I just loved books.

46:55.613 --> 46:57.348
JEFFREY BROWN: And
you wanted to write.

46:57.348 --> 47:02.053
PATTI SMITH: I didn't think of
it until I read "Little Women."

47:02.053 --> 47:11.095
And Jo was such a great role
model. She was sort of
tomboyish, like I was, and what
they

47:11.095 --> 47:17.234
used to call a bookworm, and she
wrote. And then I thought, ah, I
can write, just like

47:17.234 --> 47:23.274
Jo. And I was quite young, but I
took that in my heart as my
vocation.

47:23.274 --> 47:29.146
JEFFREY BROWN: You know, there
is also in this book a lot of --
an air of solitude.

47:29.146 --> 47:33.818
There's loss, some 20-plus years
since your husband, Fred, died.
Is it in some way a response

47:33.818 --> 47:37.221
to that sense of loss?

47:37.221 --> 47:42.126
PATTI SMITH: Really, it just
threaded its way through the
book.

47:42.126 --> 47:47.331
Truthfully, I didn't want to
write about loss at all. I
wanted to write something where

47:47.331 --> 47:58.542
I was unfettered by any
destination, any responsibility.
Yet we are who we are. And I
often -- my husband,

47:58.542 --> 48:05.182
Fred, is always with me and in
my thoughts, as my mother and my
father. So the people

48:05.182 --> 48:11.388
they love and lost found their
way in this book. I didn't
expect them to find their way,

48:11.388 --> 48:16.827
but they did. So
I welcomed them.

48:16.827 --> 48:21.832
JEFFREY BROWN: And now you find
yourself, I think, an
established -- well-established

48:21.832 --> 48:26.370
writer, as well as musician.
Does that feel right to you?

48:26.370 --> 48:30.307
PATTI SMITH: I always hesitate
when people call me a musician.

48:30.307 --> 48:37.114
I have had no musical training.
I can't play anything. I really
think of myself as a performer.

48:37.114 --> 48:44.221
It's always been writing for me.
I evolved with my band in rock
'n' roll through poetry,

48:44.221 --> 48:50.494
not through music. I feel At
this point I have spent at least
60 years writing. I guess

48:50.494 --> 48:52.863
I can at last call
myself a writer.

48:52.863 --> 48:55.132
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
the new book is "M Train."

48:55.132 --> 48:56.066
Patti Smith, thanks so much.

48:56.066 --> 48:58.569
PATTI SMITH: Thank you.

48:58.569 --> 49:03.374
Eileen Pollack

49:03.374 --> 49:11.148
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now time
for a "NewsHour" essay.

49:11.148 --> 49:17.221
Women in the U.S. earn just over
57 percent of bachelor's degrees
in all fields, yet they

49:17.221 --> 49:22.993
receive less than 20 percent of
degrees conferred in computer
science, engineering and
physics.

49:22.993 --> 49:29.466
A recent study by the American
Association of University Women
found that, in 2013, 26

49:29.466 --> 49:36.974
percent of all computing jobs
were held by women, a drop from
35 percent in 1990.

49:36.974 --> 49:42.079
We asked Eileen Pollack, one of
the first two women to receive a
bachelor's of science

49:42.079 --> 49:47.685
degree in physics at Yale and
who now teaches creative writing
at the University of Michigan,

49:47.685 --> 49:49.286
to share an idea from her latest
book, "The Only Woman in the
Room: Why Science Is Still

49:49.286 --> 49:50.988
a Boys' Club."

49:50.988 --> 49:55.125
EILEEN POLLACK, Author, "The
Only Woman in the Room: Why
Science Is Still a Boys' Club":

49:55.125 --> 50:00.097
When I was growing up, I wanted
passionately to be a physicist.

50:00.097 --> 50:04.468
But in seventh grade, the
principal wouldn't let me enter
the accelerated track in science

50:04.468 --> 50:10.274
and math. "Girls never go on to
careers in those subjects," he
told my mother. "Besides,"

50:10.274 --> 50:15.246
he said, "getting skipped ahead
in science and math would ruin
my social life."

50:15.246 --> 50:22.419
As a result, I arrived at Yale
in 1974 far behind my male
classmates. I failed my first

50:22.419 --> 50:28.325
physics midterm, and my parents
urged me to switch majors. But I
worked incredibly hard

50:28.325 --> 50:34.265
and didn't give up. Four years
later, I graduated with a nearly
perfect GPA, an A in a graduate

50:34.265 --> 50:40.137
course in gravitational theory,
and two original research
papers.

50:40.137 --> 50:46.477
Even so, I didn't go on. As
ridiculous as it seems now, I
assumed that if I were talented

50:46.477 --> 50:52.449
enough to apply to graduate
school, one of my professors
would have let me know.

50:52.449 --> 50:57.788
Since then, I have done a lot of
research on gender bias in the
sciences, and I'm sorry

50:57.788 --> 51:04.261
to report not much has changed.
When parents ask why there are
still so few girls in advanced

51:04.261 --> 51:08.732
science and math classes in high
school, I tell them, because
girls still need way more

51:08.732 --> 51:13.170
encouragement than boys
to take those courses.

51:13.170 --> 51:18.409
We still raise girls to look to
other people for assurance they
are attractive and smart,

51:18.409 --> 51:22.713
while boys are raised to
determine their own value. Many
girls are still made to feel
it's

51:22.713 --> 51:25.950
not feminine to be good
at science or math.

51:25.950 --> 51:32.122
And if a girl complains about
how hard her AP calculus course
is, her parents are more

51:32.122 --> 51:38.395
likely to let her drop it than
if her brother voices the same
complaint. As a result, by

51:38.395 --> 51:44.101
the time they get to college,
most girls won't, or can't, sign
up for rigorous courses in

51:44.101 --> 51:52.242
science or math. Those who do
often find themselves unprepared
or lacking in confidence.

51:52.242 --> 51:57.414
What delivers the one-two punch
that knocks so many women and
minorities out of STEM fields

51:57.414 --> 52:02.619
is that scientists have this
strange belief that, if you need
to be encouraged, you aren't

52:02.619 --> 52:07.424
talented or dedicated enough to
be one of them. If you flunk
your first physics or calculus

52:07.424 --> 52:11.395
midterm, you deserve
to be weeded out.

52:11.395 --> 52:17.234
What they don't realize is that
young women and students of
color grow up in a society

52:17.234 --> 52:22.373
that fails to encourage and
often actively discourages them
from thinking of themselves

52:22.373 --> 52:27.044
as scientists. Ask most people
to picture a physicist, and they
will imagine Albert

52:27.044 --> 52:32.750
Einstein or Sheldon from
"The Big Bang Theory."

52:32.750 --> 52:38.422
My parents didn't know how to
provide me with the
encouragement I needed to
achieve my dreams.

52:38.422 --> 52:43.427
But the solution isn't rocket
science. If your daughter finds
herself in a course designed

52:43.427 --> 52:49.733
to weed her out, cheer her on,
urge her to seek extra help, and
give her a giant pat

52:49.733 --> 52:58.075
on the back for having made it
so far, despite all the
discouragement she already has
overcome.

52:58.075 --> 53:09.286
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight:
Happy anniversary to us.

53:09.286 --> 53:12.956
Forty years ago today, we
premiered as "The Robert MacNeil
Report." We have changed a

53:12.956 --> 53:17.728
lot since then, but our core
journalistic standards remain.

53:17.728 --> 53:21.999
Here's a quick look back at how
we have evolved since then. You
may or may not remember some

53:21.999 --> 53:56.366
of it. I cannot tell you how
much of an honor it is to be
part of that tradition, and
especially

53:56.366 --> 53:59.036
to sit across from you
as we continue it.

53:59.036 --> 54:02.106
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I feel the
same way. We haven't been here
the whole time, but we have

54:02.106 --> 54:05.876
been here a chunk of that time,
and, boy, do we feel lucky to be
right where we are,

54:05.876 --> 54:07.377
thanks to our founders,
Jim and Robin.

54:07.377 --> 54:09.279
GWEN IFILL: Thanks,
Jim and Robin.

54:09.279 --> 54:15.552
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right now: Bounce houses
can be lots of fun for

54:15.552 --> 54:20.491
kids, but how safe are they? Our
data team finds that injuries
are on the rise. Read

54:20.491 --> 54:23.594
about the risks on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:23.594 --> 54:27.397
GWEN IFILL: And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight. I'm Gwen
Ifill.

54:27.397 --> 54:29.700
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:29.700 --> 54:34.071
Join us online and again right
here tomorrow evening. For all
of us at the "PBS NewsHour,"

54:34.071 --> 54:35.005
on this anniversary, thank
you, and good night.
