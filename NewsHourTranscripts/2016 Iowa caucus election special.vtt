GWEN IFILL: Welcome to our "PBS
NewsHour"
special coverage of the
presidential caucuses

00:10.277 --> 00:12.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Iowa. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:12.613 --> 00:17.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff in Des
Moines in the capital city of
Des Moines on

00:17.351 --> 00:23.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the campus of Drake University,
as the caucus
results are all but almost
completely in,

00:23.423 --> 00:26.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the shape of the
presidential race has
been changed.

00:26.693 --> 00:30.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The people of Iowa
have kicked
off the presidential year
tonight with big

00:30.731 --> 00:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
turnouts and big surprises.

00:33.133 --> 00:38.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the Republican side, with
nearly all caucus
sites reporting, the Associated
Press projects

00:38.438 --> 00:44.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz has won, defeating
Donald Trump,
who led in public opinion polls
before today.

00:44.878 --> 00:48.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio ran a strong third,
nearly even
with Trump.

00:48.782 --> 00:53.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democratic race is still too
close to
call, with Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders

00:53.820 --> 00:58.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running almost dead even and
some sites yet
to report.

00:59.026 --> 01:03.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republicans are already
coming out to
assess their performances.
Donald Trump and

01:03.163 --> 01:05.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marco Rubio spoke a short while
ago, separately.

01:05.565 --> 01:10.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We finished second. And I want
to tell you

01:10.137 --> 01:15.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something. I'm just honored. I'm
really honored.
And I want to congratulate Ted.
And I want

01:15.943 --> 01:21.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to congratulate all of the
incredible candidates,
including Mike Huckabee, who has
become a

01:21.581 --> 01:24.384 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really good friend of mine. So,
congratulations
to everybody.

01:24.484 --> 01:28.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
For months, they told us,
because we didn't

01:29.089 --> 01:34.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have the right endorsements or
the right political
connections, we had no chance.

01:34.728 --> 01:39.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They told me that we had no
chance because
my hair wasn't gray enough and
my boots were

01:39.199 --> 01:40.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
too high.

01:40.133 --> 01:40.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:40.867 --> 01:43.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:43.103 --> 01:49.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: They told me I
needed to
wait my turn, that I needed to
wait in line.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

01:52.312 --> 02:01.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO: But, tonight,
tonight, here
in Iowa, the people of this
great state have

02:01.321 --> 02:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sent a very clear message. After
seven years
of Barack Obama, we are not
waiting any longer

02:07.427 --> 02:09.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take our country back.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:11.031 --> 02:15.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The results in Iowa
have also
started to winnow the field.
Republican Mike

02:15.302 --> 02:20.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Huckabee tweeted a short while
ago that he
is dropping out. He won just 2
percent support

02:20.107 --> 02:21.975 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

02:22.075 --> 02:25.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Democratic -- and Democrat
Martin O'Malley
announced he's suspending his
campaign after

02:25.912 --> 02:28.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
garnering just 1 percent.

02:28.882 --> 02:32.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy joins us now from Des
Moines for a closer
look at what is behind the
results so far.

02:32.919 --> 02:37.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, two interesting things in
those two
speeches. Marco Rubio, who came
in third,

02:37.524 --> 02:42.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looks like he came in -- gave a
speech like
he came in first. And Donald
Trump was very

02:42.562 --> 02:43.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
subdued and brief.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Exactly, Gwen.

02:46.666 --> 02:50.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was listening to Marco Rubio,
thinking,
if you didn't know what the
numbers were,

02:50.170 --> 02:54.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you would think that he was the
first-place
finisher, rather than the
third-place finisher.

02:54.374 --> 02:59.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't have the final numbers
yet from Republicans,
but Marco Rubio clearly believes
he's riding

02:59.846 --> 03:02.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something important out of Iowa.

03:03.016 --> 03:10.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has come in first among the
so called establishment
candidates. He's not the
outsider that Donald

03:10.490 --> 03:15.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump and Ted Cruz were
portrayed as being.
And there's no question, after
listening to

03:15.695 --> 03:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rubio tonight and talking to
people in his
campaign, that they plan to take
that to New

03:19.966 --> 03:27.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hampshire, to South Carolina and
beyond, and
try to claim that mantle and
pick up the support

03:27.207 --> 03:29.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people who were looking at
other establishment
Republicans.

03:29.976 --> 03:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know, Judy, one
of the things
that you did tonight was go
visit a couple

03:33.346 --> 03:37.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of caucuses where there was a
lot of turnout.
But it turns out that turnout
wasn't necessarily

03:37.117 --> 03:38.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the outsiders.

03:38.418 --> 03:42.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, exactly
right.

03:42.689 --> 03:49.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the case of Donald Trump,
the Iowa
poll, the vaunted Iowa poll had
forecast that

03:49.396 --> 03:55.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he would likely come in first on
the strength
of that outsider appeal, the man
who had never

03:55.735 --> 04:01.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run for public office before.
It's clear that
Donald Trump did something
special in this

04:01.408 --> 04:06.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race. He shook things up in a
way that we
haven't seen American politics
shaken up.

04:06.813 --> 04:13.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Ted Cruz can attribute
some of the
energy in his campaign, and so
can the other

04:13.286 --> 04:17.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates, to what Donald Trump
brought.
But, in the end, what Donald
Trump wanted

04:17.791 --> 04:22.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clearly was a victory. He had
members of his
family today predicting he would
come in first.

04:22.395 --> 04:24.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He didn't do that.

04:24.264 --> 04:29.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right now, he's very close
to third place
-- to Marco Rubio, who is coming
in third.

04:29.469 --> 04:32.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we still have to see that
Donald Trump
coming in second.

04:32.906 --> 04:37.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Among the Democrats,
this is still
too close to call, last we
checked. Do we

04:37.744 --> 04:41.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- have we heard anything from
either the
Sanders or the Clinton campaign
that tells

04:41.181 --> 04:43.283 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
us what they think is going on?

04:43.383 --> 04:49.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the Clinton
camp was
starting to talk to reporters,
Gwen, a little

04:49.890 --> 04:55.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
while ago and saying or
suggesting that they
thought Hillary Clinton had won.

04:55.829 --> 05:00.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That -- they have backed off of
that. And
at least the last numbers I saw,
they were

05:00.834 --> 05:07.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
within two-tenths of a
percentage point apart.
She was at 49.8. He was at 49.6.
There may

05:07.474 --> 05:13.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be new numbers since then. But
that's clearly
not the margin of victory that
Hillary Clinton

05:13.113 --> 05:14.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wanted to ride out of Iowa.

05:14.981 --> 05:19.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is a far cry from what
the Clinton
camp had just a few months ago.
Her -- her

05:19.986 --> 05:26.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or, I should say, Bernie
Sanders' support
has climbed steadily since he
started putting

05:26.193 --> 05:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so much effort and energy into
this state.
And I would say that that must
give her campaign

05:32.999 --> 05:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of headaches to go to
sleep on tonight,
if they get any sleep at all.

05:36.536 --> 05:39.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: One less headache --
Judy, we
will be back with you in a few.

05:39.673 --> 05:43.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One less headache for them is,
as we heard
earlier, Iowa marks the end of
the road for

05:43.743 --> 05:45.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
some tonight.

05:45.645 --> 05:49.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrat Martin O'Malley spoke
this evening
in Des Moines after suspending
his long-shot

05:49.849 --> 05:51.551 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
campaign.

05:51.651 --> 05:54.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN O'MALLEY (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Words cannot express how
grateful I am to

05:54.187 --> 06:00.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of you, my true friends, who
have helped
me in waging this courageous
battle.

06:00.393 --> 06:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I got into this eight
months ago, I had
no doubt that it would be
anything but a tough

06:07.367 --> 06:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fight. And it is a tough fight.
But I have
always been drawn to a tough
fight. And I

06:12.305 --> 06:18.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
felt, when I got into this, as I
looked down
the road, I felt very firmly
that our country

06:18.878 --> 06:24.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was scanning the horizon,
looking for new
possibilities and new leadership
and a way

06:24.150 --> 06:27.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to heal our divisions and move
us forward.

06:27.387 --> 06:32.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm joined
now about Amy
Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

06:32.859 --> 06:34.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Amy, we have got something
to talk about.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:35.562 --> 06:37.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: We
have a lot.

06:37.364 --> 06:37.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have got -- we
have got
real numbers, real results.
They're not final

06:38.098 --> 06:38.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in these contests.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you have
already got Ted
Cruz declaring victory on the
Republican side.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But let's talk about the
Democrats first.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Absolutely.

06:46.773 --> 06:49.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: O'Malley dropping
out, suspending
his campaign. And look at how
close it is

06:49.643 --> 06:51.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
between Clinton and Sanders.

06:51.544 --> 06:56.249 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Well, the
conventional wisdom
going into this race was that
higher turnout

06:56.349 --> 06:58.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
helps Sanders and helps Trump.

06:58.852 --> 07:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's clearly helping Sanders. It
wasn't enough
to help Trump. One thing is, I'm
trying to

07:03.456 --> 07:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dig through a lot of these
entrance polls,
is to look for, what were some
signs for why

07:07.994 --> 07:09.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Sanders is doing so well?

07:09.863 --> 07:14.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The turnout among young people
wasn't as high
as it was back in 2008, when
Barack Obama

07:14.968 --> 07:19.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turned all those young people
out. But the
margin was huge. If these
entrances polls

07:19.272 --> 07:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are right, he got something like
48 percent,
Sanders did, among young people.
That is much

07:24.944 --> 07:27.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
higher than Obama, who got
something like
60 percent.

07:27.914 --> 07:33.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think what you're seeing
is, the numbers
might not translate, but the
enthusiasm was

07:33.320 --> 07:35.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strong enough.

07:35.188 --> 07:38.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what I was
hearing from
pollsters was that the support
-- and this

07:38.892 --> 07:42.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really what you are saying --
the support
that Sanders is getting from
young people

07:42.696 --> 07:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was overwhelming the support
that Hillary
Clinton was getting from women.

07:45.765 --> 07:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes. That's right.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She was counting
on women.
She was counting on younger
women.

07:48.835 --> 07:52.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: She was counting on
women and
older voters.

07:52.238 --> 07:56.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And more older voters turned out
in this election,
people over the age of 65, than
turned out

07:56.176 --> 08:01.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than in 2008, but they didn't
give her the
same margins that they -- that
the young people

08:02.082 --> 08:03.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gave to Bernie Sanders.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let's talk about
what happened
-- what is happening on the
Republican side.

08:06.386 --> 08:11.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is true what Donald Trump
said. When he
came into Iowa, it wasn't
assumed this was

08:12.092 --> 08:12.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his kind of place.

08:12.992 --> 08:13.460 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:13.560 --> 08:15.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, in the last
few weeks
and months, he's climbed in the
polls. And,

08:17.497 --> 08:22.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yes, he was overtaken by Ted
Cruz, but there
was a sense going into tonight
that Donald

08:22.802 --> 08:27.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump would do very well. He was
forecast
first in the highly respected
Iowa poll.

08:27.974 --> 08:31.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Right. He had gone
sort of up
and down through the polls in
the last few

08:32.011 --> 08:35.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months, where he was a little
bit ahead, a
little bit behind. If he
finishes in second,

08:36.082 --> 08:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then he would be somewhere in
that polling
average.

08:39.819 --> 08:45.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I think, with Donald
Trump, I think
your point is correct, that he
energized clearly

08:46.025 --> 08:51.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a whole new group of people to
come out and
vote and participate in this
process. We also

08:51.498 --> 08:55.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw that he got support among
all different
kinds of groups, including
evangelicals. He

08:56.035 --> 09:00.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did pretty well, considering
that he is not
from that traditional lane and
didn't campaign

09:00.774 --> 09:02.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as an evangelical.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other interesting thing I
noticed in the
exit polls, or entrance polls,
as they call

09:05.612 --> 09:07.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them here, because they get
people before
they go in.

09:07.447 --> 09:08.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

09:08.415 --> 09:10.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On their way in,
right.

09:10.350 --> 09:15.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, is that what
you found was
that more people said -- barely,
though -- said

09:15.822 --> 09:20.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they wanted somebody who
was new, wasn't
experienced; 49 percent picked
that.

09:21.094 --> 09:25.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But 45 percent said they want an
experience
candidate. Of the 45 percent who
said they

09:25.165 --> 09:30.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted an experienced candidate,
3 percent
gave Trump their vote, and 39
percent gave

09:30.670 --> 09:33.940 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it to Rubio, Cruz right behind
him on that.

09:34.040 --> 09:37.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there were more people that
turned out,
but a lot of people who turned
out were looking

09:37.944 --> 09:40.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for somebody that wasn't
necessarily in the
Trump mold.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And...

09:42.315 --> 09:44.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: So, that is why this
turnout didn't
necessarily translate for Trump.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well -- and
exactly. And so
the shaking up or the energy
that Trump brought,

09:47.620 --> 09:51.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of it hurt him. It caused
people to think
harder about the race...

09:51.357 --> 09:52.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Exactly.

09:52.792 --> 09:54.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ... but say, I
don't want Donald
Trump going in.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just very quickly, Amy, what
does Marco Rubio
do coming out of Iowa?

09:57.297 --> 10:01.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, as you said,
he positioned
himself as the winner, and goes
into New Hampshire

10:01.668 --> 10:05.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying, I am the candidate.
Forget about Bush,
forget about Kasich. I'm the
only person that

10:06.072 --> 10:12.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can be the true non-Trump,
non-Cruz candidate,
the only one who can win the
Electoral College

10:12.679 --> 10:16.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as it's currently set up.

10:16.249 --> 10:21.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will see. But Trump still
has a pretty
strong lead, if we believe
polling now.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At least he did
in the last
poll.

10:22.522 --> 10:23.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: He did have a very
strong lead
in New Hampshire.

10:23.590 --> 10:25.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

10:25.391 --> 10:27.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And it's going to be
critical
for Rubio to be able to come out
of New Hampshire

10:27.293 --> 10:28.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
saying that I have won
something.

10:29.028 --> 10:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then there is
John Kasich.

10:30.196 --> 10:30.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

10:30.864 --> 10:31.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter, we
thank you.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thanks.

10:34.767 --> 10:35.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will see
you back in
D.C.

10:35.368 --> 10:36.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Indeed.

10:36.135 --> 10:36.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks -- Gwen.

10:36.836 --> 10:38.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Judy.

10:38.738 --> 10:42.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we want to dig into the
numbers a little
bit, going beyond the results
for key facts

10:42.909 --> 10:46.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the Iowans who are kicking
off this
election season.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan breaks it down
-- Hari.

10:48.014 --> 10:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Gwen.

10:49.949 --> 10:54.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our data team looked to see
Iowa's track record
in picking winners and how
similar Iowans

10:54.254 --> 10:58.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are to the rest of the country.
The caucuses
are far from a perfect predictor
of who goes

10:59.058 --> 11:02.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on to become the party's nominee
or eventually
to the White House.

11:02.295 --> 11:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, for Democrats, it is
slightly better
than flipping a coin. The
caucuses have picked

11:07.333 --> 11:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the candidate correctly 55
percent of the
time. For Republicans, the
process has only

11:11.905 --> 11:14.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been right 43 percent of the
time.

11:14.507 --> 11:19.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For example, in 1992,
three-quarters of Iowa
Democrats stood behind longtime
Iowa Senator

11:19.746 --> 11:25.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tom Harkin. That year, Bill
Clinton only received
3 percent of the votes, but
later went on

11:25.485 --> 11:27.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to serve two terms as president.

11:27.453 --> 11:32.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We do have better indicators
today to which
candidate has been on the minds
of Iowans

11:32.425 --> 11:36.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the week leading up to
tonight. Over the
last week, Facebook users in
Iowa had more

11:37.063 --> 11:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to say about Donald Trump than
any other presidential
candidate, Republican or
Democrat. You saw

11:42.235 --> 11:47.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that same trend nationwide.
Behind Trump on
the Republican side were Ted
Cruz, Marco Rubio,

11:48.074 --> 11:52.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and Ben Carson. And among
Democrats, Iowans
had the most to say about
Hillary Clinton,

11:52.512 --> 11:55.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
followed by Bernie Sanders and
then Martin
O'Malley.

11:55.815 --> 12:01.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Of the issues that most
concerned Iowans on
Facebook, crime and criminal
justice, abortion,

12:01.120 --> 12:05.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taxes and the Affordable Care
Act, there was
only one topic the rest of the
country was

12:05.892 --> 12:10.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talking about. That's Wall
Street and financial
regulation. According to
Facebook, the rest

12:10.930 --> 12:17.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the nation is also talking
about topics
including religion, racism and
discrimination,

12:17.470 --> 12:19.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jobs and Benghazi.

12:19.672 --> 12:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But who are today's Iowans, and
how do they
compare to the rest of the
country? They register

12:24.577 --> 12:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote slightly more than the
rest of the
nation. In 2012, three out of
four Iowans

12:29.415 --> 12:34.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were registered, vs. two out of
three Americans.
Among Iowans 18 or older, the
state's median

12:34.687 --> 12:40.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
household income is $53,712,
almost exactly
the national average.

12:40.893 --> 12:45.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the poverty rate, 11
percent, is also
similar the rest of the United
States. But

12:45.632 --> 12:50.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there is a significant
difference. And that's
race. According to the census,
about nine

12:50.937 --> 12:56.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of 10 Iowans are white.
Nationwide, that
number is far lower, about
two-thirds. Fewer

12:56.776 --> 13:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Latino and African-American
voters call Iowa
home, compared to the rest of
the nation.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thanks, Hari.

13:04.250 --> 13:08.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now to the analysis of
Brooks and Cottle.
That is Michelle Cottle of "The
Atlantic"

13:08.955 --> 13:12.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and David Brooks, columnist with
The New York
Times. Mark Shields has been
under the weather,

13:12.892 --> 13:17.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but we look forward to his full
recovery and
his return to our campaign
coverage very soon.

13:17.330 --> 13:22.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, David, I asked you at 6:00,
at our earlier
program, what was the difference
between emotion

13:22.568 --> 13:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and organization? Now that we
know that Ted
Cruz has won, that Marco Rubio
has said he

13:27.173 --> 13:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has won, essentially, and that
Donald Trump
has kind of slung off to New
Hampshire, saying

13:32.378 --> 13:37.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will revisit this whole
thing, what do
you think won, organization or
passion?

13:37.550 --> 13:41.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I guess it
was organization.
It certainly wasn't Donald
Trump.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the big story of the
night is that
Donald Trump underperformed. He
underperformed

13:44.924 --> 13:48.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
because he's been a show
business candidate.
And we were always curious -- we
were curious

13:48.161 --> 13:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see if the show business were
turn into
substance. But, like a lot of
spectacle, it

13:51.764 --> 13:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was more flash than substance.

13:54.200 --> 13:58.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we can expect that
in the states
ahead. There is no reason to
think why his

13:58.171 --> 14:01.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supporters would come out to
vote anymore
in New Hampshire or anywhere
else. So, I think

14:01.741 --> 14:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I don't know if he will lose
New Hampshire,
but I think we can expect some
underperformance.

14:05.044 --> 14:09.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second thing we learned on
the Republican
side is that history has not
been suspended.

14:09.415 --> 14:13.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This looks a little -- a lot
more normal than
it did before tonight. We have
got a conservative

14:13.486 --> 14:18.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate. We have got Ted Cruz,
who looks
-- who inherited a lot of that
Rick Santorum,

14:18.658 --> 14:22.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Huckabee vote, who won the
previous two
caucuses. He is obviously
stronger than they

14:23.062 --> 14:24.897 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going forward.

14:24.997 --> 14:28.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But he looks like the
conservative candidates
Iowans traditionally like. Marco
Rubio looks

14:28.234 --> 14:32.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the one candidate who can
unify. This
is clearly his moment. A
panicked Republican

14:32.872 --> 14:37.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
establishment is now going to
turn their face
to him. The question for Rubio
is, can he

14:37.944 --> 14:41.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acknowledge the Trump phenomenon
and reach
out to those people and be the
one who can

14:41.914 --> 14:43.783 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unify the party?

14:43.883 --> 14:46.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: How about
overperformed -- or
who overperformed and who
underperformed tonight,

14:46.953 --> 14:48.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Michelle?

14:48.821 --> 14:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: I think Rubio
actually did
a pretty good job of beating the
expectations

14:51.124 --> 14:52.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
game.

14:53.059 --> 14:55.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I know it's late, but if you
listen closely,
you can hear the Republican
establishment

14:55.795 --> 14:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gearing up to just rally around
him and push
him through.

15:00.099 --> 15:01.934 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You can hear the
wind of relief?

15:02.034 --> 15:05.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: That's right.
You can hear
the sigh of relief going out.

15:05.404 --> 15:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David's right. Ted Cruz will
declare victory,
but this turns into a vastly
more conventional

15:11.444 --> 15:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iowa caucus. You have the social
conservative
who came out on top. And then,
you know, you

15:17.250 --> 15:21.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go from there. And they will go
into New Hampshire,
and we will just kind of see how
it shakes

15:21.254 --> 15:23.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out. But Trump missed his moment
with this.

15:23.689 --> 15:26.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's talk a
little bit
about the Democratic side,
because that is

15:26.893 --> 15:30.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still truly up in the air, as
far as we can
tell, David.

15:31.030 --> 15:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders, if you listen to
what Amy
Walter was just telling us,
really has found

15:35.535 --> 15:40.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way to at least nip at the
heels of Hillary
Clinton tonight. We don't know
how it's going

15:40.273 --> 15:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to turn out yet, but it's not
insignificant.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. At this
moment, we don't
know who will win, but we do
know that Bernie

15:45.778 --> 15:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders can turn out his people.
And that
was also the question, because
he had a lot

15:48.281 --> 15:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of first-time voters, he had a
lot of younger
voters.

15:50.283 --> 15:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had to spread around the
state to go
to the key districts. And they
did that. And

15:55.588 --> 15:59.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so Bernie Sanders, A, looks like
a lot better
executive and organizer than
Donald Trump

15:59.692 --> 16:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Republican side, because
he turned
his people out. And so, as we go
forward,

16:03.563 --> 16:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again, Iowa, New Hampshire,
Vermont were his
three best states.

16:07.166 --> 16:11.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we can -- it is not like it
is a cakewalk
for Bernie Sanders, but he has
proven to be

16:11.904 --> 16:17.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a potent force, and Hillary
Clinton looks
still the dominant favorite, but
a lot more

16:17.543 --> 16:19.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vulnerable than she did a few
hours ago.

16:19.445 --> 16:22.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know, Michelle,
one of the
things we know for sure about
Iowa, it lends

16:22.815 --> 16:24.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
itself to interpretation.

16:24.650 --> 16:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in the same way that we had
Marco Rubio
acting like he won tonight, even
though he

16:28.988 --> 16:33.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came in third, we still know
that, no matter
what this -- how this turns out
between Bernie

16:33.993 --> 16:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders and Hillary Clinton,
both of them
can say they did OK.

16:36.963 --> 16:42.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: They can. And I
think, unfortunately,
for the Clinton campaign, there
is the narrative

16:42.501 --> 16:46.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of, uh-oh, deja vu, she was the
inevitable
going in, and it has happened
again.

16:47.073 --> 16:52.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's going to have to
survive a news
cycle of that as they go into
New Hampshire,

16:52.778 --> 16:58.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whereas Sanders was considered a
joke until
not that long ago. And now he
can declare

16:58.851 --> 17:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
victory, irregardless of who
actually comes
out on top.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is Bernie Sanders --
let me stick
with you for a moment. Is Bernie
Sanders'

17:04.924 --> 17:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ability to rise above the joke
factor, as
you put it, is it a result of an
anti-Hillary

17:11.898 --> 17:17.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feeling out there in the party,
or is it a
sense that he is actually a
legitimate and

17:17.136 --> 17:20.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
viable future president of the
United States
for a lot of people?

17:20.239 --> 17:25.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: I don't know
that it's anti-Hillary
feeling, so much as kind of anti
the way things

17:25.144 --> 17:29.382 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
have -- you know,
anti-establishment, which
we're seeing a lot of places.

17:29.482 --> 17:34.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As for whether or not he is a
viable candidate
nationwide, we have to go back
to what we

17:34.120 --> 17:39.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were talking about earlier,
which is that
his three best states are
Vermont, New Hampshire

17:39.859 --> 17:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Iowa, in terms of who his
base is. And,
again, it's the Democratic
primary. He's going

17:45.798 --> 17:50.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have to prove that he can
talk to minority
voters and non-liberals before
he's going

17:50.569 --> 17:54.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be able to make real inroads
into anything
past New Hampshire.

17:54.507 --> 17:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And South Carolina,
of course,
is the first big test of that
diversity question.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.680 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHELLE COTTLE: Yes.

18:00.780 --> 18:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: David, did -- did
Marco Rubio
and did Ted Cruz especially
prove tonight

18:05.818 --> 18:10.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you can take on Donald
Trump and live
to tell the tale?

18:10.356 --> 18:11.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I don't know
if I would
give them credit for that,
because they didn't

18:11.557 --> 18:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
run ads against him barely.

18:13.559 --> 18:19.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Trump sacrificed his
own. He has defeated
himself. And, frankly, I thought
his concession

18:19.565 --> 18:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speech was a little delusional.
It was fine.
It was nice. But he didn't
acknowledge the

18:23.803 --> 18:28.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
defeat. And his is a campaign
that -- where
success has been built on
success. He claims

18:28.207 --> 18:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's in the campaign because
he's a winner.
But now is he not a winner, so
how does he

18:31.177 --> 18:33.045 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
justify the campaign?

18:33.145 --> 18:36.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, I think it was more
self-immolation. But
Cruz is a strong candidate. One
of the reasons

18:36.115 --> 18:41.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he and Sanders are strong is, as
polls have
shown all year, the parties are
polarizing.

18:41.354 --> 18:44.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The number of people who call
themselves extremely
progressive is up. The number of
people who

18:44.824 --> 18:46.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
call themselves extremely
conservative is
up.

18:46.993 --> 18:51.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Cruz and Sanders are
stronger than
their earlier versions, the
Santorums or the

18:51.197 --> 18:56.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Howard Deans, and so they
benefit from the
polarization of the country.
They are closer

18:56.535 --> 18:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the heart of where their
parties are than
would have been the case five,
10 years ago.

18:59.839 --> 19:04.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, briefly, a word
for the exiting
candidates tonight, Martin
O'Malley on the

19:04.577 --> 19:09.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic side, Mike Huckabee
on the Republican
side. Does their exit make any
difference?

19:09.315 --> 19:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Or did their presence make a
difference?

19:11.417 --> 19:13.252 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:13.352 --> 19:16.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: You know, I was
in Iowa with
Martin O'Malley over the summer
a little bit.

19:16.589 --> 19:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there were a lot of Sanders
voters at
the O'Malley events. So, it's
not like he

19:23.162 --> 19:23.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was...

19:24.096 --> 19:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He had traction of
his own.

19:25.965 --> 19:29.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COTTLE: He wasn't
electrifying a
lot of the voters there. So, I
doubt his exit

19:29.935 --> 19:31.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is going to make much of an
issue.

19:31.937 --> 19:35.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And in addition to
Mike Huckabee's
withdrawal tonight, David, we
have Ben Carson

19:35.908 --> 19:39.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying he is taking a break from
the campaign
to go get some fresh clothes.

19:39.245 --> 19:41.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

19:41.113 --> 19:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. You know,
they do have
laundries. They do have washing
machines in

19:43.616 --> 19:45.351 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these places.

19:45.451 --> 19:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes. I -- these are -- we're
going to see
the campaign not narrow
immediately, but I

19:50.389 --> 19:54.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think some of these nice guys
who are genuinely
good guys are going to drop out.
It's sort

19:54.560 --> 19:58.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of amazing that Huckabee and
Santorum, the
two previous winners, basically
registered

19:58.898 --> 20:03.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very little, a lot of fickleness
there, in
part because other -- other
forces have just

20:03.402 --> 20:06.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
come in and displaced them. I'm
not sure their
departure will mean much.

20:06.605 --> 20:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: David Brooks joining
us from New
Haven tonight, Michelle Cottle
with me here

20:10.109 --> 20:14.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Washington, thank you both
very much.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now I'm joined by Lisa
Desjardins, who
will take us a little bit deeper
into what

20:17.917 --> 20:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these numbers tell us, and
especially who
voted and where.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Fascinating
things we're
seeing on the maps tonight.

20:23.456 --> 20:27.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to go straight to the
Republican race,
where we have Ted Cruz coming
out on top.

20:27.593 --> 20:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at the map of Iowa
and you look
at the numbers that we have from
the race

20:30.996 --> 20:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tonight, look at these key areas
we talked
about before.

20:34.200 --> 20:38.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That upper northwest corner, the
conservative
corner, Ted Cruz did win there,
but I think

20:38.771 --> 20:43.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is notable, Gwen, Marco
Rubio did well
up there as well.

20:43.142 --> 20:49.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look at Des Moines. Here is
where Marco Rubio
really soared. He won two of the
hugest counties

20:49.381 --> 20:54.353 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Iowa. So, those numbers are
really what
pushed him up to number three.

20:54.453 --> 20:58.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, where did he do well. He
did well sort
of on the corners, around the
sides. And I

20:58.891 --> 21:04.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compared this to past races. He
did well in
counties that just barely went
for John McCain,

21:04.497 --> 21:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of a strange moderate, warm
Republican
area.

21:07.566 --> 21:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hard to say what generated that.
But I do
think what we see from these
numbers is, this

21:12.037 --> 21:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
looks like what three-man races
look like.
It's interesting.

21:15.541 --> 21:17.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Wow.

21:17.343 --> 21:20.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this what -- do these numbers
also explain
why things are still so tight as
a ticket,

21:20.846 --> 21:23.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as Dan Rather used to say, among
the Democrats?

21:23.516 --> 21:25.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

21:25.251 --> 21:29.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think what we're seeing at
this exact
second are the important numbers
from the

21:29.321 --> 21:33.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bigger counties coming in that
will determine
this. Let's look at the
Democratic map, and,

21:33.425 --> 21:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in particular, want to see that
those university
towns we have been talking about
all night,

21:37.997 --> 21:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they didn't all go for Bernie
Sanders to the
degree that he wanted.

21:41.467 --> 21:46.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw a couple went 60/40, but
look at the
University of Northern Iowa,
Black Hawk County.

21:46.639 --> 21:52.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a deep blue county, went
heavily for
President Obama in the general
election. Tonight,

21:52.745 --> 21:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie Sanders is winning that
county by just
four points or so.

21:56.482 --> 22:01.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a place where he was
expected to just
cream Hillary Clinton. Not
happening. Now,

22:01.420 --> 22:06.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is that because she
out-organized him? Is
it because somehow she generated
some electricity

22:06.325 --> 22:10.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that county? It's hard to
say. But when
you look at where she's winning
across the

22:10.996 --> 22:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
board, not just college towns,
it's everywhere,
Gwen. It's not one type of
county or another.

22:15.701 --> 22:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to me, that says that is
someone who
is well-organized.

22:18.337 --> 22:21.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I wonder if the map
begins to
fall apart in some of the
conventional wisdom

22:21.941 --> 22:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about Iowa as well, because the
Obama coalition
doesn't exactly exist anymore,
for instance.

22:26.879 --> 22:28.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

22:28.747 --> 22:30.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is what I like about
these maps.
I think we are seeing a
completely new way

22:30.749 --> 22:35.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of looking at Iowa, completely
new way for
candidates to approach it. Sure,
you can do

22:35.888 --> 22:39.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well as Marco Rubio did by
taking care
of Des Moines, doing well there.

22:39.558 --> 22:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the successful
candidates tonight,
especially Ted Cruz, organized
everywhere,

22:45.197 --> 22:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
got out their people everywhere,
and didn't
play this game of sort of
sectional voters

22:49.969 --> 22:51.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as much as we have seen in the
past.

22:51.937 --> 22:54.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, that cliche did
pay off, which
is, organization, organization,
organization

22:54.940 --> 22:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does pay off in Iowa for these
caucuses.

22:56.842 --> 22:58.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes. I think
that's right,
and also maybe the cliche of
three tickets

22:58.978 --> 23:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of Iowa for the Republicans,
at least,
not three tickets for Democrats,
but...

23:02.748 --> 23:04.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's because the
third was so
far down.

23:04.950 --> 23:06.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

23:06.151 --> 23:07.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Otherwise, maybe
there would have
been.

23:07.920 --> 23:11.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK. It's fascinating to watch,
fascinating
to understand why. And thank you
so much.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.492 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

23:13.592 --> 23:16.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Judy, we're back
with you.

23:16.395 --> 23:18.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hi, Gwen.

23:18.330 --> 23:23.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, as I'm listening to
these conversations
you're having with Lisa and with
David and

23:23.535 --> 23:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michelle Cottle, I'm thinking
Iowa is often
derided for having these
caucuses. They're

23:28.007 --> 23:32.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of a strange animal when it
comes to
our political process. But, once
again, Iowa

23:33.078 --> 23:36.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has reshaped this president -- a
presidential
contest.

23:36.382 --> 23:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look on the Republican side. Ted
Cruz, someone
who has had a -- already a
controversial career

23:42.187 --> 23:48.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Senate, is coming out of
here with
a clear win. And unlike the last
two elections,

23:48.627 --> 23:53.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you had Mike Huckabee, Rick
Santorum
as the Republican winner, Ted
Cruz is someone

23:53.198 --> 23:59.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has the ability to go on. He
has raised
money. He has proven his
organization statewide.

23:59.772 --> 24:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He can go on and do something
with this win
out of Iowa.

24:03.475 --> 24:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the Democratic side, you
have been
talking about it. This is a
state that put

24:07.246 --> 24:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fear of God into Hillary
Clinton. She
came into the state thinking
this was going

24:12.384 --> 24:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a place she could not
easily take, because
she struggled here in 2008
against Barack

24:18.057 --> 24:22.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama, but never in their
wildest imagination
did they think they were going
to face the

24:22.428 --> 24:25.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kind of thing that Bernie
Sanders put together.

24:25.197 --> 24:28.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really something. When you
look -- I
looked at some numbers just
before we came

24:28.767 --> 24:33.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out here tonight. Bernie Sanders
did very
well across this state. There is
a lot of

24:33.372 --> 24:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
excitement -- we talked about it
with Amy
Walter -- across the board,
ages, young, old,

24:40.813 --> 24:42.648 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
demographics up and down.

24:42.748 --> 24:47.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is for, as we said, a
Democratic
socialist in the United States
Senate, so

24:47.720 --> 24:52.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a lot of surprise on the
Democratic side.
We're still watching those final
numbers to

24:52.358 --> 24:58.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see that Hillary Clinton pulls
it out, but,
boy, it sure has -- has kept us
on our toes.

24:58.797 --> 25:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Sure has, Judy.

25:00.466 --> 25:03.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And thanks for all of your
reporting out there
in Iowa. It has been amazing.

25:03.369 --> 25:07.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we have Senator Ted Cruz,
the Republican
winner tonight. He spoke to
supporters moments

25:07.840 --> 25:09.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

25:09.708 --> 25:13.245 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Tonight, the state of Iowa has
spoken.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

25:15.914 --> 25:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Iowa has sent
notice that the
Republican nominee and the next
president

25:23.822 --> 25:29.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States will not be
chosen by
the media.

25:30.062 --> 25:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

25:34.500 --> 25:42.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Will not be
chosen by the Washington
establishment.

25:43.041 --> 25:45.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE).

25:45.944 --> 25:51.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: Will not be
chosen by the lobbyists.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

25:53.952 --> 26:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. TED CRUZ: But will be
chosen by the most
incredible, powerful force,
where all sovereignty

26:01.660 --> 26:06.698 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resides in our nation, by we,
the people,
the American people.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

26:08.667 --> 26:12.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, recapping the
headlines of
this presidential caucus night
in Iowa, Ted

26:12.471 --> 26:16.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz bested Donald Trump in the
Republican
race, with Marco Rubio a close
third. Cruz

26:17.009 --> 26:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said his win shows the strength
of conservatives
against Washington insiders.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Good night, Judy, from Iowa.

26:22.147 --> 26:24.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for joining us.

26:24.183 --> 26:28.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That wraps up our
coverage
from here. We will see you
later.

26:28.420 --> 26:44.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm Judy Woodruff. Good night.
