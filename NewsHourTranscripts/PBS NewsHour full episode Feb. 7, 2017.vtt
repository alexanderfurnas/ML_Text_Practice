DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Some things are law and, I'm all
in favor

00:11.812 --> 00:14.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of that, and some things are
common sense.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.083 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is common sense.

00:16.116 --> 00:19.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A federal appeals
court takes
up President Trump's
controversial immigration

00:19.853 --> 00:21.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
order.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Also ahead this
Tuesday: how
the confirmation of Betsy DeVos
as education

00:24.992 --> 00:27.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretary might affect students
and teachers
across the country.

00:27.794 --> 00:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in our Race
Matters series:
the challenges facing minorities
with autism,

00:34.067 --> 00:38.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and one family's mission to tear
down the
obstacles leaving too many
without the help

00:38.972 --> 00:40.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they need.

00:40.741 --> 00:45.045 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
LAURA ANTHONY,
Neuropsychologist: If you're
anything other than a 7-year-old
white boy,

00:45.078 --> 00:50.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if you're a 7-year-old
white girl, you're
less likely to be identified
with autism.

00:50.484 --> 00:58.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:58.292 --> 01:01.161 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.194 --> 01:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're having
guests join me
here at the "NewsHour" anchor
desk in the

01:09.937 --> 01:11.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming weeks.

01:11.271 --> 01:14.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, it's Audie Cornish of
NPR's "All
Things Considered."

01:14.741 --> 01:15.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

01:15.742 --> 01:16.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Thanks so much
for having me.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's great to
have you.

01:18.679 --> 01:23.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The day's top story: A federal
appeals court
hears arguments over President
Trump's executive

01:23.250 --> 01:25.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
order on refugees and
immigration.

01:25.619 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The panel will have to decide
whether to override
a lower court that blocked
enforcement nationwide.

01:31.525 --> 01:35.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will examine this in detail
right after
the news summary.

01:35.595 --> 01:39.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House says it is
confident of ultimate
victory in the court fight.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president made clear
today he is willing
to go to the mat.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

01:45.238 --> 01:49.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President Trump has
vowed to fight
for his executive order all the
way to the

01:49.743 --> 01:51.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Supreme Court, if he has to.

01:51.578 --> 01:53.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We're going to take it through
the system.

01:53.413 --> 01:55.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very important.

01:55.282 --> 02:01.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very important to the
country, regardless
of me or whoever succeeds at a
later date.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, we have to have security
in our country.

02:03.490 --> 02:08.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to have the ability when
you take
some place like Syria, you take
all of the

02:08.462 --> 02:14.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different people pouring all --
and, if you
remember, ISIS said, we are
going to infiltrate

02:14.868 --> 02:19.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States and other
countries through
the migration.

02:19.539 --> 02:22.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we're not allowed to be
tough on
the people coming in?

02:22.576 --> 02:24.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Explain that one.

02:24.444 --> 02:28.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The order temporarily
stopped citizens
of seven Muslim-majority
countries from entering

02:28.081 --> 02:31.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the United States, and barred
the admission
of refugees.

02:31.351 --> 02:36.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Friday, a federal judge in
Seattle blocked
enforcement.

02:36.490 --> 02:42.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Twitter, the president
warned: "The threat
from radical Islamic terrorism
is very real.

02:42.529 --> 02:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just look at what is happening
in Europe and
the Middle East.

02:45.799 --> 02:47.901 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Courts must act fast."

02:47.934 --> 02:52.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Capitol Hill, Representative
Bennie Thompson,
the top Democrat on the Homeland
Security

02:52.672 --> 02:57.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Committee, pressed Homeland
Security Secretary
John Kelly on whether any
terrorists have

02:57.310 --> 02:59.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entered the country.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, Homeland Security
Secretary: But
it's entirely possible that
someone that's

03:00.981 --> 03:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming in, whether it's during
this stay,
during the court action or
previous to this

03:06.219 --> 03:07.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
period, intend to do us harm.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BENNIE THOMPSON (D),
Mississippi: But you
don't have any proof at this
point.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY: Not until the boom.

03:12.592 --> 03:13.560 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:13.593 --> 03:15.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENNIE THOMPSON: Not until what?

03:15.395 --> 03:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY: Not until they act
and blow something
up or go into a mall and kill
people.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So we won't know until then.

03:20.267 --> 03:23.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Kelly said Mr.
Trump's order was
not a Muslim ban.

03:23.970 --> 03:28.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said it made an awful lot of
sense, but
acknowledged problems with the
rollout:

03:28.442 --> 03:34.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY: In retrospect, I
should have,
this is all on me, by the way, I
should have

03:34.548 --> 03:39.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delayed it just a bit so that I
could talk
to members of Congress,
particularly the leadership

03:39.052 --> 03:43.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the committees like this, to
prepare them
for what was coming.

03:43.323 --> 03:47.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Kelly also told
lawmakers the administration
is not contemplating adding
other countries

03:47.828 --> 03:49.596 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for now.

03:49.629 --> 03:54.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KELLY: This travel pause is
all about
countries that are not
cooperative, or can't

03:54.868 --> 04:00.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be cooperative because of the
conditions within
the country, to provide us, to
provide the

04:00.040 --> 04:05.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president, to provide me now a
confidence
that the people that we're
dealing with are

04:05.378 --> 04:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the people who, you know -- who
they say they
are.

04:08.415 --> 04:13.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Related to all of
this, the president's
assertion that the new media has
ignored some

04:13.820 --> 04:15.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
acts of terrorism.

04:15.355 --> 04:18.592 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The White House released a list
of 78 incidents.

04:18.625 --> 04:23.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It said most of them were
terrorist attacks
that didn't get enough news
coverage.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer:

04:25.665 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
Part of this is to make sure
that the American

04:27.767 --> 04:34.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people are reminded how
prevalent some of
these attacks are, and how much
time and attention

04:34.040 --> 04:39.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have or have not gotten,
but, more importantly,
to make sure that they
understand the unwavering

04:39.279 --> 04:43.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commitment that the president
has and the
actions that he will take to
keep the country

04:43.049 --> 04:44.584 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
safe.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.654 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Spicer said the list
was assembled
after the president's statement.

04:47.687 --> 04:50.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang at the
White House.

04:51.024 --> 04:56.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
also repeated
a claim he's made before, that
the nation's

04:56.229 --> 04:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
murder rate is the highest in 47
years.

04:59.799 --> 05:03.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, FBI figures show it is
the lowest
in decades.

05:03.436 --> 05:07.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: In the day's
other news, the
Senate confirmed Betsy DeVos to
be secretary

05:07.974 --> 05:12.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of education by the slimmest of
margins, 51-50.

05:12.045 --> 05:15.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice President Mike Pence had to
step in to
cast the tie-breaking vote, part
of his duties

05:15.982 --> 05:20.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as president of the Senate, but
it's the first
time that's happened on a
Cabinet nomination.

05:20.287 --> 05:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will take a closer look at
DeVos and the
battle over her nomination later
in the program.

05:24.624 --> 05:29.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president's
choice to head
the Veterans Affairs department,
David Shulkin,

05:29.162 --> 05:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sailed through committee today,
and headed
to the full Senate.

05:32.499 --> 05:37.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, overnight, the labor
secretary nominee,
Andrew Puzder, acknowledged that
he once had

05:37.571 --> 05:40.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an undocumented immigrant as a
housekeeper.

05:40.340 --> 05:44.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, he said -- quote
-- "When
I learned of her status, we
immediately ended

05:44.377 --> 05:46.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
her employment."

05:46.279 --> 05:50.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: House Speaker
Paul Ryan now
says Congress will finish the
work of repealing

05:50.116 --> 05:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and replacing Obamacare before
the year is
out, and he delivered a rough
timeline today,

05:55.689 --> 05:59.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this after President Trump said
over the weekend
that the process might take
until next year.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.895 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:01.928 --> 06:03.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: So
the question about how long it
takes to effectuate

06:03.730 --> 06:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the change, how long it takes to
put these
things in place, that's a
question that the

06:07.500 --> 06:09.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
HHS can answer.

06:09.169 --> 06:11.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But far as legislating is
concerned, we're
going to do our legislating this
year.

06:11.871 --> 06:16.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Republicans voted
last month
to dismantle the Affordable Care
Act, but

06:16.076 --> 06:20.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have missed their target
date of January
27 to start drafting the
legislation to make

06:20.947 --> 06:22.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that happen.

06:22.849 --> 06:25.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers
cleared the way today for
completion of the

06:25.552 --> 06:28.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
controversial Dakota Access oil
pipeline.

06:28.755 --> 06:33.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Corps notified Congress that
it is granting
the final easement in North
Dakota.

06:33.326 --> 06:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe
says the pipeline's
route threatens its cultural
sites and water

06:39.499 --> 06:42.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
supply, and it promised a new
legal fight.

06:42.135 --> 06:47.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: The governor of
Louisiana has
declared a state of emergency
after tornadoes

06:47.340 --> 06:49.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in and near New Orleans today.

06:49.442 --> 06:54.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The storms damaged a number of
homes and businesses,
and knocked out power to
thousands.

06:54.314 --> 06:57.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were no reports of deaths
and most of
the injuries were minor.

06:57.284 --> 07:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Afghanistan, a
suicide bomber
attacked an entrance to the
country's Supreme

07:02.022 --> 07:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Court, killing at least 19
people.

07:05.225 --> 07:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials say the attacker, on
foot, targeted
a side door as court employees
were leaving

07:10.563 --> 07:16.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the building in downtown Kabul;
41 people
were wounded, including 10

07:16.202 --> 07:21.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUDIE CORNISH: Israel's
Parliament has touched
off a new confrontation over
Jewish settlements

07:21.074 --> 07:24.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the West Bank, but it may end
up being
largely symbolic.

07:24.244 --> 07:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, the Knesset voted
retroactively
to legalize thousands of homes
built illegally

07:29.316 --> 07:30.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Palestinian land.

07:30.917 --> 07:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It drew praise and condemnation
alike.

07:32.986 --> 07:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOMER REHOVI, Israeli Settler
(through translator):
Both sides benefit, actually.

07:36.756 --> 07:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The side who owns the land
receives a respectable
amount of money and can build
somewhere else,

07:41.494 --> 07:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the side who already lives
there won't
have to dismantle his life
achievement.

07:44.764 --> 07:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAHMOUD ABBAS, Palestinian
Authority President
(through translator): The
Israeli government

07:48.168 --> 07:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
passed a bill yesterday in the
Knesset that
legalizes stealing Palestinian
private land

07:53.707 --> 07:55.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in favor of settlers.

07:55.642 --> 08:00.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This legislation is contrary to
international
law, and we will continue our
efforts with

08:00.146 --> 08:04.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
international courts in order to
protect our
existence and land.

08:04.084 --> 08:08.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: A number of
Israeli legal experts
predicted the nation's Supreme
Court will

08:08.621 --> 08:10.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
strike down the law.

08:10.390 --> 08:13.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, the Trump White
House said
it will wait for the courts to
rule before

08:13.960 --> 08:15.695 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
taking a stance.

08:15.729 --> 08:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, first
lady Melania Trump has reached a
settlement

08:19.299 --> 08:23.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over a libel lawsuit she filed
against a blogger.

08:23.236 --> 08:28.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had claimed falsely that she
worked as
an escort in New York in the
1990s.

08:28.608 --> 08:33.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Attorneys for both sides say the
settlement
included his apology and a --
quote -- "substantial

08:33.480 --> 08:34.748 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sum of money."

08:34.781 --> 08:38.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Wall Street had
another relatively
quiet day.

08:38.218 --> 08:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained nearly
38 points to close at 20090.

08:43.189 --> 08:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 10 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
added half-a-point.

08:47.127 --> 08:51.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Boston today,
they turned
out by the hundreds of
thousands, as the Super

08:51.898 --> 08:56.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bowl champion New England
Patriots paraded
through the streets.

08:56.102 --> 09:02.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With trophies in hand, players
and fans braved
snow, rain and wind to
celebrate.

09:02.275 --> 09:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New England beat the Atlanta
Falcons Sunday
for its fifth NFL title overall.

09:07.347 --> 09:12.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: And another
winner, the word
of the year for 2016 is
"surreal."

09:12.519 --> 09:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Merriam-Webster dictionary
people define
it as unbelievable or fantastic.

09:17.524 --> 09:22.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say online searches for
surreal spiked
after last year's terror
attacks.

09:22.128 --> 09:24.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The most popular day for that
search term,
though?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The day after the presidential
election.

09:26.699 --> 09:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you know?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

09:29.602 --> 09:31.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
where President Trump's
immigration order

09:32.005 --> 09:38.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes from here; fact-checking
the president's
claim that the press doesn't
cover terrorist

09:38.044 --> 09:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks; shocking details of a
Syrian prison's
routine torture and executions;
and much more.

09:48.087 --> 09:53.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attacks; shocking details of a
Syrian prison's
routine torture and executions;
and much more.

09:53.193 --> 10:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: For the latest on
the ongoing
court battle over President
Trump's executive

10:02.101 --> 10:05.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
order on refugees and
immigration, we are
joined by "NewsHour" regular
Marcia Coyle

10:05.939 --> 10:07.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of "The National Law Journal."

10:07.507 --> 10:08.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hi there, Marcia.

10:08.675 --> 10:10.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Hi, Audie.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUDIE CORNISH: So, what
precisely are the
judges hearing the arguments
about tonight?

10:12.145 --> 10:13.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What is at stake?

10:13.947 --> 10:17.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: The government is
going to be
arguing, first of all, that
Minnesota and

10:17.517 --> 10:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the state of Washington do not
have the right
to challenge the president's
executive order

10:22.021 --> 10:23.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on immigration.

10:23.756 --> 10:28.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president, they will argue,
has power
under federal law and the
Constitution to

10:28.161 --> 10:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issue this order, and this order
itself doesn't
violate the Constitution, either
because of

10:34.234 --> 10:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
religious discrimination or any
other provision
of the Constitution.

10:38.438 --> 10:43.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The states are going to come
back, and they're
going to say the lower court's
order is not

10:43.309 --> 10:48.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appealable by the government, we
have a right
to be in court to challenge it,
this order

10:48.848 --> 10:55.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exceeds the president's power
and violates
federal law and the
Constitution, and it does

10:55.688 --> 10:57.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
violate religious rights under
the Constitution.

10:57.657 --> 11:02.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Now, the states
have said that
they know the president has
broad authority

11:02.262 --> 11:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be in control of who comes in
and out of
the country.

11:06.165 --> 11:09.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So what do we know about how the
Supreme Court
feels about this?

11:09.335 --> 11:13.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's the case law out there
that tells us
whether or not the president
does have some

11:13.072 --> 11:14.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
limits on his power there?

11:14.807 --> 11:18.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, the Supreme
Court has
held in a number of cases over
many years

11:18.878 --> 11:25.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the president has broad
power under the
Immigration and Nationality Act
and also under

11:25.485 --> 11:29.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his inherent power to conduct
foreign affairs.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the area of immigration, he
has these broad
powers.

11:32.492 --> 11:39.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, at the same time, the
court has recognized,
because also over the years, we
have developed

11:39.499 --> 11:44.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a jurisprudence in this country
that recognizes
certain rights under the
Constitution, and

11:44.904 --> 11:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is the interplay of how those
rights may
intersect with the president's
power that

11:50.376 --> 11:58.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes to play in this particular
case, rights
such as to be free of
nationality discrimination,

11:58.151 --> 12:03.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
religious discrimination, and to
have the
equal protection and due process
of law.

12:03.056 --> 12:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: People have been
talking about
these legal challenges as though
it's inevitable

12:07.360 --> 12:09.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they will end up before the
Supreme Court.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that the case?

12:11.030 --> 12:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: We will have to
wait and see
what this three-judge panel does
with the

12:14.334 --> 12:16.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
appeal by the government.

12:16.402 --> 12:20.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ultimately, it may well get to
the Supreme
Court, but whether it will get
to the court

12:20.773 --> 12:23.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
quickly, I really don't know.

12:23.743 --> 12:30.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court may decide that this
has been such
an early action, there's been no
full hearing

12:30.183 --> 12:35.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and full argument on the merits
of the challenge
to the president's order.

12:35.121 --> 12:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court may want that to play
out a bit
in the lower court, as well as
in the other

12:39.993 --> 12:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
courts that are facing these
challenges right
now.

12:44.063 --> 12:49.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, it may be
convinced that
national security is of such a
great concern

12:49.202 --> 12:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that it ought to jump in.

12:51.371 --> 12:56.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also, just remember, this is
still an
eight-justice court, and last
term, when it

12:56.909 --> 13:04.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was faced with a major
immigration case involving
states' authority to sue to
challenge an executive

13:04.317 --> 13:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
action, as well as the scope of
a president's
power in the area of
immigration, it split

13:10.657 --> 13:18.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
4-4, and was unable to resolve
some of those
issues and give guidance to what
would -- I'm

13:18.431 --> 13:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure the Ninth Circuit would
like the see
tonight in those particular
areas.

13:22.869 --> 13:29.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the court may want to wait
until it has
a ninth justice and doesn't face
the possibility

13:29.509 --> 13:30.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of a deadlock.

13:30.943 --> 13:34.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: In the meantime,
these arguments
are being held tonight.

13:34.947 --> 13:38.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just remind us why this case is
different
from all the other legal
challenges that have

13:38.718 --> 13:40.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
propped up that have had
specific plaintiffs.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.288 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Right.

13:42.321 --> 13:47.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, this case in particular,
because the
lower court judge, Judge Robart,
he issued

13:47.660 --> 13:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a nationwide injunction against
the president's
order, and so that affects
everybody.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It affects all of the states.

13:56.335 --> 14:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It affects the people who are
trying to come
into the country as well.

14:00.540 --> 14:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the other courts have issued
more limited
orders.

14:04.911 --> 14:08.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that the attention
now is here.

14:08.214 --> 14:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government wants this one
resolved because
of the sweeping impact it has
under a nationwide

14:13.786 --> 14:15.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
injunction.

14:15.588 --> 14:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: And can you give
us a little
preview, if it goes one way or
another, are

14:18.391 --> 14:20.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there limits about who can
appeal, who cannot
appeal?

14:20.693 --> 14:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, right now,
before the
three-judge panel, it's what we
called a temporary

14:25.898 --> 14:26.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
restraining order.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, generally, those aren't
appealable.

14:29.802 --> 14:35.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the panel can look at it as
being akin
to another type of order that is
appealable.

14:35.641 --> 14:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, depending on whether this
panel wants
to reach the merits, it may.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It may not.

14:44.650 --> 14:49.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may send the case back to
Judge Robart
to have that full hearing that
generally follows

14:49.555 --> 14:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a temporary restraining order.

14:51.390 --> 14:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: And we will be
hearing more
tonight on what happens with
that case.

14:54.360 --> 14:55.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes, we will.

14:55.795 --> 14:57.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Marcia Coyle,
thank you so
much for speaking with us.

14:57.997 --> 15:05.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure.

15:05.772 --> 15:13.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One charge the
president and
his team have raised repeatedly
in recent

15:13.279 --> 15:19.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days is his claim that the news
media either
ignore or undercovers terrorist
incidents.

15:19.585 --> 15:24.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Monday, the president himself
said -- quote
-- "The dishonest press doesn't
want to report

15:24.757 --> 15:26.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on terrorist attacks."

15:26.559 --> 15:30.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was followed by the White
House issuing
a list of attacks that it
contends didn't

15:30.696 --> 15:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
get enough press attention.

15:32.465 --> 15:37.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Philip Bump, who reports for The
Washington
Post, has been looking into the
accuracy of

15:37.170 --> 15:38.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the president's claims.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he joins me now from New
York.

15:40.273 --> 15:45.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Philip, just to be clear,
what exactly
did the president himself say?

15:45.244 --> 15:47.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And distinguish that from what
his press secretary
said.

15:47.914 --> 15:50.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
®MD-BO /PHILIP BUMP, The
Washington Post:
And it's an absolutely critical
distinction.

15:50.616 --> 15:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the president, speaking to
the United
States Central Command, said
that the media

15:54.220 --> 15:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wasn't reporting, that, for
whatever reason,
implying that there was some
bias involved,

15:58.424 --> 16:00.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the media wasn't reporting about
terror attacks.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.096 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The White House's press
secretary then came
back and modified that, tried to
soften it

16:04.130 --> 16:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and say, well, what he meant to
say is, these
things have been underreported.

16:07.567 --> 16:11.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was the point at which they
issued this
list of 78 attacks that occurred
between 2014

16:11.804 --> 16:13.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and 2016.

16:13.573 --> 16:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you went over
this list
of 78 different attacks that
they put down

16:18.244 --> 16:19.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and handed out.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what did you find?

16:20.813 --> 16:24.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PHILIP BUMP: I didn't find any
that hadn't
actually been reported.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the bar that the
president set.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's important to remember.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said they had not been
reported.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Each of these 78, I had found
had been reported.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ThinkProgress, a liberal site,
went back.

16:33.626 --> 16:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found 17,000 news articles
in the first
week after each of these attacks
covering

16:37.830 --> 16:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all these attacks, 17,000
articles covering
these 78 attacks.

16:40.566 --> 16:43.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's certainly the case that
these things
had been reported.

16:43.769 --> 16:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Underreported, of course, is
very subjective,
and that's really where the
administration

16:47.573 --> 16:50.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
right now is putting its
emphasis on making
that point.

16:50.443 --> 16:54.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, just to
back up a little
bit, there were a number of
terrorist attacks

16:54.347 --> 16:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in here that were clearly
covered.

16:56.249 --> 17:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, some would argue they
were overcovered,
from Orlando to San Bernardino
to the Paris

17:02.021 --> 17:03.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attacks, Brussels, and so on.

17:03.589 --> 17:05.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PHILIP BUMP: That's exactly
right.

17:05.391 --> 17:09.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that's why it's
very safe
to assume that the motivation
for releasing

17:09.562 --> 17:12.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this list wasn't necessarily to
make this
point about being underreported.

17:12.965 --> 17:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, to include on this list
something like
the San Bernardino attack or the
Orlando attack,

17:17.603 --> 17:22.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which got saturation coverage
for days on
end, justifiably, to include
those on a list

17:22.441 --> 17:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of things being underreported
seems to suggest
the point of the list was in
fact the list

17:26.545 --> 17:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
itself, in that there were all
these terror
attacks that the administration
at this moment,

17:30.316 --> 17:34.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with this court battle, going
wants to make
people aware that terrorism
still exists as

17:34.453 --> 17:36.255 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a big problem.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Philip Bump,
you also
did find some that didn't get
that much coverage.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most of them occurred overseas,
is that right,
outside the United States?

17:42.995 --> 17:45.164 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PHILIP BUMP: That's exactly
right.

17:45.197 --> 17:50.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yes, so the scale of the attacks
here range
from the attack in Paris, which
was a multipronged

17:50.236 --> 17:55.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack, at a soccer stadium and
a music hall
and cafes, to stabbing attacks
on people -- military

17:55.841 --> 17:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
officials in Egypt, for example.

17:57.476 --> 18:00.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a huge range of what
is included
in this.

18:00.313 --> 18:04.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the attacks, no one was
killed, not
necessarily that that should be
the standard

18:04.116 --> 18:06.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by which we say a terrorist
attack is good
or bad.

18:06.419 --> 18:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact that all of these
things were
packaged together as one whole,
suggesting

18:10.656 --> 18:14.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is, therefore, a threat to
the United
States, which was the clear
implication, I

18:14.160 --> 18:15.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think is worth noting.

18:15.928 --> 18:19.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, the bottom
line is that
what the president stated is not
accurate,

18:19.632 --> 18:23.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that the press has ignored most
terrorist
attacks.

18:23.703 --> 18:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, to go beyond that, you
point out in the
article this concept of working
the refs.

18:31.243 --> 18:36.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House approach to
talking to the
press about what it's going to
do or not going

18:36.716 --> 18:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do in covering something
that's coming
up, explore that with us for a
second.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PHILIP BUMP: Sure.

18:42.788 --> 18:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there's this idea of working
with the refs,
essentially looking as the media
as being

18:46.759 --> 18:48.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
referees.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's this concept that
carries over from
sports, obviously.

18:50.062 --> 18:54.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the idea is to try and shape
the behavior
of the media by criticizing the
media in a

18:54.800 --> 18:56.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very deliberate way.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what Donald Trump said, I
don't think
that this was planned.

18:59.005 --> 19:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think he was irritated in the
moment at
the media, made these comments.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't obviously say that with
certainty.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think what Sean Spicer,
the press secretary
did, was very strategic.

19:07.179 --> 19:11.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he said, this is an
opportunity for us
to try and get this list of 78
attacks out

19:11.550 --> 19:18.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in from of the media, and at the
same time
get the media to focus from here
on out about

19:18.090 --> 19:20.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the extent to which they cover
terror attacks.

19:20.493 --> 19:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, in this moment, in
this political
moment, it is beneficial to the
administration

19:24.230 --> 19:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to have this perception that
there are a lot
of terror attacks that are going
underreported

19:27.833 --> 19:29.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that are happening all the time.

19:29.602 --> 19:33.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a way, I think, that
Spicer realized
of getting the media to be more
attentive

19:33.372 --> 19:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to, should we or should we not
cover this
thing that we might not
otherwise have covered?

19:36.776 --> 19:41.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there is also
the question
that's been raised about how
much terrorist

19:41.213 --> 19:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- how coverage of terrorist
attacks or attempted
attacks raises what we know is
the fear level

19:48.054 --> 19:54.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this country, this idea that
the more terrorism,
terrorist attacks are in the
news, no matter

19:54.827 --> 20:00.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how small or how large they may
be, how many
incidents, the more there is a
sense of fear

20:00.633 --> 20:03.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that begins to permeate the
public.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PHILIP BUMP: That's exactly
right.

20:05.371 --> 20:09.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's important to remember
that the entire
point of a terror attack is to
terrorize.

20:09.208 --> 20:14.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the only way you can
terrorize is if the
news media, if people in general
hype the

20:14.480 --> 20:18.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
idea that there is a lot of
terrorism going
on and that there is a reason to
be afraid.

20:18.784 --> 20:23.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is clearly a balance
that any elected
official has to hold to between
whether or

20:23.322 --> 20:26.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not you emphasize terror or
whether or not
you downplay terrorism.

20:26.525 --> 20:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, during the daily press
briefing, Sean
Spicer tried to sort of play it
both ways.

20:31.430 --> 20:35.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He suggested that it was
important that we
talk about all these things, but
that the

20:35.101 --> 20:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
result of that would be that
people would
feel safer under President
Trump.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not sure he can have that
cake and eat
it too.

20:40.139 --> 20:43.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it
certainly was important
to go down and look at this list
that the

20:43.709 --> 20:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White House put out of 78
incidents.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And your reporting was
important.

20:47.279 --> 20:48.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Philip Bump, we thank you.

20:48.514 --> 20:49.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PHILIP BUMP: Thanks.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.483 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sure.

20:50.516 --> 21:02.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:02.394 --> 21:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
the newly
confirmed secretary of education
could reshape

21:07.533 --> 21:12.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that department; on our Race
Matters series,
the unique challenges facing
black children

21:13.005 --> 21:20.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with autism; and a new take on
Timothy McVeigh's
motivation for the Oklahoma City
bombing.

21:20.246 --> 21:26.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: Amnesty International
has just
issued a report documenting what
it says is

21:26.318 --> 21:32.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clear evidence that the Assad
regime in Syria
has been illegally imprisoning,
torturing

21:32.525 --> 21:35.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and murdering political
opponents.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has more.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: Some of the
details here are
disturbing.

21:39.265 --> 21:45.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Amnesty's
report says that
somewhere between 5,000 and
13,000 people

21:45.137 --> 21:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were tortured and executed at
one military
prison outside Damascus between
2011 and 2015.

21:52.545 --> 21:56.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amnesty alleges that officials
at the highest
level of the Syrian government
approved the

21:56.382 --> 22:01.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
killings, as did the grand mufti
of Syria,
the highest ranking religious
figure in the

22:01.187 --> 22:02.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

22:02.254 --> 22:03.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by Sunjeev Bery.

22:03.756 --> 22:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's Amnesty's director of
advocacy for the
Middle East and North Africa.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SUNJEEV BERY, Amnesty
International: Thank
you for having me.

22:08.994 --> 22:12.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Very, very
troubling reading
in this report and the stories
of the people

22:13.032 --> 22:15.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who were tortured and executed
at this prison.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you tell me, who were these
people?

22:18.103 --> 22:22.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUNJEEV BERY: There were
thousands of civilians,
as well as some ex-military
officers, who

22:22.141 --> 22:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are held at Saydnaya prison in
Saydnaya, Syria.

22:25.578 --> 22:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We estimate that between 10,000
and 20,000
people are held there now.

22:29.281 --> 22:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for years, on a weekly
basis, as many
as 50 people have been hanged in
mass executions

22:34.386 --> 22:36.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the Syrian government at this
prison.

22:36.222 --> 22:40.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And are these
people who
are picked up -- what are the
crimes that

22:40.092 --> 22:41.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're accused of?

22:41.794 --> 22:44.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUNJEEV BERY: Many of them are
perceived to
be opposition to the government,
although

22:44.363 --> 22:49.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when you're doing this kind of
mass arrest,
mass torture and miss execution,
who knows

22:49.902 --> 22:51.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what the individual people's
backgrounds are?

22:51.870 --> 22:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, peaceful,
nonviolent opposition
to a government is certainly not
a crime.

22:56.775 --> 23:01.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But with that background, many
of them are
subjected to forced confessions
through extraordinarily

23:01.814 --> 23:08.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brutal torture, and once that
confession is
put via ink to paper, then the
execution process

23:08.220 --> 23:09.989 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
begins.

23:10.022 --> 23:13.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I understand a
lot of the
documentation for this report
came from people

23:13.158 --> 23:15.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who witnessed what's going on in
there.

23:15.227 --> 23:19.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand that there is some
kind of a
trial process, so-called trial.

23:19.765 --> 23:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you explain a little bit
about what goes
on?

23:21.634 --> 23:23.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUNJEEV BERY: Sure.

23:23.435 --> 23:26.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And just to put it in
perspective, the so-called
trial is a total of one to three
minutes.

23:26.305 --> 23:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One to three
minutes' long?

23:27.873 --> 23:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUNJEEV BERY: One to three
minutes per person,
who is then later executed.

23:30.809 --> 23:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So you have thousands of people
in these prisons
subjected to extraordinary
brutal torture

23:35.281 --> 23:39.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in complete silence, living
under rules of
complete silence, routine
deaths.

23:39.985 --> 23:45.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A certain percentage of the
population in
this prison are then taken to
trials via a

23:45.557 --> 23:52.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
military field court, a
so-called court, in
a suburb of Damascus, where,
during a one-to-three-minute

23:52.331 --> 23:59.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trial, with, of course, no
lawyer present,
no due process at all, in 60 to
180 seconds,

23:59.571 --> 24:01.373 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they are sentenced to death.

24:01.407 --> 24:04.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That death sentence is then
rubber-stamped
by higher authorities up to the
highest levels

24:04.910 --> 24:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of government, and then later
they are tortured
and hung to death.

24:08.480 --> 24:12.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The thing that
was so striking
to me, among many, in this
report was the

24:12.351 --> 24:18.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bureaucracy, the documentation
of it, the
fingerprinting, the getting
witnesses to sign

24:18.757 --> 24:23.896 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that they had never been
mistreated, getting
doctors to certify that all
these deaths occurred

24:23.929 --> 24:25.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
because of natural causes.

24:25.798 --> 24:29.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do you think that the regime
goes to these
lengths to basically catalogue
their own war

24:29.635 --> 24:31.270 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crimes?

24:31.303 --> 24:34.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUNJEEV BERY: It is difficult to
know why
the regime is so
bureaucratically efficient

24:34.907 --> 24:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in its documentation of its
crimes against
humanity.

24:38.377 --> 24:42.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One possibility may be that the
senior levels
of the government, perhaps even
including

24:42.481 --> 24:47.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Bashar al-Assad, want
to know that
the crimes against humanity that
they are

24:47.519 --> 24:52.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likely to be ordering are, in
fact, being
carried out by the military and
the intelligence

24:53.025 --> 24:54.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bureaucracy.

24:54.760 --> 24:58.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so with each of these
executions, the
executions are signed, either by
the grand

24:58.497 --> 25:04.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mufti, the highest appointed
supposedly Muslim
authority in Syria, although, if
you're signing

25:04.503 --> 25:11.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
off on all these mass
executions, it's highly
questionable what your personal
morality is,

25:11.276 --> 25:17.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the army chief of staff, or
one other senior
level defense official, the
minister of defense.

25:17.216 --> 25:20.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What do you
hope the international
community does with this
evidence?

25:20.319 --> 25:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUNJEEV BERY: Well, the first
thing to do
is stare the evidence in the
face and acknowledge

25:24.022 --> 25:25.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what's happening.

25:25.891 --> 25:30.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's time for Russia and China
to drop their
veto at the U.N. Security
Council and allow

25:30.529 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United Nations to take
action on this.

25:32.998 --> 25:38.504 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's time for the U.S.
government under President
Trump to stop pretending that
anything other

25:38.537 --> 25:40.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than gross crimes against
humanity are happening.

25:40.973 --> 25:44.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's also time to
acknowledge what Syrian
refugees are fleeing.

25:44.943 --> 25:50.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have perhaps 5,000 to 13,000
people killed
at this prison, another 17,000
people killed

25:50.582 --> 25:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at other prisons across Syria,
and all of
that against a backdrop of some
400,000 people

25:55.454 --> 25:58.323 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who have died since the Syrian
war began.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People are fleeing for their
lives.

26:00.225 --> 26:06.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is shameful that our own
U.S. government
here has said no to Syrian
refugees at a time

26:06.965 --> 26:08.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of such extraordinary suffering.

26:08.700 --> 26:13.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This report
comes out amidst
-- it's just the latest piece of
evidence

26:13.972 --> 26:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a mountain of evidence that
already exists
about Assad's regime.

26:17.509 --> 26:21.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as you well know, Assad
still sits happily
on his perch in Syria.

26:21.313 --> 26:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that this is going
to move the
needle in any way?

26:24.116 --> 26:26.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SUNJEEV BERY: The needle
definitely has to
move.

26:26.051 --> 26:29.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one key factor is going to
be putting
pressure on the U.N. Security
Council to take

26:29.621 --> 26:31.390 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means putting pressure on
the Russian
government, putting pressure on
the Chinese

26:33.325 --> 26:37.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government, and ensuring that
the U.S. government,
under the new U.S. ambassador to
the United

26:37.329 --> 26:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nations, Nikki Haley, actually
stands up on
this issue and pushes on it, as
opposed to

26:42.301 --> 26:47.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
referring to President Bashar
al-Assad as
some kind of ally in the
so-called war against

26:47.573 --> 26:49.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terrorism.

26:49.374 --> 26:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Sunjeev Bery
of Amnesty International, thank
you very much.

26:54.146 --> 27:00.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUNJEEV BERY: Thank you.

27:00.786 --> 27:07.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Now let's turn
back to the
contentious confirmation of
Betsy DeVos as

27:07.793 --> 27:09.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the next secretary of education.

27:09.695 --> 27:11.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The vote was razor-thin.

27:11.430 --> 27:16.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, tonight, we look at how it
went down,
what DeVos can do as education
secretary,

27:16.268 --> 27:17.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the limits of her power.

27:17.870 --> 27:21.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the focus of our weekly
education segment,
Making the Grade.

27:21.106 --> 27:22.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins gets us started.

27:23.008 --> 27:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
On this vote, the yeas are 50,
the nays are

27:27.579 --> 27:29.181 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
50.

27:29.214 --> 27:33.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Senate being equally
divided, the vice
president votes in the
affirmative.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hand the nomination is
confirmed.

27:35.454 --> 27:39.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It marked the
first time
a vice president presiding over
the Senate

27:39.458 --> 27:45.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has broken a tie to confirm a
Cabinet secretary,
a dramatic ending to the
nomination of Betsy

27:45.330 --> 27:47.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DeVos for secretary of
education.

27:47.266 --> 27:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it came after 24 straight
hours of debate,
when Democrats held a rare
overnight speech-a-thon

27:53.805 --> 27:55.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to oppose DeVos.

27:55.607 --> 28:01.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the primary doubt came from
two Republicans,
Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa
Murkowski

28:01.146 --> 28:02.481 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Alaska.

28:02.514 --> 28:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both said DeVos' confirmation
hearing led
them to vote no.

28:06.652 --> 28:10.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats like Ohio's Sherrod
Brown tried
to persuade other Republicans.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERROD BROWN (D), Ohio: As many
have said
on this floor, based on her
confirmation hearing,

28:14.826 --> 28:19.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it appears she has a complete
lack of knowledge
as to what the Department of
Education actually

28:19.932 --> 28:21.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
does.

28:21.733 --> 28:23.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But a number of
Republicans,
like Tennessee's Lamar
Alexander, defended

28:23.735 --> 28:24.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DeVos.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

28:26.572 --> 28:28.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAMAR ALEXANDER (R), Tennessee:
She has led
the most effective public school
reform movement

28:28.707 --> 28:30.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the last 30 years.

28:30.475 --> 28:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I urge you to give the new
Republican
president the opportunity to
choose his own

28:33.745 --> 28:35.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
education secretary.

28:35.647 --> 28:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: DeVos is known
as a school
choice activist, who supports
for-profit charter

28:40.185 --> 28:45.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools, and wants public funds
to be used
as vouchers for private schools.

28:45.424 --> 28:50.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's also a billionaire, who,
along with
her family, has donated heavily
to Republicans.

28:50.829 --> 28:56.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the end, she survived the
toughest fight
for any Trump nominee yet, and
Vice President

28:56.101 --> 28:58.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Pence swore her in late today.

28:58.203 --> 29:00.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: And Lisa joins me
now.

29:00.772 --> 29:06.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Lisa, outs of all of these
nominees,
this one ended up giving the
Trump administration

29:06.745 --> 29:08.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the most trouble.

29:08.213 --> 29:09.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What happened?

29:09.982 --> 29:12.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well, I think
that there
was an overwhelming response
from America.

29:12.918 --> 29:17.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Part of that, we know, was
individual voters
following Betsy DeVos' hearings
who called

29:17.623 --> 29:18.757 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their senators.

29:18.790 --> 29:20.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But let's not kid ourselves.

29:20.292 --> 29:24.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There was also a huge
organizational push,
largely by teachers unions.

29:24.529 --> 29:27.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I talked to the National
Education Association.

29:27.065 --> 29:31.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They said they directed 1.1
million e-mails
toward senators.

29:31.803 --> 29:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then also the American
Federation of Teachers,
2,000 actions from them.

29:35.974 --> 29:38.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These were unions making a huge
push.

29:38.076 --> 29:40.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They came close, Audie, but, in
the end, this
is also a tale of unions.

29:40.979 --> 29:42.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They still have influence.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They can still mobilize.

29:44.149 --> 29:46.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they don't have decisive
influence anymore.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They lost.

29:47.052 --> 29:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Right, close, but
no cigar.

29:48.053 --> 29:49.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: The thing is,
that is the outside
opposition.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What about Democrats on the
inside?

29:52.624 --> 29:54.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What were they able to do?

29:54.292 --> 29:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because I know they were able to
try to peel
off a Republican in the last
minute.

29:56.428 --> 29:59.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think
Democrats thought
this outside push was going to
do it and win

29:59.798 --> 30:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over another Republican.

30:01.566 --> 30:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you talk to the Republicans
who voted
no, like Susan Collins today,
and she said

30:05.070 --> 30:10.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what did it for her what Betsy
DeVos herself,
that the hearing just changed
Susan Collins'

30:10.442 --> 30:12.144 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mind.

30:12.177 --> 30:14.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in addition, the voices she
was listening
to were those of teachers in her
state.

30:14.579 --> 30:18.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She said the superintendent of
the Bangor
School District, also
superintendent from

30:18.517 --> 30:23.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an island school district, those
voices said
to her, we don't like Betsy
DeVos, we don't

30:23.188 --> 30:25.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trust her to run our education
system.

30:25.290 --> 30:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's who Susan Collins
listened to.

30:27.225 --> 30:31.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: What does this
mean going forward
for her relationship, say, with
Capitol Hill,

30:31.763 --> 30:32.731 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

30:32.764 --> 30:33.732 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is this...

30:33.765 --> 30:34.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:34.766 --> 30:36.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They do have an oversight role,
of course,
over everything in the agencies.

30:37.402 --> 30:39.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for the most part, I think,
Audie, this
is over.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans, including Susan
Collins, say
they want to move on.

30:41.940 --> 30:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're hoping the education
secretary, now
that she's confirmed, does well.

30:45.977 --> 30:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think watch Democrats,
because this
is just another very difficult
political decision

30:50.015 --> 30:51.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for them.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do they keep opposing everything
the way their
base is pressuring them, or, as
Dick Durbin

30:55.954 --> 31:00.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said to me, do they try and take
a deep breath
and see what's actually
winnable, what could

31:00.125 --> 31:01.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actually change something/

31:01.727 --> 31:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our producer Pam Kirkland talked
to Dianne
Feinstein.

31:04.529 --> 31:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She just kind of shook her head
and said,
"It is what it is."

31:07.299 --> 31:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Lisa, thanks so
much.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: My pleasure.

31:10.202 --> 31:13.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AUDIE CORNISH: With the
confirmation battle
behind her, what can Betsy DeVos
do now?

31:13.705 --> 31:17.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What exactly is in her power to
change at
the Education Department.

31:17.309 --> 31:20.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Emma Brown of The Washington
Post has written
about this.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

31:21.780 --> 31:26.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Emma, I want to start by
asking you about
what the education secretary can
actually

31:26.518 --> 31:28.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do on her own, right?

31:28.353 --> 31:33.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen an administration
that's willing
to use executive power in trying
to deal with

31:33.091 --> 31:34.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
regulations.

31:34.559 --> 31:36.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does that mean for an
education secretary?

31:36.595 --> 31:39.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA BROWN, The Washington Post:
There are
certain things that the
education secretary

31:39.831 --> 31:43.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
absolutely can do on her own
now.

31:43.602 --> 31:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the really important
areas is civil
rights.

31:46.471 --> 31:51.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And civil rights advocates are
really worried
actually about what Betsy DeVos
and the Trump

31:51.810 --> 31:54.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
administration will do in this
realm.

31:54.446 --> 31:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They could really easily with
the stroke of
a pen rescind or revise the
Obama administration's

31:59.684 --> 32:04.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
controversial guidance on
transgender students'
accommodations in public
schools.

32:04.956 --> 32:11.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Similarly, they can reverse the
guidance that
has really pushed schools and
colleges to

32:12.030 --> 32:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
handle complaints of sexual
violence differently.

32:13.865 --> 32:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a whole realm of
civil rights
enforcement and investigation
that is really

32:19.037 --> 32:22.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
under Betsy DeVos' management
now.

32:22.073 --> 32:25.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: With both the
Obama administration
and the Bush administration,
there were times

32:25.911 --> 32:29.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when their Education Departments
and secretaries
were accused of overreach.

32:29.614 --> 32:30.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

32:30.715 --> 32:33.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They faced massive backlash over
federal initiatives.

32:33.752 --> 32:37.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What has that shown us about the
limits of
power for the education
secretary?

32:37.289 --> 32:42.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA BROWN: Yes, the Obama
administration
took the power of the Education
Department

32:42.327 --> 32:43.361 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to its limits.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what we saw was a backlash
from Congress.

32:45.630 --> 32:51.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Congress didn't appreciate that,
and, in the
end, you know, passed with
overwhelming majorities

32:51.803 --> 32:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new federal education law, the
Every Student
Succeeds Act, that really reined
in the education

32:58.543 --> 33:03.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary's authority and
shifted quite a
bit of authority from the
federal government

33:03.648 --> 33:06.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in general back to states and
local districts.

33:06.051 --> 33:12.224 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so there is a real
sensitivity right now
in Washington to the federal
role in education,

33:12.257 --> 33:14.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Republicans really want to
see that federal
role shrunken.

33:14.993 --> 33:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: That being said,
we know that
candidate Donald Trump advocated
for block

33:20.165 --> 33:23.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
grants to states to support
school choice
programs.

33:23.468 --> 33:28.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, now that he will have an
education secretary
who also believes in vouchers
and school choice,

33:28.907 --> 33:32.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is the appetite on Capitol
Hill for something
like that, right?

33:32.110 --> 33:33.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They hold the purse strings.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would have to approve the
legislation
to make it happen.

33:36.681 --> 33:38.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMMA BROWN: Absolutely.

33:38.483 --> 33:43.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is where she, Betsy
DeVos, is going
to need cooperation from
Congress, you know,

33:43.321 --> 33:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
either in the budget language or
in legislation.

33:47.959 --> 33:53.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Trump's proposal was a $20
billion proposal,
which is really huge.

33:53.865 --> 33:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spend $15 billion right now
on Title I
funds, which is all the money
that goes from

33:58.870 --> 34:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the federal government to
support schools
that serve lots of kids who are
low-income.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, $20 billion is huge.

34:05.810 --> 34:11.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that a lot of folks in
the education
community saw that as a really
heavy lift,

34:11.149 --> 34:14.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even before all this pushback
against DeVos.

34:14.185 --> 34:17.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are other ways she can
promote school
choice.

34:17.122 --> 34:20.325 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can do it through tax code
overhaul.

34:20.358 --> 34:25.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can look for examples like
the D.C. voucher
program.

34:25.130 --> 34:30.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have the only federally
funded voucher
program here in D.C. -- to
expand that.

34:31.002 --> 34:37.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there will be, I think,
at least the
beginnings of efforts to expand
school choice,

34:37.909 --> 34:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe on a smaller scale first,
before going
to those bigger pushes.

34:41.780 --> 34:46.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Given the fight
over her nomination,
what do you see as the political
kind of hurdles

34:46.618 --> 34:48.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going forward?

34:48.486 --> 34:53.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMMA BROWN: Well, I think that
the folks who
have opposed her, including the
teachers unions,

34:53.158 --> 34:58.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but also civil rights advocates
and the folks
who just weren't connected to
either of those

34:58.396 --> 35:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups, but just came out
against her because
they said they believed in
public schools,

35:01.733 --> 35:06.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the goal of the
opponents of Betsy
DeVos is going to have to
continue mobilizing

35:06.972 --> 35:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those forces to watch everything
she does
and to continue applying
pressure on Congress

35:12.610 --> 35:14.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to serve as a watchdog.

35:14.312 --> 35:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, you know, she's
going to have
to prove that she is an advocate
for sort

35:21.987 --> 35:25.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this whole constituency that
came out against
her in the last few weeks.

35:25.423 --> 35:29.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Emma Brown of The
Washington
Post, thank you.

35:29.661 --> 35:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EMMA BROWN: Thanks.

35:35.433 --> 35:45.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the story of
an African-American
family that knows autism
firsthand and the

35:45.777 --> 35:49.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particular challenges facing
communities of
color.

35:49.748 --> 35:54.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Autism rates among
African-Americans are the
same as rates among whites, but
African-American

35:54.619 --> 36:01.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children are often diagnosed
with autism at
an older age, missing potential
years of treatment.

36:01.860 --> 36:06.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent John
Donvan and producer
Caren Zucker have our report.

36:06.297 --> 36:12.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Here's how handsome
this man
named Jason Harlan is, this
29-year-old, who

36:12.170 --> 36:14.039 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lives just outside Chicago.

36:14.072 --> 36:18.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's his mother's thought --
her name
is Debra Vines -- that with
looks like these:

36:18.309 --> 36:22.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBRA VINES, Founder, The
Answer, Inc.: Jason's
going to be the first autism
model on the

36:22.414 --> 36:23.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cover of "GQ" magazine.

36:24.015 --> 36:24.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:25.016 --> 36:25.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: That's the dream?

36:26.017 --> 36:27.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEBRA VINES: It is.

36:27.786 --> 36:31.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Now, the obstacles
to that ever
happening may seem huge, because
Jason does

36:31.189 --> 36:36.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indeed have autism of a kind
that means he
has quite limited language, so
that only a

36:36.361 --> 36:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very few people like his dad,
James, have
the insight it takes for real
two-way communication

36:42.233 --> 36:46.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

36:46.371 --> 36:52.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jason also has a limited
repertoire of skills,
like tidying up, which he excels
at and loves.

36:52.210 --> 36:57.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in most ways, for meeting
his own basic
needs, he has to count on
constant help from

36:57.148 --> 36:58.850 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

36:58.883 --> 37:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then there is this other
factor complicating
Jason's journey through life.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.923 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is black.

37:04.956 --> 37:11.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you are black and
autistic, you face
a set of disparities that
significantly raise

37:11.663 --> 37:13.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the challenges.

37:13.331 --> 37:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They begin with the fact that,
when it comes
to autism, diagnosis skews
white.

37:18.503 --> 37:21.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Neuropsychologist Laura Anthony
puts it bluntly:

37:21.039 --> 37:25.810 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
LAURA ANTHONY,
Neuropsychologist: If you're
anything other than a 7-year-old
white boy,

37:25.844 --> 37:31.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if you're a 7-year-old
white girl, you're
less likely to be identified
with autism.

37:31.116 --> 37:36.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: It's in the CDC's
own statistics,
where the reported autism rate
among black

37:36.254 --> 37:41.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
8-year-olds, 13.2 kids per every
thousand,
lags the percent of white
8-year-olds by nearly

37:41.993 --> 37:43.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
20 percent.

37:43.294 --> 37:48.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among Latino children, the gap
is even larger,
at 50 percent.

37:48.299 --> 37:52.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anthony is a clinician and
researcher who
works with a lot of kids who
have autism,

37:52.937 --> 37:54.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like 9-year-old Jaja (ph).

37:54.639 --> 37:59.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says the undercounting of
children of
color denies them appropriate
care.

37:59.611 --> 38:05.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happens in part because
autism diagnosis
is a judgment call on a child's
behaviors,

38:05.650 --> 38:07.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and inadvertently:

38:07.452 --> 38:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA ANTHONY: We have a bias,
even though
we don't want to, that that's
what autism

38:12.724 --> 38:13.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looks like.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Jason, in fact,
escaped that
particular bias.

38:17.028 --> 38:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was diagnosed with autism at
18 months,
which is actually early.

38:21.266 --> 38:26.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather, it is another sort of
discrepancy
that has challenged him, which
his mom illustrated

38:26.838 --> 38:31.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by taking us all out on a stroll
to where
the Des Plaines River, north of
Chicago, flows

38:31.976 --> 38:36.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
between two communities,
Maywood, where she
lives to the north, and which is
mostly black,

38:36.481 --> 38:40.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to the south, the mostly
white community
of River Forest.

38:40.785 --> 38:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBRA VINES: Once you're in
River Forest,
the services for the special
needs is like

38:45.623 --> 38:47.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Holy Grail.

38:47.292 --> 38:51.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The services just open up for
special rec,
for education, for advocacy, for
ABA.

38:51.462 --> 38:54.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: So, compared to
that way, where
you live?

38:54.365 --> 38:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEBRA VINES: There's no special
rec this way.

38:56.834 --> 38:57.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oh.

38:57.902 --> 39:02.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a dirty job, but somebody's
got to do
it.

39:02.106 --> 39:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Now, Debra is not a
complainer.

39:05.276 --> 39:07.178 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's an agitator.

39:07.212 --> 39:08.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's a difference.

39:08.980 --> 39:12.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first afternoon we spent
with her, she
was setting the table for a gala
dinner and

39:12.183 --> 39:14.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
auction in support of her own
startup, whose
name is:

39:15.019 --> 39:16.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBRA VINES: The Answer, Inc.

39:16.254 --> 39:18.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: The Answer?

39:18.056 --> 39:22.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBRA VINES: The Answer, because
so many families
are always asking questions, so
we want to

39:22.260 --> 39:23.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be able to provide the answers.

39:23.995 --> 39:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Because she knew,
firsthand,
since Jason was little back in
the 1980s,

39:28.666 --> 39:34.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
just how far behind her
community was in being
able to help people like her
boy.

39:34.772 --> 39:39.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when she had to travel
half-an-hour
by train to get to a support
group, only to

39:39.177 --> 39:40.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
find that:

39:40.311 --> 39:42.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBRA VINES: I was the only
African-American
there.

39:42.580 --> 39:49.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was, I would say,
middle- to upper-class
families, so they would drive a
Mercedes.

39:49.087 --> 39:51.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They would, you know, had on
nice jewelry.

39:51.789 --> 39:59.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had their children with
specialized services,
just an array of things.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I just felt really isolated.

40:02.267 --> 40:04.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Did you get a cold
shoulder?

40:04.269 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBRA VINES: Absolutely not.

40:06.271 --> 40:08.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were very welcoming.

40:08.306 --> 40:14.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess a lot of it might have
been me, the
fact that I had to go outside my
community,

40:14.746 --> 40:17.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then find out that you're
doing it all
wrong, Debra.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're doing it all wrong.

40:18.816 --> 40:20.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's because of where you
live.

40:20.818 --> 40:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Meanwhile, she also
learned that
her own African-American
community wasn't

40:25.790 --> 40:28.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entirely accepting of Jason's
differences.

40:28.459 --> 40:33.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBRA VINES: One particular
church that we
were going to, the pastor came
and told me

40:33.564 --> 40:38.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that a couple of people had come
to him and
said that they were
uncomfortable with Jason

40:38.469 --> 40:44.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
standing up during the sermon,
and being disruptive,
he was being disruptive, and
things like that.

40:44.809 --> 40:50.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And James told me
that isolation
comes also from shame, which he
admitted to

40:50.648 --> 40:54.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feeling, when he started to feel
embarrassed
that his kid wasn't like his
friends' kids.

40:54.886 --> 40:58.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES HARLAN, Father of Jason:
These milestones,
they're talking this, that, and
the other.

40:58.656 --> 40:59.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I said, well, Jason learned
how to tie
his shoes.

40:59.657 --> 41:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then you get these looks.

41:00.892 --> 41:04.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's 7 years old and he just now
learned to
tie his shoes?

41:04.062 --> 41:05.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: What did you feel?

41:05.830 --> 41:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES HARLAN: I literally got a
warm feeling
came all over me from being
embarrassed.

41:09.734 --> 41:14.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what that made me do is kind
of withdraw
myself, you know, being honest,
let me draw

41:14.706 --> 41:15.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wouldn't say anything about by
son.

41:17.175 --> 41:19.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eventually, I quit going to the
sports bar.

41:19.077 --> 41:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: The isolation hit
other families
in the community with autistic
kids.

41:24.048 --> 41:25.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there were many.

41:25.216 --> 41:27.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These are their faces.

41:27.118 --> 41:30.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they were cut off from each
other, instead
of organizing to demand more
support for their

41:30.588 --> 41:35.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
loved ones, as families in white
communities
had been doing for decades.

41:35.727 --> 41:41.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this local state senator,
Kimberly Lightford,
says shame and stigma are only
part of it.

41:41.099 --> 41:46.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY LIGHTFORD, Illinois
State Senator:
I think the connection is just
being underprivileged,

41:46.437 --> 41:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
underutilized, communities of
color not receiving
proper resources, lack of job
opportunities

41:54.545 --> 41:56.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that provide insurance.

41:56.314 --> 42:02.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have families, they just
do enough
to get by, but all of those
essentials, I

42:02.086 --> 42:07.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can't go to the doctor because
I'm on public
assistance, or I can't go to get
this additional

42:07.392 --> 42:10.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
help, just because I feel like I
can't do
it.

42:10.828 --> 42:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: But here's what's
changed around
Maywood.

42:14.165 --> 42:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember that gala that Debra
was setting
up?

42:16.334 --> 42:22.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, now it's the night itself,
where she
showed up, dolled up like it was
the 1920s.

42:22.340 --> 42:23.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So did everybody else.

42:23.674 --> 42:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Harlem Nights was the theme.

42:25.343 --> 42:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBRA VINES: Actually, Jason is
the reason
why The Answer, Incorporated was
started,

42:31.182 --> 42:36.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of Jason, because if I
didn't have
a child with autism, I would
definitely support

42:36.053 --> 42:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the cause, but I don't think I
would be doing
what I'm doing.

42:37.855 --> 42:41.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And these many
families, once
cut off from each other, here,
they were a

42:41.159 --> 42:47.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big family together, out in
public, proud
of who they are, touched by
autism, unburdened

42:47.565 --> 42:51.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by shame, and grateful that
Debra started
The Answer.

42:51.202 --> 42:55.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: It's helped to educate the
community,
police departments, other kids.

42:55.339 --> 42:58.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I feel like I'm not in it
by myself
with The Answer.

42:58.743 --> 43:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Thank God somebody, you
know, especially
a person of color.

43:02.613 --> 43:08.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: There's also a
program called
Just For Men, which James runs.

43:08.085 --> 43:13.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having long since stopped being
embarrassed
by Jason, today, he feels
grateful to have

43:13.157 --> 43:14.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this man as his son.

43:14.959 --> 43:18.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES HARLAN: And I tell the men
at the meeting,
I have learned how to love since
I have had

43:18.329 --> 43:19.297 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Jason.

43:19.330 --> 43:20.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: More than ever
before?

43:20.331 --> 43:21.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES HARLAN: Yes.

43:21.332 --> 43:22.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oh, yes.

43:22.333 --> 43:23.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: How so?

43:23.334 --> 43:24.302 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

43:24.335 --> 43:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES HARLAN: Because he loves
unconditional.

43:25.336 --> 43:28.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's no conditions tied to
his love.

43:28.706 --> 43:34.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: The Answer has
served 4,000 families
in its nine years, but, still,
it's a work

43:34.312 --> 43:38.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in progress.

43:38.382 --> 43:41.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One challenge met, however,
concerns church.

43:41.886 --> 43:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is Jordan Temple Baptist,
whose pastor
Stephen Richardson, says
autistic kids, autistic

43:47.191 --> 43:48.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
adults are all welcome.

43:48.759 --> 43:50.528 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REV.

43:50.561 --> 43:51.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHEN RICHARDSON, Jordan
Temple Baptist:
The fact of the matter is, it's
not our church.

43:51.095 --> 43:52.363 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's God's church.

43:52.396 --> 43:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Which means it's
for Jason and
his family too.

43:56.033 --> 44:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now Sunday's are Jason's
favorite day
of the week, when, walking into
Jordan Temple's

44:01.138 --> 44:11.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foyer, he's greeted like this,
where his face
is all you need to see to know
how he loves,

44:11.449 --> 44:17.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and where, inside, he gets to
act like this,
up and swaying, when everyone
else is praying

44:17.455 --> 44:21.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in their seats, the very
behavior that made
him unwelcomed before.

44:21.192 --> 44:28.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, here, it just doesn't
matter, proving
that acceptance doesn't take a
miracle, not,

44:28.432 --> 44:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perhaps, like getting his face
on the cover
of "GQ," but who knows?

44:32.904 --> 44:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "NewsHour," I'm John
Donvan in Maywood,
Illinois.

44:40.478 --> 44:54.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AUDIE CORNISH: Finally tonight:
1995 was the
year of the largest act of
domestic terrorism

44:54.325 --> 44:56.961 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in U.S. history, the Oklahoma
City bombing.

44:56.994 --> 45:01.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A new documentary premieres
tonight on the
PBS series "American Experience"
and takes

45:01.666 --> 45:05.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a fresh look at that traumatic
event and what
led to it.

45:05.236 --> 45:06.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

45:06.470 --> 45:08.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: There's heavy damage done.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: April 19, 1995.

45:10.274 --> 45:14.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: About a third of the
building has been
blown away.

45:14.545 --> 45:20.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A Ryder rental
truck with 5,000
pounds of explosives ripped
through the Alfred

45:20.451 --> 45:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P. Murrah Federal Building in
Oklahoma City;
168 people were killed, 19
children among

45:26.791 --> 45:27.992 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

45:28.025 --> 45:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Who has come in here and
done this
terrible thing?

45:30.561 --> 45:33.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
BARAK GOODMAN, Director,
"Oklahoma City: I
knew very little of the story.

45:33.230 --> 45:39.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I remember -- like a lot
of people
remember that day, and the image
of that building,

45:39.203 --> 45:43.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, with its face blown
off, an image
that we weren't used to or
accustomed to at

45:43.541 --> 45:45.009 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the time.

45:45.042 --> 45:47.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Barak Goodman is
the director
of the film "Oklahoma City."

45:47.044 --> 45:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARAK GOODMAN: While I think a
lot of people
remember this as a simple story
of a lone

45:51.515 --> 45:55.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorist committing an act, it
actually has
very deep roots.

45:55.620 --> 46:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when we pulled on those
roots, a whole
'nother story sort of appeared.

46:00.124 --> 46:04.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film delves
into the rise
of white nationalist militias in
the 1980s,

46:04.829 --> 46:10.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and two later events that
galvanized the country
and deeply influenced Oklahoma
City bomber

46:10.735 --> 46:20.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Timothy McVeigh: the siege of
Ruby Ridge in
1992, when the FBI and U.S.
Marshals confronted

46:20.244 --> 46:26.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Randy Weaver at his home in
rural Idaho, resulting
in the deaths of Weaver's wife,
son and a

46:26.550 --> 46:33.224 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
U.S. Marshal.

46:33.257 --> 46:38.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the following year, Waco,
Texas, when
federal agents, responding to
reports of weapons

46:38.362 --> 46:43.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stockpiling, attempted to arrest
the leader
of a religious sect known as the
Branch Davidians.

46:43.901 --> 46:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A firefight broke out, killing
10, including
four ATF agents.

46:48.906 --> 46:54.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after a 51-day standoff, the
complex went
up in flames as agents moved in
with tear

46:54.512 --> 46:55.479 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
gas.

46:55.513 --> 46:59.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
More than 70 people died.

46:59.116 --> 47:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the long standoff, then
24-year-old
Army veteran Timothy McVeigh had
been watching

47:04.388 --> 47:06.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nearby.

47:06.223 --> 47:11.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Timothy McVeigh had
already apparently
been very concerned about what
had happened

47:11.228 --> 47:13.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at Ruby Ridge.

47:13.230 --> 47:22.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he came down to Waco and sold
bumper stickers
with pro-gun, anti-government
slogans.

47:22.239 --> 47:30.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He saw the raid as clear
evidence of what
the government would do to try
to confiscate

47:30.448 --> 47:32.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
guns and persecute gun owners.

47:32.583 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Timothy McVeigh
himself wasn't
a member of a militia, but
you're convinced

47:38.756 --> 47:41.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that that context is the way to
understand
him?

47:41.759 --> 47:43.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BARAK GOODMAN: Without question.

47:43.761 --> 47:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McVeigh himself writes -- he
talks in interviews
that we got access to and
tape-recorded interviews

47:50.067 --> 47:56.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the anger he felt, the
rage he felt
at Ruby Ridge in particular, and
Waco, and

47:56.607 --> 48:01.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the radicalization that happened
in part because
of those events, and, in
addition to that,

48:01.112 --> 48:03.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a series of other exposures to
this movement.

48:04.014 --> 48:06.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"The Turner Diaries" was his
bible.

48:06.183 --> 48:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The Turner Diaries" is a
horrible novel,
racist novel that became a --
it's almost

48:12.723 --> 48:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a talisman to this movement, a
very important
motivating force.

48:17.194 --> 48:20.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think it actually
describes the bombing
of an FBI building in
Washington.

48:20.431 --> 48:21.632 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's even a
model.

48:21.665 --> 48:23.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BARAK GOODMAN: It describes the
kind of bomb.

48:23.734 --> 48:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very similar to the one
McVeigh used.

48:25.469 --> 48:29.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he was steeped in the ideas
of this movement.

48:29.140 --> 48:31.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was steeped in the ideology.

48:31.475 --> 48:32.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a very diffuse movement.

48:32.810 --> 48:35.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And being a member of a militia
is really
sort of irrelevant.

48:35.379 --> 48:39.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JERRY FLOWERS, Police Inspector:
We could
hear people screaming.

48:39.383 --> 48:40.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We could hear them screaming.

48:40.384 --> 48:41.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We could hear them crying.

48:41.485 --> 48:43.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You just couldn't see them
because it was
so dark.

48:43.521 --> 48:47.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The documentary
breaks often
from that history to return to
the bombing

48:47.925 --> 48:52.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
itself, talking with
eyewitnesses who still
hold painful memories.

48:52.163 --> 48:53.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: They had no idea.

48:53.931 --> 48:58.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It shows how much
confusion
there was initially about who
had carried

48:58.335 --> 49:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it out, and the surprise when
McVeigh was
arrested.

49:01.305 --> 49:05.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I think everybody felt this
sudden sense
of betrayal.

49:05.442 --> 49:08.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think everyone thought, you're
one of us.

49:08.112 --> 49:11.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARAK GOODMAN: People forget
that, in the
days and hours after the
bombing, everyone

49:11.982 --> 49:14.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assumed it had been Middle
Eastern terrorism.

49:14.285 --> 49:20.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was bandied about on
national television
and CNN and CBS and all the
networks.

49:20.457 --> 49:23.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were all focused on Middle
Eastern terrorism.

49:23.360 --> 49:26.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And their sources were telling
them that it
was likely a Middle Eastern
terrorist.

49:26.430 --> 49:31.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film also
shows the role
conspiracy theories about Waco
and Ruby Ridge

49:31.468 --> 49:34.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
played in roiling this
right-wing movement.

49:34.405 --> 49:36.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some will no doubt see parallels
to today.

49:36.874 --> 49:38.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Goodman takes a longer view.

49:38.776 --> 49:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARAK GOODMAN: I would say that
this is a
movement that waxes and wanes
throughout American

49:42.546 --> 49:47.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history and sort of appears in
different forms,
whether it's going back to
Shays' Rebellion

49:47.785 --> 49:53.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the beginning of the history
of our country,
up through the Red Scare, the
Klan years.

49:53.290 --> 49:55.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a lot of different
manifestations.

49:55.359 --> 49:58.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what unites all of it are
two things,
really.

49:58.762 --> 50:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is a deep enmity towards the
federal government,
a feeling that the federal
government is the

50:02.700 --> 50:09.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seed of all evil and it's a tool
in the hands
of enemies, like the Jews, like
blacks, like

50:09.373 --> 50:11.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the U.N. now.

50:11.175 --> 50:14.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other thing that really
characterizes
it is sort of conspiratorial
thinking, that

50:14.879 --> 50:19.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- a way of connecting dots that
places movement
in a kind of context of a war.

50:19.683 --> 50:25.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERRY NOBLE, Former Militia
Member: And in
this war, it's an all or
nothing.

50:25.489 --> 50:32.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We are either going to win as
the white race,
or we're going to lose.

50:32.696 --> 50:38.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Despite the
theories of a larger
conspiracy at work, the film
shows how McVeigh,

50:38.202 --> 50:41.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with some help from two friends,
was able
to pull off the bombing.

50:41.839 --> 50:46.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did you come to any conclusions
about how
this act of domestic terrorism
changed the

50:46.677 --> 50:49.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country or changed our sense of
our own security,
ourselves?

50:49.280 --> 50:53.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARAK GOODMAN: I think it had a
tremendously
transformative effect.

50:53.851 --> 50:58.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, first of all, for law
enforcement,
there was never again a naivete
about the

50:58.889 --> 51:00.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
threat from domestic terrorism.

51:00.658 --> 51:05.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, if you went to the FBI
today and
you really talked to people,
unlike perhaps

51:05.529 --> 51:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some politicians, they are very
focused on
the threat from domestic
terrorism.

51:09.800 --> 51:13.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They understand it and they're
paying attention
to it.

51:13.270 --> 51:19.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, just for the
ordinary citizen,
although this movement is so --
kind of oscillates.

51:19.510 --> 51:25.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sort of can, and it did after
Oklahoma
City, retreat and recede, that
we sometimes

51:25.282 --> 51:27.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
forget about it.

51:27.051 --> 51:28.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's still there.

51:28.052 --> 51:29.320 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It never goes away.

51:29.353 --> 51:30.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then it will come back.

51:30.888 --> 51:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, in recent years,
you have seen
more and more of an uptick.

51:34.091 --> 51:39.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dylann Roof in Charleston and
any number of
other such actions are no longer
quite as

51:39.763 --> 51:41.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shocking.

51:41.131 --> 51:45.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We understand that this is part
now of a motif
in American life.

51:45.302 --> 51:50.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that the recent
incarnation of
that started with Oklahoma City
and Timothy

51:50.341 --> 51:51.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
McVeigh.

Brown for the "PBS NewsHour."

now: President Trump's flurry of
executive

52:03.988 --> 52:08.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
orders and actions have
generated a lot of
attention and some confusion.

52:08.225 --> 52:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you know the difference
between an executive
order and a presidential
memorandum, or which

52:14.064 --> 52:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president signed the most
executive orders?

of stories.

52:29.113 --> 52:32.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
