CAPTURED IT THREE YEARS AGO.

00:07.874 --> 00:09.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HAS BEEN DECLARED OVER THE

CALIPHATE.

00:39.572 --> 00:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WERE JUST THERE IN MOSUL

00:41.274 --> 00:42.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YESTERDAY.

00:42.308 --> 00:43.510 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S IT LOOK LIKE?

00:43.510 --> 00:44.811 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> FIGHTING IS ONGOING IN THE

00:44.811 --> 00:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OLD CITY OF MOSUL, WHICH IS A

00:46.179 --> 00:48.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CENTURIES-OLD DISTRICT OF THE

00:48.415 --> 00:49.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITY.

00:49.349 --> 00:51.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS THE LAST AREA OF MOSUL

00:51.418 --> 00:53.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE ISLAMIC STATE STILL HAS

00:53.319 --> 00:54.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PRESENCE IN.

00:54.454 --> 00:55.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S GOING TO BE PRETTY GRIM.

00:55.622 --> 00:57.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY NARROW ALLEYWAYS AND, YOU

00:57.924 --> 00:59.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, FIGHTING THAT GETS VERY

00:59.959 --> 01:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLOSE...VERY CLOSE COMBAT.

01:02.162 --> 01:02.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: TELL ME ABOUT

01:02.862 --> 01:04.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CIVILIANS THAT YOU SAW

01:04.097 --> 01:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE, THE ONES THAT WERE

01:05.598 --> 01:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLEEING.

01:06.666 --> 01:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, WE WERE AT THE SITE OF

01:10.570 --> 01:12.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GRAND MOSQUE IN THE HEART OF

01:12.906 --> 01:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OLD CITY, WHICH IS WHERE

01:15.508 --> 01:17.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISLAMIC STATE LEADER, ABU BAKR

01:17.310 --> 01:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AL-BAGHDADI, MADE HIS APPEARANCE

01:19.379 --> 01:20.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE YEARS AGO.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THIS IS WHERE WE SAW

01:21.581 --> 01:23.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIVILIANS STREAMING OUT.

01:23.349 --> 01:25.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS A FEW DOZEN THAT WE SAW,

01:25.452 --> 01:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I LATER HEARD THAT IT WAS

01:27.153 --> 01:29.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY 3,000 OVERALL YESTERDAY

01:29.289 --> 01:30.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT... THAT LEFT THE OLD CITY.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY WERE COMING OUT IN A

01:32.826 --> 01:35.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY DESPERATE STATE.

01:35.161 --> 01:36.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'VE SEEN THOUSANDS AND

01:36.863 --> 01:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS FLEEING

01:38.631 --> 01:39.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSUL FOR THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS,

01:39.799 --> 01:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THESE WERE BY FAR THE

01:42.702 --> 01:44.838 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORST...IN WORST CONDITION.

01:44.838 --> 01:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHY WOULD THEY

01:45.538 --> 01:46.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STAY THERE AS LONG AS THEY DID?

01:46.973 --> 01:48.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, WERE SOME OF THEM BEING

01:48.241 --> 01:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL AS HUMAN

01:49.943 --> 01:51.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHIELDS?

01:51.010 --> 01:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE ISLAMIC STATE HAS

01:51.744 --> 01:53.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN USING CIVILIANS AS... AS

01:53.012 --> 01:54.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMAN SHIELDS THIS ENTIRE TIME,

01:54.814 --> 01:56.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE ENTIRE BATTLE.

01:56.883 --> 01:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT THE IRAQI

01:59.686 --> 02:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES-- AND ESPECIALLY THE

02:00.887 --> 02:01.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNATIONAL COALITION BACKING

02:01.921 --> 02:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM-- IS DOING EVERYTHING THEY

02:03.456 --> 02:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN TO PREVENT CIVILIAN

02:05.058 --> 02:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CASUALTIES, SO THEY'LL OFTEN

02:07.594 --> 02:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCE CIVILIANS TO STAY IN THE

02:09.262 --> 02:10.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOWER GROUNDS OF A BUILDING AND

02:10.463 --> 02:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN PUT A SNIPER ON TOP SO THAT

02:12.732 --> 02:14.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SNIPER IS... IS IN SOME

02:14.601 --> 02:16.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAYS PROTECTED FROM MORTAR

02:16.569 --> 02:17.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKS OR AIR STRIKES.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.371 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: TELL US A LITTLE

02:18.371 --> 02:19.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIT ABOUT THIS MOSQUE AND WHY

02:19.973 --> 02:21.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S SUCH AN IMPORTANT SYMBOL

02:21.741 --> 02:22.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

02:22.575 --> 02:24.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE GRAND NURI MOSQUE IS AT

02:24.077 --> 02:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CENTER OF THE OLD CITY,AND

02:25.311 --> 02:26.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT HAS BEEN AROUND... WHICH IS

02:26.613 --> 02:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
840 YEARS OLD, WHICH IS... IS

02:29.082 --> 02:30.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEANING, SORT OF LIKE THE

02:30.216 --> 02:31.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEANING TOWER OF PISA.

02:31.851 --> 02:34.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DUE TO, WE THINK, STRUCTURAL

02:34.053 --> 02:37.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBLEMS, IT BEGAN LEANING VERY

02:37.657 --> 02:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOON AFTER CONSTRUCTION.

02:38.591 --> 02:40.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THIS IS AN ICONIC SITE IN

02:40.326 --> 02:41.161 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOSUL.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS ALSO WHERE ISLAMIC STATE

02:43.997 --> 02:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADER ABU BAKR AL-BAGHDADI CAME

02:47.233 --> 02:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN JULY 2014 AND MADE THIS...

02:50.370 --> 02:51.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY THE ONLY PUBLIC

02:51.137 --> 02:52.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPEARANCE THAT WE KNOW OF,

02:52.505 --> 02:54.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONFIRMED PUBLIC APPEARANCE, AND

02:54.674 --> 02:55.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROCLAIMED HIMSELF THE CALIPH,

02:55.909 --> 02:58.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE LEADER OF THE ISLAMIC STATE.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE HE CAME.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE IRAQI FORCES WERE HOPING

03:01.881 --> 03:03.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET TO THIS SITE, TAKE DOWN

03:03.917 --> 03:05.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE... THE BLACK ISIS FLAG THAT

03:05.718 --> 03:06.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN HANGING THERE FOR THE

03:06.619 --> 03:08.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAST THREE YEARS, AND STRING UP

03:08.054 --> 03:10.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE... THE TRI-COLOR IRAQI FLAG

03:10.690 --> 03:13.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS A REALLY SYMBOLIC SIGN OF

03:13.259 --> 03:13.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VICTORY.

03:13.993 --> 03:15.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT

03:15.195 --> 03:16.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE, JUST OVER A WEEK AGO

03:16.829 --> 03:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW, THE ISLAMIC STATE RIGGED

03:18.865 --> 03:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE... THE ENTIRE COMPLEX WITH

03:20.266 --> 03:22.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPLOSIVES AND BLEW IT UP.

03:22.402 --> 03:24.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONLY PART OF THE MOSQUE THAT

03:24.204 --> 03:25.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS STILL INTACT WAS THE... THE

03:25.939 --> 03:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOME UNDER WHICH BAGHDADI STOOD

03:28.975 --> 03:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MADE THAT MESSAGE THREE

03:30.476 --> 03:31.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS AGO.

03:31.244 --> 03:31.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: NOW, THE IRAQI

03:31.945 --> 03:33.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES THAT YOU SPEAK TO, WHAT'S

03:33.880 --> 03:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NEXT STEP?

03:35.481 --> 03:36.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S SAY, BEST-CASE SCENARIO,

03:36.583 --> 03:38.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY RETAKE THE CITY; IT'S IN

03:38.451 --> 03:39.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUINS RIGHT NOW.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

03:41.921 --> 03:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN MOSUL IS

03:43.356 --> 03:44.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY HEAVILY DAMAGED.

03:44.924 --> 03:46.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHERE THERE IS ELECTRICITY AND

03:46.593 --> 03:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WATER, IT'S USUALLY PROVIDED BY

03:49.729 --> 03:53.099 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GENERATORS OR WATER TRUCKS.

03:53.099 --> 03:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT

03:54.033 --> 03:54.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, THE BATTLE CONTINUES, AND

03:56.903 --> 03:59.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY AND STABILITY--

03:59.005 --> 04:00.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAINTAINING THAT-- REALLY, IS

04:00.740 --> 04:02.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO BE A... A TRICK FOR THE

04:02.375 --> 04:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY FORCES, AS WELL.

04:04.444 --> 04:08.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE ALMOST 100% SURE THAT THE

04:08.414 --> 04:10.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISLAMIC STATE HAS LEFT SLEEPER

04:10.750 --> 04:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CELLS, THAT... THAT SOME OF

04:11.651 --> 04:13.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR FIGHTERS HAVE BLENDED IN

04:13.019 --> 04:14.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE CIVILAIAN POPULATION.
