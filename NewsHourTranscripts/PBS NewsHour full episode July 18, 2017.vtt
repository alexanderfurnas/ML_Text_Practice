JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.300 --> 00:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.300 --> 00:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:09.366 --> 00:10.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of
the United States: I would say
I'm disappointed in what took

00:10.000 --> 00:11.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place.

00:11.933 --> 00:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
showdown over health care
reaches a fever pitch.

00:14.533 --> 00:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump slams Senate
Republicans, who can't win
enough support to replace or

00:20.400 --> 00:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
repeal the Affordable Care Act.

00:22.300 --> 00:26.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then: another Obama-era
legacy left standing.

00:26.366 --> 00:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Trump administration
reluctantly certifies
Iran's compliance with
the nuclear deal, but

00:32.800 --> 00:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
adds new sanctions over its
ballistic missile program.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And defying the odds.

00:37.933 --> 00:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
An all-girls team from
Afghanistan competes
in a robotics contest
after being denied entry

00:44.700 --> 00:47.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the U.S. twice.

00:47.233 --> 00:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN, Student
(through translator): I
want to show the world
what Afghan girls,

00:49.833 --> 00:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or young girls, can do.

00:51.666 --> 00:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can show them, when we have
a creative idea, we can do it.

00:55.133 --> 00:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:58.700 --> 01:02.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:02.866 --> 01:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The latest Senate
Republican push to replace
the Affordable Care Act has

01:15.000 --> 01:16.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come to nothing.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now party leaders say they
will try for just repeal.

01:20.133 --> 01:23.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins begins
our coverage of the past
tumultuous 24 hours.

01:23.866 --> 01:25.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:25.900 --> 01:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), Majority
Leader: I regret that the
effort to repeal and immediately

01:28.233 --> 01:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
replace the failures
of Obamacare will
not be successful.

01:32.533 --> 01:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A remarkable
statement and a bitter admission
for Senate Majority Leader

01:39.500 --> 01:42.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mitch McConnell, that
Republicans still can't
muster the votes on
a health care bill.

01:44.500 --> 01:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It became clear last night,
after Utah's Mike Lee and Jerry
Moran of Kansas said they'd

01:48.633 --> 01:50.566 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
vote against the
revised version.

01:50.566 --> 01:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With that, McConnell
changed course, and decided
to go for pure repeal.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL: A majority
of the Senate voted to pass
the same repeal legislation

01:57.533 --> 02:00.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back in 2015.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Obama vetoed it then.

02:03.066 --> 02:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Trump -- President
Trump will sign it now.

02:06.500 --> 02:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: McConnell
proposed delaying the effective
date of repeal for two years,

02:12.633 --> 02:14.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so both parties can
work out a replacement.

02:14.666 --> 02:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, almost immediately, three
Republicans came out as no's
to McConnell's idea That's

02:20.333 --> 02:22.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
enough to kill it.

02:22.833 --> 02:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska,
Shelley Moore Capito
of West Virginia, and
Susan Collins of Maine

02:26.600 --> 02:31.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all said it is too risky
to repeal without an
immediate plan for what next.

02:31.366 --> 02:33.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:33.433 --> 02:37.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN COLLINS (R), Maine: I
do not think it is going to be
constructive to repeal a law

02:39.300 --> 02:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, at this point, is so
interwoven in our health care
system, and then hope that, over

02:45.933 --> 02:50.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the next two years, we
will come up with some
kind of replacement.

02:50.166 --> 02:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the same
time, Democrats are flexing
their muscles against repeal.

02:55.166 --> 02:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Minority Leader Chuck Schumer:

02:56.233 --> 02:58.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:58.433 --> 03:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY),
Minority Leader: Passing
repeal now is not a door
to bipartisan solutions,

03:03.400 --> 03:05.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as the majority leader
suggested this morning.

03:05.100 --> 03:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rather, it is a disaster.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The door to bipartisanship
is open right now.

03:11.666 --> 03:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not with repeal, but
with an effort to improve
the existing system.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Even
though it seems certain
to fail, Republican
leaders said they're going

03:21.100 --> 03:24.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to press forward and hold
a vote some time soon.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:25.766 --> 03:27.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MITCH MCCONNELL: Well,
I think we will have
to see what happens.

03:27.933 --> 03:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will have demonstrated that
Republicans by themselves are
not prepared at this point

03:36.366 --> 03:38.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do a replacement.

03:38.066 --> 03:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
We're not going own it.

03:39.400 --> 03:41.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm not going to own it.

03:41.433 --> 03:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the White
House, President Trump was left
lamenting the latest health

03:43.533 --> 03:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care failure, and insisting
the fault lies elsewhere.

03:46.766 --> 03:51.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: For seven years,
I have been hearing repeal
and replace from Congress.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I have been hearing
it loud and strong.

03:53.400 --> 03:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, when we finally get
a chance to repeal and replace,
they don't take advantage

03:57.700 --> 03:59.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will let Obamacare fail, and
then the Democrats are going
to come to us and they're going

04:02.300 --> 04:04.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to say, how do we fix
it, how do we fix it?

04:04.500 --> 04:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As recently
as yesterday, Mr. Trump sounded
more confident, in a quick

04:10.366 --> 04:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aside to Vice President Pence.

04:11.633 --> 04:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: We're
getting it together.

04:13.833 --> 04:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's going to
happen, right, Mike?

04:16.466 --> 04:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States: Yes, sir.

04:18.400 --> 04:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I think.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

04:21.466 --> 04:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Mr. Trump has
repeatedly said he's willing
to sign a repeal-only bill.

04:24.333 --> 04:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The vice president, who spent
much of the day on Capitol
Hill, urged lawmakers to do

04:28.800 --> 04:30.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
something.

04:30.033 --> 04:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE: Inaction
is not an option.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Congress needs to step up.

04:34.733 --> 04:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress needs to do
their job, and Congress
needs to do their job now.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: House
Speaker Paul Ryan sounded
a similar note, and also
said the House bill,

04:47.333 --> 04:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which repeals and replaces
Obamacare simultaneously,
is still -- quote --
"the best way to go."

04:50.433 --> 04:52.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: Well, we'd like to see
the Senate move on something.

04:54.533 --> 04:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And House
Budget Committee Chair Diane
Black joined the chorus urging

04:57.233 --> 04:58.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Senate to act.

04:58.233 --> 05:00.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:00.366 --> 05:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE BLACK (R), Tennessee:
We're going to be eternally
optimistic that the Senate is

05:01.300 --> 05:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to get their work done.

05:03.400 --> 05:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Meanwhile, a
bipartisan group of 11 governors
called for the Senate to reject

05:07.533 --> 05:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
efforts to repeal Obamacare
now and replace it later.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, when we will see the
next votes in the Senate?

05:14.633 --> 05:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator John Cornyn, the number
two Republican in the Senate,
told my colleague Ellis Kim

05:18.300 --> 05:21.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
(ph) and some other reporters
tonight he expects that
vote this week -- Judy.

05:21.933 --> 05:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa,
from what you're reporting, it
doesn't sound like they have

05:25.033 --> 05:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the votes to pass
repeal, so what are they
going to do after that?

05:28.300 --> 05:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right,
it's fascinating.

05:30.366 --> 05:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're frantic to take a vote
now that likely will fail and
looks it like, Judy, after that,

05:36.433 --> 05:39.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they're ready for a
180-degree turn to move
from this closed-door
process they have had

05:39.366 --> 05:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
until now for the past seven
months to a more open, public,
kind of regular process that,

05:44.166 --> 05:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as it's known here in the
Senate, with committee hearings.

05:46.966 --> 05:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late tonight, the chairman
of the Health Committee
here in the Senate, Senator
Alexander, announced

05:51.466 --> 05:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he does plan to holding
open hearings on health
care and stabilizing
the markets, regardless

05:56.200 --> 05:58.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the vote.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Judy, it's worth noting
those three senators who are the
no votes, who are essentially

06:00.433 --> 06:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
blocking this latest effort from
Mr. McConnell, they're are all
senators who were not included

06:06.266 --> 06:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the closed-door meetings.

06:08.266 --> 06:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those female senators now
saying they think it should have
been open like this all along.

06:11.033 --> 06:15.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
Lisa, this is a big
hit for the Republicans
in the Senate and the

06:15.733 --> 06:16.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Congress overall.

06:16.966 --> 06:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are they saying to you?

06:18.200 --> 06:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do they feel about this?

06:19.533 --> 06:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
They're very raw, Judy.

06:21.133 --> 06:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One of them told me that
they're just exhausted.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another said today's meeting
of all Republican senators
was -- quote -- "robust."

06:27.900 --> 06:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Translation of that,
Judy, it was tense.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is some real fear
about what this means for
their elections next year.

06:33.933 --> 06:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are real questions
about what it means to hold a
vote that is likely to fail.

06:38.033 --> 06:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why are they doing that?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why does Mitch McConnell
want to hold the vote?

06:41.700 --> 06:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, the theory is that he
wants to show who is to blame
for blocking their repeal

06:48.633 --> 06:51.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efforts and to say they gave
it their best try, but that
idea could, of course, ricochet

06:51.566 --> 06:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and harm some of their
senators as well.

06:53.633 --> 06:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what about
Majority Leader McConnell?

06:57.333 --> 06:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is his standing
secure after all this?

06:59.966 --> 07:03.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Well,
one senator, Ron Johnson
of Wisconsin, made an
extraordinary statement

07:03.400 --> 07:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, saying he doesn't have
confidence in Mitch McConnell
anymore and doesn't trust

07:07.933 --> 07:08.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his leadership.

07:08.933 --> 07:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But, Judy, he was an exception.

07:11.000 --> 07:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other senators, including
Lisa Murkowski, told me they
do have confidence in him.

07:14.666 --> 07:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She gave a great quote
today, Judy, to us.

07:16.733 --> 07:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said that Mitch McConnell
is trying to keep the frogs
in the wheelbarrow and doing

07:21.133 --> 07:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as well as he can.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fascinating, because she's one
of the frogs that actually has
jumped out of that wheelbarrow,

07:26.166 --> 07:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it looks like for now
his leadership will stay
and he will stay in power.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I
like the metaphor.

07:33.633 --> 07:37.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa, what does all this
mean for health care?

07:37.133 --> 07:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because the Republicans have run
several plans up the flagpole.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They haven't passed.

07:43.933 --> 07:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do they stand?

07:44.933 --> 07:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where do we stand?

07:45.933 --> 07:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was the fifth draft, maybe
the sixth draft, depending
on how you count it this

07:49.233 --> 07:51.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's just get to some
bottom lines for what we're
doling with now as Americans.

07:53.400 --> 07:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looks like now the effort to
have massive Medicaid reform,
large-scale cuts in the numbers

08:00.100 --> 08:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of Medicaid recipients
in the future, that
effort now seems dead.

08:02.133 --> 08:05.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
However, the fate of
the Medicaid expansion
under Medicaid -- under
the Obamacare, that

08:08.933 --> 08:10.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is not clear.

08:10.200 --> 08:11.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will have to see what
happens in negotiations.

08:11.766 --> 08:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, overall, Medicaid itself
will largely stay as it is now.

08:16.100 --> 08:21.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also, the idea of repealing
Obamacare wholesale, that
seems unlikely to happen.

08:23.033 --> 08:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see what happens in
the next vote but it seems most
likely, Judy, that Obamacare

08:25.633 --> 08:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will stay largely within the
framework it has now and that
the discussion will shift

08:32.200 --> 08:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to how to fix it and
how to stabilize markets
within that framework.

08:34.466 --> 08:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this -- you
and I were talking earlier,
this will have an effect

08:38.733 --> 08:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the larger Republican
leadership agenda as well.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
Oh, a huge effect.

08:45.900 --> 08:50.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're hoping that it will not
be catastrophic, but now they
are jammed up against some very,

08:50.100 --> 08:52.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
very limited time on
the calendar, Judy.

08:52.566 --> 08:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have some must-do
things like passing
spending bills, which,
as we know, is never

08:56.266 --> 09:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
easy, but also a debt ceiling
limit that must be raised some
time in the next few months.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And in addition to
that, they are trying to
still pursue tax reform.

09:04.733 --> 09:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is a once-in-a-generation
kind of achievement.

09:07.700 --> 09:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're trying to do it in
this very kind of caustic,
sharp environment with health

09:12.533 --> 09:14.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
care still waiting.

09:14.566 --> 09:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's unclear about what
of that will happen or when it
can all happen, but Republicans

09:18.533 --> 09:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say they're still going to try.

09:20.600 --> 09:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in just a
few seconds, Lisa, you were also
telling us today the Republicans

09:24.300 --> 09:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the House rolled
out their budget.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is something not to be
missed and would be a headline
probably in most other weeks,

09:30.333 --> 09:32.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but that's right.

09:32.266 --> 09:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This Republican budget document
is just a starting step in
spending process, but it's

09:35.366 --> 09:37.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
important, Judy because
they're doing something
very new this year.

09:37.900 --> 09:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are proposing cutting not
just discretionary subjects,
which are your usual government

09:44.933 --> 09:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
agencies we talk about,
education and so forth,
but they want to cut
mandatory programs as

09:48.866 --> 09:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
well in their budget.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are things like Social
Security, Medicare, food stamps.

09:52.466 --> 09:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to use those cuts
in those mandatory programs to
help things like the defense and

09:57.300 --> 09:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also for tax cuts, so
something to watch.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's
a lot to watch.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins, thank
you for being our eyes
and ears at the Capitol.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We thank you.

10:07.333 --> 10:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the day's other news:
It turns out that there was
an eighth person present when

10:10.900 --> 10:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump Jr. met with a
Russian lawyer last summer.

10:14.233 --> 10:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Washington Post
and others identify the
person as Ike Kaveladze.

10:18.733 --> 10:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He works for the Russian
real estate developer whose
son suggested the meeting.

10:23.133 --> 10:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's son
acknowledges that he
accepted because damaging
information was promised

10:27.933 --> 10:30.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Hillary Clinton.

10:30.233 --> 10:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reports this evening say that
President Trump and Russian
President Vladimir Putin had a

10:34.633 --> 10:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
second meeting at the G20 summit
in Paris earlier this month.

10:39.233 --> 10:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is in addition to the
more-than-two-hour session they
held that was widely publicized.

10:45.733 --> 10:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The second meeting had not
been disclosed previously.

10:48.166 --> 10:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. Treasury Department
slapped new sanctions
today on 18 individuals
and groups tied to

10:53.733 --> 10:56.300 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Iran's ballistic
missile program.

10:56.300 --> 11:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It came hours after the State
Department again certified
that Iran is complying with the

11:02.700 --> 11:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
letter of its nuclear deal,
but not with the spirit.

11:04.333 --> 11:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have a full report
later in the program.

11:07.900 --> 11:12.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Eastern Ukraine,
Russian-backed separatists
have proclaimed the
formation of a new state.

11:12.700 --> 11:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rebel leaders said today that
the new state will include
areas they already control and

11:17.633 --> 11:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ultimately the rest of Ukraine.

11:20.200 --> 11:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Ukrainian President
Poroshenko, during
a visit to Georgia,
dismissed the declaration

11:26.533 --> 11:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and called the separatists
puppets of Russia.

11:28.433 --> 11:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETRO POROSHENKO, Ukrainian
President: They are
not political figures.

11:31.066 --> 11:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are confident that we
reintegrate the Donbass,
we reintegrate the Crimea,
and we renew sovereignty

11:41.333 --> 11:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and territorial integrity,
no matter what Russia said.

11:45.133 --> 11:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The announcement
casts more doubt on the
future of the 2015 cease-fire.

11:49.533 --> 11:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China warned today of an all-
out confrontation with India
in a growing border dispute in

11:55.566 --> 11:57.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Himalayas.

11:57.700 --> 12:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each side accuses the other
of building up troops along a
contested region between China

12:01.533 --> 12:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and Bhutan, an ally of India.

12:03.733 --> 12:08.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The confrontation flared
recently after Indian
troops stopped Chinese
workers from building

12:09.833 --> 12:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a road in the area.

12:11.833 --> 12:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, officials
today dropped two high-profile
cases involving shootings

12:17.200 --> 12:19.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by police.

12:19.133 --> 12:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Cincinnati prosecutor
announced that he will not retry
former university policeman

12:24.266 --> 12:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ray Tensing for a third time.

12:26.700 --> 12:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tensing was accused of murder
and manslaughter in the killing
of a black motorist, Sam Dubose,

12:32.433 --> 12:33.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during a traffic stop.

12:33.700 --> 12:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Two previous trials
ended in hung juries.

12:36.600 --> 12:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE DETERS, Prosecutor: After
discussing this matter with
multiple jurors, both black and

12:44.466 --> 12:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white, and they have, to a
person, said to us that we
will never get a conviction in

12:53.733 --> 12:55.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this case.

12:55.800 --> 12:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Separately,
in Albuquerque, New Mexico,
federal prosecutors closed the

12:58.700 --> 13:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civil rights investigation
into the death of James Boyd,
a homeless man killed by police

13:04.266 --> 13:06.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2014.

13:06.200 --> 13:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They cited lack of evidence.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
California's signature climate
initiative will stay in force
through at least the year

13:14.066 --> 13:15.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2030.

13:15.733 --> 13:19.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
State lawmakers voted
on Monday to extend the
cap-and-trade program.

13:19.600 --> 13:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It limits carbon emissions
and lets polluters trade
or buy emissions permits.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The program had been
set to end in 2020.

13:28.666 --> 13:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
55 points to close at 21574.

13:35.533 --> 13:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq rose nearly
30 points, and the S&amp;P
500 added one point.

13:42.533 --> 13:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's word that
China is censoring Winnie
the Pooh on social media.

13:45.600 --> 13:50.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is aimed at comic
comparisons of the pudgy bear
with President Xi Jinping.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The forbidden list now includes
widely circulated images of Xi
strolling with then-President

13:58.566 --> 14:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obama in 2013 juxtaposed with
Winnie the Pooh and Tigger,
and, from 2014, Xi shaking hands

14:05.700 --> 14:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Japanese Prime
Minister Abe, alongside an
image of Pooh and Eeyore.

14:11.300 --> 14:13.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who knew?

14:13.300 --> 14:17.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
I talk with Senator Bernie
Sanders about what's next for

14:17.333 --> 14:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Affordable Care Act; the
White House slaps new sanctions
on Iran; we catch up with the

14:24.366 --> 14:28.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Afghan girls robotics team
initially banned from coming
to the U.S.; and much more.

14:39.633 --> 14:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The collapse of the Republicans'
push on health care raises
serious questions about the road

14:44.533 --> 14:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ahead for reform, key
among them, will the
Democrats come to the table?

14:49.266 --> 14:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To explore that and more,
we are joined now by Senator
Bernie Sanders of Vermont.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is the ranking member on
the Senate Budget Committee.

14:56.566 --> 14:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome back to the
"NewsHour," Senator Sanders.

14:58.800 --> 15:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, what happened to your
Republican colleagues?

15:01.066 --> 15:02.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What went wrong?

15:02.066 --> 15:04.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:04.133 --> 15:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS (I), Vermont:
Well, what went wrong, Judy, is
they brought forth a disastrous

15:06.200 --> 15:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care bill that had the
support of all of 12 percent
of the American people, that

15:13.066 --> 15:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was opposed by the American
Medical Association,
the American Hospital
Association, the AARP.

15:19.866 --> 15:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And virtually every national
health care organization
understood that, when
you throw 22 million

15:27.700 --> 15:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people off of health insurance,
when you cut Medicaid by $800
billion, when you raise premiums

15:34.733 --> 15:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for older workers, when you
defund Planned Parenthood, and
you make it almost impossible

15:40.800 --> 15:43.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for people with preexisting
conditions to get the health
care they need and can afford,

15:43.966 --> 15:45.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you know what?

15:45.633 --> 15:46.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You have got a bill
that's a stinker, it
shouldn't go anyplace.

15:46.966 --> 15:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it didn't go anyplace.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's a good thing
for the American people.

15:50.900 --> 15:55.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I thank the millions
of people who stood up
and fought back and said
that that legislation

15:57.066 --> 15:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is not what this
country is about.

15:59.166 --> 16:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when the
president -- he did criticize
today the Republicans, but he

16:02.166 --> 16:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
also blamed Democrats
and he said Democrats
are obstructionists.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're only about obstructing.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:09.333 --> 16:12.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well, if he
wants to blame me for helping
kill that bill, I accept that

16:12.566 --> 16:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
responsibility completely.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This bill was an
absolute disaster.

16:17.400 --> 16:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its goal was primarily to give
tax breaks to the rich and
to large corporations, rather

16:23.833 --> 16:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than to address the needs
of the American people.

16:25.933 --> 16:29.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the president wants
to blame me and anyone
else for preventing 22
million Americans losing

16:30.766 --> 16:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
their health insurance,
I accept that criticism.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So,
we're hearing, Senator
- - our Lisa Desjardins
was reporting the plan

16:35.666 --> 16:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now is if the vote for a pure
repeal goes down, which it's
expected to, the next step

16:42.666 --> 16:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is to go to committees, go
back to what is called regular
order, to work with Democrats.

16:46.033 --> 16:49.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Are you and others
Democrats prepared to
work with Republicans?

16:49.066 --> 16:50.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:50.066 --> 16:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Of course.

16:52.200 --> 16:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why not -- look, nobody
has said, Judy, that the
Affordable Care Act is
anywhere near perfect.

16:55.500 --> 16:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It did add 20 million
more people to the
ranks of the insured.

16:59.233 --> 17:00.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's good.

17:00.433 --> 17:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Deductibles, however,
are too high.

17:02.966 --> 17:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Co-payments are too high.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Premiums are too high.

17:06.766 --> 17:10.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we pay by far the highest
in the world for prescription
drugs, getting ripped off

17:12.000 --> 17:14.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
every day by the
pharmaceutical industry.

17:14.066 --> 17:18.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if the Republicans want
to sit town and say how do we
improve the Affordable Care

17:20.066 --> 17:23.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Act, not destroy it, how
do we improve it, let's
go forward and do that.

17:23.200 --> 17:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have some very
specific ideas on that.

17:25.333 --> 17:28.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
let's talk about that,
because, realistically,
you know where many

17:28.433 --> 17:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Republicans are.

17:29.833 --> 17:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know where the Democrats,
you and others, are.

17:32.166 --> 17:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where's the middle ground here?

17:33.866 --> 17:35.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Where do you see a
place for compromise?

17:35.366 --> 17:36.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:36.566 --> 17:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS:
Well, I'll tell you.

17:38.633 --> 17:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As I just mentioned, the cost
of prescription drugs in this
country is far, far higher than

17:41.700 --> 17:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in any other country.

17:43.733 --> 17:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You may recall that Donald Trump
as a candidate for president
talked about how he was going

17:48.066 --> 17:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to take on the pharmaceutical
industry and it was going to
lower prescription drug costs.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, we have some
ideas to do that.

17:54.166 --> 17:56.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans may
have other ideas.

17:56.666 --> 18:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's talk about lowering
prescription drug costs,
saving the federal
government substantial

18:00.633 --> 18:02.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sums of money.

18:02.633 --> 18:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about having
Medicare negotiate prices with
the pharmaceutical industry.

18:06.966 --> 18:09.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's number one.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number two, there are areas of
this country right now where
there are no insurance companies

18:11.933 --> 18:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
offering the
Affordable Care Act.

18:15.000 --> 18:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let us provide a public option
in every county in America, so
if people don't like what the

18:22.000 --> 18:25.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
private insurance companies
are offering or there is no
offer, let them have at least

18:26.266 --> 18:28.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a public option.

18:28.300 --> 18:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Number three, I believe that
the American people would
very much like to see lowering

18:33.800 --> 18:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the eligibility age of
Medicare from 65 to 55.

18:38.466 --> 18:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, lastly, in my view --
and I speak only for myself
-- the United States must join

18:45.433 --> 18:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rest of the industrialized
world, guarantee health care
to all people as a right.

18:51.366 --> 18:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is why I will be
introducing a Medicare-for-all
single-payer programs.

18:54.933 --> 18:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It will not be passed, believe
me, in this session of Congress.

18:58.066 --> 19:00.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I know that.

19:00.166 --> 19:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have got to begin the
discussion as to why we spend
so much more per capita on

19:03.633 --> 19:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
health care than any other
nation, why we pay the highest
prices in the world, why we

19:07.733 --> 19:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do not guarantee health
care to all people, as every
other major country does.

19:11.433 --> 19:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me
ask you about what is going
to happen in the meantime.

19:13.866 --> 19:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You mentioned
prescription drug prices.

19:15.866 --> 19:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You mentioned having a
public option in different
parts of the country.

19:23.033 --> 19:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we know it's the case
that, in many states,
there is no insurance
company that is providing

19:28.033 --> 19:30.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Republicans like
to say the market, the
exchanges are collapsing.

19:33.166 --> 19:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What can be done in
the short term, Senator
Sanders, to shore these up?

19:38.100 --> 19:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there a way to come up
with subsidies that both
parties can agree to?

19:41.766 --> 19:42.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS: Oh, yes.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, Judy, I think --
it's not me talking.

19:45.466 --> 19:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is what the insurance
companies are saying.

19:47.966 --> 19:52.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they're saying is,
there's great instability
in the marketplace,
precisely because of tweets

19:54.300 --> 19:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like the one President -- the
president sent out today: Let's
see the Obamacare act destroyed.

19:59.966 --> 20:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, that's not exactly a
strong sign of confidence going
out to the insurance companies.

20:03.000 --> 20:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what we have got to do
is, number one, we have to
enforce the individual mandate.

20:07.733 --> 20:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're losing a lot of money that
is not coming into the system.

20:10.533 --> 20:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, number two, we have
to deal with cost-sharing,
which is something we
have been doing many,

20:14.600 --> 20:16.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
many years.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you do that, I think
you will stabilize the
market for the short term.

20:18.966 --> 20:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But long term, longer term, we
have to improve the Affordable
Care Act, and longer term than

20:25.933 --> 20:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we have to join the rest
of the world and guarantee
health care to all people as

20:28.100 --> 20:30.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a right.

20:30.066 --> 20:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much more
money is the federal government
going to have to put into

20:35.300 --> 20:36.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
health care in order
for this to work?

20:36.366 --> 20:37.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Well,
that's a very good question.

20:39.900 --> 20:43.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm sure that there's
absolutely nobody in the world
who knows the answer to it.

20:43.666 --> 20:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All that I can say is that
we are spending far more per
capita than people in any other

20:50.633 --> 20:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country, and our health care
outcomes are in many cases worse
in terms of life expectancy,

20:55.533 --> 20:57.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
infant mortality and so forth.

20:57.666 --> 21:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think the issue is
not necessarily -- we may
have to spend more money.

21:02.300 --> 21:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The issue is to trying to figure
out why we end up spending so
much more than other countries.

21:07.166 --> 21:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And one of the reasons, clearly,
high cost of prescription drugs.

21:10.833 --> 21:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second reason, we do
very, very badly in terms
of primary health care.

21:14.800 --> 21:19.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are millions of people,
even those who have insurance,
who can not get to a doctor

21:19.500 --> 21:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when they are sick.

21:20.933 --> 21:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They end up in the emergency
room, very expensive.

21:22.733 --> 21:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They end up in the hospital,
very, very expensive.

21:25.800 --> 21:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we greatly expanded primary
health care, lower the cost
of prescription drugs, we take

21:30.266 --> 21:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a giant step forward in lowering
health care costs in America.

21:33.033 --> 21:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, very quickly,
if you had to name one area
where you could see an early

21:37.700 --> 21:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement between Democrats
and Republicans on health
care, what would it be?

21:41.400 --> 21:42.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS:
Prescription drugs.

21:44.733 --> 21:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
we are listening to you,
Senator Bernie Sanders.

21:46.266 --> 21:47.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BERNIE SANDERS: Thank you, Judy.

21:50.433 --> 21:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, tomorrow
night, we are going to get a
Republican perspective, and

21:53.300 --> 21:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that will from Senator
Roger Wicker of Mississippi.

22:02.633 --> 22:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has been two years since the
Iran nuclear deal was struck,
a central and controversial

22:14.266 --> 22:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
part of the Obama
administration's legacy.

22:17.100 --> 22:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But President Trump has made
no secret of his dislike for
the agreement, and that is

22:21.533 --> 22:24.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one part of heightened
tensions with Iran.

22:24.366 --> 22:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has more.

22:26.433 --> 22:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: My number one
priority is to dismantle the

22:29.733 --> 22:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disastrous deal with Iran.

22:31.700 --> 22:34.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

22:34.400 --> 22:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On the
campaign trail, candidate
Trump vowed to rip up the
international community's

22:37.900 --> 22:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agreement that curbed Iran's
nuclear program in exchange
for sanctions relief.

22:44.866 --> 22:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, last night, President
Trump took the required step
of certifying whether Iran was

22:49.133 --> 22:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in fact complying with
its end of the deal.

22:51.066 --> 22:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this was the second time
the Trump administration
certified it was.

22:58.033 --> 23:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State Department spokeswoman
Heather Nauert, while affirming
Iran's compliance, said they're

23:01.133 --> 23:03.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not off the hook.

23:03.166 --> 23:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEATHER NAUERT, State Department
Spokeswoman: There are still
a lot of things Iran is doing

23:05.033 --> 23:07.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that are very troubling
to this administration.

23:07.466 --> 23:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we're going to try and
push on the Iranian regime to
stop its destabilizing activity.

23:15.600 --> 23:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In fact, the
president had to be convinced
by his national security team

23:19.900 --> 23:24.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Monday to agree to
this step, for now.

23:24.166 --> 23:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Simultaneously, the
administration maintained
a tough posture on Iran's
non-nuclear activities,

23:31.166 --> 23:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
imposing fresh sanctions on
its ballistic missile program
and its most elite military

23:35.900 --> 23:37.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
unit.

23:37.933 --> 23:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. officials say Iran's
ballistic missile tests, its
support for the militant group

23:41.200 --> 23:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Hezbollah, and its
increasing harassment of
other nations' ships in
the Persian Gulf violate

23:48.266 --> 23:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the spirit of the nuclear
agreement, though they're
not expressly prohibited.

23:50.733 --> 23:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HEATHER NAUERT: Some of the
actions the Iranian government
has been involved with undermine

23:57.633 --> 23:59.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that stated goal of
regional and international
peace and security.

23:59.666 --> 24:03.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Iranian
Foreign Minister Javad Zarif
insists Iran is living up to the

24:03.966 --> 24:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nuclear bargain and that the
U.S. has run afoul of the deal
by adding these new sanctions

24:08.800 --> 24:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and discouraging companies
from investing in Iran.

24:11.800 --> 24:15.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOHAMMAD JAVAD ZARIF, Iranian
Foreign Minister: Iran, in our
view, and in the view of the

24:15.966 --> 24:20.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
IAEA, built trust
by implementing its
side of the bargain.

24:21.833 --> 24:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The United States didn't.

24:23.900 --> 24:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Zarif warned
that if this keeps up, Iran
could choose to pull out of

24:27.033 --> 24:29.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the deal itself.

24:29.633 --> 24:33.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the U.S. says
it is reviewing its entire
Iran policy, even before
the next certification

24:34.800 --> 24:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
deadline, which is
just 90 days away.

24:37.533 --> 24:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on the future of the
Iranian nuclear deal, I'm joined
now by our own Margaret Warner

24:42.033 --> 24:43.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Nick Schifrin.

24:43.033 --> 24:44.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

24:44.200 --> 24:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nick, I want to
starts with you first.

24:46.200 --> 24:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know you have been reporting,
and several others have, that
President Trump certifying

24:50.133 --> 24:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that Iran was in fact
in compliance with the
deal was no easy matter.

24:54.666 --> 24:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you sort of explain,
what are the divisions
within the administration?

24:57.233 --> 24:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Yes, this
was a real struggle.

24:59.633 --> 25:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This time, we had what is
called the interagency process.

25:02.166 --> 25:06.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It took weeks to get to
the point where we were
about 12:00 yesterday.

25:06.033 --> 25:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that process said the
president is ready to recertify
that Iran is in compliance.

25:11.900 --> 25:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The president said not so fast.

25:14.433 --> 25:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On one side, you have
the president, President
Trump, and his chief
strategist, Steve Bannon.

25:17.466 --> 25:22.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a larger struggle,
frankly, vs. -- the pragmatic
vs. the ideological sides of the

25:24.800 --> 25:26.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

25:26.866 --> 25:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have Trump and Bannon
on one side, and you have
most of the national security

25:28.500 --> 25:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
establishment on the other side.

25:31.033 --> 25:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have Secretary of
State Tillerson, Secretary
of Defense Mattis,
National Security Adviser

25:34.333 --> 25:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
H.R. McMaster, Joint Chiefs
Chairman Joe Dunford.

25:36.800 --> 25:41.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And for the next five
or six hours, those two
sides were debating.

25:41.166 --> 25:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president and Bannon
say, we don't like the deal.

25:43.533 --> 25:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not permanent.

25:44.933 --> 25:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the deal is not
what Iran is about.

25:47.700 --> 25:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iran is about the things that
your piece just mentioned,
ballistic weapons, not allowing

25:52.400 --> 25:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
free access in the Gulf,
terrorist support across
the region, and that's
the larger problem.

25:59.366 --> 26:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other side said, look, you
may not like everything that
Iran does, but the fact is

26:05.900 --> 26:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that those other issues are
not part of the deal and that
Iran is in compliance, and,

26:10.500 --> 26:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
until it's not, you
have to recertify.

26:11.866 --> 26:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, Margaret,
help us out with that.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The argument is that if they're
not violating the letter of the
law, perhaps they're violating

26:17.400 --> 26:19.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the spirit of the law.

26:19.533 --> 26:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's true and what is not?

26:21.566 --> 26:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It's true
that they are complying
with the letter of the law.

26:23.466 --> 26:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the State Department
spokeswoman said it again today.

26:26.766 --> 26:29.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And there was no real
spirit of the law.

26:29.000 --> 26:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, there's a phrase about
it's hoped that everyone will
be positive in the region

26:34.600 --> 26:36.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or something.

26:36.733 --> 26:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But the negotiators made
a deliberate decision
to corral, to only deal
with nuclear, because

26:42.300 --> 26:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they knew if they got
into ballistic missiles
or Iran's threat on
Israel and all the other

26:46.733 --> 26:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
things you mentioned in
your piece, the whole
thing would fall apart.

26:49.733 --> 26:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There were some in
the administration who
had hoped that a more
benign environment would

26:56.766 --> 27:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
result because they built this
working relationship, John Kerry
and Javad Sharif, though a very

27:03.600 --> 27:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
senior official who did a lot
with Iran said to me, oh, me,
they are going to be actually

27:06.233 --> 27:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worse after the deal because
they want to prove to the
hard-liners that they're not

27:10.766 --> 27:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wimps and they're not weak.

27:12.766 --> 27:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The schism
that Nick is describing within
the Trump administration

27:16.433 --> 27:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is also reflected in a
schism within Iran itself.

27:19.766 --> 27:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Rouhani was
elected initially to
open up negotiations
with the West, to deliver

27:24.500 --> 27:26.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on this deal.

27:26.933 --> 27:30.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was recently reelected,
but that is not a
unanimous decision and
feeling within Iran.

27:31.366 --> 27:32.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: No, it wasn't.

27:32.633 --> 27:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It wasn't certainly at the time.

27:34.733 --> 27:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had to really -- Rouhani
and Supreme Leader Khamenei had
supported him, sort of, had to

27:41.166 --> 27:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really fight hard-liners.

27:43.233 --> 27:47.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where I do think there is a
lot of unhappiness in Tehran is
the point that Zarif made, that

27:49.733 --> 27:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the money has not rolled
in as they expected,
meaning foreign investment.

27:52.700 --> 27:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, part of it was, as
one person who had been very
involved said to me, oil was

27:56.833 --> 28:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$100 a barrel when they started
the negotiations, $40 after.

28:01.133 --> 28:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The energy companies aren't
exactly dying to rush in.

28:04.500 --> 28:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their banks are almost,
I wouldn't say insolvent,
but a lot of bad loans.

28:09.266 --> 28:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the companies have to
be big enough to come in
and fund it all themselves.

28:14.066 --> 28:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, finally, of course, there
are all these signals, and
they have gotten more intense

28:18.100 --> 28:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
since the Trump administration
came in, far from encouraging
banks -- or at least John

28:25.166 --> 28:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kerry used to travel around
with groups of aides saying,
look, here is how you can do

28:28.566 --> 28:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business, you won't run
afoul up the law -- the Trump
administration, that all ended.

28:33.566 --> 28:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, instead, you have Tillerson
saying things that -- and
Trump saying things that make

28:40.000 --> 28:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Iranians nervous and
foreign investors nervous.

28:42.066 --> 28:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, Nick, we
have this situation now where
the Trump administration says we

28:44.966 --> 28:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to do a
top-to-bottom review of
our Iran policy, 90 days
until the next certification

28:50.600 --> 28:51.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deadline.

28:51.866 --> 28:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are we likely
to see coming up?

28:53.333 --> 28:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The president
doesn't like this deal.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is very, very clear.

28:56.666 --> 29:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I had one official tell me
today he didn't think the
president would recertify in the

29:00.800 --> 29:02.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

29:02.300 --> 29:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is the perception among
a lot of people in this town.

29:05.766 --> 29:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's going to happen now, as
you mentioned in your story,
the administration is going

29:09.366 --> 29:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to look at what it calls the
totality of the problem, so not
just review the nuclear deal,

29:14.100 --> 29:16.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but review all of
Iran's actions.

29:16.133 --> 29:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that review will produce
some kind of paper, some kind of
guideline that will presumably

29:20.800 --> 29:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
include whether they will
recertify in the next 90 days.

29:24.866 --> 29:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it comes out that the
administration doesn't want to
recertify, that really means

29:31.466 --> 29:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the deal is in absolute limbo.

29:33.400 --> 29:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there's no recertification
in 90 days, Congress immediately
gets 60 days to either

29:38.900 --> 29:41.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vote it down or to change it.

29:41.000 --> 29:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whatever Congress decides,
Iran will feel the pressure to
respond in kind, and you could

29:47.966 --> 29:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get a situation where the
deal collapses, we lose, the
U.S. loses access to the IAEA

29:53.900 --> 29:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
information that the deal
allows in Iran, Iran restarts
its nuclear program, and we're

29:58.433 --> 30:00.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
back to where we
were before the deal.

30:00.533 --> 30:03.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a lot of ifs, but
those are exactly the ifs that
most of the national security

30:03.933 --> 30:08.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
establishment is using to
try and convince President
Trump to stay in the deal.

30:08.766 --> 30:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All
right, Nick Schifrin,
Margaret Warner, thank you.

30:20.633 --> 30:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:23.866 --> 30:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
famine and drought
threaten Somaliland's
future; and what this

30:30.433 --> 30:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
artist's paintings of
sunrises and sunsets
can teach us about life.

30:34.900 --> 30:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: An all-girls
team from Afghanistan
finally made it to the U.S.
this week to participate

30:42.233 --> 30:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a robotics competition.

30:44.333 --> 30:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their visas were denied twice
by American officials, until
criticism prompted President

30:50.700 --> 30:52.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump to intervene
and reverse the decision.

30:52.800 --> 30:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The girls joined high school
students from more than 150
other countries, many of whom

30:58.166 --> 31:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
had never seen or
made a robot before.

31:00.433 --> 31:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown will look at some
of the immigration policy issues
this is raising once again.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we start with special
correspondent Kavitha Cardoza
of our partner Education Week.

31:10.600 --> 31:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She spoke to some of the Afghan
girls and other international
students in Washington,

31:14.733 --> 31:16.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
D.C.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
series Making the Grade.

31:18.800 --> 31:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Hundreds
of high school students
arrived in Washington
from across the globe,

31:26.000 --> 31:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
robotics teams from Jamaica to
Jordan, Canada to Australia.

31:29.800 --> 31:32.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There was even one
representing refugees.

31:32.333 --> 31:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But none of the students had a
more unlikely journey, perhaps,
than the crowd favorite.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Team Afghanistan.

31:40.433 --> 31:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA:
Sixteen-year-old Kawsar
Roshan, one of the six girls,
says this was her proudest

31:45.733 --> 31:47.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
moment.

31:47.733 --> 31:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAWSAR ROSHAN, Student (through
translator): I was very happy,
and I was proud when the

31:50.266 --> 31:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people supported us.

31:51.766 --> 31:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm happy when people feel
that Afghans can do something.

31:55.166 --> 32:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: This robotics
competition is part of an
effort to get more young people,

32:02.033 --> 32:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
particularly from
underrepresented countries,
to enter STEM fields.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a term used to include
science, technology,
engineering and math.

32:08.666 --> 32:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A few months ago, all teams
received boxes containing
hundreds of identical parts, and

32:15.666 --> 32:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the students had to figure
out how to take the wheels and
gears, sensors and sprockets,

32:21.300 --> 32:23.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and create a robot.

32:23.833 --> 32:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN, Student
(through translator):
We have an old computer,
but often it doesn't

32:25.833 --> 32:27.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

32:27.366 --> 32:30.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA:
Fatemah Qaderyan is from
the Herat province.

32:30.400 --> 32:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost 40 percent of
school-age children don't
have access to education.

32:34.433 --> 32:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even when they do, there's
often a shortage of
teachers and textbooks.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For many Afghan girls, Fatemah
says even getting to school can
be a challenge, because they

32:45.400 --> 32:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need a man's permission.

32:46.833 --> 32:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN (through
translator): We can't go alone.

32:48.933 --> 32:52.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we need someone to support
us, like a man, to get us to
the school, or other places

32:52.933 --> 32:54.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we want to go.

32:54.966 --> 32:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Their
coach, Alireza Mehraban, says
technology is hard to come by.

33:00.666 --> 33:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALIREZA MEHRABAN, Coach: We
don't have equipment of robotic.

33:03.133 --> 33:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't have it.

33:05.233 --> 33:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: He says even
though these girls were chosen
from more than 150 students,

33:11.266 --> 33:13.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because the team has no
experience in robotics, some
doubted their abilities.

33:13.366 --> 33:16.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALIREZA MEHRABAN: They say you
can't, because it's impossible.

33:16.066 --> 33:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For girls in Afghanistan,
can't do this, really.

33:19.133 --> 33:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's too hard for us.

33:21.033 --> 33:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: And what did
you say when they said that?

33:23.333 --> 33:25.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALIREZA MEHRABAN: We
say, we can do it.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just we say, we can do it.

33:27.466 --> 33:29.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Just give us a chance.

33:29.866 --> 33:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Then, after
they built their robot, their
visas were denied twice.

33:34.366 --> 33:36.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were not given
any explanation.

33:36.966 --> 33:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN (through
translator): When we
applied and were rejected,
we are so disappointed.

33:41.400 --> 33:44.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are crying a lot
for six or seven hours.

33:44.233 --> 33:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Mehraban can
hardly believe they're here.

33:47.633 --> 33:50.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN: How do you feel
when everyone cheers
team Afghanistan?

33:50.533 --> 33:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALIREZA MEHRABAN: What I have
to say, because the feeling
like I'm so happy, so happy.

33:56.433 --> 33:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can't describe it best.

33:58.500 --> 34:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Really, I can't describe
it best, because a feeling
like I can't control myself.

34:04.666 --> 34:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Eighty percent
of these teams are made up
of boys, a gender gap that is

34:09.600 --> 34:11.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reflected in STEM
fields worldwide.

34:11.566 --> 34:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the inequality in education
is far bigger than just STEM
subjects and Afghanistan.

34:18.266 --> 34:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Around the world, more than
60 million girls don't have
access to any education.

34:23.166 --> 34:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The reasons vary, from wars,
to cultural mores, to something
as simple as distance.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Melissa Lemus is
with team Honduras.

34:30.533 --> 34:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELISSA LEMUS, Student (through
translator): Some of my friends
live about two hours from

34:34.366 --> 34:37.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the high school, or
they have to take a bus.

34:37.466 --> 34:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: While Gregine
Kumba Natt with team Liberia
says often they don't have

34:41.800 --> 34:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
electricity during the day.

34:43.833 --> 34:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREGINE KUMBA NATT, Student: We
need to charge the robots, but
in our country, we have poor

34:47.166 --> 34:49.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
electricity.

34:49.200 --> 34:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We couldn't charge our phones
either, and because of that,
usually, we don't practice

34:54.000 --> 34:55.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
at day.

34:55.000 --> 34:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We practice in the night hour.

34:57.033 --> 35:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: And like many
countries here, Ruby Balami
from team Nepal says her school

35:03.966 --> 35:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't have a science lab, so,
initially, she was nervous when
she saw teams from developed

35:08.666 --> 35:10.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries, such as
Japan and the U.S.

35:10.666 --> 35:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RUBY BALAMI, Student: We think
that they are much competitive,
and it was a scary thing,

35:17.066 --> 35:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, coming here, making them
friends, now we have -- feel
much more better, and now

35:29.166 --> 35:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we are much more confident.

35:31.733 --> 35:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Some
last-minute tinkering
and intense discussions,
and then it was showtime.

35:35.366 --> 35:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Each country's team was paired
with two others, often not
speaking the same language.

35:40.100 --> 35:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Learning to collaborate and
communicate is part of the goal,
says Dean Kamen, the founder

35:46.233 --> 35:48.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the competition,
FIRST Global Challenge.

35:48.200 --> 35:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEAN KAMEN, Founder, FIRST
Global Challenge: You're the
first generation on this planet

35:54.333 --> 35:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that could grow up with
all of its kids knowing
each other, working
together, creating value,

35:59.300 --> 36:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
so that you could all
have better lives, we
can have a better world.

36:05.533 --> 36:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
important thing here.

36:07.900 --> 36:12.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Fatemah
loved meeting students
from other countries.

36:12.366 --> 36:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She says she knows people think
of Afghanistan as a place of
violence and poverty, but she

36:18.233 --> 36:20.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wants to change that perception.

36:20.300 --> 36:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN (through
translator): War like a habit
for us, because bomb blasting

36:24.233 --> 36:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and counterblasting and
killing people so normal for
us, because we see it a lot.

36:31.133 --> 36:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: She believes
the only way that can
change is through education.

36:33.500 --> 36:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her mother stopped at grade
six, and even now more than
three million children, mostly

36:39.600 --> 36:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
girls, are not
enrolled in school.

36:41.333 --> 36:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But someday, Fatemah wants to
get a Ph.D. in computer science.

36:45.733 --> 36:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN (through
translator): Because I
need this, our country
needs this, to have

36:52.200 --> 36:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
women educated, to be new
generation in the future.

36:55.166 --> 36:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I want to show the world
what Afghan girls, or
young girls, can do.

36:59.333 --> 37:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We can show them, when we have
a creative idea, we can do it.

37:03.166 --> 37:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: For
the "PBS NewsHour" and
Education Week, I'm Kavitha
Cardoza in Washington,

37:08.633 --> 37:10.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
D.C.

37:10.766 --> 37:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As Kavitha said,
the visa question for the Afghan
girls gained national attention

37:15.833 --> 37:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the direct intervention
by President Trump.

37:17.933 --> 37:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alan Gomez from USA Today
joins me now to talk about
that part of the story.

37:22.433 --> 37:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, Alan, was this a
special case, an outlier?

37:25.766 --> 37:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What, if anything, does it
tell us about the current
situation with visas?

37:30.233 --> 37:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ, USA Today:
Well, absolutely, this
was a complete outlier.

37:34.366 --> 37:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Understand that the Trump
administration has made clear
throughout its time that it will

37:38.266 --> 37:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
handle any visa application
on a case-by-case basis,
exceptions can always be made.

37:45.200 --> 37:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But this case definitely
represents a very
sharp departure from
what has been a pretty

37:51.200 --> 37:54.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
clear strategy from
this administration to
limit, to restrict, to
in some cases completely

37:54.933 --> 37:58.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
suspend immigration from
terror-prone countries.

37:58.533 --> 38:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, understand that, you know,
we're still dealing with the
travel ban that the president

38:02.866 --> 38:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been trying to implement
now for months that is directed
at six countries that have

38:07.033 --> 38:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been labeled as having very
close ties to terrorism.

38:09.966 --> 38:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has completely suspended
the refugee program, all in
the name of national security.

38:17.366 --> 38:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Afghanistan has
never been on any of
those lists of countries,
but, you know, I think

38:20.566 --> 38:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would be pretty easy to make
a case that Afghanistan has a
bit of history with terrorism,

38:27.533 --> 38:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that's why this case makes
it -- is so, so surprising
that it's threes girls from

38:30.666 --> 38:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Afghanistan that have been
allowed into the country.

38:33.633 --> 38:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, I wonder,
do we even know yet why they
were denied visas originally?

38:38.466 --> 38:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALAN GOMEZ: No, the State
Department generally
discuss individual
cases and why it makes

38:44.333 --> 38:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
individual determinations.

38:46.400 --> 38:51.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But when you think about
the overall posture of
this administration to
seriously scrutinize

38:53.266 --> 38:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any visas, any visa applications
that are coming from countries
with those ties to terrorism,

38:58.666 --> 39:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it follows that trend of
denying a lot of those visas
from people coming from those

39:00.900 --> 39:02.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so
this case raises some -- plays
into some larger confusions

39:04.633 --> 39:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and that continuing controversy.

39:06.666 --> 39:10.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to ask you about one
other development in the visa
world that came yesterday.

39:10.600 --> 39:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The government announced they're
adding 15,000 new H-2B visas.

39:16.733 --> 39:17.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, explain what's
going on there.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ALAN GOMEZ: Yes.

39:19.800 --> 39:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's just another example
of why it's so difficult to
try to figure out sort of

39:22.433 --> 39:26.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what direction this
administration is going
when it comes to the
legal immigration system

39:26.433 --> 39:28.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just a couple of months ago,
to give you some background,
the president ordered a total

39:31.900 --> 39:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
review of the H-1B visa program.

39:35.400 --> 39:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are visas dedicated
to foreigners who are
trained in science,
technology, engineering,

39:40.066 --> 39:42.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mathematics.

39:42.100 --> 39:44.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're used by technology
companies to bring in computer
scientists and programmers.

39:44.966 --> 39:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Trump administration
ordered a review of the program
because they believe that there

39:48.966 --> 39:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is too much fraud and that
these technology companies are
abusing that program to just

39:53.333 --> 39:54.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
import cheaper labor.

39:54.833 --> 39:56.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, we had that
as the background.

39:56.566 --> 39:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They talk about
American workers first.

39:58.433 --> 40:01.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And that's sort of the
posture that they have
been proceeding under.

40:01.066 --> 40:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's H-1.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's the H-1.

40:03.566 --> 40:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, this is H-2, which
is for temporary workers.

40:05.433 --> 40:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Right.

40:07.933 --> 40:10.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, all of a sudden,
yesterday, we get this
announcement that they
are going to approve

40:10.466 --> 40:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
15,000 additional new
visas for H-2B visas, and
these are dedicated to
lower-skilled workers.

40:18.400 --> 40:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Think about people who work
in fisheries, in hotels, in
construction, in resorts, and

40:24.833 --> 40:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those are the kind of workers
that they're going to allow in.

40:26.900 --> 40:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The argument from the Trump
administration is that these
companies, a lot of them were

40:31.000 --> 40:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in very desperate need of
the labor, that they couldn't
find American workers to do

40:34.833 --> 40:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that job, so they needed to
bring in these additional
workers to do it.

40:37.800 --> 40:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, again, it sort of goes
against what the administration
has been arguing for all these

40:45.266 --> 40:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
months, that they are going
to limit the immigration
system to help American
workers and to reduce

40:49.333 --> 40:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the competition that they're
facing here in the country.

40:50.566 --> 40:52.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: All
right, ever evolving.

40:52.266 --> 40:55.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Alan Gomez, USA Today,
thanks very much.

40:55.666 --> 41:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALAN GOMEZ: Thank you.

41:02.666 --> 41:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United
Nations has called it the worst
humanitarian crisis since 1945,

41:12.033 --> 41:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, just today, the lead
editorial in The Washington
Post called it the worst crisis

41:17.766 --> 41:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you have never heard of.

41:19.833 --> 41:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Drought and famine threaten 20
million people in the war-torn
countries of Yemen, South

41:26.166 --> 41:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sudan, and Somalia, as
well as drought-stricken
neighbors, such as Ethiopia.

41:30.266 --> 41:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week, for the first
time, eight of the leading
U.S.-based international
relief organizations

41:36.633 --> 41:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are launching the Global
Emergency Response Coalition.

41:40.233 --> 41:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a joint fund-raising appeal
to the American public due to
the hunger crisis, which will

41:46.466 --> 41:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
use social media to
amplify its message.

41:49.200 --> 41:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent
Fred de Sam Lazaro
reports from the breakaway
region of Somalia known

41:54.833 --> 41:56.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as Somaliland.

41:56.933 --> 42:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: A glimpse
from our airplane window showed
the stark moonscape of drought

42:02.566 --> 42:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
stretching for miles on
end, where many regions
in East Africa are at
risk of famine for the

42:07.466 --> 42:11.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
third time in 25 years.

42:11.900 --> 42:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 360,000 children
are malnourished in Somalia;
70,000 of them are in critical

42:18.333 --> 42:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
condition, according to the
World Health Organization.

42:21.133 --> 42:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We traveled to Somaliland,
a region that declared
itself independent of
Somalia more than two

42:26.733 --> 42:28.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
decades ago.

42:28.700 --> 42:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Its capital, Hargeisa, has seen
an influx of mostly nomadic
livestock herders fleeing

42:34.066 --> 42:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the drought and in some
cases fighting in the
vast surrounding region.

42:37.733 --> 42:40.766 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
They now live in
temporary camps.

42:40.766 --> 42:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thirty-old-Year-old Hamda
Abdilahi Dhamac is the
mother of five children.

42:47.800 --> 42:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She came here after all of
her livestock, some 30 goats
and 50 sheep, died from the

42:51.366 --> 42:53.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drought.

42:53.533 --> 42:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HAMDA ABDILAHI DHAMAC,
Somaliland (through
translator): I used
to be part of a family

42:55.066 --> 42:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of livestock herders.

42:57.166 --> 42:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now I have been forced
to come to this camp, where I
don't have enough money to buy

42:59.700 --> 43:00.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
food and water.

43:00.933 --> 43:03.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am really suffering.

43:03.000 --> 43:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: She gets
some money from relatives, but
says it's just enough to buy

43:08.366 --> 43:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
rice and perhaps
an onion or tomato.

43:10.866 --> 43:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She can't afford beans or meat.

43:14.400 --> 43:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like Dhamac, a majority
of Somalis make their
living by grazing animals.

43:18.966 --> 43:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the drought has wiped out
70 percent of all livestock.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dhamac says she doesn't know how
she will survive in the future.

43:25.733 --> 43:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HAMDA ABDILAHI DHAMAC
(through translator): I
don't have any hope now.

43:28.966 --> 43:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't have a
plan for my future.

43:31.033 --> 43:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Humanitarian
organizations are distributing
emergency food to ease the

43:36.900 --> 43:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
crisis in the short-term.

43:38.933 --> 43:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jeremiah Kibanya coordinates
relief efforts for World Vision.

43:41.900 --> 43:46.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEREMIAH KIBANYA, World
Vision: We are providing
food commodities to the
people who right now

43:47.933 --> 43:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not having anything to eat.

43:50.033 --> 43:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will need money to help
people get more animals into
their family and begin their

43:56.033 --> 43:58.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
livelihood.

43:58.100 --> 44:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: How
much do you need, and what
percentage are you getting?

44:00.266 --> 44:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMIAH KIBANYA: World Vision
has requested for about $37
million be able to respond.

44:04.566 --> 44:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, so far, we have
received $11 million.

44:07.866 --> 44:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Most of
that money, $10 million, has
come from the U.S. government.

44:14.933 --> 44:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Seattle-based agency is
helping deliver medical care
for those most vulnerable to

44:19.200 --> 44:22.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drought: pregnant
women and children.

44:22.300 --> 44:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At this clinic in the
village of Gabiley, babies
are measured and weighed.

44:25.900 --> 44:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A simple test with an
armband determines their
level of nutrition.

44:30.033 --> 44:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Yellow means moderate
malnutrition.

44:33.233 --> 44:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Red means severe.

44:35.266 --> 44:39.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there's malnourishment,
the mothers are given packets
of peanut paste, along with

44:39.266 --> 44:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
guidance to administer it only
to the sickest children, says
clinic director Asha Abdi Ali.

44:46.166 --> 44:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very difficult for a
mother if she has other children
who are hungry to not share

44:50.066 --> 44:51.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

44:51.766 --> 44:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ASHA ABDI ALI, Clinic
Director: We tell them
for the same reason.

44:53.233 --> 44:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's that these other
children are not in need.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is only for this child.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: But
it's still difficult?

44:59.433 --> 45:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ASHA ABDI ALI: It's
still difficult.

45:01.500 --> 45:05.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Keeping
people healthy is now made even
more difficult, ironically,

45:05.933 --> 45:08.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by rain.

45:08.033 --> 45:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some rains have arrived this
year, and that's been enough
to green up the landscape.

45:14.100 --> 45:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the effects of the
drought are going to linger
for a much longer time.

45:16.100 --> 45:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, more immediately,
the threat to public
health is even greater.

45:20.100 --> 45:24.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's because there are
millions of livestock
carcasses strewn all
over the landscape, and

45:24.966 --> 45:29.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the rains do is
wash contaminants into
sources of drinking water.

45:29.966 --> 45:34.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On a hillside just outside
Dilla, a village about
an hour's drive from
the capital, carcasses

45:36.700 --> 45:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have become an unmanageable
problem for Mayor
Ibrahim Abdi Haji.

45:39.100 --> 45:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IBRAHIM ABDI HAJI, Mayor of
Dilla (through translator):
It is a bigger problem than we

45:42.600 --> 45:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can handle alone.

45:44.133 --> 45:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have asked the government for
help to burn those dead animals.

45:46.800 --> 45:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But we haven't
received help yet.

45:48.833 --> 45:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're afraid the community
will get waterborne
diseases from the animals.

45:51.433 --> 45:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are very scared.

45:53.466 --> 45:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Water
which has collected at a nearby
earthen dam, has been completely

45:57.633 --> 46:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contaminated by both dead
and diseased animals.

46:00.600 --> 46:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEREMIAH KIBANYA: And if people
use that water because of
desperation, and they don't have

46:05.066 --> 46:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any other water to drink, that
poses another threat again to
outbreak of waterborne diseases

46:11.600 --> 46:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the communities.

46:13.666 --> 46:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That can lead to outbreaks
of diseases like acute
water diarrhea or cholera.

46:20.433 --> 46:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I want to show you
the best way of making
your water clean and safe.

46:23.766 --> 46:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: As a
short-term solution, World
Vision has distributed
some 75,000 filters

46:30.133 --> 46:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and chlorine tablets, so
people can purify their water.

46:32.966 --> 46:37.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But World Vision's
Kibanya says the other
issues, food shortages,
limited medical services

46:39.133 --> 46:41.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and lack of jobs, are
tougher ones to tackle.

46:41.400 --> 46:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There's a tradition
in this region, where
droughts are localized,
that communities welcome

46:46.233 --> 46:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people temporarily displaced
by the dry conditions.

46:49.533 --> 46:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one of Dilla's newcomers,
Roda Yusaf, a mother of seven,
isn't sure she can return

46:55.600 --> 46:57.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to her former livelihood
without animals.

46:57.966 --> 47:00.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She plans to stay in
Dilla indefinitely.

47:00.133 --> 47:05.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RODA YUSAF, Somaliland (through
translator): When you come from
another area, it's difficult

47:05.800 --> 47:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get a job here.

47:07.066 --> 47:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the community has
been very supportive.

47:09.166 --> 47:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Six years
ago, Dilla was in a similar
position of hosting displaced

47:13.733 --> 47:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
persons from a severe famine
which ended up killing
260,000 people in Somalia.

47:20.333 --> 47:23.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mayor Haji hopes that
doesn't happen again.

47:23.866 --> 47:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems to be a tradition
here for sharing and helping
people who are in distress in

47:29.466 --> 47:30.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the tribe.

47:30.833 --> 47:32.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
After some time, does
that become difficult?

47:32.800 --> 47:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
IBRAHIM ABDI HAJI (through
translator): We are starting
to reach that point.

47:40.033 --> 47:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last time we supported
displaced people who
had come here, everybody
ended up suffering.

47:42.000 --> 47:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The repeated
cycles of drought over the
past 25 years is constantly

47:47.933 --> 47:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the minds of aid workers
and political leaders.

47:50.166 --> 47:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Saad Ali Shire is
Somaliland's foreign minister.

47:53.466 --> 47:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAAD ALI SHIRE, Somaliland
Foreign Minister: We need to
look into the future and build

47:57.600 --> 48:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
resilience, so when the drought
comes next time -- and it
will come, because these are

48:04.233 --> 48:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
now more severe and
more frequent, because
of the climate change.

48:06.733 --> 48:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: He
says much greater long-term
investment must be made
to improve the region's

48:12.166 --> 48:14.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
viability.

48:14.266 --> 48:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAAD ALI SHIRE: We need
to change the way we raise
livestock in this country.

48:19.800 --> 48:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We very much follow --
we raise livestock as we
raised it 200 years ago.

48:25.200 --> 48:27.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a nomadic way.

48:27.366 --> 48:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think we need to settle
and grow food for livestock.

48:31.466 --> 48:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we also need, I think, to
orient part of our population
towards fishing and other

48:40.133 --> 48:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
activities, industry, services.

48:42.566 --> 48:46.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: However,
that seems unlikely,
at least in the short
term, given that urgent

48:48.566 --> 48:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
appeals to deal with the
immediate needs have fallen far
short of what the U.N. and aid

48:53.600 --> 48:55.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
agencies have requested.

48:55.666 --> 49:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Fred de Sam Lazaro reporting
from Dilla, Somaliland.

49:02.600 --> 49:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Fred's
reporting is a partnership
with the Under-Told
Stories Project at the

49:06.200 --> 49:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
University of St.
Thomas in Minnesota.

49:09.733 --> 49:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new exhibit, Sunrise, Sunset,
by Swiss artist Nicolas Party,
recently opened at the Hirshhorn

49:24.966 --> 49:27.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Museum in Washington, D.C.

49:27.166 --> 49:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party, known for his large works
of public art, painted directly
on 400 feet of the museum's

49:33.666 --> 49:35.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
circular walls.

49:35.400 --> 49:38.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We tracked his progress
over two weeks.

49:38.166 --> 49:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party told the "NewsHour" he
was inspired by the notion
that, no matter what happens,

49:42.466 --> 49:45.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the sun will rise
in the morning.

49:45.200 --> 49:50.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICOLAS PARTY, Artist: I was
aware of the circle shape of the
building, and that influenced

49:50.800 --> 49:52.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my decision.

49:52.866 --> 49:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I decided to do a show about
sunsets and sunrises, which is
this kind of end and beginning

49:58.233 --> 50:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that happens every day, but
also implied this idea of this
very, very long timeline that

50:03.933 --> 50:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just shows the rotation of
every element in the universe.

50:06.966 --> 50:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And let's give a perspective
of maybe, like, seeing history
and things in a much bigger

50:13.366 --> 50:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way, and maybe not being
always focused on the daily.

50:15.033 --> 50:19.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The circle aspect really
defines the project.

50:19.566 --> 50:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, after, I'm trying
to kind of build up a
rhythm into this space.

50:23.866 --> 50:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every wall is a different
color, but also every shape of
the paintings that I'm doing

50:27.933 --> 50:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the wall also has a different
format to give like a rhythm
and an energy to the wall.

50:33.666 --> 50:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I like to improvise.

50:35.233 --> 50:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there's an element of freedom
when I work on the walls.

50:37.900 --> 50:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I use the wall almost
as a piece of paper.

50:41.633 --> 50:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, of course, I have
sketches, but, yes, I work
very organically, so there's an

50:46.500 --> 50:47.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
element of surprise.

50:47.866 --> 50:49.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's really exciting.

50:49.300 --> 50:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, yes, it's really
exciting to have all this space.

50:51.733 --> 50:55.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In a matter of seven
days, I will do like
30 different paintings.

50:55.200 --> 50:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of art that I love, they
feel really alive and energetic.

50:58.233 --> 51:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you need to be in that
stage when you're doing them.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A lot of landscape painting.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have been obviously
painting sunsets and sunrises.

51:05.766 --> 51:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the only moment
during the day that you
can really see, visually,
how the entire universe

51:12.033 --> 51:13.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
functions.

51:13.433 --> 51:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can really see the rotation
of Earth at that moment.

51:15.300 --> 51:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Right now, we can't see it.

51:17.400 --> 51:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But during those 30 minutes
of a sunset or a sunrise, you
can actually feel it, and you

51:20.833 --> 51:22.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can see it very clearly.

51:22.866 --> 51:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And all those kind of different
reasons that the color change
the sky, that's the physical

51:29.766 --> 51:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reaction of the light
going through different
kind of angles and stuff.

51:31.833 --> 51:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I thought
that's fascinating.

51:34.300 --> 51:39.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, the daily life
and our little preoccupations
that are very important,
but so it's interesting

51:40.566 --> 51:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to put them in perspective
with this big thing.

51:42.766 --> 51:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's very different stages
when I do those murals.

51:45.600 --> 51:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's like the beginning
that is very slow and
allow myself a lot of time.

51:49.500 --> 51:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then there's a moment when it's
-- everything is beginning to
build up, and I realize, oh,

51:52.733 --> 51:56.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I made mistakes in the
placements or the size,
colors or whatever.

51:56.300 --> 51:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's getting very stressful.

51:58.733 --> 52:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so then there's a
moment it's very difficult,
usually, because it's
not going how I want

52:03.133 --> 52:05.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to go.

52:05.733 --> 52:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, just like coming to
a space, doing something
and this thing will
disappear or more or less

52:11.033 --> 52:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being covered up, so it will
still be here, but it will be
covered by a layer of paint.

52:14.766 --> 52:16.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's like ruins
that are underneath.

52:16.766 --> 52:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like the cave painting, you
don't see, but I'm sure there's
a lot of them that we don't

52:19.833 --> 52:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see or we don't know about,
but still they exist.

52:23.233 --> 52:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's very different steps
between the moment you start, to
run to the moment it's extremely

52:28.100 --> 52:31.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difficult, to the end, when
you feel totally fine just
running through the line.

52:31.466 --> 52:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's all those moments
that are very exciting,
yes, to look forward to do.

52:37.733 --> 52:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You don't need to
change the world.

52:39.833 --> 52:42.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can just change your
few meters around you.

52:42.500 --> 52:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so I did change the circle.

52:46.166 --> 52:51.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's what I did.

52:53.666 --> 52:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later tonight
on PBS: an inside look
at life out of prison.

53:01.700 --> 53:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Frontline" teams up with The
New York Times for the film
"Life on Parole" for a look at

53:06.600 --> 53:11.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Connecticut's push to
keep people from returning
to life behind bars.

53:11.466 --> 53:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I have been coming to
prison since 1999 now, and I
have been in and out of jail 11

53:19.533 --> 53:21.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

53:21.533 --> 53:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: This time I got out,
it was the first time
that I was on parole.

53:26.266 --> 53:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Brantley (ph).

53:28.166 --> 53:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: I was definitely
frightened.

53:32.733 --> 53:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't know what to expect.

53:36.533 --> 53:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Sentence less
than four years.

53:42.933 --> 53:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: Errol's parole
officer is Mark Polich (ph).

53:45.100 --> 53:47.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's been a parole
officer for 18 years.

53:47.533 --> 53:49.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, what was your
crime over there?

53:49.400 --> 53:50.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Burglary.

53:50.400 --> 53:51.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Burglary.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that kind of your thing or...

53:52.400 --> 53:53.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: No, at all.

53:53.533 --> 53:54.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was -- for drugs.

53:54.766 --> 53:56.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: All right, and
the drug of choice is?

53:56.400 --> 53:58.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Heroin.

53:58.533 --> 54:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Mr. Brantley, you can
just read, had a long, long
history of opiate addiction.

54:01.700 --> 54:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you're in this business
long enough, you know the
chances are at some point it

54:05.833 --> 54:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will rear its ugly head.

54:07.833 --> 54:12.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, now he's on your watch,
so you have got to make sure
you're dotting I's and crossing

54:12.200 --> 54:13.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
T's.

54:13.200 --> 54:15.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's for sure.

54:15.166 --> 54:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: "Frontline"'s
"Life on Parole" airs
tonight on most PBS stations.

54:19.033 --> 54:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Seattle made headlines
for its substantial minimum

54:23.533 --> 54:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wage hike, now as high
as $15 an hour for some.

54:27.466 --> 54:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new study, commissioned by
the city itself, has found that
the boost has cost jobs for

54:33.200 --> 54:35.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the lowest-wage workers.

54:35.333 --> 54:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We asked an economist and an
entrepreneur to share their
takes, which you can find on

54:40.866 --> 54:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:43.733 --> 54:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

54:45.233 --> 54:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
