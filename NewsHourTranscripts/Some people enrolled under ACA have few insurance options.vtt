WASHINGTON BY MARY AGNES CAREY

00:59.125 --> 01:00.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF KAISER HEALTH NEWS.

01:00.493 --> 01:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DID WE GET TO THIS

01:01.294 --> 01:02.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION?

01:02.395 --> 01:03.630 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, THE PRESIDENT LIKES TO

01:03.630 --> 01:04.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESCRIBE IT AS OBAMACARE

01:04.764 --> 01:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPLODING.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE'RE CLEARLY SEEING THAT

01:07.834 --> 01:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A DISPARITY IN HOW MUCH

01:09.769 --> 01:11.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHOICE CONSUMERS HAVE WHEN THEY

01:11.871 --> 01:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO TO THESE EXCHANGES.

01:13.873 --> 01:14.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> INSURERS HAVE BEEN VERY

01:14.841 --> 01:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNED ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY

01:16.309 --> 01:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.

01:17.944 --> 01:18.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU MENTIONED, THERE'S BEEN A

01:18.912 --> 01:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF DISCUSSION ON CAPITOL

01:20.146 --> 01:21.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HILL ABOUT REPEALING AND

01:21.281 --> 01:22.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPLACING THE LAW.

01:22.682 --> 01:23.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT FELL APART THIS WEEK IN THE

01:23.716 --> 01:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENATE.

01:24.784 --> 01:25.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S BEEN CONCERN ABOUT

01:25.752 --> 01:27.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER OR NOT THE TRUMP

01:27.087 --> 01:28.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION WOULD FUND THESE

01:28.321 --> 01:30.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COST-SHARING SUBSIDIES THAT HELP

01:30.256 --> 01:31.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOW-INCOME PEOPLE WITH THEIR

01:31.324 --> 01:32.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS.

01:32.959 --> 01:33.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE'S ALSO BEEN CONCERN

01:33.960 --> 01:35.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM INSURERS ABOUT TOUGH

01:35.261 --> 01:36.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENFORCEMENT OF THE INDIVIDUAL

01:36.463 --> 01:38.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANDATE, THIS REQUIREMENT THAT

01:38.164 --> 01:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOST AMERICANS HAVE INSURANCE

01:39.466 --> 01:40.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR PAY A FINE.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THAT

01:42.569 --> 01:44.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLECTIVELY, INSURERS ARE

01:44.104 --> 01:45.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING WORRIED, AND SOME ARE

01:45.605 --> 01:46.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDING NOT TO GO INTO SOME

01:46.873 --> 01:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKETS OR LEAVE OTHER MARKETS

01:48.775 --> 01:50.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR RAISE THEIR PRICES TO TRY TO

01:50.276 --> 01:51.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPENSATE FOR THAT UNCERTAINTY.

01:51.778 --> 01:52.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: I REMEMBER

01:52.412 --> 01:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THE A.C.A. FIRST PASSED,

01:53.813 --> 01:56.216 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE BIG, SORT OF

01:56.216 --> 01:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPROMISES TO THE INSURANCE

01:58.051 --> 01:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDUSTRY WAS SAYING, "HEY, THIS

01:59.686 --> 02:00.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDIVIDUAL MANDATE WILL BE IN

02:00.787 --> 02:01.554 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACE.

02:01.554 --> 02:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYONE WILL HAVE TO HAVE

02:02.555 --> 02:03.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURANCE.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE AN

02:04.357 --> 02:05.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPPORTUNITY TO FIND NEW

02:05.525 --> 02:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CUSTOMERS."

02:06.259 --> 02:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE THOUGHT HAS BEEN ALSO

02:08.862 --> 02:10.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAS BEEN THE OPPORTUNITY

02:10.196 --> 02:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR THE INSURERS, AND THEY HAVE

02:11.297 --> 02:12.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOTTEN IN, BUT THEY KNEW

02:12.265 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INITIALLY, THE SICKEST PEOPLE

02:13.800 --> 02:15.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD COME IN FIRST.

02:15.168 --> 02:16.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE BEEN VERY, VERY

02:16.302 --> 02:17.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPENSIVE.

02:17.570 --> 02:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEN THERE'S ALSO BEEN

02:18.738 --> 02:20.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONGOING CONCERN ABOUT THE PRICE

02:20.540 --> 02:21.774 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE PREMIUMS.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PEOPLE HAVE OPTED, RATHER,

02:23.810 --> 02:25.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT TO ENROLL AND SIMPLY PAY

02:25.612 --> 02:28.081 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT INDIVIDUAL MANDATE PENALTY.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE INDIVIDUAL MANDATE, OF

02:29.916 --> 02:31.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURSE, WE KNOW HAS BEEN A

02:31.084 --> 02:32.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIGHTNING ROD ON CAPITOL HILL.

02:32.051 --> 02:33.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS HATE IT.

02:33.052 --> 02:34.220 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY SAY AMERICANS SHOULDN'T BE

02:34.220 --> 02:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIRED TO PURCHASE INSURANCE

02:35.622 --> 02:36.422 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR BE TOLD WHAT INSURANCE TO

02:36.422 --> 02:37.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUY.

02:37.390 --> 02:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT HAS BEEN A FOCAL POINT OF

02:38.691 --> 02:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS EVER SINCE THE AFFORDABLE

02:39.926 --> 02:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARE ACT WAS CREATED.

02:41.227 --> 02:42.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: INSURANCE

02:42.295 --> 02:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPANIES ARE ALSO RESPONSIBLE

02:43.429 --> 02:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THEIR SHAREHOLDERS.

02:44.597 --> 02:45.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE THINKING A COUPLE OF

02:45.498 --> 02:46.399 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS OUT.

02:46.399 --> 02:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS

02:47.800 --> 02:49.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE SEEN THEM START TO MAKE

02:49.435 --> 02:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVES REGARDLESS OF WHO WAS

02:50.703 --> 02:52.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO WIN THIS WHITE HOUSE.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YOU KNOW, THEY LOOKED AT THE

02:53.173 --> 02:54.140 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKET, AS YOU MENTIONED, SOME

02:54.140 --> 02:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE IN, AND SOME ARE OUT.

02:55.508 --> 02:56.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AGAIN, WE GET BACK TO THE

02:56.409 --> 02:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNCERTAINTY.

02:58.044 --> 02:58.978 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THIS A MARKETPLACE WHERE THEY

02:58.978 --> 02:59.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO BE?

02:59.946 --> 03:01.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL THIS MARKETPLACE BE

03:01.347 --> 03:02.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTED BY THE TRUMP

03:02.582 --> 03:03.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION?

03:03.483 --> 03:04.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL THE RULES AND REGULATIONS

03:04.651 --> 03:06.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT BE

03:06.352 --> 03:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPLEMENTED AND OVERSEEN BY THE

03:08.454 --> 03:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, AND THAT

03:09.722 --> 03:11.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS JUST BEEN AT THE FOCAL POINT

03:11.424 --> 03:12.559 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THIS ENTIRE THING, WHERE THE

03:12.559 --> 03:13.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURERS ARE INVOLVED.

03:13.960 --> 03:14.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WELL, WHAT ABOUT

03:14.961 --> 03:16.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAID EXPANSION OR AT LEAST

03:16.029 --> 03:18.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SUBSIDIES, AND HOW MUCH THE

03:18.097 --> 03:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OR ANY SORT

03:19.599 --> 03:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A REPLACEMENT WILL PAY?

03:21.234 --> 03:22.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT CAN THE INSURANCE COMPANIES

03:22.235 --> 03:23.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECT?

03:23.803 --> 03:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, RIGHT NOW, SINCE THINGS

03:24.871 --> 03:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE FALLEN APART ABOUT THIS ON

EXPANSION, WHICH 31 STATES

03:29.776 --> 03:32.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBRACED, IS STILL THERE.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY COULD STILL COUNT ON

03:33.680 --> 03:34.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ENROLLMENT.

03:34.614 --> 03:36.416 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FOR NOW, THE SUBSIDIES

03:36.416 --> 03:37.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER,

FUND ABOUT EIGHT OUT OF TEN

03:38.918 --> 03:40.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFICIARIES, ARE STILL THERE.

03:40.587 --> 03:41.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE KEY POINT ON THE SUBSIDY

03:41.821 --> 03:42.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUE IS THIS COST SHARING

03:42.755 --> 03:43.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBSIDY.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS THE SUBSIDY THAT HELPS

03:45.592 --> 03:46.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT SEVEN MILLION ENROLLEES

03:46.926 --> 03:48.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THEIR OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS.

03:48.661 --> 03:49.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND INSURERS ARE VERY WORRIED

03:49.862 --> 03:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION

03:50.797 --> 03:52.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT STOP FUNDING THAT.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTIONS CAN BE TAKEN FOR, WHAT

03:54.634 --> 03:55.702 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE CALLED THESE "BARE"

03:55.702 --> 03:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTIES, WHERE BASICALLY THERE

03:56.836 --> 03:58.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE NOW CURRENTLY NO INSURERS ON

03:58.204 --> 03:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EXCHANGES, OR AS THOSE

03:59.939 --> 04:01.441 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTIES GROW IN NUMBER?

04:01.441 --> 04:02.575 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE ARE A VARIETY OF

04:02.575 --> 04:03.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROPOSALS THAT COULD BE

04:03.543 --> 04:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBRACED.

MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BUY

COVERAGE.

04:15.488 --> 04:16.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS ALSO A VARIETY OF

PROPOSALS OUT THERE TO TRY TO

04:17.457 --> 04:18.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELP INSURERS WITH THEIR HIGH-

04:18.725 --> 04:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COST CASES.

04:20.059 --> 04:21.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS CALLED REINSURANCE.

04:21.561 --> 04:22.695 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PROGRAM EXISTED FOR THREE

04:22.695 --> 04:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS.

04:23.963 --> 04:25.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S GOING AWAY IN 2018.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE MEMBERS ON BOTH SIDES

04:27.100 --> 04:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE AISLE TALKING ABOUT THAT.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE THOUGHT IS, IF YOU STEP

04:30.169 --> 04:31.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN AND TRY TO HELP WITH THOSE

04:31.437 --> 04:33.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIGH-COST CASES, THAT PREMIUMS

04:33.273 --> 04:34.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE REDUCED.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER

04:36.109 --> 04:37.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE BROADER BILLS FROM

04:37.577 --> 04:38.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS IN THE HOUSE AND THE

04:38.845 --> 04:40.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THESE INSURERS.

04:43.650 --> 04:44.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S KIND OF A MOVING TARGET

04:44.784 --> 04:45.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THIS POINT.

04:45.752 --> 04:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
