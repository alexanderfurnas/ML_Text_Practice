16:46.367 --> 16:49.100
RECOGNIZE THIS ACTIVITY AND OF

16:49.100 --> 16:50.633
COURSE OF MOST IMPORTANCE IS

16:50.633 --> 16:52.333
WHETHER CHILDREN ARE INVOLVED IN

16:52.333 --> 16:53.900
THE TRAFFICKING WHICH IS

16:53.900 --> 16:55.900
OBVIOUSLY A VERY GRIEVOUS CRIME.

16:55.900 --> 16:58.067
SO WE ARE LOOKING TO INTERRUPT

16:58.067 --> 17:00.333
THIS ACTIVITY WHERE AND WHEN I

17:00.333 --> 17:01.067
OCCURS

17:01.067 --> 17:05.267
AND WE'RE ALSO NOT JUST LOOKIN

17:05.267 --> 17:06.867
TO MAKE NECESSARILY ARREST

17:06.867 --> 17:08.567
ALTHOUGH THE TRAFFICKERS

17:08.567 --> 17:10.100
THEMSELVES, BUT WE'RE LOOKING TO

17:10.100 --> 17:10.967
RESCUE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE

17:10.967 --> 17:12.200
TRAPPED IN THIS LIFESTYLE.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.633

17:13.633 --> 17:15.933
OF SISTER PAT AND OTHERS ARE

17:15.933 --> 17:16.867
STARTING TO PAY OFF.

17:16.867 --> 17:19.233
BECAUSE OF HEIGHTENED AWARENES

AMONG LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL

17:19.967 --> 17:21.033
AND BUSINESS LEADERS

BUT SHE FEARS THE GAINS COUL

17:23.300 --> 17:23.933
EASILY BE LOST

17:23.933 --> 17:26.867

17:39.267 --> 17:41.933
WHERE HUMAN BEINGS ARE TREATED

17:41.933 --> 17:46.100

18:43.833 --> 18:45.233
UNION ADDRESS EARLIER THIS BEAK,

18:45.233 --> 18:47.967
PRESIDENT OBAMA UNVEILED A PLA

18:47.967 --> 18:49.367
DESIGNED TO HELP AMERICANS SAV

18:49.367 --> 18:50.133
FOR RETIREMENT

18:50.133 --> 18:52.800
SOMETHING HE CALLED A MYRA

18:52.800 --> 18:56.867
FOR MORE ON THIS, WE ARE JOINE

18:56.867 --> 18:59.100
BY THE CORRESPONDENT FOR REA

18:59.100 --> 18:59.967
CLEAR POLITICS

18:59.967 --> 19:02.100
FIRST OF ALL, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM

19:02.100 --> 19:02.700
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION SAYS

19:02.700 --> 19:04.700
THIS IS GOING TO ADDRESS

19:04.700 --> 19:06.267
>> WELL, THE ADMINISTRATION LIKE

19:06.267 --> 19:07.800
MANY PEOPLE, VERY WORRIED THAT

19:07.800 --> 19:09.667
MANY WORKERS IN THE UNITED

19:09.667 --> 19:10.667
STATES DON'T HAVE ANY OPTION

19:10.667 --> 19:11.767
THROUGH THEIR WORKPLACE TO SAV

19:11.767 --> 19:13.367
FOR RETIREMENT

19:13.367 --> 19:14.633
AND IN FACT, ARE NOT PUTTING

19:14.633 --> 19:16.900
MONEY AWAY FOR RETIREMENT AN

19:16.900 --> 19:18.100
WILL FIND THAT SOCIAL SECURITY

19:18.100 --> 19:19.633
ISN'T ENOUGH OR THAT THEY SHOULD

19:19.633 --> 19:20.500
HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR PRIVAT

19:20.500 --> 19:21.233
OPTIONS LIKE INDIVIDUA

19:21.233 --> 19:21.867
RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.

19:21.867 --> 19:23.633
SO AS PART OF HIS EXECUTIV

19:23.633 --> 19:30.633
INITIATIVES, THE PRESIDENT WIT

19:30.633 --> 19:33.400
THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT FINISHED

19:33.400 --> 19:35.100
A NEW PILOT PROGRAM, GET IT UP

19:35.100 --> 19:38.633
AND RUNNING, USE A PRIVATE

19:38.633 --> 19:40.500
FINANCIAL OFFICIAL AS TH

19:40.500 --> 19:41.933
ADMINISTRATOR, BUT GIVE MILLIONS

19:41.933 --> 19:43.833
OF WORKERS WHO DON'T HAV

19:43.833 --> 19:44.800
OPTIONS FOR THEIR EMPLOYMENT T

19:44.800 --> 19:46.667
SAVE IN LITTLE MICROACCOUNTS

19:46.667 --> 19:47.967
VERY RISK FREE

19:47.967 --> 19:49.667
THEY'LL BE LOW RETURNS, BUT IT

19:49.667 --> 19:50.800
WILL BE VERY SAFE.

19:50.800 --> 19:52.567
AND THEY'RE DESCRIBING THIS AS A

19:52.567 --> 19:55.300
WAY TO ALMOST HAVE A TRAINING OR

19:55.300 --> 19:56.133
BEGINNER SAVERS ACCOUNT THAT

19:56.133 --> 19:59.300
WOULD ALLOW WORKERS TO GET MOR

19:59.300 --> 20:01.500
USED TO PUTTING MONEY AWAY FOR

20:01.500 --> 20:02.800
RETIREMENT AND ACCRUE ENOUGH

20:02.800 --> 20:04.833
THEY COULD ROLL IT OVER INTO

20:04.833 --> 20:07.433
REGULAR IRA THAT WE'RE USED TO

20:07.433 --> 20:08.367
WHERE WE CHOOSE THE FUNDS WE

20:08.367 --> 20:09.233
WANT THE INVEST IN

20:09.233 --> 20:11.700
>> ONE OF THE POINTS WE'RE

20:11.700 --> 20:14.367
HEARING IS THAT THIS SOMETHING

20:14.367 --> 20:17.633
THAT EMPLOYEES WOULD B

20:17.633 --> 20:18.733
SOMETHING TO OPT OUT OF, THA

20:18.733 --> 20:19.000
IN

20:19.000 --> 20:20.800
>> NO, THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING

20:20.800 --> 20:22.700
HE'D LIKE CONGRESS TO TAKE UP

20:22.700 --> 20:26.267
SEPARATE LEGISLATIVE INITIATIV

20:26.267 --> 20:28.900
THAT WOULD BE CALLED THE OPT

20:28.900 --> 20:29.267
OUT.

20:29.267 --> 20:30.933
IT'S AN AUTOMATIC IRA AN

20:30.933 --> 20:33.233
CONGRESS IS A LITTLE RESISTANT

20:33.233 --> 20:33.800
THAT IDEA BECAUSE THEY'R

20:33.800 --> 20:34.433
CONCERNED IT WOULD REQUIRE

20:34.433 --> 20:35.033
EMPLOYERS TO SIGN UP THEIR

20:35.033 --> 20:35.800
WORKERS.

20:35.800 --> 20:41.233
AND THEY'D PREFER A --

20:41.233 --> 20:43.300
ESPECIALLY REPUBLICANS IT BE A

20:43.300 --> 20:44.200
VOLUNTARY IDEA, CONTINUING THE

20:44.200 --> 20:45.833
WAY WE'RE DOING IT NOW IN TH

20:45.833 --> 20:46.433
RETIREMENT SYSTEM.

20:46.433 --> 20:47.500
BUT THE PRESIDENT IS SAYIN

20:47.500 --> 20:48.767
THERE ARE MANY STUDIES OUT THERE

20:48.767 --> 20:51.067
THAT SUGGEST THAT WORKERS AR

20:51.067 --> 20:53.033
MUCH MORE LIKELY TO PUT ASID

20:53.033 --> 20:57.233
MONEY FOR RETIREMENT IF THEY'R

20:57.233 --> 20:58.767
AUTOMATICALLY SIGNED UP FOR AN

20:58.767 --> 20:59.667
ACCOUNT THROUGH THEIR WORKPLAC

20:59.667 --> 21:01.300
AND THEN THEY HAVE THE CHOICE TO

21:01.300 --> 21:01.867
OPT OUT.

21:01.867 --> 21:03.200
AND THERE ARE MANY ACADEMI

21:03.200 --> 21:05.800
STUDIES THAT SHOW THAT W

21:05.800 --> 21:06.767
OVERCOME OUR INERTIA ABOUT

21:06.767 --> 21:07.733
SAVING IF SOMEONE ACTUALLY

21:07.733 --> 21:09.167
STARTS TO EXECUTE IT FOR US.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.433
SO WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL

21:10.433 --> 21:13.533
SUPPORT, THE PRESIDENT IS SAYING

21:13.533 --> 21:16.600
HE WANTS TO CREATE THIS LITTLE

21:16.600 --> 21:18.700
STARTER SAVING ACCOUNT, THE MY

21:18.700 --> 21:20.900
R.A. AND TO ENCOURAGE WORKERS TO

21:20.900 --> 21:24.533
THINK OF PAYROLL DEDUCTION

21:24.533 --> 21:25.733
AUTOMATICALLY WITH THEIR

21:25.733 --> 21:28.767
EMPLOYERS AND THEY WOULD ACCRU

21:28.767 --> 21:30.400
MONEY IN A VERY SMALL WAY AN

21:30.400 --> 21:31.767
GET MORE USED TO SAVING.

21:31.767 --> 21:33.133
>> BRIEFLY, HOW DO THEY KNOW HOW

21:33.133 --> 21:34.300
MANY PEOPLE WOULD SIGN UP?

21:34.300 --> 21:36.233
>> VERY GOOD QUESTION.

21:36.233 --> 21:37.933
AND THEY DON'T KNOW.

21:37.933 --> 21:39.933
THEY HAVE SOME -- IN THE

21:39.933 --> 21:44.567
ADMINISTRATION SOME BALLPARK

21:44.567 --> 21:46.400
ESTIMATES, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW

21:46.400 --> 21:47.367
BEHAVIORALLY HOW MANY WORKER

21:47.367 --> 21:49.067
WOULD BE INTERESTED IN THIS, HOW

21:49.067 --> 21:50.900
MANY EMPLOYERS WILL MAKE THIS AN

21:50.900 --> 21:52.333
OPTION TO DO THE PAYROLL

21:52.333 --> 21:53.100
DEDUCTION.

21:53.100 --> 21:56.067
HOW WELL THEY'LL BE ABLE T

21:56.067 --> 21:57.367
SPREAD THE WORD THIS I

21:57.367 --> 21:57.633
AVAILABLE.

21:57.633 --> 21:59.767
SO THEY'RE NOT ESTIMATING HO

21:59.767 --> 22:01.033
MANY OTHER THAN TO SAY MAN

22:01.033 --> 22:02.300
MILLIONS THEY HOPE AFTER THE

22:02.300 --> 22:03.033
PILOT PROGRAM.

22:03.033 --> 22:04.467
>> ALL RIGHT

22:04.467 --> 22:06.133

22:50.233 --> 22:51.733
I'M GUILTY AND SICKENED BY THE

22:51.733 --> 22:53.633
FOOD WE THROW AWAY EVERY DAY

22:53.633 --> 22:55.733
I'D LOVE TO SEE MORE PROGRAMS TO

COMPOST AND RECYCLE THE FOOD W

22:57.167 --> 22:58.833
PUT IN OUR LANDFILLS EVERY DAY

22:58.833 --> 23:00.733
I BELIEVE THAT THE FOOD GIANTS

23:00.733 --> 23:02.967
WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE I

23:02.967 --> 23:05.033
WE COULD IMPLEMENT A COMPOSTIN

23:05.800 --> 23:07.800
BUT JIM GORDON WROTE, COMPOSTING
