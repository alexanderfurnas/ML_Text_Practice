JUDY WOODRUFF: The words from
Mexico's president,
Enrique Pena Nieto, this
afternoon said it

00:05.539 --> 00:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all: "Mission accomplished. We
have him."

00:08.442 --> 00:15.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The him is perhaps the world's
most-notorious
drug lord, Joaquin Guzman, known
as El Chapo,

00:15.048 --> 00:20.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the ringleader of the Sinaloa
cartel. He was
arrested after a fierce gun
battle today,

00:20.654 --> 00:25.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly six months after his
elaborate escape
from a high-security prison.

00:25.392 --> 00:27.461 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We go to Hari Sreenivasan for
more.

00:27.494 --> 00:31.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: I'm joined now
by Alfredo
Corchado, director of the
Borderlands program

00:31.999 --> 00:36.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Cronkite School of
Journalism at Arizona
State University. He has also
reported for

00:36.069 --> 00:41.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many years from Mexico for The
Dallas Morning
News, and is author of "Midnight
in Mexico,"

00:41.375 --> 00:44.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a book about his experience
covering the brutal
drug war.

00:44.811 --> 00:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, let's start with the basics.
What happened?
Where was he? How did he get
captured?

00:48.916 --> 00:51.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO, Arizona State
University:
Well, he was captured this
morning right before

00:51.919 --> 00:59.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dawn, intense firefight between
the marines
and drug traffickers, people
close to or guarding

00:59.259 --> 01:01.028 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Chapo Guzman.

01:01.061 --> 01:05.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we know is that, since last
July, the
marines, with the help of U.S.
intelligence,

01:05.365 --> 01:09.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been tracking him in several
Mexican states,
including Sinaloa, where he was
captured this

01:09.836 --> 01:14.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
morning, the state of Durango,
and even Tabasco.

01:14.675 --> 01:19.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This -- there were two
confrontations, from
what we know, the first one at a
private home

01:19.746 --> 01:24.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then he was later captured
at a motel.
Five of his trusted bodyguards
were killed,

01:24.718 --> 01:27.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and at least one marine was
wounded.

01:27.087 --> 01:31.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is the
second time
the president of Mexico has gone
on national

01:31.792 --> 01:36.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
television and said they have
got this guy.
I mean, this is an important
win.

01:36.330 --> 01:41.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: This is the
second time
for President Pena Nieto, and
the third time

01:41.768 --> 01:45.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that a Mexican president has
said that.

01:45.305 --> 01:49.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, you know, "Mission
accomplished,"
but I think a lot of people will
feel that

01:49.209 --> 01:54.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the mission has not been
accomplished until
Chapo actually faces justice.
And the best

01:54.448 --> 01:56.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chance of doing that will be on
the U.S. side.

01:56.817 --> 02:02.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there's a lot of tangling
already going
on, a lot of debate as to
whether he will

02:02.155 --> 02:03.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be extradited this time.

02:03.824 --> 02:08.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And let's talk
a little
bit about that. The United
States has asked

02:08.061 --> 02:11.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for extradition. Do you think
that that is
a greater possibility now?

02:11.431 --> 02:16.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: I think the
timing is -- it's
much better than last time.

02:16.803 --> 02:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, the first time he was
captured, there
was a lot of angst, a lot of
reticence within

02:21.675 --> 02:27.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Mexican government. There
was the suspicion
that you don't want to let the
Americans get

02:27.381 --> 02:29.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
too close, come in too close.

02:29.616 --> 02:35.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But after this huge
embarrassment that went
worldwide, I think there is a
sense that this

02:35.288 --> 02:39.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
may be good for Mexican
government. This obviously
will be good for the U.S.
government.

02:39.559 --> 02:45.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But keep in mind that Chapo
Guzman has a vast
army of lawyers. And I'm sure
that the -- even

02:45.198 --> 02:50.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before he's captured, there was
already a
fight to -- for temporary
injunctions that

02:50.837 --> 02:59.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prohibit or that would stop an
extradition.
It may happen, but I think it's
a long, long

02:59.513 --> 03:01.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ways before this happens.

03:01.248 --> 03:05.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What
involvement was there,
if any, by the U.S. in assisting
with the

03:05.852 --> 03:07.587 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
capture?

03:07.621 --> 03:11.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: Well, my
sources tell me
that the U.S. has been helping
the Mexican

03:11.491 --> 03:16.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marines since the capture with
intelligence,
but, unlike the first time,
there were no

03:16.496 --> 03:22.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. agents on the ground
assisting the Mexican
marines and the federal police.

03:22.669 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, this is a -- was primarily a
Mexican operation.

03:25.639 --> 03:31.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You know,
Chapo Guzman already
had almost folklore status, but
that prison

03:31.878 --> 03:36.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
break and how elaborate it was
just six months
ago really sealed it.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: Right.

03:38.885 --> 03:45.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, the premiere of the
movie "Chapo"
is in Mexico City. They're
expecting at least

03:45.625 --> 03:50.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four other movies this year.
There's talk
about a series, or there have
been books.

03:50.497 --> 03:56.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be interesting to see
how people in
regions in Mexico, especially
Sinaloa, how

03:56.203 --> 03:58.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they will react.

03:58.038 --> 04:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will they come out and protest
again because
of this arrest? Will they let it
go? I'm sure

04:03.043 --> 04:06.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there will be -- I'm sure there
are already
songs being written at this
moment, as we

04:06.079 --> 04:08.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
speak, about Chapo's latest
capture.

04:08.381 --> 04:14.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there some
sense that
this will be a more significant
blow to the

04:14.321 --> 04:20.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drug cartels? In some ways, his
capture or
his escape seems to be almost
representative

04:20.660 --> 04:25.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Mexican government's
ability to tackle
the drug war.

04:25.465 --> 04:30.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: And the
ability to try to
create a country with rule of
law.

04:30.103 --> 04:35.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what is interesting
about today's
capture is that Chapo's main
lieutenant known

04:35.542 --> 04:39.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as El Cholo Ivan was also
captured. So, that's
a huge blow to the Sinaloa
cartel.

04:39.446 --> 04:44.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as we have seen, the
Sinaloa cartel,
for a long time, has been really
under the

04:44.217 --> 04:50.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
control of Zambada, Mayo
Zambada. So, that
-- there might be some
territorial fights

04:50.290 --> 04:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in places like Ciudad Juarez,
and Chihuahua,
other places, but it's business
as usual,

04:56.429 --> 05:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as long as you have U.S. demand,
I think the
drugs will continue to come up
north.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Alfredo Corchado,
director of the Borderlands
program at the

05:03.937 --> 05:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cronkite School of Journalism at
Arizona State,
thanks so much for joining us.

05:06.807 --> 05:07.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALFREDO CORCHADO: Thank you.
