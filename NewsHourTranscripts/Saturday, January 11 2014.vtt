08:52.700 --> 08:54.433
>> THAT NIGHT, THE PRESIDENT DID

08:54.433 --> 08:56.600
NOT MENTION POVERTY IN THE

08:56.600 --> 08:56.833
SUBURBS.

08:56.833 --> 09:00.633
BUT IN THE YEAR SINCE THE NUMBER

09:00.633 --> 09:02.967
OF AMERICANS LIVING IN SUBURBS

09:02.967 --> 09:04.067
HAD SURGED

09:04.067 --> 09:07.200
IT'S A VERY REAL PROBLEM

09:07.200 --> 09:08.900
NEWSHOUR CORRESPONDENT MEGAN

09:08.900 --> 09:10.700
THOMPSON HAS THE FIRST REPORT IN

OUR YEAR LONG SERIES POVERTY I

09:11.967 --> 09:12.433
AMERICA.

09:12.433 --> 09:14.867
>> YOU WANT TO DO THE CHOCOLAT

09:14.867 --> 09:17.233
CHIP OR SUGAR COOKIES FIRST?

09:17.233 --> 09:18.667
>> BY ALL APPEARANCES, THI

09:18.667 --> 09:22.200
WOMAN IS LIVING A COMFORTABLE,

09:22.200 --> 09:23.900
SUBURBAN LIFE.

09:23.900 --> 09:25.133
SHE BAKED COOKIES AT HER MOM'S

09:25.133 --> 09:26.300
PLACE, ABOUT 65 MILES EAST O

09:26.300 --> 09:27.700
NEW YORK CITY.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.400
SHE OWNS AN SUV.

09:31.400 --> 09:34.767
THE GIRLS SPEND THEIR DAYS AT

09:34.767 --> 09:35.600
NICE DAY-CARE CENTER

09:35.600 --> 09:36.433
AND SHE WORKS A FULL-TIME JOB.

09:36.433 --> 09:37.200
>> PEOPLE LOOK AT ME AND THE

09:37.200 --> 09:38.067
JUDGE ME BY LOOKING AT ME LIKE

09:38.067 --> 09:38.633
OKAY, SHE HAS A JOB.

09:38.633 --> 09:39.833
YOU KNOW

09:39.833 --> 09:41.867
SHE -- YOU KNOW, SHE HAS A HOME.

09:41.867 --> 09:44.967
AND, YOU KNOW, HE KIDS LOOK WELL

09:44.967 --> 09:46.567
TAKEN CARE OF.

09:46.567 --> 09:49.500
WHY WOULD SHE NEED ANY HELP AT

09:49.500 --> 09:53.000
ALL?

09:53.000 --> 09:56.267
>> SHE NEEDS HELP BECAUSE BY

09:56.267 --> 09:56.400
OFFICIAL STANDARDS SHE AND HER

09:56.400 --> 09:58.000
DAUGHTERS LIVE IN POVERTY.

09:58.000 --> 10:00.233
HER JOB AS A CERTIFIED MEDICAL

10:00.233 --> 10:01.133
ASSISTANT PAYS JUST OVER $19,000

10:01.133 --> 10:08.733
A YEAR AND OFFERS NO BENEFITS.

10:08.733 --> 10:13.133
SO SHE IS ON MEDICAID AND GETS

10:13.133 --> 10:14.167
SUBSIDIES TO PAY FOR MEDICAL

10:14.167 --> 10:15.300
CARE SHE COULDN'T AFFORD

10:15.300 --> 10:17.333
THIS SINGLE MOM LIVES IN THE TWO

HER CAR HAS ALMOST 200,000 MILES

10:22.233 --> 10:23.167
ON IT.

10:23.167 --> 10:24.000
AND IS IN SUCH BAD SHAPE, SHE'

10:24.000 --> 10:28.100
AFRAID TO DRIVE IT

10:28.100 --> 10:30.133
>> I LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK

10:30.133 --> 10:31.133
THAT'S WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW.

10:31.133 --> 10:31.433
YEAH

10:31.433 --> 10:32.367
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY SAVINGS

10:32.367 --> 10:33.333
>> TYPICALLY, I HAVE ENOUG

10:33.333 --> 10:34.967
PROBABLY TO GET ME THROUGH THE

10:34.967 --> 10:40.000
NEXT WEEK OR SO.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.467
BUT AS FAR AS HAVING A SAVINGS

10:41.467 --> 10:41.800
NO

10:41.800 --> 10:44.600
I WORRY ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE T

10:44.600 --> 10:45.567
HAVE ENOUGH FOOD TO FEED THE

10:45.567 --> 10:45.867
GIRLS.

10:45.867 --> 10:46.867
I WORRY ABOUT THEM NOT HAVIN

10:46.867 --> 10:48.467
THE OPPORTUNITY THAT OTHER KID

10:48.467 --> 10:52.267
ARE GONNA HAVE

10:52.267 --> 10:52.833
SO I'M CONSTANTLY WORRYING

10:52.833 --> 10:53.067
YOU KNOW

10:53.067 --> 10:54.133
I'M ALWAYS WORRYING.

10:54.133 --> 10:56.433
>> ACCORDING TO EXPERTS, STORIES

10:56.433 --> 10:58.500
LIKE LEE'S ARE BECOMING MORE

10:58.500 --> 11:02.800
COMMON ACROSS THE UNITED STATES.

11:02.800 --> 11:04.067
>> THERE ARE NOW MORE POOR

11:04.067 --> 11:06.733
RESIDENTS LIVING IN SUBURBS THAN

11:06.733 --> 11:08.267
IN MAJOR CITIES.

11:08.267 --> 11:13.300
>> ELIZABETH ME NEW BONN IS

11:13.300 --> 11:15.000
CO-AUTHOR OF A BOOK CONFRONTIN

11:15.000 --> 11:16.100
POVERTY IN AMERICA

11:16.100 --> 11:17.300
>> IT CAN BE HIDDEN.

11:17.300 --> 11:20.567
IT CAN BE HARDER TO IDENTIFY O

11:20.567 --> 11:22.033
EVEN UNDERSTAND THE EXTENT T

11:22.033 --> 11:23.600
WHICH NEED HAS GROWN BECAUSE I

11:23.600 --> 11:26.400
MAY NOT BE EASILY VISIBLE.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.733
>> TODAY THE NATION'S POVERT

11:28.733 --> 11:28.867
RATE IS ABOUT 15% COMPARED T

11:28.867 --> 11:32.533
19% IN 1964.

11:32.533 --> 11:34.333
WHEN PRESIDENT JOHNSON DECLARE

11:34.333 --> 11:35.533
THE WAR ON POVERTY

11:35.533 --> 11:38.867
>> OUR AIM IS NOT ONLY T

11:38.867 --> 11:40.633
RELIEVE THE SYMPTOM OF POVERTY

11:40.633 --> 11:41.633
BUT TO CURE IT

11:41.633 --> 11:43.433
>> NEWBONE SAYS SOME ASPECTS

11:43.433 --> 11:45.167
HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.

11:45.167 --> 11:48.833
>> WELL, WHEN WE SAW THE LAUNC

11:48.833 --> 11:52.367
OF THE WAR ON POVERTY, THE

11:52.367 --> 11:53.733
GEOGRAPHY OF POVERTY IS VERY

11:53.733 --> 11:54.800
DIFFERENT THAN TODAY

11:54.800 --> 11:57.667
THE BULK OF POOR PEOPLE IN THE

11:57.667 --> 11:58.567
COUNTRY LIVED IN URBAN AREAS

11:58.567 --> 11:59.267
BIG CITIES OR IN RURAL

11:59.267 --> 12:00.500
COMMUNITIES.

12:00.500 --> 12:02.733
AND SINCE THAT TIME, WE HAVE

12:02.733 --> 12:06.500
SEEN A REAL SHIFT.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.433
>> ACCORDING TO NEWBONE TH

12:08.433 --> 12:08.533
NUMBER OF PEOPLE LIVING IN

12:08.533 --> 12:12.467
SUBURBS HAS GROWN BY 65%

12:12.467 --> 12:14.100
FOR EXAMPLE, POVERTY IS UP B

12:14.100 --> 12:15.667
ALMOST 16% IN THE SUBURBS OF

12:15.667 --> 12:18.133
PITTSBURGH

12:18.133 --> 12:20.367
UP MORE THAN 27% IN THE SUBURB

12:20.367 --> 12:21.600
OF PROVIDENCE.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.033
UP NEARLY 79% OUTSIDE SEATTLE.

12:24.033 --> 12:26.433
AND IN THE SUBURBS OF AUSTIN

12:26.433 --> 12:27.467
TEXAS, THE NUMBER OF POOR HA

12:27.467 --> 12:32.533
SWELLED ALMOST 143%.

12:32.533 --> 12:34.633
MORE POOR PEOPLE LIVE IN

12:34.633 --> 12:35.800
AMERICA'S SUBURBS THAN IN CITIES

12:35.800 --> 12:37.200
OR RURAL AREAS

12:37.200 --> 12:39.733
THE MAIN EXPLANATION IS SIMPLY

12:39.733 --> 12:40.033
DEMOGRAPHICS

12:40.033 --> 12:41.200
MANY MORE AMERICANS HAVE MOVED

12:41.200 --> 12:43.033
TO SUBURBS IN RECENT YEARS

12:43.033 --> 12:44.633
AND THAT GROWTH INCLUDED LOW

12:44.633 --> 12:46.467
INCOME RESIDENTS AND NEW

12:46.467 --> 12:47.067
IMMIGRANTS

12:47.067 --> 12:48.500
OTHER FACTORS -- SUBURBS ARE

12:48.500 --> 12:49.800
STILL RECOVERING FROM TH

12:49.800 --> 12:51.067
FORECLOSURE AND FINANCIA

12:51.067 --> 12:53.067
CRISES

12:53.067 --> 12:54.167
FEDERAL PROGRAMS FOR THE POO

12:54.167 --> 12:55.867
WERE MOSTLY DESIGNED BACK IN THE

12:55.867 --> 12:58.300
'60s WITH RURAL OR URBAN

12:58.300 --> 12:59.133
COMMUNITIES IN MIND.

12:59.133 --> 13:02.400
AND WHEN HARD TIMES CAME TO TH

13:02.400 --> 13:04.867
SUBURBS, MANY WERE NOT PREPARED.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.933
>> OFTEN, SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES

13:05.933 --> 13:07.033
HAVE NOT BUILT UP THE SAME LEVEL

13:07.033 --> 13:09.167
OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND SAFETY NET

13:09.167 --> 13:12.033
SUPPORT THAT CITIES HAVE BEE

13:12.033 --> 13:14.567
BUILDING UP OVER DECADES

13:14.567 --> 13:18.467
>> OH, BOY

13:18.467 --> 13:21.333
WHERE DO I BEGIN WITH TH

13:21.333 --> 13:22.833
CHALLENGES

13:31.667 --> 13:34.567
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FACE GREATER

13:34.567 --> 13:35.533
BURDENS IN THE FACE OF FEDERAL

13:35.533 --> 13:37.100
BUDGET CUTS AND THE WINDING DOWN

13:37.100 --> 13:38.767
OF STIMULUS FUNDS.

13:38.767 --> 13:40.800
>> SUFFOLK COUNTY IN THE LAS

13:40.800 --> 13:43.800
COUPLE OF YEARS HAS FACE

13:43.800 --> 13:44.500
$500 MILLION DEFICIT

13:44.500 --> 13:49.467
>> EVEN THOUGH SUFFOLK COUNT

13:49.467 --> 13:49.700
HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST MEDIA

13:49.700 --> 13:52.433
HOUSEHOLD INCOMES IN THE COUNTRY

THAT'S THE CASE THROUGHOUT MUC

FOOD STAMP USE UP DRAMATICALLY

14:03.400 --> 14:03.867
COAST TO COAST

14:03.867 --> 14:05.433
>> IT CAN BE DIFFICULT TO TR

14:05.433 --> 14:08.167
AND SCALE UP TO MEET THE LEVEL

14:08.167 --> 14:10.733
OF NEED THAT THEY'RE SEEING.

14:10.733 --> 14:16.133
>> IN SUFFOLK COUNTY, CHARITIE

14:16.133 --> 14:18.300
HAVE STEPPED UP AS THE LOCAL

14:18.300 --> 14:20.300
GOVERNMENTS HAVE HAD A HARD TIME

14:20.300 --> 14:21.600
MEETING THE DEMAND

14:21.600 --> 14:23.600
FOOD PANTRY ORGANIZERS HAVE SEEN

CAROL YARDMISCH LEADS THIS ONE

14:29.567 --> 14:30.767

14:35.233 --> 14:36.400
PANTRIES AND IT'S MULTIPLYING ON

14:36.400 --> 14:37.400
THE LEVEL THAT IT'S HARD T

14:37.400 --> 14:38.933
COMPREHEND

14:38.933 --> 14:40.300
>> ADVOCATES SAY THEY'RE NOT

14:40.300 --> 14:42.400
JUST SERVING PEOPLE OUT OF WORK.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.900
THEY SEE MANY WITH JOBS WH

14:43.900 --> 14:46.333
CAN'T MAKE ENDS MEET

14:46.333 --> 14:48.100
JUST LIKE LEE.

14:48.100 --> 14:49.867
NATIONALLY, REAL WAGES ADJUSTE

14:49.867 --> 14:51.467
FOR INFLATION HAVE BEEN FLAT FOR

14:51.467 --> 14:51.633
SEVERAL DECADES.

14:51.633 --> 14:52.600
EVEN AS COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE

14:52.600 --> 14:54.633
>> WE ALSO HAVE THESE LARGER

14:54.633 --> 14:56.733
SHIFTS IN THE ECONOMY WHERE

14:56.733 --> 15:01.067
LOT OF THE JOBS WE'RE CREATING

15:01.067 --> 15:02.367
DON'T PAY ENOUGH TO MAKE END

15:02.367 --> 15:03.333
MEET FOR A FAMILY.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.333
SO EVEN IF YOU'RE WORKIN

15:05.333 --> 15:06.500
FULL-TIME, YOU'RE JUST NOT

15:06.500 --> 15:07.633
TAKING HOME ENOUGH

15:07.633 --> 15:10.067
>> THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE IN

15:10.067 --> 15:10.667
SUFFOLK COUNTY

15:10.667 --> 15:11.700
WHERE MANY WORKING POOR DON'

15:11.700 --> 15:13.767
QUALIFY FOR GOVERNMENT HEL

15:13.767 --> 15:16.033
BECAUSE THEY EARN TOO MUCH TO BE

15:16.033 --> 15:17.100
CONSIDERED OFFICIALLY POOR

15:17.100 --> 15:18.233
AROUND $23,500 FOR A FAMILY OF

FOUR

>> DESPITE OUR AFFLUENCE, WE

15:20.767 --> 15:24.500
HAVE A LOT OF MIDDLE INCOM

15:24.500 --> 15:25.400
PEOPLE WHO ARE STRUGGLING.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.600
WE ARE ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE

15:27.600 --> 15:29.800
COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES

15:29.800 --> 15:33.200
IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING

15:33.200 --> 15:34.433
GASOLINE, HOUSING, FOOD.

15:34.433 --> 15:35.933
>> IN 2012, THE COMMISSION PUT

15:35.933 --> 15:38.667
OUT A STUDY ESTIMATING THA

15:38.667 --> 15:41.467
BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST O

15:41.467 --> 15:42.900
LIVING HERE, THE POVERTY RATE'

15:42.900 --> 15:44.800
AT LEAST 20%

15:44.800 --> 15:46.167
THAT'S THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN

15:46.167 --> 15:47.500
THE OFFICIAL CENSUS FIGURE O

15:47.500 --> 15:48.300
LESS THAN 7%

15:48.300 --> 15:49.667
ANOTHER MAJOR PROBLEM AN

15:49.667 --> 15:51.300
EXPENSE IS TRANSPORTATION.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.767
IN MANY SUBURBS, PUBLI

15:52.767 --> 15:56.367
TRANSPORTATION IS LIMITED.

15:56.367 --> 15:59.500
UNTIL RECENTLY, BUSES IN SUFFOLK

15:59.500 --> 16:00.533
COUNTY DIDN'T RUN ON SUNDAYS

16:00.533 --> 16:02.200

16:02.200 --> 16:05.000
PERSON, IF YOU'RE A HOME HEALT

16:05.000 --> 16:09.300
AIDE, MANY WORK ON SUNDAYS, WHAT

16:09.300 --> 16:11.033
DO YOU DO?

16:11.033 --> 16:13.300
HOW DO YOU GET TO WORK

16:13.300 --> 16:14.433
YOU COULD TAKE A CAB, WHIC

16:14.433 --> 16:16.967
COULD EAT UP TO 20% OF WHA

16:16.967 --> 16:17.100
YOU'RE EARNING THAT DAY.

16:17.100 --> 16:19.567
>> SO MANY POOR PEOPLE DEPEND ON

THEIR CAR AND CAR INSURANCE AN

16:22.767 --> 16:25.433
GAS EAT UP ABOUT $600, MORE THAN

16:25.433 --> 16:27.800
40% OF THE ROUGHLY $1,400 SH

16:27.800 --> 16:28.900
TAKES HOME EACH MONTH.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.300
IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING, HE

16:30.300 --> 16:33.033
MOM WHO JUST TURNED 60 REALL

16:33.033 --> 16:34.800
ISN'T IN A POSITION TO HELP.

INHERITED.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.200
AND IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

16:47.200 --> 16:48.267
IT'S SO EXPENSIVE.

16:48.267 --> 16:51.100

FAMILY THAT I HAVE

I HAVE BEEN WORKING EVER SINCE

MORE THAN WHAT I'M ASKING FOR,

YOU KNOW

I UNDERSTAND THE BACKLASH, I

17:37.633 --> 17:38.200
REALLY DO.

THE MORE SHE EARNS THE WORSE OFF

17:47.100 --> 17:51.900
SHE MIGHT BE

IS A REAL PRESSING POLIC

18:33.467 --> 18:35.267
CONCERN, LOOKING FORWARD

IF WE THINK ABOUT THE WAR ON

18:41.133 --> 18:42.867
POVERTY, 50 YEARS AGO WHEN

18:42.867 --> 18:44.800
LYNDON JOHNSON DECLARED THIS

WAR, IF EVERYBODY HAD KNOWN WHAT

WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, WHAT WOUL

WE HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY

THIS IS OUR OPPORTUNITY NOW FO

POVERTY -- STAGNATING WAGES.

18:59.233 --> 18:59.600
AS THIS GRAPHIC SHOWS, WAGES

18:59.600 --> 19:01.300
ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION HAVE BEEN

19:01.300 --> 19:02.833
FLAT DURING THE PAST 45 YEARS.

19:02.833 --> 19:05.933
BUT CONSUMER PRICES HAVE BEE

19:05.933 --> 19:07.700
RISING SHARPLY DURING THAT SAM

PERIOD

19:08.133 --> 19:09.800
FOR MORE ABOUT THIS AND IT

19:09.800 --> 19:14.300

CONTRIBUTOR FOR BLOOMBER

19:17.700 --> 19:18.733
BUSINESS WEEK.

19:18.733 --> 19:20.633
LET'S TALK ABOUT THE GAP

19:20.633 --> 19:22.600
BETWEEN WAGING AND PURCHASIN

19:22.600 --> 19:22.833
POWER.

19:22.833 --> 19:23.967
WHY IS THAT DIFFERENT?

19:23.967 --> 19:25.533
>> BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT TH

19:25.533 --> 19:28.833
FACT THAT I MADE $50 A WEE

19:28.833 --> 19:30.033
LET'S SAY FOR ARGUMENT'S SAK

19:30.033 --> 19:31.367
AND I MAKE $60 RIGHT NOW AND

19:31.367 --> 19:32.800
IT'S NOT BAD, IN REALITY YOU'R

19:32.800 --> 19:35.633
FOOLING YOURSELF IN REAL TERMS

19:35.633 --> 19:36.933
BECAUSE INFLATION IS PERNICIOU

19:36.933 --> 19:38.833
EVEN IF IT'S GROWING IN THE LO

19:38.833 --> 19:41.367
SINGLE DIGITS LIKE 2% OR 2.5

19:41.367 --> 19:42.767
LIKE WE HAVE BEEN USED TO FO

19:42.767 --> 19:44.000
THE PAST DECADE.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.233
WHEN YOU COMPOUND IT OVE

19:47.233 --> 19:48.467
SEVERAL DECADES IT'S LIK

19:48.467 --> 19:51.033
SINGEING OFF THREE QUARTERS OF

19:51.033 --> 19:52.467
YOUR DOLLAR EVERY TIME YOU TAK

19:52.467 --> 19:53.600
IT OF THE POCKET

19:53.600 --> 19:55.133
IN THE END, WHEN THEY CAN'T BU

19:55.133 --> 19:56.667
AS MUCH AS THEY USED TO, ON WHAT

19:56.667 --> 19:57.767
THEY WERE MAKING, THEY GET BLIND

19:57.767 --> 19:58.067
SIDED.

19:58.067 --> 19:59.933
>> SO WHAT ARE SOME OF THE

19:59.933 --> 20:01.067
FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO IT

20:01.067 --> 20:02.333
PEOPLE WILL SAY, LISTEN, NOW,

20:02.333 --> 20:04.433
HAVE ACCESS TO GOODS AND

20:04.433 --> 20:05.933
SERVICES FROM ALL OVER THE

20:05.933 --> 20:07.067
WORLD, EVEN CHEAPER PRICES

20:07.067 --> 20:07.867
SO MAYBE I DON'T NEED TO MAKE AS

20:07.867 --> 20:08.100
MUCH

20:08.100 --> 20:09.733
>> WELL, THAT IS TEMPERED TH

20:09.733 --> 20:11.367
PAIN, CERTAINLY, BUT THAT'S

20:11.367 --> 20:14.700
FUNCTION OF REALLY AGGRESSIV

MAYBE AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE FROM

20:25.000 --> 20:26.367

FOUR AND PUTTING KIDS THROUG

20:35.233 --> 20:37.733
SCHOOL AND WHAT NOT.

20:37.733 --> 20:37.967
THAT'S SO DETERIORATED OVER TH

20:37.967 --> 20:39.633
PAST SEVERAL DECADES

20:39.633 --> 20:41.200
YOU CAN'T COUNT ON THERE BEING

MORE THAN WHAT ACTUALLY GETS

YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
