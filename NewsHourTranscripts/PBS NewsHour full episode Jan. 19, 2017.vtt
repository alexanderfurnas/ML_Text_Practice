invisible fence keeping older
women out of

00:46.747 --> 00:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE, Author, "
Fifty-Five, Unemployed
and Faking Normal": You're the
loser.

00:50.417 --> 00:54.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, how can you have this
kind of background
and be landing here?

00:54.421 --> 01:02.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's

01:02.262 --> 01:04.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.065 --> 01:15.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

to tomorrow for Donald Trump.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He made ready today for his
formal inauguration
as president.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.650 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has our report.

01:23.750 --> 01:28.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: President-elect Trump
arrived at
Joint Base Andrews outside
Washington almost

01:28.388 --> 01:32.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exactly 24 hours before he takes
the oath
of office.

01:32.893 --> 01:37.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vice president-elect Mike Pence
was already
in Washington, talking up the
transition.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKE PENCE (R), Vice
President-Elect: I'm
pleased to have a chance to
report, to the

01:41.034 --> 01:47.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American people and to all of
you, the progress
that we have made at the
president-elect's

01:47.174 --> 01:51.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
direction preparing a team that
will be ready
to serve the American people and
making America

01:52.079 --> 01:53.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
great again on day one.

01:53.914 --> 01:58.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But a series of
reports, including
in The New York Times and
Politico, quoted

01:58.552 --> 02:04.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama national security
officials saying that
the Trump team's delay in
filling some jobs

02:04.124 --> 02:05.859 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had slowed the transition.

02:05.959 --> 02:12.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Trump spokesman Sean
Spicer key Obama
officials would stay until
successors were

02:12.432 --> 02:14.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
picked.

02:14.501 --> 02:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, Incoming White
House Press Secretary:
We have appointed 50 people to
maintain critical

02:15.435 --> 02:18.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
positions to maintain their
office.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have looked through the
entire government
and found areas where there is a
critical

02:21.742 --> 02:23.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
need to maintain someone.

02:23.610 --> 02:27.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: They include Deputy
Secretary of
Defense Robert Work, and Brett
McGurk, the

02:27.914 --> 02:31.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
envoy to the International
Coalition Combating
ISIS.

02:31.151 --> 02:37.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, Spicer slammed
Senate Minority
Leader Chuck Schumer for slowing
the confirmation

02:37.591 --> 02:38.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Mr. Trump's Cabinet.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEAN SPICER: Why are they
delaying Elaine
Chao?

02:41.294 --> 02:43.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why are they not moving on Dr.
Ben Carson?

02:43.430 --> 02:45.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why are they not moving on
Governor Nikki
Haley?

02:45.365 --> 02:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Schumer said the
delays were over
ethics concerns.

02:48.635 --> 02:50.337 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:50.437 --> 02:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: If
there were ever a group of
Cabinet nominees

02:53.740 --> 02:57.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that cry out for rigorous
scrutiny, it's this
one.

02:58.011 --> 03:06.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every day, there's another
report of a major
ethical lapse among the nominees
for the Cabinet,

03:06.520 --> 03:07.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the swamp Cabinet.

03:07.654 --> 03:10.657 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Spicer said it's all
politics.

03:10.757 --> 03:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: These people have
had their paperwork
in.

03:12.559 --> 03:16.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their quality and caliber and
integrity is
unquestionable.

03:16.630 --> 03:20.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think to see some of these
attacks and
the focus not be on issues like
schools and

03:20.967 --> 03:23.904 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
teachers and homeland security
is a problem.

03:24.004 --> 03:28.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: This morning, Mr.
Trump made his
final Cabinet pick, naming
former Georgia

03:29.009 --> 03:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Governor Sonny Perdue as his
choice to be
agriculture secretary.

03:33.346 --> 03:37.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Perdue was the state's first
Republican governor
since Reconstruction and started
businesses

03:38.018 --> 03:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that deal in fertilizers and
grain trading.

03:41.088 --> 03:45.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With the Perdue pick, Mr. Trump
had rounded
out a proposed Cabinet slate
that, for the

03:45.192 --> 03:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first time in nearly 30 years,
includes no
Hispanic nominees.

03:51.631 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Spokesman Spicer insisted today
that, in time,
there will be diversity, when
the Trump administration

03:57.137 --> 03:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is considered in its totality.

03:59.005 --> 04:02.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: He continues to put
together
an amazingly diverse Cabinet.

04:02.442 --> 04:06.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think, so if you're
looking specifically
at Hispanics, I think, as we
move forward,

04:06.213 --> 04:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we have got 5,000 jobs to fill.

04:08.849 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There is going to be a
tremendous number of
Hispanic-Americans that fill
those posts.

04:13.453 --> 04:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Later, at a luncheon
at his Trump
Hotel in Washington, he
indicated that Woody

04:18.391 --> 04:23.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Johnson, owner of the New York
Jets NFL team,
would be nominated as ambassador
to Great

04:23.597 --> 04:25.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Britain.

04:25.765 --> 04:30.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This afternoon, Mr. Trump took
part in a wreath-laying
ceremony at the Tomb of the
Unknown, a tradition

04:30.270 --> 04:37.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for incoming presidents on the
eve of taking
office.

04:37.444 --> 04:43.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He ended his day making an
entrance at a sunset
concert on the steps of the
Lincoln Memorial.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:45.986 --> 04:51.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: President
Obama issued a final round of
commutations

04:51.925 --> 04:54.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on his last full day in office.

04:54.494 --> 05:00.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He shortened the prison
sentences of 330 federal
inmates convicted of drug
crimes, the most

05:00.734 --> 05:03.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ever commutations in a single
day.

05:03.136 --> 05:09.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The White House said he's now
cut the sentences
of 1,715 people during his time
in office.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's more than any other
American president.

05:12.946 --> 05:19.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also freed 568 inmates who
had been serving
life terms in prison.

05:19.152 --> 05:24.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obama administration has
punctuated its
fight against the Islamic State
with a major

05:24.391 --> 05:26.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
airstrike in Libya.

05:26.293 --> 05:31.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Pentagon says that it
targeted militants
who were actively planning
attacks in Europe.

05:31.131 --> 05:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The raid last night hit ISIS
camps 30 miles
south of the Libyan city of
Sirte, and it

05:36.937 --> 05:38.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
killed 80 fighters.

05:38.705 --> 05:45.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two B-2 stealth bombers flew for
30 hours,
from Missouri to Libya and back,
and they

05:45.445 --> 05:48.148 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
dropped roughly 100 guided
bombs.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.717 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The planes had not seen combat
since 2011.

05:50.817 --> 05:54.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER COOK, Pentagon Press
Secretary: This
was a decision made by
commanders based on

05:55.088 --> 05:59.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the specific mission
requirements here, the
capabilities of the B-2
specifically, not

05:59.559 --> 06:03.563 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on in terms of its payload but
also its ability
to loiter.

06:03.663 --> 06:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were specific reasons why
the commanders
felt this was the appropriate
platform to

06:07.467 --> 06:09.336 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
use.

06:09.436 --> 06:12.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Pentagon says
that initial
assessments are that the strike
was successful,

06:12.205 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's unclear whether any
high-profile
ISIS leaders were killed.

06:17.043 --> 06:20.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The death toll from yesterday's
suicide bombing
in Mali has risen to 77.

06:20.947 --> 06:27.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bombers struck government
forces and former
rebels who've been trying to
enforce a 2015

06:27.721 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
peace treaty.

06:29.656 --> 06:33.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Surveillance footage captured
the blast as
the vehicle breached a compound
where fighters

06:33.727 --> 06:35.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had gathered for a meeting.

06:35.328 --> 06:39.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A group linked to al-Qaida
claimed responsibility.

06:39.532 --> 06:44.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A political crisis intensified
in the African
nation of Gambia today, with the
defeated

06:44.571 --> 06:47.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president refusing to step
aside.

06:47.507 --> 06:52.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Troops from neighboring states
entered the
small West African nation to
force him out,

06:52.379 --> 06:54.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after the new president took the
oath of office.

The man beaten in elections last
year, Yahya
Jammeh, is digging his heels in,
holed up

07:38.558 --> 07:45.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the presidential palace, in
power for 22
years, once said he'd rule
Gambia for a billion

07:45.298 --> 07:47.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

border, ultimate destination,
the capital.

08:09.289 --> 08:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a decisive moment for
the region,
an early intervention by a
coalition of West

08:13.793 --> 08:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African countries dealing with a
West African
problem, the inauguration, a
decisive moment

08:19.866 --> 08:21.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for Gambians themselves.

08:21.768 --> 08:27.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, the West
African military
force halted its advance into
Gambia until

The casualty figures fluctuated
as rescuers
searched the wreckage for
survivors and bodies.

08:48.661 --> 08:54.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State TV showed the moment the
historic building
crumbled, with firefighters
still inside.

08:54.501 --> 08:59.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One official said the fire was
caused by an
electrical short-circuit.

08:59.339 --> 09:04.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Central Italy, rescuers spent
this day
desperately digging into a
luxury mountain

09:04.344 --> 09:07.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hotel that was shattered by an
avalanche.

09:07.313 --> 09:13.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They found two survivors and two
bodies, but
up to 30 people could have been
inside.

09:13.119 --> 09:19.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Aerial views showed the
four-story hotel buried
up the roof, and its sides
smashed in.

09:19.359 --> 09:24.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Crew used heavy vehicles to
clear paths through
snow as deep as 16 feet.

09:24.697 --> 09:31.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I want
to say that
we are all holding our breath
for what has

09:31.371 --> 09:33.006 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened last night with the
avalanche.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw the videos of rescuers
reaching the
hotel.

09:36.042 --> 09:40.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These videos bear testimony to
the sense of
duty of the rescuers, but also
to the very

09:40.513 --> 09:42.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hard conditions they are
operating in.

09:42.415 --> 09:46.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The avalanche
followed a series
of strong earthquakes in the
area, but it's

09:46.786 --> 09:50.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
unclear if the quakes caused the
disaster.

09:50.223 --> 09:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mexico announced late today that
it has extradited
the accused drug lord Joaquin
"El Chapo" Guzman

09:56.529 --> 09:57.564 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the U.S.

09:57.664 --> 10:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He allegedly founded and led the
Sinaloa cartel.

10:00.834 --> 10:04.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Guzman was captured in Mexico in
early 2014.

10:04.604 --> 10:08.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He escaped and was finally
recaptured a year
ago.

10:08.608 --> 10:13.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Back in this country, the
Republican National
Committee has elected a new
chair, Ronna Romney

10:13.980 --> 10:15.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
McDaniel.

10:15.882 --> 10:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's a niece of Mitt Romney,
the party's
presidential nominee four years
ago, and the

10:19.185 --> 10:21.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
choice of president-elect Trump.

10:21.387 --> 10:26.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She takes over for Reince
Priebus, who's becoming
Mr. Trump's White House chief of
staff.

10:27.060 --> 10:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks
slipped again,
as yields on bonds rose.

10:31.531 --> 10:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 72 points
to close at 19732.

10:35.869 --> 10:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 15, and the S&amp;P
500 slipped
eight.

10:40.840 --> 10:46.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the nominees
for treasury and energy
secretary face tough

10:47.080 --> 10:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions before the Senate; a
rocky presidential
transition on national security;
the difficult

10:54.120 --> 11:03.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
road of people who appear
middle-class, but
are on the edge of financial
ruin; and much

11:03.429 --> 11:07.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

11:07.700 --> 11:15.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president-elect moved a bit
closer to
getting his Cabinet in place
with another

11:15.575 --> 11:18.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
round of confirmation hearings
today.

11:18.111 --> 11:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The most contentious was for his
treasury
secretary pick, Steven Mnuchin,
a billionaire

11:23.283 --> 11:27.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
banker who worked at Goldman
Sachs and owned
a hedge fund.

11:27.253 --> 11:30.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was important news that
came out during
the hearing.

11:30.590 --> 11:35.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mnuchin said that he would
support raising
the debt ceiling sooner rather
than later,

11:35.795 --> 11:38.031 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and not risk the country
defaulting.

11:38.131 --> 11:42.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The president-elect had
previously suggested
that he might want to
renegotiate the government's

11:42.669 --> 11:44.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
obligations instead.

11:44.737 --> 11:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But most of the focus was on
Mnuchin's business
background and investments.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins has our report.

11:51.578 --> 11:55.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: He came
prepared for a broadside
attack.

11:55.682 --> 11:59.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN MNUCHIN, Treasury
Secretary Nominee:
I have been maligned as taking
advantage of

11:59.152 --> 12:03.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
others' hardships in order to
earn a buck.

12:03.156 --> 12:06.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nothing could be further than
the truth.

12:06.359 --> 12:10.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Steven Mnuchin
began his
appeal to become treasury
secretary by defending

12:10.930 --> 12:16.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
his record at the helm of
OneWest, a bank
that Democratic critics say was
a foreclosure

12:16.436 --> 12:18.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
machine during the housing
crisis.

12:18.271 --> 12:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN: OneWest extended
over 100,000
loan modifications to delinquent
borrowers

12:24.010 --> 12:26.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to try to help them out of a bad
situation.

12:26.346 --> 12:30.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Oregon
Democrat Ron Wyden
disputed Mnuchin's version.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:32.852 --> 12:36.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RON WYDEN (D), Oregon:
Investigations found
that the bank frequently
mishandled documents

12:36.255 --> 12:38.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and skipped over reviewing them.

12:38.891 --> 12:48.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All it took to plunge families
into the nightmare
of potentially losing their home
was 30 seconds

12:48.234 --> 12:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of sloppy paperwork and a few
haphazard signatures.

12:52.405 --> 12:57.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was some of
the most dogged
questioning of president-elect
Trump's nominees

12:57.610 --> 13:00.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
yet, and it was tense between
senators.

13:00.813 --> 13:02.548 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:02.649 --> 13:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAT ROBERTS (R), Kansas: Senator
Wyden, I
have got a Valium pill you might
want to take

13:07.820 --> 13:08.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before the second round,

13:08.855 --> 13:10.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERROD BROWN (D), Ohio: Mr.
Chairman, Mr.
Chairman, I hope that that
comment about Valium

13:13.126 --> 13:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doesn't set the tone for 2017 in
this committee.

13:17.397 --> 13:21.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Wyden also
pressed Mnuchin
about reports that he initially
didn't reveal

13:22.001 --> 13:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than $100 million of assets
on disclosure
forms and that he left out his
role directing

13:27.740 --> 13:28.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
some offshore accounts.

13:28.775 --> 13:29.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN: How many employees
did you have
in Anguilla?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN: We didn't have
any employees
in Anguilla.

13:33.579 --> 13:34.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:34.781 --> 13:36.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON WYDEN: How many customers
did you have
there?

13:36.315 --> 13:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN: We didn't have
any customers
that resided in Anguilla.

13:39.018 --> 13:39.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:40.019 --> 13:41.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RON WYDEN: Did you have an
office there?

13:41.254 --> 13:43.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN: We didn't have a
office ourselves
there.

13:44.057 --> 13:44.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RON WYDEN: So you just had a
post office box?

13:46.893 --> 13:50.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN MNUCHIN: I would
diligently look at
these things, and I can assure
you I paid

13:50.396 --> 13:53.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
all my taxes as was required.

13:53.132 --> 13:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: New Jersey
Senator Bob Menendez
dug in.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.270 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT MENENDEZ (D), New Jersey:
One doesn't
go and create offshore entities
at the end

14:00.039 --> 14:06.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the day, other than to avoid,
in some form
or fashion, the tax laws of the
United States.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's pretty simple.

14:08.648 --> 14:12.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Mnuchin
surprised some,
saying that he agrees that
offshore accounts

14:12.485 --> 14:14.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are a problem he wants to fix.

14:14.487 --> 14:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Well, first of
all, I'm absolutely
committed to work with you and
your office,

14:17.657 --> 14:23.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as I have said, on tax
simplification and
to cut down and make sure that
we don't let

14:23.796 --> 14:25.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anybody avoid taxes.

14:25.798 --> 14:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would be happy to work with
your office
to simplify the tax code.

14:29.435 --> 14:33.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Committee
Chairman Orrin
Hatch called Democrats' focus on
those offshore

14:33.139 --> 14:34.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accounts hypocritical and
ironic.

14:35.041 --> 14:36.209 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ORRIN HATCH (R), Utah:
Evidently, memories
are short.

14:38.144 --> 14:45.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At least two of President
Obama's nominees
who now sit in his Cabinet had
Cayman Island

14:45.384 --> 14:47.019 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
holdings.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats
returned to Mnuchin's
role with OneWest back in 2009.

14:51.290 --> 14:56.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to an independent
California housing
organization, OneWest
aggressively foreclosed

14:57.029 --> 15:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on some 60,000 homes while
Mnuchin ran it.

15:00.767 --> 15:05.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also this fall, two advocacy
groups asked
the Department of Housing and
Urban Development

15:05.505 --> 15:11.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to investigate possible
discrimination, charging
that OneWest offered fewer
mortgages and options

15:11.410 --> 15:13.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to minorities.

15:13.379 --> 15:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mnuchin sold that bank for $3.4
billion in
2015 and has denied anything
improper.

15:20.153 --> 15:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He told the committee it wasn't
just about
profit, but saving a dying bank.

15:24.457 --> 15:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Overall, I
helped many homeowners
stay in their homes and escape
financial ruin

15:29.796 --> 15:32.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through my management of OneWest
Bank.

15:32.565 --> 15:40.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My experience confirms that we
must identify
and eliminate unwise and
burdensome policies

15:41.040 --> 15:46.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
which contributed to the
disastrous outcomes
that came in the wake of the
financial collapse.

15:46.913 --> 15:51.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At one point,
the treasury
nominee also pushed back at
Democrats.

15:51.851 --> 15:55.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN: It seems to me,
in all due
respect, you just want to shoot
questions

15:55.588 --> 15:56.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at me and not let you...

15:56.789 --> 15:57.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:58.024 --> 15:58.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERROD BROWN: I will let you
explain when
I'm done.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

16:00.426 --> 16:02.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN MNUCHIN: Let people at
least understand
these are complicated questions.

16:02.695 --> 16:03.596 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHERROD BROWN: They are
complicated.

16:05.498 --> 16:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As the top
economic official,
there was plenty of policy talk,
too.

16:08.301 --> 16:12.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mnuchin said he would enforce
current Russian
sanctions and would keep the
Consumer Financial

16:12.872 --> 16:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protection Bureau, though he
questioned its
funding source.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Lisa joins me
now.

16:18.244 --> 16:20.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Lisa, you were there for the
hours of
this hearing.

16:20.246 --> 16:23.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Did you come away with a
particular impression
of Steven Mnuchin?

16:23.182 --> 16:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As you saw, I
had a good
seat.

16:25.251 --> 16:29.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have to say, I think what
he was trying
to telegraph to the committee
that he is more

16:29.188 --> 16:31.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moderate than his opponents are
casting him.

16:31.724 --> 16:36.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, we have to see what he does
if he's confirmed
as secretary, but things like
the CFPB, saying

16:37.063 --> 16:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he would keep that, and he
also said
things like, I want to increase
the staff

16:40.333 --> 16:42.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at the IRS.

16:42.335 --> 16:45.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are things conservatives
have traditionally
gone after, and he's said to
this committee,

16:45.671 --> 16:47.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm going to be more reasonable.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He used those words.

16:48.708 --> 16:50.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: CFPB being the
Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Financial
Protection Bureau.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to ask you
about the
status of one of the
president-elect's other

16:55.047 --> 16:59.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nominees to be the budget
director, Mick Mulvaney,
the congressman from South
Carolina.

16:59.919 --> 17:03.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has run into some problems
over an employee
of his family.

17:03.389 --> 17:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's correct.

17:04.657 --> 17:06.225 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

17:06.325 --> 17:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told the Senate about a month
ago that
he found out a caregiver for his
children

17:10.062 --> 17:13.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who worked for him for a few
years, he didn't
pay taxes for that person.

17:13.266 --> 17:17.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's now paying those back
taxes, but
it seems that this might really
be a problem.

17:17.837 --> 17:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason I think so is
that we haven't
seen statements from leading
Republicans supporting

17:22.275 --> 17:23.943 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him today.

17:24.043 --> 17:27.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I spoke to another
Republican senator,
Judy, who says there's another
issue.

17:27.179 --> 17:31.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They're concerned because
Mulvaney in the
past has asked to cut defense
spending in

17:32.018 --> 17:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a way that Republicans don't
like.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it will come down to his
hearing next
week.

17:35.788 --> 17:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, now,
one other thing
I want to ask you about.

17:37.957 --> 17:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that Republicans want as
many of these
nominees confirmed as soon as
possible.

17:43.429 --> 17:47.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Democrats are not in the
majority, but they
have the ability to slow them
down, and that's

17:47.133 --> 17:48.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what they're doing.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: You heard that
from Chuck
Schumer in John's report
earlier.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.505 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

17:52.605 --> 17:56.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats said today they are
going to allow
two nominees to be confirmed
tomorrow on Inauguration

17:56.475 --> 17:57.376 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Day.

17:57.476 --> 17:58.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just two?

17:58.477 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Just two, in
the evening.

18:00.513 --> 18:03.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are the defense secretary,
James Mattis,
and also Department of Homeland
Security Secretary

18:03.950 --> 18:06.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John -- I'm sorry -- John Kelly.

18:06.152 --> 18:12.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two Marine Corps generals
are going to
be confirmed, but not
necessarily Mike Pompeo.

18:12.291 --> 18:16.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Senator Ron Wyden has an
objection to the
CIA director-designate.

18:16.495 --> 18:17.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's a real concern for
Republicans.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They say that's a security risk.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It might be a political risk for
Democrats.

18:21.867 --> 18:27.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say Pompeo is likely to be
confirmed
soon, but it doesn't look like
tomorrow.

18:27.440 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As for the rest of these
nominees, Democrats
say they are planning to slow
down the process,

18:32.211 --> 18:33.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they want more
deliberation.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.481 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How can they do that if they're
in the minority?

18:35.581 --> 18:41.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, under Senate rules, they
can use procedure
to add lots of debate time for
each nominee.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.923 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It looks like they're planning
to do that.

18:44.023 --> 18:47.059 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Watch the especially
non-controversial ones
like Elaine Chao, Ben Carson.

18:47.159 --> 18:48.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What happens with them?

18:48.427 --> 18:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Republicans
not happy about
this.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: No, they're not
happy.

18:51.731 --> 18:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's building to not just a
sense of typical
strategy here, but real tension
between the

18:56.068 --> 18:56.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two sides.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins,
thank you.

18:59.271 --> 19:01.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Appreciate it.

19:01.107 --> 19:04.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other confirmation hearing
we were watching
today was the one for Mr.
Trump's pick for

19:04.710 --> 19:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the secretary of energy, former
Texas Governor
Rick Perry.

19:08.547 --> 19:12.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, Perry called for the
elimination of that
very department when he ran for
president

19:12.952 --> 19:14.720 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2012.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he forgot the name of
the department
during a debate.

19:17.723 --> 19:23.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, much of the department's
role is devoted
to monitoring, maintaining and
keeping safe

19:23.162 --> 19:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the nation's nuclear stockpile.

19:25.064 --> 19:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Perry admitted that he
didn't truly
understand its scope and mission
until recently,

19:30.436 --> 19:32.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and he said he now has a
different attitude.

19:32.405 --> 19:36.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK PERRY, Secretary of Energy
Nominee: My
past statements made over five
years ago about

19:36.709 --> 19:40.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abolishing the Department of
Energy do not
reflect my current thinking.

19:41.080 --> 19:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, after being briefed on
so many of
the vital functions of the
Department of Energy,

19:46.719 --> 19:50.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I regret recommending its
elimination.

19:50.356 --> 19:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Perry, who has
previously has
denied the science of climate
change, also

19:55.561 --> 19:57.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spoke about his views on that
subject.

19:57.963 --> 20:02.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senators pressed him on whether
he would even
protect scientists within the
department and

20:02.368 --> 20:04.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their budget.

20:04.270 --> 20:07.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And along a similar line of
questioning, he
also was asked about reports
that the Trump

20:07.573 --> 20:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
transition team wants to cut
funding for programs
promoting renewable energy.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here's how some of that played
out.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RICK PERRY: I believe that
climate is changing.

20:18.217 --> 20:23.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I believe some of it is
naturally occurring,
but some of it is caused by
manmade activity.

20:23.689 --> 20:32.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is how we address
it in a thoughtful
way that doesn't compromise
economic growth,

20:32.798 --> 20:36.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it affects the affordability of
energy or
American jobs.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.304 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:38.404 --> 20:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIA CANTWELL (D), Washington:
Do you plan
to protect the science research
at DOE related

20:43.175 --> 20:44.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to climate?

20:45.044 --> 20:49.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK PERRY: Senator, I am going
to protect
the men and women of the
scientific community

20:49.315 --> 20:55.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from anyone that would attack
them no matter
what their reason may be, at the
Department

20:55.554 --> 20:56.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Energy.

20:56.555 --> 20:57.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBBIE STABENOW (D), Michigan:
How do you
see your role?

20:59.658 --> 21:03.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You're coming into a new
position where we
are talking about massive cuts
in the kinds

21:03.729 --> 21:11.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of things that you have
advocated for, you
supported in your role as
governor things,

21:11.137 --> 21:17.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are critical to the future
of the economy
and lowering emissions and
creating more efficiency?

21:17.977 --> 21:20.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RICK PERRY: I will be an
advocate for that.

21:20.312 --> 21:24.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will be in the room advocating
for these
types of things.

21:24.183 --> 21:29.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to tell you I'm
going to be
1000 percent successful in that.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.756 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAZIE HIRONO (D), Hawaii: My
question is,
do you support these cuts, yes
or no?

21:33.726 --> 21:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICK PERRY: Well, Senator, maybe
they will
have the same experience I had
and forget

21:38.097 --> 21:39.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that they said that, but...

21:39.798 --> 21:40.699 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:40.799 --> 21:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAZIE HIRONO: We're counting on
you.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

21:43.435 --> 21:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The next round of
confirmation
hearings starts again on
Tuesday.

21:48.774 --> 21:53.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And moments ago, president-elect
Trump spoke
before the crowd gathered for an
inaugural

21:53.179 --> 21:55.214 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
concert at the Lincoln Memorial.

21:55.314 --> 21:59.952 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
DONALD TRUMP (R),
President-Elect: We all
got tired of seeing what was
happening, And

22:00.052 --> 22:03.989 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we wanted change, but we wanted
real change.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I look so forward to
tomorrow.

22:05.925 --> 22:12.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to see something
that is going
to be so amazing.

22:12.865 --> 22:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: January 20, 2017, the
inauguration
of Donald J. Trump, the 45th
president of

22:21.707 --> 22:25.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the United States, day one of a
new era.

22:25.611 --> 22:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join "PBS NewsHour" for live
coverage and
analysis you won't find anywhere
else, Friday,

22:32.218 --> 22:39.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
January 20 at 11:00 a.m., 10:00
Central, only
on PBS.

22:39.992 --> 22:45.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
national security
and diplomatic transition from
the Obama to

22:45.731 --> 22:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Trump administrations.

22:47.800 --> 22:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, I asked outgoing
Secretary of State
John Kerry how well the
transition was proceeding.

22:53.772 --> 22:58.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he bluntly answered,
"Smoothly, because
there's not an enormous amount
of it."

22:58.444 --> 23:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He also said he had yet to meet
his designated
successor, Rex Tillerson.

23:03.082 --> 23:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, with less than 24 hours
left in his
tenure, Kerry's spokesman was
asked if the

23:08.454 --> 23:10.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two men had met.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KIRBY, Pentagon Press
Secretary: The
secretary made very clear that
he was willing

23:12.925 --> 23:16.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to met with Mr. Tillerson.

23:16.829 --> 23:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as I understand it, they
just weren't
able to get it on the schedule.

23:21.500 --> 23:24.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So -- but he did speak to him on
the phone.

23:24.436 --> 23:30.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think it was trying to work
both men's schedules.

23:30.442 --> 23:34.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As you know, the secretary also
went on a
weeklong trip.

23:34.246 --> 23:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he -- they worked to try to
make it happen.

23:38.684 --> 23:44.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they just weren't able to
get it on both
men's schedule at a time that
was mutually

23:44.323 --> 23:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
convenient for both of them.

23:46.292 --> 23:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Apart from Kerry
and Tillerson,
some Obama Cabinet secretaries
have met their

23:50.396 --> 23:52.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
designated successors.

23:52.331 --> 23:57.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as John Yang reported
earlier, the incoming
Trump administration was forced
to defend

23:57.536 --> 24:03.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the pace of its staffing of
important national
security and diplomatic jobs
today after a

24:03.375 --> 24:07.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
series of reports detailed a
disjointed transition.

24:07.746 --> 24:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For that, we turn now to the
author of one
of those reports, New York Times
White House

24:11.550 --> 24:15.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
correspondent Mark Landler, and
to Roger Cressey.

24:15.487 --> 24:21.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He was the deputy for
counterterrorism on
the National Security Council
staff from 1999

24:21.427 --> 24:22.961 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to 2001.

24:23.062 --> 24:27.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He was there during the
transition from President
Clinton to George W. Bush.

24:27.399 --> 24:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He is now a security consultant.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

24:32.604 --> 24:34.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mark Landler, to you first.

24:34.606 --> 24:39.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In that story you wrote
yesterday, you referred
to the staff of president-elect
Trump barely

24:39.611 --> 24:46.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
having engaged with the current
National Security
Council staff below the most
senior levels.

24:46.318 --> 24:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is the level of contact
between the two?

24:48.821 --> 24:52.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK LANDLER, The New York
Times: Well, the
incoming national security
adviser, General

24:52.958 --> 24:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Flynn, has met four
times with his
predecessor, Susan Rice.

24:58.430 --> 25:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there has been significant
meetings at
the deputy level, K.T.

25:02.735 --> 25:08.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McFarland with Admiral Haines,
and at one
level below that, General Keith
Kellogg, who

25:08.607 --> 25:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to be the incoming
chief of staff
of the NSC.

25:11.810 --> 25:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But below that level, which is
to say, all
the senior directors that
oversee departments

25:16.915 --> 25:22.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the National Security
Council, there has
been very little, if any
contact.

25:22.955 --> 25:27.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is for a number of
reasons, one of
which is the fact that the Trump
transition

25:27.292 --> 25:31.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has been marked by a kind of a
rotating cast.

25:31.463 --> 25:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The NSC and the White House is
now dealing
with the third transition team
since the election.

25:37.336 --> 25:42.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with that constant upheaval,
it's been
difficult for them to establish
relationships,

25:43.008 --> 25:48.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Trump people to get the
security clearances
they need to begin reading
classified information.

25:48.247 --> 25:54.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, a process that would have
unfolded pretty
intensively starting on November
10 or 11

25:54.520 --> 25:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has really only swung into gear
really in
the last two weeks.

25:58.257 --> 26:01.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roger Cressey,
what are you
hearing about how it's going to
at the National

26:01.293 --> 26:03.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Security Council?

26:03.262 --> 26:05.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER CRESSEY, Former National
Security County
Staff: Well, they have
definitely lost time.

26:05.297 --> 26:09.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think there is some
concern on the part
of the career people that there
is not enough

26:09.301 --> 26:14.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communication with the incoming
team, so that
the new team is fully up on all
the nuances

26:14.606 --> 26:16.308 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of what they're inheriting.

26:16.408 --> 26:19.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reality, Judy, is, no matter
who comes
into office, they're always
unprepared for

26:20.012 --> 26:21.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what they're about to inherit.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think there is some
concern that there
may not be enough preparation
before the new

26:25.984 --> 26:27.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
team arrives tomorrow.

26:27.820 --> 26:31.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Roger
Cressey, staying
with you, how does this compare
to previous

26:31.990 --> 26:33.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transitions?

26:33.559 --> 26:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROGER CRESSEY: Well, we have
seen some where
they have been very short.

26:35.427 --> 26:41.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was there in 2000-2001
with -- going
from President Clinton to
President Bush,

26:41.433 --> 26:43.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that was very short.

26:43.302 --> 26:48.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, even then, we met with
Condi Rice, with
Steve Hadley, the national
security adviser,

26:48.607 --> 26:50.476 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the deputy.

26:50.576 --> 26:53.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They went around to each office
to meet the
team that was there that they
were inheriting

26:53.412 --> 26:56.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and also to get a better
perspective on what
each office was doing.

26:56.482 --> 26:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think the challenge for
General Flynn,
for K.T.

26:59.384 --> 27:04.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McFarland is to get up to speed
as quickly
as possible with the career
people that are

27:04.356 --> 27:08.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
staying, so they can understand
what the current
state of affairs are and all the
issues they

27:08.360 --> 27:10.028 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are going to inherit tomorrow.

27:10.128 --> 27:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we should
say, General
Flynn, of course, is the
incoming national

27:12.464 --> 27:14.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
security adviser to the
president.

27:14.566 --> 27:15.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
K.T.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
McFarland is his deputy.

27:17.503 --> 27:22.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Landler, give us a picture
of the National
Security Council staff.

27:22.174 --> 27:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How many of those positions are
going to be
holdovers, if any, and how many
are going

27:27.513 --> 27:29.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be empty when the Trump team
comes in?

27:29.815 --> 27:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK LANDLER: Well, Roger knows
more about
this than I do, but at the level
of the professional

27:35.687 --> 27:39.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
staff, you have a lot of
directorates in the
NSC.

27:39.691 --> 27:44.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The senior directors, the people
that run
those departments, tend to be
political appointees.

27:44.630 --> 27:49.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And most, if not all of those
jobs will be
vacant and will be filled by the
incoming

27:49.768 --> 27:51.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
administration.

27:51.270 --> 27:54.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But below that, you have a cadre
of professionals
at the director level.

27:54.673 --> 27:59.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Most of these people are
seconded from other
agencies, say, from the Pentagon
or the State

27:59.978 --> 28:03.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department, and are at the White
House for
a set period of time.

28:03.649 --> 28:08.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the Obama administration
came in, they
basically held over people in
those positions,

28:08.820 --> 28:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which provided the important
continuity.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump team has told me they
plan to do
the same thing.

28:14.927 --> 28:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it is not as though General
Flynn will
come in and find an empty
building.

28:19.665 --> 28:21.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
He won't.

28:21.266 --> 28:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will find dozens of very
well-briefed,
experienced senior-level people.

28:25.904 --> 28:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he will have to do, though,
very quickly
is put in a layer of senior
directors.

28:30.976 --> 28:35.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, they say that they have
identified and
chosen many of these people, and
they just

28:35.147 --> 28:37.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
haven't publicly announced them
yet.

28:37.549 --> 28:43.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So that will all unfold
presumably in the
opening days after the president
is inaugurated.

28:43.422 --> 28:49.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, where they have lost
time is in
all of these people reading into
the reams

28:49.561 --> 28:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and reams of paper that lay out
the administration's
current policies, that lay out
the major flash

28:55.267 --> 28:57.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
points they're going to face
around the world.

28:57.736 --> 29:02.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's time that they could
well have
used starting as early as late
November and

29:02.975 --> 29:04.743 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
early December of last year.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Roger
Cressey, if you're
part of this incoming Trump
team, what are

29:07.079 --> 29:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you worried that you may not
know?

29:09.047 --> 29:12.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER CRESSEY: Well, all special
assistants
to the president are typically
political appointees

29:12.951 --> 29:14.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the first year of the new
president.

29:14.553 --> 29:18.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, their job is to shape policy
for the new
president.

29:18.223 --> 29:22.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The career people that Mark
referred to are
there to provide continuity of
operations

29:22.260 --> 29:25.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to ensure that balls are not
dropped, but
they are not going to make any
new policy

29:25.464 --> 29:27.232 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pronouncements.

29:27.332 --> 29:30.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the new people come in to do
two things
to, to do a review of existing
policy to see

29:31.003 --> 29:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where they might want to change
it, and then
to put in place the actual new
policy, a presidential

29:35.641 --> 29:38.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
review directive, to a
presidential decision
directive.

29:38.343 --> 29:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, these senior people that
have to be appointed
cleared at the top-secret
codeword level,

29:42.781 --> 29:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are going to come in to do that.

29:44.383 --> 29:46.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, General Flynn, K.T.

29:46.251 --> 29:50.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McFarland can rely on their
career people
to provide up-to-date
information on daily

29:50.455 --> 29:54.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
activities, but no new policy is
going to
happen until this new team comes
in at the

29:54.660 --> 29:56.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
special assistant to the
president level.

29:56.194 --> 29:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's where
you're talking
about a delay.

29:58.063 --> 30:04.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I finally want to ask both
of you, to
Mark Landler again on this, as
we look ahead

30:04.603 --> 30:10.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Trump administration, its
foreign policy,
it's national security policy,
do we read

30:10.108 --> 30:13.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something into that by what's
happened right
now?

30:13.345 --> 30:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK LANDLER: Well, look, I
think it's fair
to say that this election
brought a very unexpected

30:19.184 --> 30:24.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
outcome, that the Trump people
were probably
starting off from a standing
start.

30:24.256 --> 30:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a lot of upheaval in
the early days.

30:26.825 --> 30:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You remember that the original
transition
team was led by Governor Chris
Christie, and

30:31.296 --> 30:34.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that team was purged almost
immediately after
the election.

30:34.332 --> 30:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I guess the one thing I would
watch for is
if this kind of upheaval,
improvisation, frequent

30:41.807 --> 30:47.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shifts either in personnel or in
policy continue
to be a hallmark of the new
administration's

30:47.679 --> 30:49.448 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
style.

30:49.548 --> 30:53.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they do, as some people think
they will,
we could be in for a bumpy ride
on national

30:53.318 --> 30:54.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
security.

30:55.087 --> 30:58.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's also possible that once
they get
their team in place and they
settle down on

30:58.557 --> 31:04.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their key priorities, that we
sort of return
to regular order, and things
begin unfolding.

31:04.996 --> 31:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm sure Roger will say,
every administration
faces a kind of a baptism by
fire, so I don't

31:10.168 --> 31:14.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think it's fair to necessarily
assume that
these people are going to be off
the rails

31:14.172 --> 31:15.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immediately.

31:15.173 --> 31:16.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just 15 seconds.

31:16.575 --> 31:18.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think in terms of
what this says
about the future?

31:18.510 --> 31:21.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROGER CRESSEY: The wheel of
government will
continue to work, even as these
people come

31:21.246 --> 31:25.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in and we wait for them, but the
issue is,
there's always one thing, as
Mark says, that

31:25.584 --> 31:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a new administration confronts.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the Bush administration, it
was terrorism.

31:29.488 --> 31:32.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For this administration, it's
going to be
cyber-security, not Russian
hacking.

31:32.791 --> 31:36.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a symptom of the bigger
problem, but
the bigger issue of cyber, how
they deal with

31:36.995 --> 31:38.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we may see something else
we're not anticipating.

31:39.931 --> 31:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's going to be their
challenge.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Roger Cressey,
Mark Landler,
thank you both.

31:42.534 --> 31:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK LANDLER: Thank you so much.

31:46.905 --> 31:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROGER CRESSEY: Thanks, Judy.

31:53.879 --> 32:01.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now our economics
correspondent
Paul Solman takes a look at what
has become

32:01.386 --> 32:07.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the new normal for many members
of the aging
middle class: financial
fragility.

32:07.425 --> 32:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of his weekly series,
Making Sense,
which airs Thursdays on the
"NewsHour."

32:11.296 --> 32:13.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE, Author,
"Fifty-Five, Unemployed
and Faking Normal": Everybody is
pretending.

32:13.832 --> 32:17.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that's why you
call the book
"Faking Normal"?

32:17.102 --> 32:22.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Right, because
there's a
lot of pressure to seem like you
are doing

32:22.874 --> 32:24.609 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

32:24.709 --> 32:29.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Elizabeth White is
not doing
terribly well, as she painfully
chronicles

32:29.981 --> 32:38.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in the book she's just
self-published, "Fifty-Five
Unemployed and Faking Normal."

32:38.356 --> 32:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White's been on the edge of the
financial
cliff for years, even though you
would never

32:41.993 --> 32:47.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know it from how she looks or
the Washington,
D.C., townhouse she bought years
ago, one

32:47.766 --> 32:50.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she couldn't even dream of
renting today.

32:50.802 --> 32:54.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But you haven't been in a
situation where
you literally couldn't afford
whatever it

32:54.472 --> 32:55.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is, the condo fee, or?

32:55.540 --> 32:57.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Oh, absolutely,
I have.

32:57.642 --> 33:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I right now have to park outside
because I'm
in arrears on the condo fee,
right now.

33:03.748 --> 33:08.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And she's
refinanced to the hilt,
taken in a boarder.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, you haven't used food
stamps.

33:10.622 --> 33:11.723 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: But I have.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.325 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have had to.

33:13.425 --> 33:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's been quite a
comeuppance
for someone with her background.

33:16.361 --> 33:19.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: I have a
bachelor's from
Oberlin.

33:20.098 --> 33:24.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I have a master's in
international studies
from Johns Hopkins.

33:24.669 --> 33:30.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a Harvard MBA, worked at
the World
Bank, came in through a program
where they

33:30.308 --> 33:32.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
recruited 5,000 people.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They took two Americans out of
that 25.

33:35.146 --> 33:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was one of the Americans.

33:37.082 --> 33:40.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, ultimately,
White decided
to leave the bank to start her
own business.

33:40.652 --> 33:44.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: I had a chain
of stores,
of decorative home stores.

33:44.222 --> 33:45.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Really?

33:45.223 --> 33:46.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Yes.

33:46.691 --> 33:50.395 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I sold some of the things you
see here, African-inspired
products.

33:50.495 --> 33:56.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I realized that there was an
African-American
market that wanted things in
their home that

33:56.768 --> 33:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reflected heritage and culture.

33:58.937 --> 34:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you wanted to give your
little girl a black
Raggedy Ann doll, you couldn't
easily find

34:02.274 --> 34:03.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

34:03.341 --> 34:05.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I just curated that from all
over.

34:05.210 --> 34:11.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I then bet the ranch that I
could get
this going.

34:11.516 --> 34:18.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I took a lot of my -- not
all of it, but
I took a big chunk of my World
Bank money

34:18.356 --> 34:19.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to sort of fund this.

34:19.624 --> 34:20.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Retirement savings.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Savings.

34:22.494 --> 34:29.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it wasn't going -- it was
doing well,
but I couldn't see -- my vendors
of artisan

34:29.634 --> 34:34.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
producers were not going to be
able to blow
this out into a national chain,
were already

34:34.506 --> 34:36.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
struggling with volume.

34:36.641 --> 34:38.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Did you sell your
stores?

34:38.710 --> 34:39.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: No.

34:39.711 --> 34:40.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Closed it in the end.

34:40.712 --> 34:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just didn't -- didn't work.

34:42.781 --> 34:46.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But steady
consulting work allowed
White to maintain an
upper-middle class lifestyle

34:46.551 --> 34:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for awhile, until the crash of
'08.

34:49.220 --> 34:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Within six
months, I went
from, you know, probably close
to 200?

34:54.259 --> 34:55.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Thousand dollars a
year.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Right, to zero.

34:57.529 --> 35:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And after that, the
jobs of the
past were nowhere to be found.

35:02.400 --> 35:10.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: This is, to me,
where the
age discrimination piece
happens.

35:10.709 --> 35:18.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I find it much harder at this
phase of life
to get hired than I did earlier.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you look so
young.

35:21.219 --> 35:24.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not just saying that to,
you know,
flatter you or something.

35:24.622 --> 35:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, you surely can pass now
-- you're
62 or something?

35:29.427 --> 35:30.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Three.

35:30.528 --> 35:31.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Sixty-three.

35:31.930 --> 35:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you could pass for your 50s,
easily, mid-50s,
early 50s, right?

35:36.434 --> 35:40.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Early 50s is
not considered
young in the workplace.

35:40.205 --> 35:45.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No, it's not, as we
learned in
an interview with economist
Teresa Ghilarducci,

35:45.677 --> 35:47.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
citing a study by the New York
Federal Reserve.

35:47.912 --> 35:52.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TERESA GHILARDUCCI, The New
School for Social
Research: From 45 to 55, wages
decrease by

35:52.684 --> 35:57.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
9 percent, from 55 to 65,
another 9 percent.

35:58.089 --> 36:03.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So this age earning profile,
where you kind
of peak and then it flattens out
and falls,

36:03.795 --> 36:07.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that age of peaking is a lot
younger than
we ever thought.

36:07.699 --> 36:12.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that
corresponds to age discrimination
as measured in economic
experiments by the

36:13.071 --> 36:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likes of Joanna Lahey, who sent
fake resumes
to employers.

36:17.876 --> 36:23.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The red dots show where on the
resumes H.R.
managers looked, and for how
long.

36:24.049 --> 36:26.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when does age discrimination
start?

36:26.451 --> 36:27.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNA LAHEY, The Bush School of
Government
and Public Service: Immediately.

36:27.886 --> 36:28.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It starts at age 35.

36:28.887 --> 36:29.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Really?

36:29.888 --> 36:30.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOANNA LAHEY: Yes.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a pretty steady process.

36:32.724 --> 36:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And it's women more
than men?

36:35.393 --> 36:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNA LAHEY: It's definitely
women more than
men.

36:37.228 --> 36:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No wonder career
coaches tell
you to wipe the dates off your
C.V., but,

36:42.500 --> 36:44.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
says White:

36:44.569 --> 36:48.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: When they then
ask you to
fill out the application that's
all algorithm-driven,

36:49.074 --> 36:52.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you cannot leave off when you
graduated from
college.

36:53.078 --> 36:55.814 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And once you put that date in
there...

36:55.914 --> 36:56.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Then it's...

36:56.915 --> 36:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: They know.

36:58.450 --> 37:02.387 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, as you get older, your
network also is
not what it used to be.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because they're
losing their
jobs?

37:03.855 --> 37:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: They're losing
their jobs.

37:05.356 --> 37:06.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are retiring.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're not hearing about
things.

37:08.893 --> 37:10.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're winding down.

37:10.495 --> 37:12.030 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
People have died.

37:12.130 --> 37:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, White has been
scraping by
with scattered freelance gigs.

37:15.867 --> 37:22.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: It's sort of
bits and pieces
that allow me to cobble together
income.

37:22.907 --> 37:27.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But nowhere near
the income of
the past?

37:27.178 --> 37:28.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: No, no.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Not even close.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: No.

37:31.549 --> 37:34.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, again, I have years of,
you know,
under $30,000.

37:34.219 --> 37:39.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Help has come from
unexpected
sources, like neighborhood free
spirit Elijah,

37:39.624 --> 37:41.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a clothing minimalist.

37:41.493 --> 37:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: I was getting
on the far
side of where my mortgage
company was getting,

37:48.933 --> 37:50.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like, serious with me.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because you were
behind in your
payments.

37:52.170 --> 37:53.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Behind.

37:53.171 --> 37:54.472 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He just said, Lizzy, I will do
it.

37:54.572 --> 37:56.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I can do it.

37:56.107 --> 37:58.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But I will do it,
meaning, I
will make up the difference.

37:58.543 --> 37:59.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Yes, I will do
it.

37:59.811 --> 38:02.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: I will pay -- he
will pay your
mortgage?

38:02.413 --> 38:03.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Right.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, this is my Elijah (ph).

38:06.151 --> 38:07.685 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's my Elijah, yes.

38:07.785 --> 38:09.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm the people's Elijah.

38:09.854 --> 38:15.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The Vietnam vet
gets about $900
in monthly benefits, saves
almost half.

38:15.260 --> 38:17.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: I'm not a things person.

38:17.362 --> 38:21.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much money do you think I'm
spending on
my attire, OK?

38:21.166 --> 38:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: As he says, I
have a few
friends like you who are in the
stuff world,

38:26.738 --> 38:31.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is what he calls, and you're
always getting
into some kind of mishap.

38:31.576 --> 38:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Grateful to get by
with a little
help from her friends.

38:36.114 --> 38:37.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
White was also embarrassed.

38:37.515 --> 38:40.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: You're the
loser.

38:40.885 --> 38:42.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
You know?

38:42.253 --> 38:45.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How can you have this kind of
background and
be landing here?

38:45.523 --> 38:46.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: There must be
something wrong
with you.

38:46.824 --> 38:49.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: There has to
be.

38:49.460 --> 38:53.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And -- and then you read things
like, oh,
it's the latte factor, it's all
that bottled

38:53.898 --> 38:54.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
water you were drinking.

38:54.899 --> 38:56.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know, it's a...

38:56.634 --> 38:58.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The latte factor,
meaning you
were spending too much money
on...

38:58.169 --> 38:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Spent money,
right.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: On Starbucks.

39:00.171 --> 39:01.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Right.

39:01.573 --> 39:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But you could've
saved more,
couldn't have you?

39:02.440 --> 39:03.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: Absolutely.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.409 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, are you...

39:06.311 --> 39:09.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WHITE: I could've not
started a
business, I stayed at the World
Bank, not

39:09.547 --> 39:11.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
taken that, you know, risk.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But she did.

39:13.251 --> 39:15.119 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Her reward?

39:15.220 --> 39:20.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Financial fragility, something
she now shares
with a surprisingly large
portion of the former

39:21.092 --> 39:23.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so-called middle class.

39:23.161 --> 39:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From Washington, D.C., this is
economics correspondent
Paul Solman, grateful to be
reporting for

39:29.200 --> 39:30.568 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the "PBS NewsHour."

39:30.668 --> 39:33.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're
grateful you are
too.

39:33.771 --> 39:39.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In next Thursday's Making Sense:
how common
Elizabeth White's plight is
these days, and

39:39.277 --> 39:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her tips for how to be normal in
the face
of financial adversity, instead
of continuing

39:44.649 --> 39:57.962 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to fake it.

39:58.062 --> 40:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight marks President Obama's
final full
day in office.

40:02.333 --> 40:07.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We look back at those years now
with someone
who was there with him from day
one, his press

40:07.105 --> 40:09.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
secretary, Josh Earnest.

40:09.374 --> 40:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Yang met with Earnest at
the White House
to ask him about the challenges
of the job

40:13.678 --> 40:16.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what he wishes for his
successor.

40:16.247 --> 40:21.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
I joined the campaign in April
2007, so it's

40:21.452 --> 40:23.254 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been a while now.

40:23.354 --> 40:26.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Josh Earnest was
there when Barack
Obama was a senator running for
president,

40:26.157 --> 40:29.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he will be there when the
lights go out
in the Obama White House.

40:29.527 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: Thank you, all.

40:30.528 --> 40:31.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been a genuine pleasure.

40:31.529 --> 40:33.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, flash-forward
eight years.

40:33.331 --> 40:34.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH EARNEST: Yes.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What does it feel
like?

40:36.200 --> 40:39.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: It feels like that
was a million
years ago, but it feels like
that million

40:40.071 --> 40:41.773 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
years has flown by.

40:41.873 --> 40:45.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Earnest took over
from Jay Carney
as White House press secretary
in 2014.

40:45.877 --> 40:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Today, the flak jacket is
officially passed

40:49.480 --> 40:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a new generation, Mr. Josh
Earnest.

40:51.949 --> 40:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: When he first
offered me this
job back in the summer of 2014,
we were talking

40:57.221 --> 41:00.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little bit about what his
expectations were
for the person who was going to
be in this

41:00.391 --> 41:02.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
role.

41:02.327 --> 41:03.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said: You know, one of
the things you
should know is, I don't intend
to watch your

41:03.661 --> 41:05.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
briefing every day.

41:05.563 --> 41:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if there's ever a situation
where you're
prepared to walk out to the
briefing, and

41:08.266 --> 41:11.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's something that you're
not sure about
or something you need to ask me
about, then

41:11.636 --> 41:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just let me know, and I will
make sure that
that have got an opportunity to
come in here

41:15.106 --> 41:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and talk to me before you have
to go there
and address the public.

41:17.809 --> 41:20.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's something that I have used
frequently
to make sure that the
information that I'm

41:20.611 --> 41:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conveying to the reporters in
this room is
not just accurate, but
accurately reflects

41:25.249 --> 41:27.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the president's thinking.

41:27.185 --> 41:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In 345 briefings, an
exercise he's
likened to catching javelins,
Earnest has

41:32.824 --> 41:34.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
defended President Obama's
policies.

41:35.093 --> 41:37.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: That's consistent
with the president's
vision since he took office, and
it's also

41:37.862 --> 41:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consistent with his record.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Bantered with
reporters.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: I'm sure we will
try to come
up with something to talk about
today.

41:43.101 --> 41:47.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And even raised
eyebrows and drew
criticism by mocking then
candidate Donald

41:47.872 --> 41:49.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump's appearance.

41:49.741 --> 41:53.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: The Trump campaign
for months
now has had a dustbin-of-
history-like quality

41:53.244 --> 41:58.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to it, from the vacuous
sloganeering, to the
outright lies, to even the fake
hair.

41:58.716 --> 42:03.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Some critics accuse
the administration
of criminalizing investigative
reporting by

42:03.488 --> 42:05.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aggressively targeting leaks.

42:06.023 --> 42:10.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite that, Earnest says the
toughest part
is the unrelenting pace.

42:10.428 --> 42:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think people appreciate
how early
you and other members of the
White House staff

42:15.366 --> 42:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get here every morning, the
meetings you have
early to get things going.

42:19.170 --> 42:22.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: So, that is the
part of it that
is challenging day after day
after day.

42:22.940 --> 42:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not that there is any one
long day.

42:25.410 --> 42:30.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's that that long day is then
followed up
by another day that's moving at
a pretty good

42:30.114 --> 42:31.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
pace.

42:31.716 --> 42:34.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Despite that, Earnest
says he will
miss the daily sense of purpose.

42:34.452 --> 42:40.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: When it's time to
get to work,
feeling this intense motivation
to get the

42:40.825 --> 42:43.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job done and get it done the
right way.

42:43.261 --> 42:50.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's something that really
stokes the internal
fires about this job, that it's
hard to imagine

42:50.201 --> 42:52.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how that ever gets replaced, if
it ever does.

42:52.236 --> 42:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We made a special one for
him.

42:54.172 --> 42:55.973 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH EARNEST: Oh, wow.

42:56.073 --> 42:59.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There have been
personal perks,
like welcoming his beloved
Kansas City Royals

42:59.744 --> 43:02.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the White House as 2015 World
Series champs.

43:03.014 --> 43:05.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: You look so
powerful.

43:05.216 --> 43:09.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: and having his
2-year-old son,
Walker, meet the president at
Halloween.

43:09.654 --> 43:11.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALKER EARNEST, Son of Josh
Earnest: That's
POTUS.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOSH EARNEST: I know.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.392 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That was POTUS.

43:14.492 --> 43:18.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But Earnest says
dealing with the
press day in and day out is
serious business.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you wish for Sean
Spicer, your successor?

43:20.965 --> 43:23.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: I hope he succeeds
in this job.

43:23.501 --> 43:27.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that it's a critically
important job
that requires the buy-in, not
just of the

43:27.972 --> 43:30.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person who's standing behind the
podium, but
by a whole White House staff
that needs to

43:31.075 --> 43:32.910 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be invested in his success.

43:33.010 --> 43:35.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As he prepares to
leave the White
House, Earnest thinks back to
when he moved

43:36.080 --> 43:38.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Washington 16 years ago.

43:38.649 --> 43:42.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He toured the White House in the
closing days
of the Clinton administration.

43:42.286 --> 43:44.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: I remember walking
into this
room.

43:44.655 --> 43:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I took a picture behind that
podium, wearing
my overcoat, and thought about
what a special

43:49.660 --> 43:53.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opportunity it would be to work
here in the
West Wing.

43:53.531 --> 43:57.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some ways, you know, my
departure here
really brings the whole thing
full circle.

43:57.368 --> 43:58.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: So, Josh,
congratulations.

43:58.369 --> 44:01.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: Thank you, sir.

44:01.873 --> 44:03.274 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

44:03.374 --> 44:05.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm John
Yang at the White House.

44:05.309 --> 44:08.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can find
all of our
conversations with outgoing
members of the

44:08.646 --> 44:13.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama administration and other
coverage of
achievements, controversies and
challenges

44:13.851 --> 44:16.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the last eight years in The
Obama Years.

44:16.954 --> 44:30.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

44:30.501 --> 44:34.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a veteran filmmaker takes on
the art of
poetry.

44:34.672 --> 44:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our look at
the new movie
"Paterson."

44:37.308 --> 44:43.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM DRIVER, Actor: I go through
trillions
of molecules that move aside to
make way for

44:43.581 --> 44:44.482 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

44:44.582 --> 44:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Where does poetry
come from?

44:46.050 --> 44:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not a question normally
posed by a film.

44:48.386 --> 44:52.356 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JIM JARMUSCH, Director: I
remember giving
the script, sending it first to
Ron.

44:52.456 --> 44:57.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he called me and said, wow,
Jim, I think
you're really going for the big
bucks here,

44:57.461 --> 45:00.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a poet who's a bus driver in New
Jersey, you
know?

45:00.765 --> 45:05.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The script that
director Jim
Jarmusch shared with his friend
poet Ron Padgett

45:05.436 --> 45:11.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was for the film "Paterson," and
it is indeed
about a bus driver, played by
Adam Driver,

45:11.275 --> 45:15.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making his daily route through
the streets
of Paterson, New Jersey, taking
in what's

45:15.246 --> 45:21.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
around him, overhearing
conversations, using
the stuff of everyday life to
write poems,

45:21.619 --> 45:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which we hear him recite and see
on screen.

45:24.589 --> 45:28.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ADAM DRIVER: Another one.

45:28.659 --> 45:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're a child, you learn
there are three
dimensions, height, width and
depth, like

45:35.700 --> 45:37.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a shoe box.

45:37.468 --> 45:42.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then, later, you hear there's a
fourth dimension,
time.

45:42.740 --> 45:50.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That and other
plainspoken
poems in the film were actually
written by

45:50.281 --> 45:54.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
74-year-old Padgett,
prize-winning poet, essayist
and translator who's been
publishing his work

45:55.052 --> 45:56.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since the 1960s.

45:57.021 --> 46:02.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said he was taken aback at
first when Jim
Jarmusch asked if he wanted to
write new poems

46:02.193 --> 46:03.661 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the film.

46:03.761 --> 46:06.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON PADGETT, Poet: And then we
hung up, and
I started thinking, why not?

46:06.364 --> 46:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why do I have to be such a
chicken?

46:08.733 --> 46:12.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why can't I just really accept
this challenge?

46:12.603 --> 46:16.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And not too long there
thereafter -- and I
had read the script, and I kind
of had an

46:16.741 --> 46:19.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
idea about this character,
Paterson.

46:19.677 --> 46:26.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I kind of found myself falling
into what I
kind of temporarily fantasized
to be his world.

46:26.550 --> 46:31.022 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I tried to make it by him, not
by me, but
also by me.

46:31.122 --> 46:35.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Poetry was also a
longtime
love of Jim Jarmusch, who,,
beginning in the

46:36.060 --> 46:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1980s in films like "Stranger
Than Paradise"
and "Down By Law," established
himself as

46:41.132 --> 46:45.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a filmmaker with a very personal
and distinctly
non-Hollywood vision.

46:46.003 --> 46:50.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As movies seem to get ever
bigger and louder,
he's managed to set his own
pace.

46:50.841 --> 46:53.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JIM JARMUSCH: I love the form of
filmmaking.

46:54.078 --> 47:02.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love all the aspects of it,
except financing
and promoting them.

47:02.620 --> 47:05.256 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it's such a beautiful form
to me.

47:05.356 --> 47:12.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that I'm not able to make
someone else's
film for them in, say, a studio
setting.

47:12.463 --> 47:19.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't have other people's
input who are
thinking about the commercial
viability of

47:19.336 --> 47:23.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the film affecting how the film
is made or
what goes into it.

47:24.075 --> 47:29.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would end up in jail, having
kneecapped
some executive who previously
ran an underwear

47:29.947 --> 47:30.848 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
factory.

47:30.948 --> 47:32.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, I'm a filmmaker.

47:32.950 --> 47:34.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is what I'm learning to do.

47:35.019 --> 47:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the film
"Paterson," Jarmusch
has also created an ode to an
earlier "Paterson,"

47:40.858 --> 47:46.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the epic poem written in the
1940s and '50s
by one of America's most
renowned poets, William

47:46.697 --> 47:47.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carlos Williams.

47:47.932 --> 47:52.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Williams lived and worked as a
doctor in the
area.

47:52.369 --> 47:57.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the poem's preface, Williams
writes: "To
make a start out of particulars
and make them

47:57.608 --> 47:58.943 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
general."

47:59.043 --> 48:03.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bus driver in the film
"Paterson" is no
William Carlos Williams.

48:03.247 --> 48:05.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's never published a thing and
is unlikely
to.

48:06.083 --> 48:07.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he'd understand the
sentiment.

48:07.885 --> 48:11.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ADAM DRIVER: I'm working on a
poem for you.

48:11.689 --> 48:15.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: A love poem?

48:15.392 --> 48:16.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ADAM DRIVER: Yes.

48:16.427 --> 48:19.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I guess, if it's for you, it's a
love poem.

48:19.196 --> 48:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And Jarmusch
picked up on the
notion of taking the particulars
of everyday

48:23.234 --> 48:27.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life, looking at them, listening
to them and
making art from them.

48:27.338 --> 48:33.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM JARMUSCH: Because he's a bus
driver, and
we have images flowing past him,
both visually

48:34.044 --> 48:41.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and things he overhears, he kind
of drifts
through his job, which is very
-- it's a routine,

48:41.152 --> 48:42.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
right?

48:42.153 --> 48:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's all very set for him.

48:44.622 --> 48:47.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this allows him to just take
things in.

48:47.792 --> 48:53.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's what poets -- in
this case,
he's a poet -- all people who
create things,

48:54.098 --> 48:55.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this is what they do.

48:55.800 --> 48:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have to get input from
something.

48:58.269 --> 49:02.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The stuff of life
becomes the
details of poetry.

49:02.907 --> 49:04.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RON PADGETT: I hope so.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can't figure out where else to
get it.

49:06.877 --> 49:08.612 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:08.712 --> 49:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I asked Ron
Padgett, who's
taught writing to children,
college students

49:11.649 --> 49:14.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and adults, what people too
often don't get
about poetry.

49:15.019 --> 49:19.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON PADGETT: They are given to
quote, I think,
wrong or misleading or narrow
idea of what

49:19.924 --> 49:22.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
poetry is or can be.

49:22.560 --> 49:26.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, secondly, they don't value
their own
imaginations.

49:26.964 --> 49:30.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just suppress or don't want
to deal with
their imagination.

49:30.467 --> 49:35.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And yet it's so close to being a
poet in many
ways.

49:35.873 --> 49:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we can only bust through
those barriers
-- and maybe a film like
"Paterson" will help

49:40.544 --> 49:44.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some people say, huh, maybe I
could write
something like this, too.

49:44.949 --> 49:49.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The film
"Paterson" is now
in wide release around the
country.

49:49.186 --> 49:57.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From New York, I'm Jeffrey Brown
for the "PBS
NewsHour."

49:57.127 --> 50:06.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to another in
our Brief
But Spectacular series, where we
ask interesting

50:06.937 --> 50:09.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to describe their
passions.

50:09.106 --> 50:15.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, author and futurist Amy
Webb offers
us a glimpse of things to come
in the world

50:15.145 --> 50:16.947 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of tech.

50:17.047 --> 50:21.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her latest book is "The Signals
Are Talking:
Why Today's Fringe Is Tomorrow's
Mainstream."

50:21.151 --> 50:22.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WEBB, Author, "The Signals
Are Talking:
Why Today's Fringe Is Tomorrow's
Mainstream":

50:22.987 --> 50:25.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't stop to think about it,
but if you
really want to freak yourself
out, and you

50:25.155 --> 50:31.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own a cell phone, go to Google
and look up
your personal information, every
single place

50:31.528 --> 50:34.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that you have been since you
have been online.

50:34.331 --> 50:38.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While we don't think about those
digital bread
crumbs, there are lots of third
parties out

50:38.202 --> 50:41.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there that are happily scooping
them up and
doing something with that data.

50:41.805 --> 50:47.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you stop to think about it,
your phone
knows you better, has a more
intimate relationship

50:47.244 --> 50:51.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with you than whoever it is that
you're sleeping
with, than your loved one.

50:51.115 --> 50:52.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is for PBS, isn't it?

50:52.349 --> 50:53.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I can't say that.

50:53.584 --> 50:56.954 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUESTION: You can say that.

50:57.054 --> 51:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WEBB: We are entering a
period in which
you can be expected to talk to
machines for

51:03.027 --> 51:04.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rest of your life.

51:04.228 --> 51:07.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The thing that's coming is
artificial intelligence.

51:07.164 --> 51:09.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It won't just be you talking to
a machine.

51:10.067 --> 51:13.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A lot of it's going to be
invisible, and it's
going to make our lives easier.

51:13.671 --> 51:19.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to allow scientists
to leapfrog
ahead in their research.

51:19.543 --> 51:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do believe that, within my
lifetime,
life as we know it on this
planet is probably

51:23.147 --> 51:24.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to look a little bit
different than
it is today.

51:24.915 --> 51:29.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's some really interesting
bioinformation
tools that are coming to market.

51:29.987 --> 51:32.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, one big trend is, how can we
prevent against
hackers?

51:33.057 --> 51:38.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No matter how hard we try to
tell people,
you have got to change your
passwords, most

51:38.829 --> 51:40.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people don't change their
passwords.

51:40.731 --> 51:44.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What if we no longer had
passwords, but instead
we are using our own biometric
information?

51:44.868 --> 51:47.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're probably already doing
that if you
have a newer phone.

51:47.738 --> 51:50.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're using your thumbprint as
a way to make
payments.

51:50.407 --> 51:54.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some of the interesting things
on the horizon
are things like heat maps.

51:54.511 --> 51:59.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of the capillaries of your
face are in
very slightly different places,
which means

51:59.650 --> 52:04.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that your face sort of gives off
this unique
heat map.

52:04.488 --> 52:08.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that unique heat map is one
way that we
can authenticate you.

52:08.625 --> 52:13.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the challenges with
technology is that,
as it becomes more
sophisticated, it also

52:13.797 --> 52:15.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
becomes more hidden.

52:15.599 --> 52:18.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look under the hood of a
modern car,
you see what looks like a flat
surface.

52:18.435 --> 52:23.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Not every person who drives a
car needs to
be Lewis Hamilton's F1 pit crew
boss, but

52:23.807 --> 52:28.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think it's dangerous for us
to continue
going forward without having
some of that

52:28.545 --> 52:30.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lexicon.

52:30.481 --> 52:34.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to be able to have
conversations with
each other and with the people
creating these

52:34.318 --> 52:38.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
devices, because, if we can't
have the conversations,
then we can't ask the questions.

52:38.622 --> 52:43.227 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if we can't ask the
questions, the problem
is that, 10 years into the
future, we're going

52:43.327 --> 52:48.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to look back at this moment in
time and wish
that we had done things
differently.

52:48.532 --> 52:52.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Amy Webb, and this
was my Brief
But Spectacular take on the
future.

52:53.003 --> 52:57.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can watch
additional
Brief But Spectacular episodes
on our Web

52:57.808 --> 52:59.309 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
site.

52:59.410 --> 53:02.513 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

53:02.613 --> 53:04.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And a news update.

53:04.415 --> 53:08.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon announced this
evening that four
more prisoners have been
transferred away

53:08.218 --> 53:12.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from Guantanamo to the United
Arab Emirates
and to Saudi Arabia.

53:12.856 --> 53:17.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are the final transfers
before President
Obama leaves office.

53:17.361 --> 53:21.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That means 41 inmates remain at
Guantanamo.
