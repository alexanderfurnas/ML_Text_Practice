GWEN IFILL: Good evening. I'm
Gwen Ifill.
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.375 --> 00:12.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
inside the Panama
Papers, how one of the largest
data leaks

00:12.779 --> 00:19.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in history allegedly shows world
leaders using
offshore companies to hide their
wealth.

00:19.720 --> 00:25.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead, the battle for
Wisconsin. Both
parties' front-runners face
hurdles, as candidates

00:25.325 --> 00:28.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make a final push before
tomorrow's primary.

00:28.528 --> 00:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with the falling price of
oil, one of
America's most reliable allies
against ISIS

00:34.368 --> 00:36.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is going broke.

00:36.136 --> 00:39.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAFIN DIZAYI, Kurdish Regional
Government
Spokesman: Often, people say
that Peshmergas

00:39.306 --> 00:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are fighting on behalf of the
international
community and the free world. If
that is the

00:44.711 --> 00:46.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
case, then there has to be more
assistance.

00:46.647 --> 00:54.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:54.688 --> 00:57.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:57.591 --> 01:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Europe moved in
earnest today
to reverse the human flood
spilling into the

01:07.567 --> 01:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continent. It took the form of
deportations
from Greece involving the first
of what could

01:12.239 --> 01:14.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be thousands of people.

01:14.374 --> 01:16.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Malcolm Brabant reports on the
day's developments.

01:16.710 --> 01:24.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: As dawn broke,
the first
of more than 200 migrants,
mostly Pakistanis

01:24.084 --> 01:27.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Afghans, were ferried from
the Greek islands
back to Turkey.

01:27.888 --> 01:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Escorted by officers from the
E.U.'s border
agency, they were taken to tents
for registration

01:32.693 --> 01:39.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and health checks. At the same
time, 32 Syrian
refugees were flown from
Istanbul to Hannover,

01:39.232 --> 01:44.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Germany, to be resettled. The
exchange is
part of Turkey's deal with the
European Union

01:44.237 --> 01:47.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to end more than a year of
uncontrolled migration.

01:47.107 --> 01:53.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Greece and Turkey are
implementing the
agreement lawfully and the
commission and

01:53.680 --> 01:57.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the agencies are on the ground
advising with
advice and expertise.

01:57.317 --> 02:02.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The deal aims
to discourage
economic migrants and those
fleeing conflict

02:02.122 --> 02:06.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from making the perilous sea
journey, as well
as to close down
people-smuggling networks.

02:07.027 --> 02:12.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In return, Turkey receives
financial aid and
expedited E.U. membership talks.

02:12.799 --> 02:17.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Turkish prime minister
rejected claims
that his nation was not safe for
returnees.

02:17.270 --> 02:22.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AHMET DAVUTOGLU, Turkish Prime
Minister (through
translator): Today, as we take
back Syrian

02:22.309 --> 02:27.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees from Europe, my request
to our police
officers is to treat those who
consider Turkey

02:28.015 --> 02:33.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with an embrace of mercy with
compassion,
and don't distinguish them from
our own citizens.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTESTERS: E.U., shame on you!

02:35.655 --> 02:40.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dozens of
protesters gathered
at the port in Lesbos to
denounce the deportations.

02:40.761 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: They are being forcibly
returned to Turkey,
and Turkey is not a safe
country. Turkey has

02:46.466 --> 02:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not signed the Geneva Convention
in full.
Only Syrians are enjoying some
kind of protection

02:54.674 --> 03:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Turkey, and all the other
migrants and
refugees are not protected at
all in Turkey.

03:00.714 --> 03:04.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Human rights
groups also
claim the operation breaches
international

03:04.851 --> 03:06.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
refugee conventions.

03:06.686 --> 03:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: These are individuals who
are fleeing
horrific scenes of war and the
kind of abuses

03:11.992 --> 03:17.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we know from Aleppo, for
example, and we are
playing some type of ping-pong
with them.

03:17.531 --> 03:22.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These people have a right to
asylum, to safety,
to protection, and we need to
grant it to

03:22.836 --> 03:24.604 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

03:24.638 --> 03:28.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: In all, 50,000
migrants and
refugees remain stranded in
Greece, unable

03:28.108 --> 03:33.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to travel deeper into Europe.
About 4,000
who arrived after March the
20th, the cutoff

03:33.880 --> 03:38.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
date, and didn't receive asylum,
are being
detained for deportation.

03:38.085 --> 03:43.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But still, they come. In the
last 24 hours,
more than 300 people made the
dangerous voyage

03:43.090 --> 03:44.024 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Lesbos.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant.

03:46.626 --> 03:51.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: It was
primary eve in Wisconsin, and
the campaigning

03:51.598 --> 03:57.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went on almost nonstop. On the
Republican
side, both Donald Trump and Ted
Cruz predicted

03:57.370 --> 04:02.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
victory. And Democrat Bernie
Sanders talked
of scoring a win over
front-runner Hillary

04:02.876 --> 04:07.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton. We will get a report
from Wisconsin,
and review the race in general,
later in the

04:07.781 --> 04:09.516 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

04:09.549 --> 04:13.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two big state governors signed
bills today
taking their minimum wage to the
highest in

04:13.753 --> 04:20.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nation. In California, the
state live-streamed
Governor Jerry Brown's signing
of a new law

04:20.260 --> 04:24.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which by 2022 will raise the
wage from $10
to $15 an hour.

04:24.531 --> 04:29.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JERRY BROWN (D),
California: This is
about economic justice. It's
about people.

04:29.636 --> 04:36.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's about creating a little,
tiny balance
in a system that every day
becomes more unbalanced.

04:36.943 --> 04:43.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, in New York,
Governor Andrew
Cuomo signed a bill setting a
$15 minimum

04:43.116 --> 04:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for New York City and its
suburbs by 2021.
The rest of the state will rise
to $12.50

04:49.356 --> 04:54.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an hour. President Obama today
commended the
state efforts. He urged Congress
to hike the

04:54.528 --> 04:56.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
federal minimum as well.

04:56.897 --> 05:02.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Supreme Court has
unanimously upheld a
Texas law in the latest battle
over legislative

05:02.602 --> 05:09.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
districts. The law counts
overall population,
not just eligible voters, in
drawing districts.

05:09.209 --> 05:13.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Challengers said that means some
end up with
far more voters than others. But
the court

05:13.146 --> 05:18.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ruled the method doesn't violate
the principle
of one person, one vote.

05:18.285 --> 05:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amtrak trains in the Northeast
are back on
normal schedules, after Sunday's
collision

05:23.023 --> 05:27.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that killed two maintenance
workers. It happened
when a southbound train struck
heavy maintenance

05:27.994 --> 05:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
equipment and derailed outside
Philadelphia.
CNN reported today the
maintenance workers

05:33.433 --> 05:37.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were on the wrong track, but it
remains unclear
why.

05:37.804 --> 05:42.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brussels' main airport ramped up
departures
today after partially reopening
on Sunday.

05:43.009 --> 05:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The facility had been closed
since last month's
attacks. Security was tight
today, as passengers

05:48.281 --> 05:53.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went through stricter check-in
procedures.
Many said it's about pushing on,
in spite

05:53.153 --> 05:54.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the terrorists.

05:54.988 --> 05:59.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): It's
terribly sad,
what happened at the airport.
And my first

05:59.793 --> 06:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reaction wasn't to go on holiday
anymore,
but after a couple of days, I
thought that

06:04.064 --> 06:07.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life should go on and that we
have to resume
all activities. We have to
straighten our

06:08.001 --> 06:09.869 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
backs and go on.

06:09.903 --> 06:13.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Twenty flights were
scheduled
to leave today, up from three
yesterday. Officials

06:13.807 --> 06:17.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say it will be months before
full service
is restored.

06:17.844 --> 06:23.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Iraq, a string of suicide
attacks killed
29 people. At least 14 died at a
restaurant

06:23.116 --> 06:28.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's popular with Shiite
fighters in the
south. and in Basra, a car bomb
in a commercial

06:28.121 --> 06:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
district left five dead. Search
teams sifted
through the charred hulks of
cars looking

06:34.060 --> 06:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for victims. Islamic State
extremists claimed
responsibility for most of the
attacks.

06:40.233 --> 06:45.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, a new
analysis finds
prices of widely used
medications have shot

06:45.372 --> 06:50.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up sharply in five years.
Reuters reports
manufacturers of four of the top
10 drugs

06:50.777 --> 06:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the U.S. raised prices by
more than 100
percent since 2011. The cost of
six other

06:56.850 --> 07:02.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medicines increased by more than
50 percent
in that time, among them, the
arthritis drugs

07:02.856 --> 07:07.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Humira and Enbrel, and the
asthma drug Advair.

07:07.160 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heart patients have some new
developments
to talk over with their doctors.
Findings

07:11.564 --> 07:16.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
published this week show
anti-cholesterol
statin drugs can prevent heart
attacks even

07:16.536 --> 07:21.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in patients with only a
borderline risk. And
for those who don't tolerate
statins well,

07:21.675 --> 07:28.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
another study finds an
alternative is showing
promise. It's known as a PCSK9
inhibitor.

07:28.315 --> 07:34.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BP's record settlement over the
2010 Gulf
oil spill has cleared its final
hurdle. A

07:34.654 --> 07:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal judge in New Orleans
today approved
the roughly $20 billion deal.
Much of it will

07:39.426 --> 07:44.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
go to state and local
governments. In 2012,
BP reached a similar settlement
on private

07:45.031 --> 07:46.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
damage claims.

07:46.900 --> 07:52.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average lost more than 55 points
to close

07:52.605 --> 07:58.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at 17737. The Nasdaq fell 22
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped six.

07:58.778 --> 08:03.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the Panama
Papers, a massive trove of
documents exposing

08:03.483 --> 08:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the secret world of shell
companies and offshore
accounts; In Wisconsin, the
final push for

08:09.255 --> 08:19.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes as polls predict tight
races for both
Democrats and Republicans; and
much more.

08:19.299 --> 08:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes as polls predict tight
races for both
Democrats and Republicans; and
much more.

08:28.375 --> 08:33.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The project is called the Panama
Papers. It
represents the work of hundreds
of journalists

08:33.046 --> 08:38.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in dozens of countries,
coordinated by the
International Consortium for
Investigative

08:38.218 --> 08:40.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Journalism, or ICIJ.

08:40.487 --> 08:45.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The project exposes the dealings
of a Panamanian
law firm called Mossack Fonseca,
and its work

08:45.892 --> 08:50.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in allegedly creating shell
companies for
the global rich and powerful to
hide and launder

08:50.730 --> 08:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money and to evade taxes. More
than 11 million
law firm documents were
initially provided

08:57.070 --> 09:00.106 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a German newspaper by an
anonymous source.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Among the world leaders
allegedly involved
in these schemes, the presidents
of Argentina

09:04.677 --> 09:09.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Ukraine, the king of Saudi
Arabia, and
the prime minister of Iceland.

09:09.883 --> 09:15.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The papers also detail the
elaborate financial
dealings of the friends and
relatives of both

09:15.121 --> 09:18.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
and Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad.

09:18.825 --> 09:25.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The real-world effect of these
deals is shown,
in part, in this video released
by ICIJ and

09:25.398 --> 09:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Pulitzer Center on Crisis
Reporting, a
frequent "NewsHour" partner.

09:30.069 --> 09:36.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Over the past three
years, Syria's
air forces rained death on more
than 21,000

09:36.443 --> 09:43.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
civilians, their bodies ripped
apart by exploding
barrel bombs, missiles dropped
on homes, businesses,

09:43.983 --> 09:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
bus stops, even hospitals.

09:46.820 --> 09:51.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These war crimes have been
well-documented.
Not so the part played by the
shadowy world

09:51.825 --> 09:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of offshore finance. Behind the
scenes, companies
using offshore tax havens were
accused of

09:59.399 --> 10:05.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supplying fuel to the Syrian air
force. In
2014, multiple governments,
including the

10:05.572 --> 10:09.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.K. and U.S., issued bans on
doing business
with these companies.

10:09.776 --> 10:15.315 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But now a new global
investigation has revealed
that a Panamanian firm helped
these companies

10:15.348 --> 10:21.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operate as attacks in Syria
continued. That
firm, Mossack Fonseca, is a key
player in

10:21.721 --> 10:26.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sprawling, secretive industry
that the world's
rich and powerful used to hide
assets and

10:26.559 --> 10:31.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
skirt rules but setting up front
companies
in far-flung jurisdictions.

10:31.831 --> 10:36.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 300 journalists
trolled through
millions of leaked records from
Mossack Fonseca

10:36.402 --> 10:42.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to expose an alarming list of
clients involved
in bribery, arms deals, tax
evasion, financial

10:42.675 --> 10:45.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fraud and drug trafficking.

10:45.845 --> 10:54.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Behind the invoices, e-mails and
paper trails
are real victims. In Uganda, a
company that

10:54.387 --> 11:00.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wanted to sell a prospective oil
field paid
Mossack Fonseca to help it avoid
$400 million

11:00.326 --> 11:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in taxes. It was sent the
paperwork. The company's
address was changed from one tax
haven to

11:06.199 --> 11:13.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
another. In a country where one
in three people
live on less than $1.25 a day,
$400 million

11:13.273 --> 11:16.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
represents more than the
government's annual
health budget.

11:16.242 --> 11:21.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Uganda spent years in court
trying to force
the company to pay its taxes.
Meanwhile, hospitals

11:22.015 --> 11:27.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the shadow of the oil field
lacked funds
for even the most basic
equipment. Patients

11:27.754 --> 11:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slept on floors and were asked
to bring their
own medical supplies like
sterile gloves and

11:32.492 --> 11:34.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cotton balls.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): It
was a surprise
to me, because I expected all of
this equipment

11:37.931 --> 11:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be at the health center. No,
these things
are not there. Nurses say, we
cannot work

11:42.168 --> 11:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on you. At times, we are forced
to leave and
return home unattended to.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some women have lost their legs
and babies.

11:49.042 --> 11:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Uganda ranks among the
worst 10
countries in the world for high
maternal,

11:53.313 --> 11:57.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
newborn and child mortality
rates due to a
lack of access to good health
care.

11:57.417 --> 12:02.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In a statement to
the International
Consortium of Investigative
Journalists, Mossack

12:02.188 --> 12:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fonseca said it never knowingly
allowed the
use of its companies by
individuals with a

12:06.793 --> 12:11.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relationship to Syria. The law
firm said it
was quick to report suspicious
activity, always

12:11.864 --> 12:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cooperated with authorities, and
that it doesn't
-- quote -- "offer solutions
whose purpose

12:16.703 --> 12:20.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to hide unlawful acts such as
tax evasion."

12:20.273 --> 12:24.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on all of this, we turn
to Gerard
Ryle, the director of the ICIJ,
and Shruti

12:24.911 --> 12:30.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shah. She's vice president of
Transparency
International-USA, a watchdog
group that seeks

12:30.717 --> 12:32.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to expose corruption globally.

12:32.819 --> 12:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Gerard Ryle, tell us,
explain to us what
these folks are doing in these
dealings, and

12:37.323 --> 12:39.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what is illegal about it?

12:39.158 --> 12:41.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GERARD RYLE, Director,
International Consortium
of Investigative Journalists:
Well, a lot

12:41.094 --> 12:44.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of what happens in the offshore
world is actually
legal, but where you have
secrecy, which is

12:44.464 --> 12:48.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
exactly what the offshore world
abides, then
you have the potential for
wrongdoing.

12:48.968 --> 12:52.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And certainly, in the documents
that we have
seen, there was wrongdoing. I
mean, it's almost

12:52.972 --> 12:57.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ridiculous to think that Mossack
Fonseca,
this company, didn't actually
know who their

12:57.043 --> 13:01.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clients were. And some of these
clients appear
on sanctions lists, for
instance, or they

13:01.314 --> 13:03.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are drug dealers or mafia
bosses.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, when they put
out a statement
that says this wasn't our intent
to facilitate

13:07.020 --> 13:08.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
anything illegal?

13:08.388 --> 13:10.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GERARD RYLE: I think it is the
whole system
here that is wrong.

13:10.757 --> 13:14.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think what you're seeing here
is, they are
claiming their major -- their
clients were

13:14.293 --> 13:19.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually the banks and the
accountancy firms
that were basically going to
them for their

13:19.265 --> 13:24.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
end client. It's almost
unbelievable to think
that they actually didn't know
who these people

13:24.070 --> 13:25.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really were.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Shruti Shah, they
often say it
is what is legal that is the
crime.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHRUTI SHAH, Vice President,
Transparency
International-USA: You're
absolutely right

13:29.542 --> 13:31.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
there as well.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what Gerard just said was
that it is absolutely
legal in many parts of the world
to form a

13:34.747 --> 13:40.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
company without disclosing who
the true beneficial
owner is, including right here
in the United

13:40.253 --> 13:41.954 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In every state in the U.S., you
can form a
company without having to
disclose who the

13:45.925 --> 13:51.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
person is that really controls
the company
or derives economic benefit from
it. And also

13:51.097 --> 13:56.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
here, you know, people,
gatekeepers such as
real estate agents and others,
don't have

13:56.803 --> 14:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do any due diligence on
buyers' identities
or the sources of their funds.

14:01.240 --> 14:05.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what he has pointed out is
really the
crux of the problem. The
structure needs reform.

14:05.878 --> 14:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Even though, in this
case, in
these sets of documents, we
haven't seen -- or

14:09.415 --> 14:12.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least I haven't read about a
lot of U.S.
names and U.S. connections.

14:12.185 --> 14:16.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD RYLE: Well, it is the
first time, though,
we are actually seeing U.S.
jurisdictions

14:16.456 --> 14:18.224 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
coming out in a big leak.

14:18.257 --> 14:21.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are seeing a lot of documents
from Nevada,
for instance, and also from
Wyoming, which

14:22.028 --> 14:25.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have never seen before. But,
I mean, people
think of the offshore world as
being some

14:25.965 --> 14:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Caribbean island somewhere. It's
not. It is
actually spread around the
world. It is in

14:28.835 --> 14:30.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First World places, as well as
Third World
places.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Where are the most
popular places
to hide money?

14:33.339 --> 14:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD RYLE: Well, the most
popular place
to hide money is here in the
U.S., in fact,

14:36.876 --> 14:38.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and in Britain.

14:38.678 --> 14:43.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the money flow that we
see from Russia,
from China, from Africa is
actually coming

14:43.483 --> 14:48.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in to the banks here in the U.S.
and to Britain.
And that's why we're seeing so
many banks

14:48.788 --> 14:51.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the data. They are actually
the users of
this world.

14:51.724 --> 14:57.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Are you saying that
it is perfectly
fine for people to do that, as
long as the

14:57.463 --> 14:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
laws do not account for anything
shady?

14:59.432 --> 15:06.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHRUTI SHAH: What I am saying is
that it shouldn't
be so easy for money launderers,
drug traffickers

15:06.305 --> 15:10.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other criminals from around
the world
including corrupt public
officials, to be

15:10.209 --> 15:15.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to access the global
financial system
with such ease using anonymous
companies and

15:15.782 --> 15:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hide their true identities.

15:17.817 --> 15:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This veil has to be lifted. We
really need
to know who the true owners are
behind these

15:22.321 --> 15:28.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies. And we need to end
the secrecy,
particularly, as Gerard pointed
out, Delaware

15:28.361 --> 15:33.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is home to thousands of shell
companies. Nevada,
which he pointed out.

15:33.266 --> 15:38.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, Mossack Fonseca has a
presence in Nevada,
and it's not by accident. Again,
it's one

15:38.604 --> 15:41.841 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those states that is known
for its business-friendly
corporation laws.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Has there been
fallout from the
publication of this information
so far?

15:45.611 --> 15:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD RYLE: Well, before we
even published,
Vladimir Putin's spokesman came
out last Monday

15:50.516 --> 15:56.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and attacked us because we had
sent a list
of questions asking why
associates very close

15:56.222 --> 16:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to him, what we were seeing in
the documents
is almost $2 billion had flowed
through offshore

16:01.127 --> 16:07.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies involving people very
close to Vladimir
Putin, including the godfather
of his child.

16:07.600 --> 16:12.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And one of the offshore
companies we saw was
the owner of a ski resort in
Russia where

16:13.005 --> 16:14.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vladimir Putin's daughter got
married.

16:14.907 --> 16:18.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I saw that Nawaz
Sharif, the prime
minister of Pakistan, his
children all have

16:18.344 --> 16:19.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these kinds of companies.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GERARD RYLE: Yes.

16:21.147 --> 16:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we saw the biggest ever
protest in Iceland
today. In fact, the entire
parliament house

16:24.817 --> 16:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there was surrounded by people
protesting
about the fact that we revealed
that the prime

16:29.222 --> 16:34.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minister of Iceland had a secret
offshore
account that had millions of
dollars in bank

16:34.460 --> 16:36.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bonds.

16:36.229 --> 16:39.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you recall, in Iceland,
there was a
crisis a few years ago where all
the banks

16:39.232 --> 16:43.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
melted down. And he was actually
elected to
sort that problem out, without
telling the

16:43.236 --> 16:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people that he had a secret
company that had
bonds in the same banks.

16:47.340 --> 16:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: If you are an
ordinary person
who has a savings account, a
checking account,

16:50.943 --> 16:53.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe still a passbook, how does
this affect
you?

16:53.312 --> 16:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHRUTI SHAH: Let me explain how
it affects
you, both in the international
stage and right

16:57.149 --> 16:59.285 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
here in the U.S.

16:59.318 --> 17:04.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the international scene, when
you see corrupt
people stealing money from their
own people,

17:04.390 --> 17:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it leads to loss of trust in
government. It
creates instability, leads to
conflict, and

17:08.661 --> 17:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
really poses a national security
problem for
the U.S.

17:12.398 --> 17:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of right here domestic
-- in the
domestic context, you see the
real estate

17:17.303 --> 17:22.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boom in places like Manhattan
and also Miami
being fueled by these anonymous
real estate

17:22.375 --> 17:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
purchases, which means that
ordinary citizens
like doctors, nurses,
schoolteachers can't

17:29.682 --> 17:32.218 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
buy houses in these places
because they are
so unaffordable.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is how, I think, it really
affects us
in the U.S.

17:34.987 --> 17:39.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Gerard Ryle, we're
talking about
more than 11 million documents
from one single

17:39.692 --> 17:40.159 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
law firm.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GERARD RYLE: Yes.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is this the tip of
an iceberg?

17:42.895 --> 17:45.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERARD RYLE: It has to be,
because we know
that even though Mossack Fonseca
is one of

17:45.731 --> 17:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the biggest incorporators of
offshore companies
around the world, there are
about 800 others

17:50.736 --> 17:52.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ones around there.

17:52.505 --> 17:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we are only really seeing a
small slice
of this world. And what is
stunning is that

17:55.574 --> 18:00.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are so many politicians
that we -- what
we saw. There are 12 current and
former world

18:00.913 --> 18:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders. There are about 140
politicians in
all, and then hundreds more of
their associates.

18:05.985 --> 18:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, Shruti Shah, how
do you get
to the bottom of this?

18:08.321 --> 18:10.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHRUTI SHAH: Well, you need to
call for reform.

18:10.523 --> 18:14.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is where they have done
us a whole
lot of good in calling attention
to this issue

18:14.560 --> 18:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of anonymous companies. There
have been several
past investigations which have
talked about

18:19.031 --> 18:22.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the role that anonymous
companies play in
aiding criminals.

18:22.902 --> 18:28.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I really do hope that this
actually leads
to actual structural reform,
i.e., in the

18:28.040 --> 18:33.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S., we start collecting
information on beneficial
ownership of shell companies. We
do ask our

18:33.646 --> 18:36.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gatekeepers, such as people in
the real estate
industry, to do due diligence.

18:36.816 --> 18:41.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, responsibility lies
with the banks.
Banks should be required to
determine and

18:41.687 --> 18:46.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
verify who the beneficial owner
is of their
covered clients. I think that
all of these

18:46.759 --> 18:51.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three things, if we can manage
to do them
in the U.S., it would make the
U.S. financial

18:51.797 --> 18:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
system less vulnerable to dirty
money.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This seems so much
easier said
than done. What you just laid
out sounds like

18:58.237 --> 19:00.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a very high mountain to change.

19:00.473 --> 19:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHRUTI SHAH: I would disagree.
Two of these
things can be done without
legislation.

19:05.277 --> 19:11.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With regard to my last point
about, you know,
requiring financial institutions
to determine

19:11.217 --> 19:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and verify the beneficial owner
of the (INAUDIBLE)
actually proposed a rule in
2014. It still

19:19.358 --> 19:24.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needs to be finalized -- 18
months after the
rule was introduced, it has not
yet been finalized.

19:24.330 --> 19:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Maybe this will give them the
push to do it.

19:25.898 --> 19:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Maybe so.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Shruti Shah, vice president of
Transparency
International, and Gerard Ryle,
the director

19:31.570 --> 19:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the ICIJ, thank you both very
much.

19:34.273 --> 19:37.743 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHRUTI SHAH: Thank you.

19:37.777 --> 19:41.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GERARD RYLE: Thank you.

19:41.313 --> 19:46.552 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHRUTI SHAH: Thank you so much.

19:46.585 --> 19:49.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

19:49.121 --> 19:54.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
the drop
in oil prices is hurting a key
U.S. ally in

19:54.527 --> 20:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fight against ISIS; and a
look at the
intense social pressures
American girls face

20:00.499 --> 20:03.135 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a world dominated by
smartphones.

20:03.169 --> 20:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, John Yang has been
in Wisconsin
this past week talking to
voters. It's a battle-tested

20:09.942 --> 20:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state that's seen its share of
political turmoil
over the past five years.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Team Trump pass. Make
America great again
hats.

20:17.917 --> 20:22.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Hours before the
doors opened on
Sunday, people were already
lining up outside

20:22.822 --> 20:25.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Donald Trump rally in West
Allis, Wisconsin.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Go Trump. Whoo!

20:27.760 --> 20:33.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Jim Marlow, a small
business owner
from Muskego, got here at noon
for the event

20:33.199 --> 20:35.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that began at 7:00 p.m.

20:35.134 --> 20:41.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I see strength and I see
power and I
see somebody who's not afraid to
say it like

20:41.407 --> 20:48.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he feels it. Even if he
potentially is a little
abrasive sometimes, you know
what, when I'm

20:48.214 --> 20:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in my living room, I'm a little
abrasive too.

20:50.349 --> 20:56.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Leanne Patnod (ph)
and her daughter,
Kayla Lumay (ph), came from
Green Bay, 125

20:56.655 --> 20:58.424 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
miles away.

20:58.457 --> 21:04.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: He may be a billionaire,
but he feels
a lot of the same way us poor
people feel,

21:04.497 --> 21:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you know, the tax issue, the
illegal immigrants
taking jobs, the manufacturing
going overseas.

21:12.071 --> 21:15.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know, we have lost a lot.

21:15.875 --> 21:21.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: All of that praise
sounds familiar,
but Wisconsin is presenting
Trump with something

21:21.046 --> 21:26.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's never seen before, united
opposition
from the state's Republican
establishment

21:26.619 --> 21:28.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and conservative media.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CHARLES FRANKLIN, Marquette
University
Law School: There is clear
opposition to Donald

21:30.189 --> 21:35.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump because is he front-runner
and a real
effort in the Republican Party
to prevent

21:35.261 --> 21:37.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him from being the nominee.

21:37.062 --> 21:42.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Charles Franklin is
the director
of the respected Marquette Law
School poll.

21:42.134 --> 21:47.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His latest survey shows that Ted
Cruz has
catapulted into a 10-point
statewide lead

21:47.940 --> 21:49.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over Trump.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CHARLES FRANKLIN: That's a
tremendous
increase, and I don't think Ted
Cruz's issue

21:52.878 --> 21:54.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
positions changed over that
period.

21:54.947 --> 21:59.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Cruz gained momentum
last week
with an endorsement from
Republican Governor

21:59.118 --> 22:00.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Scott Walker.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SYKES, Radio Talk Show
Host: The notion
that Donald Trump has and that
many of the

22:03.822 --> 22:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trumpkins have that the politics
is involved
with smash-mouth.

22:07.493 --> 22:11.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: In addition,
conservative talk
show hosts like Charley Sykes
are using the

22:12.031 --> 22:15.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
airwaves to rally their
audiences against
Trump.

22:15.067 --> 22:19.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SYKES: Ted Cruz was not
my first choice
or my second choice. I'm more
anti-Trump than

22:19.572 --> 22:24.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am pro-Cruz. So, you know, the
key thing
at this point is to stop Donald
Trump from

22:24.944 --> 22:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting that 1,237 votes on the
first ballot
of the convention.

22:30.216 --> 22:35.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's actually almost this
cartoon version
of every stereotype that
liberals would have

22:35.254 --> 22:40.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of what they think of
conservative, xenophobic,
racist, misogynistic. But the
problem is,

22:40.292 --> 22:44.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's not a cartoon. He is the
leading Republican
candidate. And it poses a threat
to everything

22:44.964 --> 22:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we have claimed about ourselves,
everything
we have tried to do.

22:47.933 --> 22:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What about the other
Republican
candidate, Ohio Governor John
Kasich?

22:52.137 --> 22:55.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE SYKES: The vote on April
5 is going
to be a binary choice. This is
going to be

22:55.741 --> 23:01.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the closest thing you have had
to a head-to-head
matchup between Ted Cruz and
Donald Trump,

23:01.213 --> 23:04.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I think it is going to be
the first of
the rest of the campaign.

23:04.950 --> 23:12.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But at a Kasich event
at a Madison
sports bar over the weekend,
Brian Keith,

23:12.057 --> 23:15.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an accountant from Monroe, said
he's sticking
with the man from Ohio.

23:16.028 --> 23:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I think that John Kasich
has got a huge
ramp to go up to try to make it.
But, at the

23:22.101 --> 23:25.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of the day, maybe there is a
chance that
if he gets some momentum here in
Wisconsin,

23:25.838 --> 23:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he starts moving forward, that
maybe there
is something that can happen.

23:30.276 --> 23:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump has no character.
Sorry to say
it. And from what I have seen
with Ted Cruz,

23:35.481 --> 23:40.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure that he's got the
amount of character
needed either. So we need
better-character

23:41.020 --> 23:43.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people running America and
helping America
be better.

23:43.989 --> 23:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Democratic
front-runner is
also facing a tough challenge
here in Wisconsin.

23:49.295 --> 23:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Polls show Hillary Clinton and
Bernie Sanders
in a virtual tie. But the
dynamics of that

23:54.433 --> 23:57.069 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
race are very different from the
Republicans.

23:57.102 --> 24:02.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CHARLES FRANKLIN: On the
Democratic side,
it's less clear that this is an
attempt to

24:02.274 --> 24:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prevent Hillary Clinton from
being the nominee.

24:05.077 --> 24:10.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Over this snowy
weekend at the
Dane County farmer's market in
Madison, the

24:10.683 --> 24:12.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talk over breakfast, politics.

24:12.117 --> 24:17.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: They can get behind such
extremism
as Donald Trump.

24:17.156 --> 24:23.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Retired teachers Ruby
and Joe Cabibbo
now run a bakery. They like what
Sanders says,

24:23.896 --> 24:25.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but they're voting for Clinton.

24:25.631 --> 24:29.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE CABIBBO, Wisconsin: Reaching
too high
isn't necessarily going to get
very much done.

24:29.935 --> 24:36.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think her approach is more
realistic
and have a better chance of
actually being

24:36.709 --> 24:38.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
implemented.

24:38.644 --> 24:42.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUBY CABIBBO, Wisconsin: I think
part of it
is her plans have more
forethought and follow-through

24:42.214 --> 24:47.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in them. And I think what she is
supposing,
she is going to be able to do.
And that's

24:47.486 --> 24:49.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why I'm strongly behind her.

24:49.555 --> 24:55.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But in this liberal
enclave, home
to the University of Wisconsin,
we found a

24:55.794 --> 24:57.463 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lot of Sanders supporters.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
M.J. Bowman (ph) is a nurse.

24:59.531 --> 25:03.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I tell people all the
time don't listen
what people say about Bernie.
Listen to what

25:03.936 --> 25:07.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie has to say. And you will
get it, because
he gets it.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Travis Gorash (ph) is
a graduate
student.

25:09.575 --> 25:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: He believes in a lot of the
same interests
that I do, mainly getting
corporate interests

25:15.080 --> 25:21.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of politics, decreasing the
price of higher
education overall. So, out of
the two candidates,

25:21.153 --> 25:23.856 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he is the choice for me.

25:23.889 --> 25:27.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Rachel Beerstra (ph)
and Alissa
Redazel (ph) are Wisconsin
juniors.

25:28.026 --> 25:31.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I think that like, in
this country,
big money has just gotten too
much into politics,

25:31.897 --> 25:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is, like, exactly what
politics shouldn't
be, because it should of and by
and for the

25:35.701 --> 25:37.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

25:37.469 --> 25:41.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: If you just look at
everything that
he has been saying over the
entire kind of

25:41.306 --> 25:46.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time frame that he has been in
politics or
around politics, he's been
pretty consistent.

25:46.678 --> 25:50.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's not something that I
am seeing
with a lot of the other
candidates.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Polls show this is
Sanders' base.

25:53.852 --> 25:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CHARLES FRANKLIN: Sanders is
doing enormously
well with voters under 45 and
unbelievably

25:59.892 --> 26:01.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
well among those under 30.

26:01.693 --> 26:06.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters are telling us in their
polls that
even young voters are going to
go to the polls.

26:06.465 --> 26:12.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that's the great question
for Election
Day, is, do those young voters
really turn

26:12.571 --> 26:17.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out for Sanders and give him
that enormous
vote, which is holding him up in
the polls

26:17.776 --> 26:19.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now?

26:19.711 --> 26:23.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: I would like to get rid
of the stigma
for students. I don't like that,
the unreliability.

26:23.248 --> 26:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't like that. Don't think
of us as unreliable.
Think of us as people that are
just as interested

26:29.455 --> 26:30.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in this as you are.

26:30.689 --> 26:32.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton's strengths
are in urban
Milwaukee.

26:32.858 --> 26:39.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. CHARLES FRANKLIN: Among
likely voters,
Hillary Clinton is winning
nonwhite voters

26:39.198 --> 26:41.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
pretty substantially.

26:41.133 --> 26:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At the farmer's
market, we also
met undecided voters like
retired forest pathologist

26:45.337 --> 26:47.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Alan Pray (ph).

26:47.139 --> 26:49.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Well, I was going to have
coffee with
one of my friends on Monday, and
we're going

26:49.675 --> 26:54.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to talk about it. So, I will be
down to the
last minute. When I walk in
there, I won't

26:54.446 --> 26:59.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know until I'm going to -- when
I actually
get the ballot on Tuesday
morning.

26:59.685 --> 27:04.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's a dilemma, no
doubt, that
many voters across Wisconsin are
facing tonight.

27:04.990 --> 27:07.993 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Milwaukee.

27:08.026 --> 27:13.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And on the trail
today, the Republican
candidates jabbed at each other
in the final

27:13.398 --> 27:15.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hours before the polls open in
Wisconsin.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
When we get to the convention,
they're going

27:17.903 --> 27:23.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to wonder, who can beat Hillary,
which I consistently
do and they do not. And that's
why they're

27:23.809 --> 27:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starting to trash me. They want
to dirty me
up, like they have dirtied
themselves up.

27:28.547 --> 27:31.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
He's one and 30. He ought to get
the hell

27:31.850 --> 27:34.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, honestly. He's just like a
stubborn guy.
He's stubborn. He doesn't want
to leave. They

27:35.020 --> 27:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
asked him the other day, are you
going to
leave? No, I'm not going to
leave.

27:37.890 --> 27:42.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let me tell you, he hurts me
much more
than he hurts Cruz. Cruz wants
him out. Cruz

27:42.594 --> 27:44.429 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is wrong.

27:44.463 --> 27:46.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
Our campaign still has a clear
path to earning

27:46.198 --> 27:50.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1,237 delegates before the
convention. That
is our plan A. That's what we're
focused on

27:50.702 --> 27:54.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doing. Now, I recognize Donald
wants to change
the standard; he doesn't want
the standard

27:54.806 --> 27:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be who can earn a majority,
because he
can't earn a majority.

27:57.209 --> 28:02.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the Democratic
side, Bernie
Sanders touted his chances
against his rival

28:02.047 --> 28:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the upcoming primaries, while
Clinton focused
her criticism on the Republican
front-runner.

28:07.185 --> 28:11.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
If we win in New York ate,
between you and

28:11.123 --> 28:13.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me, I don't want to get Hillary
Clinton more
nervous than she already is.

28:13.659 --> 28:13.992 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:14.026 --> 28:15.727 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

28:15.761 --> 28:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: She's
already under a
lot of pressure. So don't tell
her this.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.334 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:22.367 --> 28:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: But I
think, we win here,
we win in New York state, we're
on our way

28:22.901 --> 28:24.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the White House.

28:24.803 --> 28:27.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
There are people who don't
believe that the

28:27.372 --> 28:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minimum wage should be raised.
In fact, Donald
Trump has said that wages are
too high. A

28:35.547 --> 28:41.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lot of members of his party
agree. Right?

28:41.787 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: He's fired.

28:43.956 --> 28:44.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: "He's
fired." That's
funny.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:46.491 --> 28:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on what's
next on the
path to the White House, we turn
to Politics

28:49.294 --> 28:51.096 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Monday.

28:51.129 --> 28:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's Tamara Keith of NPR
joining us tonight
from Milwaukee, and Amy Walter
of The Cook

28:55.033 --> 28:56.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Political Report.

28:56.702 --> 29:00.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, so, Amy, let's start with
this countdown
to Wisconsin. What do you
expect?

29:00.205 --> 29:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: The
expectations now -- and, of
course, they have

29:03.275 --> 29:08.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not always proved to be correct,
but the expectations
right now, Ted Cruz ahead in
Wisconsin, will

29:08.814 --> 29:10.582 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
win Wisconsin.

29:10.616 --> 29:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bernie Sanders with a very
narrow lead,
he could still hold on to that,
but it's not

29:13.919 --> 29:15.420 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to be a blowout.

29:15.454 --> 29:17.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, you are in
Wisconsin tonight.
What's it look like there?

29:17.823 --> 29:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Well,
there is a little snow falling.
And I have

29:21.660 --> 29:26.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been to a couple of Bernie
Sanders events
in the last couple of days where
they had

29:26.832 --> 29:29.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a bigger venue than they
ultimately needed.

29:29.401 --> 29:35.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was an event at a big
basketball arena
last night. It holds 17,000
people. About

29:35.340 --> 29:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
5,000 showed up. Tonight, he was
supposed
to be in another big basketball
arena here

29:41.046 --> 29:45.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Milwaukee, and they moved the
event to
nearby convention center.

29:45.517 --> 29:51.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, part of that may also be
that Donald
Trump has a rally very nearby
and they wanted

29:51.590 --> 29:53.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to get a little bit more
separation.

29:53.392 --> 29:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's really hard to
tell anymore
from crowd sizes, because he has
been getting

29:56.461 --> 29:58.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- incredible crowd sizes rule
the day.

29:58.563 --> 30:03.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Crowd sizes -- the
other thing
to point out, Bernie Sanders
gets 4,000 people,

30:03.368 --> 30:09.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and that is considered
disappointing. Hillary
Clinton gets 2,300, and that is
a really big

30:09.574 --> 30:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rally for Hillary Clinton.

30:11.410 --> 30:15.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So let's talk about
the Republicans
for a moment. Donald Trump is
goading John

30:15.647 --> 30:18.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kasich to quit. Why won't he?

30:18.517 --> 30:22.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: I think John Kasich
really believes
in what he said in that clip,
which is: At

30:22.587 --> 30:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the end of the day you have two
very damaged
candidates who are either
trailing Hillary

30:27.759 --> 30:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton by a great deal, which
is Donald Trump,
or tied with Hillary Clinton and
has very

30:31.997 --> 30:39.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
high negatives. I do not. And I
will look
like a much better candidate
come July, and

30:39.104 --> 30:41.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people will turn to me because
they will see
the other two can't win.

30:41.573 --> 30:46.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem with that is two
things. One,
what Republican primary voters
have said throughout

30:46.578 --> 30:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this primary is, we may not all
agree on the
same candidate, but one thing
that 60-plus

30:51.783 --> 30:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of voters have said so
far is, we
don't want somebody who is
considered an establishment

30:56.488 --> 31:00.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or an insider. Kasich fits into
the establishment
insider category.

31:00.959 --> 31:05.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other thing that they
have been looking
for is somebody who is going to
shake up the

31:05.363 --> 31:10.068 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
system. John Kasich, not
somebody who is going
to shake up the system. So it's
very difficult

31:10.102 --> 31:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for me to believe that, even if
it gets very
messy, which it's going to be,
much messier,

31:16.975 --> 31:21.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the time we get to the
convention, Kasich
still has a very difficult path
ahead of him

31:21.313 --> 31:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be seen as the person who
would be picked.

31:24.116 --> 31:27.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And, Tam, Ted Cruz
has turned
almost exclusively to
delegate-hunting.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.521 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

31:29.554 --> 31:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, one fascinating
thing watching
TV here in Wisconsin is that Ted
Cruz is running

31:35.393 --> 31:42.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an attack ad against John
Kasich. So, Kasich
is right that they are going
after him. Ted

31:42.901 --> 31:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cruz is saying, well, maybe we
could still
get to the magic number, but
more likely he

31:48.006 --> 31:50.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just wants to prevent Donald
Trump from getting
that number.

31:50.876 --> 31:56.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And one thing
layered over all
of this, of course, Amy, is that
Donald Trump

31:56.148 --> 31:59.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- and we're getting -- we're
seeing more
and more evidence of this every
day -- is

31:59.151 --> 32:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
massively unpopular in the fall.

32:01.153 --> 32:07.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Is massively
unpopular, and it
doesn't seem to matter right now
with Republican

32:07.759 --> 32:10.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
primary voters.

32:10.128 --> 32:11.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: No.

32:11.897 --> 32:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And, in fact, Gwen,
I have been
talking about this for some time
about his

32:13.765 --> 32:19.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liabilities, and yet what
Republicans, a lot
of primary voters are saying,
they do still

32:19.871 --> 32:24.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe that is he electable and
it's important
for them to send a message.

32:24.242 --> 32:29.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, a lot of Republicans said,
you know
what, in the last two elections,
you guys

32:29.347 --> 32:33.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the media and the
establishment said you
have to support John McCain and
Mitt Romney

32:33.685 --> 32:38.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they are the winnable
candidates.
Yes, they may be too moderate,
yes, they may

32:38.523 --> 32:41.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be too establishment for you,
but these are
the only people that can win.
And then they

32:41.660 --> 32:43.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
both went on to lose.

32:43.395 --> 32:46.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a lot of Republican
primary voters
say, who are you to say who is
electable?

32:46.665 --> 32:51.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have been wrong every other
time. I think
that this is the more electable
candidate.

32:51.303 --> 32:55.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And dissuading them from that
point of view
is going to be very difficult.

32:55.907 --> 32:58.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, let's turn back
to the Democrats
for a moment.

32:58.510 --> 33:02.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a remarkable story
this morning
in The New York Times which read
a lot like

33:02.747 --> 33:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kinds of stories you read
after a campaign
is over in which the Bernie
Sanders folks

33:06.651 --> 33:12.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were openly on the record
mulling over all
the mistakes they have made so
far, if we

33:12.090 --> 33:16.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had gone after her harder in
Iowa, if only
we had done this in New
Hampshire.

33:16.261 --> 33:19.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does that change -- is that an
admission of
some kind?

33:19.431 --> 33:23.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It was sort of a
premortem postmortem.

33:23.869 --> 33:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Bernie Sanders is saying and
his campaign
staff, not in that article, but
in other venues,

33:29.407 --> 33:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are saying, absolutely, we still
believe we
have a path.

33:33.245 --> 33:37.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think that some of the
campaign staff have
said for a long time that they
wish that he

33:37.716 --> 33:41.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had gone after her, that he
hadn't let her
off the hook on the e-mails,
that he had started

33:41.786 --> 33:47.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about the speeches at
Goldman Sachs
and other companies sooner.

33:47.192 --> 33:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Bernie Sanders didn't in
part because
Bernie Sanders believes that his
brand is

33:52.697 --> 33:58.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his integrity. His brand is not
doing the
personal attacks in that way.
And in recent

33:58.203 --> 34:03.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days, he has -- he has been
going less hard
on Hillary Clinton, though today
he did mention

34:03.842 --> 34:05.610 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wall Street fund-raisers.

34:05.644 --> 34:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he has -- in some ways, it
almost seems
like his heart has never quite
been in the

34:12.851 --> 34:14.352 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attack mode.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But I should say he
is outraising
her by a lot, fund-raising.

34:16.454 --> 34:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Forty-four million
dollars,
he raised in March alone, mostly
from small-dollar

34:21.993 --> 34:24.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
contributions, people giving
again and again.

34:24.729 --> 34:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton's numbers are
just out today,
and it was $29.5 million in the
same month.

34:29.367 --> 34:36.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, Bernie Sanders is
outspending her significantly,
which means he's not going
anywhere. The premortem

34:36.374 --> 34:40.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
postmortem was a little bit
early. Bernie
Sanders can stay in this
campaign, can keep

34:40.512 --> 34:45.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running ads, outspending her on
television
ads, all the way to the
California primary

34:45.850 --> 34:47.419 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on June 6.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And scuff her up a
bit.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Well, maybe.

34:50.989 --> 34:55.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I still think, when you look
at her numbers,
she is still popular among
Democrats. She

34:55.827 --> 34:59.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bernie Sanders are equally
popular. In
fact, they both have approval
ratings among

34:59.864 --> 35:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats in the 70s. Democratic
primary voters,
even in Wisconsin, the latest
poll that we

35:05.003 --> 35:08.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saw out of Wisconsin, who are
voting for Bernie
Sanders also believe that
Hillary Clinton

35:08.940 --> 35:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is ultimately going to be the
nominee.

35:11.343 --> 35:15.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the end of the day, the best
thing going
for Hillary Clinton right now is
Donald Trump.

35:15.213 --> 35:19.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump is doing more
to motivate
the kinds of voters that Hillary
Clinton needs

35:19.651 --> 35:23.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to turn out in November than
anything she
could do on her own.

35:23.254 --> 35:28.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a skirmish going on
right now on
the Democratic side between
Hillary Clinton

35:28.827 --> 35:33.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Bernie Sanders on some
issues and over
this fight about delegates. But
on the Republican

35:33.698 --> 35:36.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
side, there is an actual, like,
thermonuclear
war.

35:36.401 --> 35:40.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But why is she
leapfrogging to
New York? She seems to be
spending more time

35:40.338 --> 35:42.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaigning there than in
Wisconsin, and that
is next week.

35:42.741 --> 35:46.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's next week.
And she wants
to be able to point an
exclamation point on

35:46.311 --> 35:48.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her delegate lead.

35:48.313 --> 35:53.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is still in the catbird
seat. She's still
on track for the nomination
based on the delegate

35:53.952 --> 35:58.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
count. The only way for Sanders
to catch up
is to win Wisconsin by a huge
percentage,

35:58.790 --> 36:02.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then to defeat her in New
York. Again,
he would have to beat her by a
big percentage.

36:02.093 --> 36:06.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If she wins New York by a big
margin, the
delegate numbers just simply
aren't going

36:06.498 --> 36:10.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to add up for Bernie Sanders.
But, at the
end of the day, as I said, I
don't think this

36:10.769 --> 36:16.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a fight that is problematic
for the ultimate
Democratic nominee. It's the
fight that is

36:16.274 --> 36:20.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going on, on the Republican side
that is helping
energize Democrats.

36:20.345 --> 36:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that this fight has not
been bloody
and messy, like it has been on
the Republican

36:24.449 --> 36:28.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side, is a good thing for
Democrats. And,
quite frankly, for Hillary
Clinton to hone

36:28.486 --> 36:33.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in on the message that Bernie
Sanders has
raised about income inequality,
stagnant middle

36:33.558 --> 36:36.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
class, is going to be important
for her to
have throughout the fall.

Citadel have

37:19.571 --> 37:25.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fluctuated dramatically over the
centuries.
Nowadays, times are tough. The
economy in

37:25.376 --> 37:30.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kurdistan is in freefall.
Government salaries
have stopped, and other work is
hard to come

37:30.949 --> 37:35.353 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by, as foreign investors have
fled.

DAWOOD MADHI, Kurdistan (through

I have three sons who don't have
work. Also,

37:53.505 --> 37:58.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I used to have a small pension,
which was
not even enough to buy medicine
for my illness.

37:58.376 --> 38:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I receive about $150 a month. I
am 66 years
old and I am retired. I am not
able to do

38:05.416 --> 38:07.218 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
another job.

38:07.252 --> 38:13.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Those protecting
these lands
are also not getting paid.
Kurdish fighters,

38:13.158 --> 38:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called Peshmerga, who defend the
semiautonomous
region, saw their wages stop
four months ago.

38:20.365 --> 38:26.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since ISIS overran swathes of
Iraq in 2014,
Peshmerga forces have pushed
them back from

38:26.304 --> 38:32.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kurdish lands. They are now
holding a lengthy
front line against the group,
aided by us

38:32.577 --> 38:38.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airstrikes and intelligence.
They are America's
strongest ally in the fight
against ISIS.

38:38.483 --> 38:43.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Senators John McCain and
Lindsey Graham
are pushing to find emergency
funds for the

38:43.821 --> 38:49.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kurds. So far, that money hasn't
arrived,
and the Peshmerga are broke.

38:49.627 --> 38:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kurdistan's regional government
spokesman,
Safin Dizayi, fully admits this
is a crisis.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAFIN DIZAYI, Kurdish Regional
Government
Spokesman: Definitely, the
Peshmerga are fighting

38:58.403 --> 39:04.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a war which is a matter of life
and death.
They will continue to fight even
if they are

39:04.842 --> 39:12.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- if they continue to be
unpaid. But while
they are fighting and they are
very vulnerable

39:12.717 --> 39:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to attack of ISIL in every form,
their families
have to survive. Their kids have
to go to

39:18.990 --> 39:20.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
school.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: Peshmerga forces
are woefully
underequipped, says the
government here.

39:23.628 --> 39:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAFIN DIZAYI: When we have
international delegations
and senior people coming to
Kurdistan, they

39:27.832 --> 39:34.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go to the battlefront. They
speak very highly
of Peshmergas. They pat on the
back, and,

39:34.606 --> 39:38.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unfortunately, sometimes, we
have been patronized.
We can do without the
patronizing.

39:38.776 --> 39:46.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we need is some more
assistance, particularly
for the Peshmergas. And this
war, if this

39:46.084 --> 39:53.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
war needs to be won -- often,
people say that
Peshmergas are fighting for --
on behalf of

39:53.291 --> 39:57.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the international community and
the free world.
If that is the case, then there
has to be

39:57.262 --> 40:02.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more assistance. Yes, we do
appreciate what
has been provided so far, but
this is not

40:02.533 --> 40:04.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sufficient.

40:04.369 --> 40:09.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: The economy here
has largely
depended on oil exports in
recent years. Oil

40:09.807 --> 40:16.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
revenues and foreign investors
made Kurdistan
a booming success story from
2003. Since then,

40:16.881 --> 40:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a crash in oil prices and a war
with ISIS
have pushed that boom into a
bust.

40:23.187 --> 40:27.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After disputes over oil exports,
the Baghdad
government has frozen payments
to Kurdistan

40:27.859 --> 40:32.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the country's national
budget. Legally,
Kurdistan is entitled to 17
percent of all

40:33.031 --> 40:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oil revenues from Baghdad's
annual budget.
Since those were cut in 2014, it
is estimated

40:39.170 --> 40:41.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Baghdad owes Kurdistan around
$20 billion.

40:41.739 --> 40:50.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The oil economy had funded an
oversized bureaucracy
that included excessive amounts
of government

40:50.848 --> 40:57.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
jobs. That has become
unsustainable. Construction
projects were the most visible
evidence of

40:57.188 --> 41:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the oil boom. Until the crisis,
foreign investors
had great confidence in
Kurdistan. Most construction

41:03.961 --> 41:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sites we saw in Irbil had
halted. Half-finished
highways circle the city.

Kadir, whose
construction company has a
contract to build

41:18.042 --> 41:21.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Kempinski Hotel, business has
been affected
by ISIS.

41:21.612 --> 41:27.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RIZGAR KADIR, Businessman: When
ISIS started
-- took over the Mosul, some
Indian workers

41:27.185 --> 41:33.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been kidnapped by them. The
Indian government
decided to take back all the
employees. They

41:33.358 --> 41:39.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opened an office in Irbil and
they took back
Indians. We lost around 800
employees. Now

41:39.664 --> 41:46.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have around 200 or so of them
back. We
are working on the project, but
very slow.

41:46.804 --> 41:55.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE FERGUSON: As the sun falls
over Irbil,
the city's streets become
busier. Young men

41:55.847 --> 42:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gather in this market. Many are
put off marriage
and a family until times get
better. At least

42:02.153 --> 42:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
here, they can meet friends and
enjoy a cheap
meal.

42:14.432 --> 42:19.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people here believe if their

fight ISIS," or Da'esh, as they
call the group,

42:19.103 --> 42:22.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
without a salary, they should be

42:22.273 --> 42:24.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

are just living.
And we have armed forces,
Peshmerga. They

42:31.883 --> 42:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
battle Da'esh without any money.
Yes, we have
to live without money.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Joining me now
is author
Nancy Jo Sales.

43:35.780 --> 43:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what are the challenges that
American
girls are facing today that are
different

43:40.918 --> 43:42.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the ones they have always
faced?

43:42.753 --> 43:44.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NANCY JO SALES, Author,
"American Girls: Social
Media and the Secret Lives of
Teenagers":

43:44.555 --> 43:46.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Girls use social media lot.
They're on their
phones a lot. And I think most
parents are

43:46.357 --> 43:48.326 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aware of that.

43:48.359 --> 43:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, really, the question is,
what is happening
there, and how are these kind of
-- some regrettable

43:56.434 --> 44:01.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trends that we have seen
happening for some
time, such as the sexualization
of girls,

44:01.105 --> 44:07.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bullying, how are these moving
on to phones
and on to screens? And what is
this environment

44:07.144 --> 44:09.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing to the life of girls and
boys?

44:09.714 --> 44:15.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You paint a
picture almost
of these young girls at this
kind of intersection

44:15.253 --> 44:21.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the existing angst that a
teenage girl
has, combined with this
technological leap

44:21.359 --> 44:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we're all taking together,
combined with
pornography.

44:24.128 --> 44:32.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY JO SALES: Yes, I think the
kind of elephant,
maybe dinosaur in the room right
now is pornography.

44:32.370 --> 44:36.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pornography has been available
online for
some time.

44:36.173 --> 44:41.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't think we have really
begun to
have a conversation about what
that is doing

44:41.512 --> 44:47.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to kids. And we know that
they're watching
it. They're teenagers. They're
going through

44:47.151 --> 44:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
puberty. They're curious.
They're watching
pornography.

44:49.520 --> 44:54.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this tends to be more and
more violent
pornography that is also, one
could I think

44:54.859 --> 44:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reasonably say, very degrading
to women. And
this is where a lot of teenagers
now find

44:59.597 --> 45:06.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their sex-ed. And porn is also
-- the porn
aesthetic is also really
engulfing social

45:06.938 --> 45:12.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media. And social media is just
full of really
explicit sexual content.

45:12.043 --> 45:16.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whether or not your child
wants to see
it or intends to see it, they
are likely to

45:16.647 --> 45:18.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see it.

45:18.716 --> 45:23.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What happens
to all of us
when there's, on the one hand,
kind of hyper-sexualization,

45:23.087 --> 45:28.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hyper-masculinization on the
boys' side and
girls' side? And this -- if this
is the new

45:28.125 --> 45:34.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sex-ed, they have really reduced
the female
body down into this thing they
can swipe across.

45:34.899 --> 45:36.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NANCY JO SALES: Yes.

45:36.801 --> 45:42.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I think it's really
challenging for
girls especially to have an
expectation to

45:42.206 --> 45:48.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
produce images of themselves in
order to get
validation, the validation that
everybody

45:48.145 --> 45:51.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seems to want of likes and
friends and followers.

45:51.749 --> 45:56.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very challenging to them, I
think, to
have an expectation to produce
images of themselves

45:56.220 --> 46:02.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which are sexualized in which
they look -- quote,
unquote -- "hot," and also to
have to navigate

46:02.360 --> 46:06.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through all these emotions that
come through
comments that might be on these
pictures that

46:06.797 --> 46:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are about how just hot they are
or how not
hot they are.

46:09.500 --> 46:12.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You capture a
lot of different
conversations, and there seems
to be this

46:12.937 --> 46:17.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conundrum, where you ask them,
well, if this
is all the stress that's
associated with making

46:17.775 --> 46:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure you're checking up on your
likes and
your pictures and who liked you
and what did

46:21.178 --> 46:25.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they say, why are you on it? And
they seem
to say, well, I can't get off
it.

46:25.916 --> 46:27.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't get that.

46:27.585 --> 46:31.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY JO SALES: Yes, I talked to
more than
200 girls in 10 states over 30
months.

46:31.155 --> 46:34.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the things that
struck me the most
was how self-aware they are, how
articulate

46:34.992 --> 46:42.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were, how analytical they
were about
this very thing they were
engaged in so much

46:42.133 --> 46:50.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the time. And they're quite
aware of the
ways in which it's really toxic.
And yet they

46:50.041 --> 46:54.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can't leave it, because this is
-- this is
the swamp they're swimming in.
This is the

46:54.612 --> 46:58.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world they're enmeshed in, where
you have
to be on it, or you're not part
of the conversation,

46:58.382 --> 47:01.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're not part of what's
happening.

47:01.452 --> 47:06.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's -- a girl in New Jersey
described it
as a second world that we live
in. You know,

47:06.257 --> 47:09.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's the real world and then
there's the
second world that we're
simultaneously in

47:09.727 --> 47:11.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
kind of all the time.

47:11.562 --> 47:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And this is
also affecting
just their relationships with
one another,

47:15.332 --> 47:19.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even in a non-sexualized way:
Who's my best
friend and what's my best friend
allowed to

47:19.637 --> 47:24.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say or do to me? Or, you know,
it's just different
than the conversations that I
had growing

47:24.675 --> 47:26.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up and deciding who to hang out
with.

47:26.510 --> 47:30.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY JO SALES: It's different
to communicate
from behind a screen, and this
is true for

47:30.047 --> 47:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adults as well. I mean, we know
this from
multiple, multiple studies that
when you communicate

47:34.518 --> 47:39.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from behind a screen, you're
more likely to
say things that you wouldn't
face to face.

47:39.090 --> 47:43.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're more likely to become
aggressive and
even, some studies say,
unethical.

47:43.461 --> 47:48.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, think about that. Like, we
have children
now growing up on phones,
learning to communicate

47:48.165 --> 47:55.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with each other and be people
from behind
a screen in an environment in
which it's OK

47:55.573 --> 47:58.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do stuff that you wouldn't do
if you were
with the person.

47:58.609 --> 48:03.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's really something
that I think
parents really need to think
about when they

48:03.180 --> 48:05.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think about how they're kids are
growing up
now.

48:05.149 --> 48:07.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You have a
15-year-old daughter.

48:07.151 --> 48:11.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How did these conversations go?
She obviously
was living with you at the time
you were working

48:11.622 --> 48:14.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on all this research. You go on
all these
trips. You talk to all these
girls. You come

48:14.425 --> 48:16.193 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back, and then what?

48:16.227 --> 48:20.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY JO SALES: We talk about it
all the time,
like, on a daily basis, because
to talk to

48:20.464 --> 48:24.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her about what is going on in
her life is
to talk to her about what is
going on, on

48:24.034 --> 48:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
social media, because that's
part of what
teenage life is about now.

48:27.738 --> 48:31.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I just try and have it be an
ongoing conversation
as if I were asking her about
what happened

48:31.909 --> 48:37.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in school today, you know, and
just kind of
find out what's going on with
your friends.

48:37.114 --> 48:40.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And sometimes really dramatic
things come
up, and I think a lot of parents
have seen

48:40.885 --> 48:42.586 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

48:42.620 --> 48:44.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What surprised
me -- and
I'm wondering what surprised you
during the

48:44.388 --> 48:47.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporting of this? But there
were -- you had
stories about women -- or young
girls that

48:47.258 --> 48:50.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were getting plastic surgery so
they could
look better in selfies.

48:50.461 --> 48:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when you went across all
these different
young women, what shocked you?

48:55.699 --> 49:03.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY JO SALES: The way that
comments on pictures
were so very sexualized, like,
almost like

49:03.474 --> 49:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
catcalling, which if this
happened in the
street, we would say, well,
that's really

49:07.511 --> 49:09.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
insulting.

49:09.246 --> 49:11.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But on social media, the culture
of social
media is such that you're
supposed to say,

49:11.649 --> 49:17.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oh, thank you, an emoji with
heart eyes, like,
you said I'm hot. And I'm just
really -- I'm

49:17.922 --> 49:23.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really concerned as a parent and
as a woman
about what this is doing to a
generation of

49:23.794 --> 49:25.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
girls.

49:25.496 --> 49:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, the book, it opens
with a girl
being asked to send nudes. A boy
that she

49:29.733 --> 49:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't know very well says to
her, really
demands of her really, send
nudes. She's not

49:35.973 --> 49:41.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- he's not her boyfriend. And
so, you know,
all kinds of thoughts start to
go through

49:41.312 --> 49:45.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her head. Like, wow, should I be
flattered?
Should I be outraged? Should I
be insulted?

49:45.716 --> 49:49.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this -- should I do it?
Should I not do
it? Well, if I did it, what
would it look

49:49.053 --> 49:50.888 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
like?

49:50.921 --> 49:54.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these are new kinds of
things for anybody
to have to think about,
especially 13-year-old

49:54.692 --> 49:56.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
girls.

49:56.560 --> 49:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, the
book is called
"American Girls: Social Media
and the Secret

49:58.362 --> 50:00.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online: A couple
of weeks ago, we introduced you
to the bubble

50:18.849 --> 50:23.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
quiz, a series of questions by
author Charles
Murray that attempts to reveal
how connected

50:23.654 --> 50:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are with the culture of
Middle America
and to what degree we live in a
bubble.

50:28.926 --> 50:33.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's written a follow-up that
uses data from
the answers. See what he found.
And you can

50:33.464 --> 50:36.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still take the quiz yourself.
You can find
it on our home page.

50:36.767 --> 50:43.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a weekly poem, a young
gay Chinese-American
poem on identity and expression.
You can listen

50:43.641 --> 50:45.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

On "Independent Lens" tonight:
the struggle
a North Dakota hamlet faced when
a white supremacist

50:56.520 --> 51:02.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
moved to town. "Welcome to
Leith" details
the story of Craig Cobb, who in
2012 bought

51:02.459 --> 51:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
property and sold it to fellow
white supremacists,
sparking tension as locals
resisted his attempt

51:08.899 --> 51:12.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to form a majority and take over
the local
government.

51:12.569 --> 51:22.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: OK, thank you all for
coming. We're going
to get about 20 voters here, and
we will be

51:22.613 --> 51:30.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: OK, thank you all for
coming. We're going
to get about 20 voters here, and
we will be

51:30.988 --> 51:37.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in charge of the civic
government of Leith.
In the interim, I wanted to
thank...

51:37.561 --> 51:40.998 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in charge of the civic
government of Leith.
In the interim, I wanted to
thank...

(SHOUTING)

51:59.984 --> 52:01.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: You know, it's really
funny, because
millions of whites have been
driven out of

52:01.618 --> 52:03.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their neighborhoods and cities
by violence.
And, here, we just have
democracy.

52:03.954 --> 52:07.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: You represent a dying
cause.

52:07.624 --> 52:17.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PROTESTER: So, North Dakota, we
