JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.405 --> 00:06.373 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.406 --> 00:07.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:07.407 --> 00:09.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:09.276 --> 00:11.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES:
We can choose to press forward
with a better

00:11.378 --> 00:19.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
model of cooperation and
integration, or we
can retreat into a world sharply
divided.

00:19.119 --> 00:24.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Obama
gives his final
speech at the U.N. General
Assembly, facing

00:24.391 --> 00:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a historic refugee crisis and
struggling cease-fire
in Syria.

00:29.529 --> 00:35.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: The CEO
of Wells Fargo apologizes for
millions of

00:35.402 --> 00:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fraudulent accounts, but says
the practice
wasn't a scheme.

00:39.006 --> 00:44.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN STUMPF, CEO, Wells Fargo &amp;
Company: We
never directed nor wanted our
team members

00:44.077 --> 00:48.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to provide products and services
to customers
that they didn't want.

00:48.515 --> 00:53.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And exploring the
presidential
candidates' plans on education.

00:53.787 --> 00:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We continue our series looking
at the issues
shaping the election.

00:57.557 --> 01:05.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:05.365 --> 01:08.201 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.235 --> 01:17.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For the president
today, a
moment on the world stage at the
United Nations

01:17.878 --> 01:23.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one last time, his message no
less than an
urgent plea to make a better
world.

01:23.817 --> 01:28.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
At this moment, we all face a
choice.

01:28.088 --> 01:33.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was his final
address to
the U.N. General Assembly, and
President Obama

01:33.460 --> 01:35.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
used it to issue a challenge.

01:35.662 --> 01:41.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: We can choose to
press forward
with a better model of
cooperation and integration,

01:41.335 --> 01:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or we can retreat into a world
sharply divided
and ultimately in conflict along
age-old lines

01:49.276 --> 01:51.979 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of nation and tribe and race and
religion.

01:52.012 --> 01:58.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
spoke of a growing
contest between authoritarian
rule and liberalism,

01:58.151 --> 02:03.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and of people losing faith in
the face of
terrorism and the refugee
crises.

02:03.223 --> 02:07.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: Given the
difficulty in forging
true democracy in the face of
these pressures,

02:07.894 --> 02:14.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's no surprise that some argue
the future
favors the strong man, a
top-down model, rather

02:14.868 --> 02:17.604 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
than strong democratic
institutions.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I believe this thinking is
wrong.

02:20.140 --> 02:24.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe the road of true
democracy remains
the better path.

02:24.511 --> 02:30.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Obama
appealed to the world
to do more for the millions
fleeing war-torn

02:30.417 --> 02:32.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
countries.

02:32.352 --> 02:36.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he warned against the
politics of Donald
Trump, without mentioning the
Republican nominee

02:36.189 --> 02:37.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
by name.

02:37.991 --> 02:42.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: The world is too
small for us
to simply be able to build a
wall and prevent

02:42.262 --> 02:44.231 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it from affecting our own
societies.

02:44.264 --> 02:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: The prime minister of the
United Kingdom.

02:46.833 --> 02:51.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Newly named
British Prime Minister
Theresa May, making her first
address at the

02:51.872 --> 02:57.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.N. after her country's vote to
leave the
European Union, said Brexit was
not a signal

02:57.911 --> 03:00.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that Britain was retreating from
its global
responsibilities.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: They
didn't vote to turn inward or
walk away from

03:04.551 --> 03:07.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any of our partners in the
world.

03:07.287 --> 03:12.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Faced with challenges like
migration, they
demanded a politics that is more
in touch

03:12.192 --> 03:17.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with their concerns and bold
action to address
them.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But that action must be more
global, not less.

03:20.067 --> 03:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But for many
leaders, Syria
topped the agenda.

03:24.004 --> 03:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama aimed strong
criticism at
the Syrians' main ally, Russia,
for its aggressive

03:30.010 --> 03:31.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
moves there and in Ukraine.

03:31.878 --> 03:38.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: In a world that
left the age
of empire behind, we see Russia
attempting

03:38.685 --> 03:41.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to recover lost glory through
force.

03:41.421 --> 03:47.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may fuel nationalist fervor
for a time,
but, over time, it's also going
to diminish

03:47.060 --> 03:49.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its stature and make its borders
less secure.

03:49.930 --> 03:56.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.N.
Secretary-General Ban
Ki-Moon also forcefully
denounced the Syrian

03:56.870 --> 04:01.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
regime, and its main backer, in
his last address
to the General Assembly.

04:01.374 --> 04:04.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BAN KI-MOON, United Nations
Secretary-General:
There is no military solution.

04:04.544 --> 04:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many groups have killed many
innocents, none
more so than the government of
Syria, which

04:12.052 --> 04:18.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
continues to bomb neighborhoods
and systematically
torture thousands of detainees.

04:18.058 --> 04:23.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Powerful patrons also have blood
on their
hands.

04:23.663 --> 04:29.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: French President
Francois Hollande
added his own demand to stop the
killing in

04:29.903 --> 04:31.705 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

04:31.738 --> 04:35.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): The Syrian tragedy
will be seen

04:35.308 --> 04:40.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by history as a disgrace for the
international
community if we do not end it
quickly.

04:41.014 --> 04:42.949 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thousands of children have died
in bombings.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Whole populations are starving.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Humanitarian convoys are being
attacked.

04:47.387 --> 04:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Chemical weapons are being used.

04:49.356 --> 04:54.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turkey's
President Recep Tayyip
Erdogan joined those who called
for a solution

04:54.928 --> 05:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Syria, but his main focus was
an exiled
cleric in the U.S., Fethullah
Gulen, whom

05:02.102 --> 05:06.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Erdogan and his government
accuse of fomenting
the failed July coup.

05:06.439 --> 05:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RECEP TAYYIP ERDOGAN, Turkish
President (through
translator): I am calling, from
this podium,

05:12.879 --> 05:17.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to all of our friends to swiftly
take the
necessary measures against the
Gulenist terrorist

05:17.584 --> 05:21.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
organization for their own
safety and the
future of their nations.

05:21.488 --> 05:25.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The General
Assembly continues
through next Monday.

05:25.358 --> 05:31.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the day's other
news: New details
emerged on Ahmad Khan Rahami,
the suspect

05:31.598 --> 05:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the New York and New Jersey
bombings.

05:33.833 --> 05:40.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reported the
FBI briefly
investigated Rahami in 2014,
after he allegedly

05:40.473 --> 05:42.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
stabbed his brother.

05:42.342 --> 05:46.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, his father told
police that Rahami
was a -- quote -- "terrorist,"
but he later

05:46.780 --> 05:49.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recanted, and an investigation
found nothing.

05:49.382 --> 05:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Authorities in
France have
made eight new arrests in a
deadly truck attack

05:54.154 --> 06:00.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in July; 86 people were killed
when a driver
plowed through crowds of
revelers in the Mediterranean

06:00.760 --> 06:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city of Nice on Bastille Day,
the French national
holiday.

06:04.898 --> 06:07.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The attacker, a Tunisian, was
killed by police.

06:07.934 --> 06:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The suspects arrested on Monday
are French
and Tunisian.

06:11.238 --> 06:17.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The United Nations
has suspended
all aid deliveries to Syria
after an attack

06:17.110 --> 06:20.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on a Red Crescent convoy killed
at least 20
people.

06:20.614 --> 06:25.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened near the northern
city of Aleppo,
just hours after a cease-fire
expired.

06:26.019 --> 06:30.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Footage today showed the charred
wreckage
of trucks lining the streets,
and supplies,

06:30.523 --> 06:33.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some marked with the U.N. logo,
strewn about.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS LAERKE, U.N. Office for the
Coordination
of Humanitarian Affairs: This is
a very, very

06:35.428 --> 06:41.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dark day for humanitarians in
Syria, and I
will say across the world,
because I think

06:41.968 --> 06:52.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's been a moment of shock
and, frankly,
disgust by this attack.

06:52.879 --> 06:58.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Russia denied claims
that its
warplanes attacked the convoy.

06:58.518 --> 07:03.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it did say there is drone
footage showing
heavily armed militants
traveling with the

07:03.390 --> 07:05.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
aid trucks.

07:05.325 --> 07:09.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A fire roared
through a migrant
camp on the Greek island of
Lesbos overnight.

07:09.963 --> 07:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thousands fled and no one was
injured, but
60 percent of the camp was
destroyed.

07:14.401 --> 07:18.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The fire broke out late Monday
and was extinguished
by midday today.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The camp houses several thousand
migrants.

07:22.008 --> 07:25.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police say the fire started
after clashes
between different ethnic groups.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, Hillary
Clinton took a day off the trail
to study

07:29.549 --> 07:34.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
up for next week's first
presidential debate,
while Donald Trump went back to
school.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

07:36.990 --> 07:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Donald Trump went to
college today,
courting the millennial vote.

07:42.028 --> 07:47.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At High Point University in
North Carolina,
he appeared to lecture Hillary
Clinton about

07:47.100 --> 07:48.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fighting terrorism.

07:48.902 --> 07:51.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Her claim that my opposition to
radical Islamic

07:52.005 --> 07:54.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
terrorism is a recruiting tool.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.709 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But why?

07:55.742 --> 07:58.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Because I'm tough, it's a
recruiting tool?

07:58.445 --> 08:02.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It demonstrates a level of
ignorance about
the terror threat.

08:02.182 --> 08:07.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It came amid more
questions about
the charitable Trump Foundation.

08:07.053 --> 08:12.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Washington Post reported it
paid more
than $250,000 to settle lawsuits
involving

08:12.759 --> 08:14.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his businesses.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.097 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Trump campaign didn't
respond.

08:17.130 --> 08:23.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And social media became a
battleground over
Donald Trump Jr.'s tweet
likening Syrian refugees

08:23.370 --> 08:25.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to a tainted bowl of Skittles.

08:25.872 --> 08:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A Clinton campaign spokesman
called it disgusting,
and a former Obama speechwriter
tweeted a

08:31.678 --> 08:37.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picture that had earlier gone
viral, saying,
this Syrian boy is "one of the
millions of

08:37.550 --> 08:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children you compared to a
poisoned Skittle."

08:41.121 --> 08:45.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Clinton made no public
appearances today,
but there was word she may get
the vote of

08:45.492 --> 08:48.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a former Republican president.

08:48.161 --> 08:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Politico reported that former
Maryland Republican
Lieutenant Governor Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend,

08:52.799 --> 08:58.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
daughter of the late Robert
Kennedy, posted
on Facebook that George H.W.
Bush had told

Today, a Bush spokesman said the
former president
is a private citizen and his
vote will be,

09:06.146 --> 09:07.847 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
too, private.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Relief is on the
way for five
Southern states after a gasoline
pipeline

09:16.089 --> 09:17.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leak in Alabama.

09:17.957 --> 09:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Colonial Pipeline said today
that it's completed
a bypass line, and it can
restart the flow

09:23.696 --> 09:25.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.701 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The leak has caused many gas
stations in the
region to shut down pumps.

09:28.735 --> 09:32.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And prices have jumped more than
20 cents
in some parts.

09:32.172 --> 09:37.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Twenty-one states
went to federal
court today to block a new
overtime pay rule.

09:37.210 --> 09:44.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It takes effect December 1 and
requires overtime
for salaried workers making less
than $47,500.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's double the current
threshold.

09:46.986 --> 09:50.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The states say it places a heavy
new burden
on state budgets.

09:50.657 --> 09:53.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a slow day on
Wall Street.

09:53.059 --> 09:58.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained nine
points to close near 18130.

09:58.665 --> 10:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose six, and the S&amp;P

a fraction.

10:03.470 --> 10:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

GWEN IFILL: The CEO of Wells
Fargo appeared
on Capitol Hill and faced a
barrage of questions

10:35.735 --> 10:41.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the bank's conduct under
his leadership,
and why employees opened nearly
two million

10:41.341 --> 10:43.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
phony accounts.

10:43.276 --> 10:48.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regulators say employees, under
pressure to
meet sales goals, had secretly
created unauthorized

10:48.248 --> 10:54.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bank and credit card accounts
for customers,
since 2011, without their
knowledge.

10:54.087 --> 10:58.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, bank chairman John Stumpf
apologized
before the Senate Banking
Committee.

10:59.025 --> 11:04.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN STUMPF, CEO, Wells Fargo &amp;
Company: I
am deeply sorry that we failed
to fulfill

11:04.163 --> 11:10.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on our responsibility to our
customers, to
our team members and to the
American public.

11:10.870 --> 11:17.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We never directed, nor wanted
our team members
to provide products and services
to customers

11:17.577 --> 11:20.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that they didn't want.

11:20.046 --> 11:25.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That is not good for our
customers, and that
is not good for our business.

11:25.785 --> 11:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is against everything we
stand for as a
company.

11:28.788 --> 11:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: More than 5,000
workers, mostly
lower-level, have been fired.

11:33.459 --> 11:38.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But senators on both sides of
the aisle said
it was Stumpf who should be
paying the price.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth
Warren:

11:40.133 --> 11:41.467 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.902 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WARREN (D),
Massachusetts: So, you
haven't resigned.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.838 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You haven't returned a single
nickel of your
personal earnings.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You haven't fired a single
senior executive.

11:48.808 --> 11:55.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Instead, evidently, your
definition of accountable
is to push the blame to your
low-level employees

11:55.715 --> 12:00.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who don't have the money for a
fancy P.R.
firm to defend themselves.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's gutless leadership.

12:03.056 --> 12:09.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You squeezed your employees to
the breaking
point, so they would cheat
customers and you

12:09.395 --> 12:15.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could drive up the value of your
stock and
put hundreds of millions of
dollars in your

12:15.668 --> 12:17.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own pocket.

12:17.203 --> 12:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And when it all blew up, you
kept your job.

12:20.673 --> 12:23.142 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You kept your
multimillion-dollar bonuses.

12:23.176 --> 12:27.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We turn now to
Michael Corkery,
who's been reporting on the
story for The

12:27.146 --> 12:28.982 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York Times.

12:29.015 --> 12:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Michael, you were in the room
today, in the
hearing chamber today, and you
saw the outrage

12:32.452 --> 12:36.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that was expressed by
Republicans and Democrats,
not just Elizabeth Warren, but
also David

12:36.956 --> 12:37.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Vitter.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Outrage is easy.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the fix that -- the fix
they're asking
for?

12:40.893 --> 12:43.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL CORKERY, The New York
Times: Well,
I think they want more
accountability.

12:44.030 --> 12:50.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I mean, this fraud was
extraordinary for how
widespread it was.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, it affected thousands of
customers.

12:53.673 --> 12:58.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're talking upwards of two
million potentially
fake -- they created -- accounts
by Wells

12:58.678 --> 13:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fargo employees; 5,300 bank
workers, mostly
low-level, low-paid bank workers
have been

13:05.318 --> 13:10.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fired, but I think what the
committee was
focused on and what Elizabeth
Warren in particular

13:10.089 --> 13:14.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was taking up the charge for was
that none
of the senior executives seem to
have been

13:14.460 --> 13:17.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
affected, either losing their
jobs or taking
back some of their compensation.

13:17.864 --> 13:21.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How long have senior
executives
known about this problem?

13:21.901 --> 13:27.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL CORKERY: Well, John
Stumpf said he
knew -- he first knew about it
in 2013, though

13:27.240 --> 13:30.643 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the problems may have gone back
to 2011.

13:30.677 --> 13:37.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even 2013, this problem has
been going
on for three years in some form
or another.

13:37.583 --> 13:41.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those employees that have been
fired have
been fired over a period of five
years.

13:41.654 --> 13:46.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, even up to this
year, people
were being fired at the bank for
this behavior,

13:46.426 --> 13:48.161 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
low-level workers.

13:48.194 --> 13:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think, again, the committee
was focused
on, why didn't you do more
sooner to take

13:53.633 --> 13:55.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care of this problem and get rid
of it?

13:55.435 --> 13:58.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN FILL: Now, some employees
said that this
problem propped up because of a
culture of

13:58.304 --> 14:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
competition at Wells Fargo.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are they talking about?

14:01.674 --> 14:03.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL CORKERY: Wells is a very
hard-driving
bank.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's very successful, very
profitable.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Stock has been on a tear.

14:08.581 --> 14:13.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they say is that employees
were under
these -- enormous pressure to
meet these sales

14:13.319 --> 14:15.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goals, to open as many new
accounts as they
can.

14:15.354 --> 14:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, John Stumpf wanted all
bank customers
-- one of his goals was to have
every bank

14:20.727 --> 14:23.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
customer have eight accounts,
eight products
with Wells Fargo.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's an enormous amount of
products.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if you think, well, you
have got a
loan, or a checking account, a
savings account.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so these employees thought
they were unrealistic.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said they were totally
unrealistic.

14:33.706 --> 14:39.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in order the meet them, not
just to gain
big bonuses, but just to keep
their jobs,

14:39.345 --> 14:41.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they felt compelled to meet
these.

14:41.180 --> 14:44.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in order to do that, many of
these former
employees said they needed to
bend the rules,

14:44.584 --> 14:46.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they need to fake them.

14:46.452 --> 14:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is there a dollar
number you can
put on a number of accounts, the
dollar impact

14:51.057 --> 14:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on actual account holders who
found out that
they held a lot more accounts in
their name

14:54.660 --> 14:56.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than they realized?

14:56.596 --> 15:01.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL CORKERY: Right now,
regulators, particularly
the CFPB, started by Elizabeth
Warren, has

15:01.968 --> 15:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
put the number at about $2
million.

15:05.271 --> 15:09.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not a big number, when you
consider the
extent of the fraud.

15:09.976 --> 15:15.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what's kind of weird
here, is that,
yes, these fees meant things to
people.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These were overdraft fees.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These were late fees on credit
cards they
didn't know they had.

15:20.753 --> 15:25.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, again, it was happening in
ways where
sometimes a bank employee would
open up an

15:25.858 --> 15:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
account for someone, the person
didn't know
it, and then two days later they
would close

15:31.164 --> 15:32.431 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they would just do it just
to get credit
for the sale.

15:34.934 --> 15:42.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it suggests that this
selling culture
was so broken, that it wasn't
even making

15:42.542 --> 15:43.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bank money.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just meeting goals for
the sake of
meeting goals.

15:46.145 --> 15:49.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But some of the
sympathy in the
hearing today seemed to be for
employees who

15:49.715 --> 15:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were fired, who they think were
treated as
scapegoats?

15:52.852 --> 15:54.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL CORKERY: Yes.

15:54.654 --> 16:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if -- they kept coming
back to this
point over and over, again,
5,000 employees.

16:01.027 --> 16:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these are people mostly who
make about
$12 an hour.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those are the ones who have been
fired.

16:07.533 --> 16:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this point, other than the
few, as John
Stumpf said quite vaguely,
managers and managers

16:12.505 --> 16:18.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of managers, nobody in the C
suite, no big,
top executive has lost their
job.

16:18.477 --> 16:24.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that has the optics
at least of
the little guy gets squeezed and
gets hurt

16:24.917 --> 16:29.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and takes the fall, and the big
CEOs get off.

16:29.922 --> 16:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Michael Corkery of
The New York

of abuse at the Marine Corps
training facility

16:52.578 --> 16:54.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at Parris Island, South
Carolina.

16:54.947 --> 16:59.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An internal investigation that
began after
the death of a young recruit
earlier this

16:59.819 --> 17:06.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year has uncovered a larger

and abuse at the legendary

17:06.058 --> 17:10.463 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s William

been reporting at Parris Island,
joins me

17:10.496 --> 17:11.898 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
now for more.

17:11.931 --> 17:14.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, William, tell us about this
investigation
that's been under way.

17:15.001 --> 17:19.272 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As you
mentioned, this whole
investigation began when this
20-year-old

17:19.305 --> 17:21.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marine recruit, he was a man
named Raheel

17:21.741 --> 17:23.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was from Michigan.

17:23.476 --> 17:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He jumped off a third-floor
balcony and fell
to his death.

17:27.747 --> 17:33.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The investigation that went into
that death
revealed that he had been
physically abused

17:33.386 --> 17:35.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by one of his drill instructors.

17:35.221 --> 17:39.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had had -- the morning that
he died, he
went out and claimed that he had
a sore throat

17:39.225 --> 17:42.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and asked for a medical -- to be
sent to the
doctor.

17:42.261 --> 17:46.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And his drill instructor
apparently didn't
believe him and made him run
laps up and down

17:46.732 --> 17:48.668 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the barracks when they were
sleeping.

17:48.701 --> 17:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He then apparently wasn't
responding to his
drill instructor appropriately,
and so he

17:52.305 --> 17:53.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was choked.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He fell to the ground.

17:55.174 --> 17:58.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then his drill instructor
apparently got
over him and slapped him in the
face at least

17:58.945 --> 18:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
once, perhaps three times, and
which he jumped
up at that point, ran out the
back door and

18:05.017 --> 18:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
leapt off the balcony and fell
to his death.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, the Marines have ruled this
a suicide.

18:09.755 --> 18:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His family believes he was
targeted specifically
and was abused intentionally.

18:14.126 --> 18:18.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Apparently, this drill
instructor involved
in this had referred to this
young man as

18:18.130 --> 18:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a terrorist before.

18:20.499 --> 18:25.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The bigger thing that this
investigation has
revealed is that this particular
drill instructor

18:25.771 --> 18:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had been investigated prior to
this for another
instance of abuse on another
Muslim recruit

18:31.110 --> 18:36.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a year before, where he had
apparently called
this young man a terrorist also,
had put him

18:36.215 --> 18:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into a large commercial dryer,
and run that
dryer and burned the young
recruit.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A clothes dryer?

18:42.421 --> 18:44.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A clothes
dryer, huge -- one
of these large industrial
dryers.

18:44.323 --> 18:50.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the family's argument --
and the Marines
say, why was this man reassigned
into this

18:50.129 --> 18:51.530 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case?

18:51.564 --> 18:53.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this investigation has
just continued
to unfold from there.

18:53.532 --> 18:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, you were
just at Parris
Island reporting on another
story just in

18:57.803 --> 18:59.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the last few weeks.

18:59.238 --> 19:02.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did you see any evidence of this
kind of treatment
of these recruits?

19:02.508 --> 19:04.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: No, we saw
nothing of the
kind.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Producer Dan Sagalyn and I were
down there.

19:06.412 --> 19:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We were reporting a story about
how women
are now entering more combat
roles in the

19:11.083 --> 19:12.051 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Marine Corps.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we were following some
female recruits.

19:13.452 --> 19:16.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we saw no evidence of
anything like this.

19:16.255 --> 19:22.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw what a lot of civilians
would look
at as almost stereotypical
Marine drill sergeant

19:22.428 --> 19:24.797 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behavior.

19:24.830 --> 19:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's rough and tough stuff,
drill sergeants
yelling at young recruits,
making them run

19:30.069 --> 19:34.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around, sometimes running to the
point of
exhaustion, a lot of chaos, a
lot of screaming.

19:34.940 --> 19:39.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's what the Marine Corps
thinks of
as its honored tradition of
turning civilian

19:39.111 --> 19:40.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into Corps.

19:40.946 --> 19:45.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we saw no evidence of abuse
whatsoever,
nothing that's alleged in this
investigation.

19:45.618 --> 19:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You were telling
me that there
are still more allegations out
there about

19:52.158 --> 19:54.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the way recruits have been
treated by these
drill instructors.

19:54.693 --> 19:56.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That's right.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This investigation, which hasn't
been released
to the public -- we went to the
Pentagon yesterday

19:58.697 --> 20:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to read it for a few hours.

20:01.167 --> 20:06.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This investigation revealed at
least a dozen
other drill instructors were
involved in what

20:06.172 --> 20:12.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Marine Corps calls a
fostering of a culture
of abuse, so physically hitting
recruits,

20:12.778 --> 20:18.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
encouraging other recruits to
hit other recruits,
choking of recruits, a real lack
of oversight

20:18.818 --> 20:20.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by officers looking into this.

20:20.619 --> 20:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has blossomed into a much
larger investigation
in the Corps.

20:23.856 --> 20:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you mentioned
officers.

20:26.158 --> 20:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who is being held accountable
for this at
this point?

20:29.161 --> 20:32.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Well, right
now, no one
has been criminally charged with
any wrongdoing

20:32.431 --> 20:33.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
whatsoever.

20:33.432 --> 20:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Several people have been fired
or dismissed.

20:34.934 --> 20:38.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have let go a colonel, a
lieutenant colonel
and a sergeant major.

20:38.404 --> 20:42.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, the Marine Corps
is still
trying to decide who should be
prosecuted,

20:42.441 --> 20:46.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who might face a court-martial,
what sort
of disciplinary action.

20:46.112 --> 20:50.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are at least 20
Marines who are
subject to possible further
sanction for their

20:50.282 --> 20:52.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
actions in these cases.

20:52.084 --> 20:55.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You and I were
also discussing
the fact that, over years, there
have been

20:55.855 --> 21:00.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allegations made about what's
been going on
at Parris Island.

21:00.826 --> 21:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Have they changed their
techniques, the M.O.,
the way they operate in general
over time?

21:07.199 --> 21:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Marine
Corps would say,
yes, that they have been very
diligent about

21:11.237 --> 21:13.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

21:13.038 --> 21:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a notorious incident
back in the
'50s where a drill instructor
led a group

21:15.474 --> 21:19.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of recruits into a very
dangerous circumstance
and several died.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reforms were made after that.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were also a series of
reforms and training
made after the end of the
Vietnam era, when

21:24.450 --> 21:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we moved from a draft to a more
volunteer
army.

21:28.087 --> 21:33.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With regards to these particular
allegations,
the biggest concern that we
heard in talking

21:33.225 --> 21:39.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to current Marines and former
Marines is that
the leadership failed in their
job here, that

21:39.965 --> 21:45.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this type of abuse shouldn't
have been allowed
to fester and blossom the way it
did.

21:45.337 --> 21:49.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's really the most
damning part of
the investigation, is that the
supervisory

21:49.141 --> 21:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officers who should have been
observing this
activity really were absent and
negligent

21:54.813 --> 21:55.814 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of their duties.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is such a
disturbing story.

21:57.850 --> 22:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know the reporting on it
continues,
as well as the investigation.

22:01.554 --> 22:04.356 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham, thank you.

22:04.390 --> 22:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Thank you.

22:12.398 --> 22:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There are new calls
for a federal
investigation into the police
shooting of

22:20.673 --> 22:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an unarmed black man in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, raising
questions yet again about the
relationship

22:26.679 --> 22:29.982 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between law enforcement and
citizens of color.

22:30.015 --> 22:34.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Forty-year-old Terence Crutcher
was killed
on Friday when local officers
responded to

22:34.753 --> 22:38.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a call of a stalled vehicle in
the middle
of the road.

22:38.557 --> 22:43.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police video subsequently showed
Crutcher,
hands in the air, walking away
from the officers

22:43.862 --> 22:46.198 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
before police fired.

22:46.232 --> 22:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Here is some of that video.

22:47.833 --> 22:52.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: That looks like a bad dude,
too.

22:52.705 --> 22:57.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I think he may have just
been Tasered.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Shots fired!

22:58.377 --> 23:00.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: We have shots fired.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.648 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have one suspect down.

23:02.681 --> 23:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: An attorney for the
officer said
she believed Crutcher was armed
and didn't

23:07.620 --> 23:09.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
heed instruction.

23:09.455 --> 23:14.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But attorneys for the family say
the video
proves otherwise, and they
believe the officer

23:14.059 --> 23:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who shot him, Betty Jo Shelby,
should be charged
with murder.

23:17.896 --> 23:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She is on paid administrative
leave.

23:20.165 --> 23:25.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His twin sister, Tiffany, noted
that officers
watching at a distance from a
helicopter could

23:25.804 --> 23:29.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be heard on tape referring to
her brother
as a "bad dude."

23:29.842 --> 23:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIFFANY CRUTCHER, Sister of
Terence Crutcher:
That big, bad dude was my twin
brother.

23:35.281 --> 23:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That big, bad dude was a father.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That big, bad dude was a son.

23:44.990 --> 23:52.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That big, bad dude was enrolled
at Tulsa Community
College, just wanting to make us
proud.

23:52.298 --> 23:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For the latest on
the investigation
and the mood in the city of
Tulsa, I am joined

23:57.870 --> 24:01.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by Ginnie Graham, columnist for
the Tulsa
World Newspaper.

24:01.106 --> 24:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ginnie Graham, The Washington
Post keeps a
database now in which they say,
in the past

24:06.679 --> 24:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
year, 696 people, 172 of them
black men, have
been fatally shot by police.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Tulsa, how did this come
about?

24:16.522 --> 24:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GINNIE GRAHAM, Tulsa World: This
particular
incident, some of that is
unfolding.

24:21.393 --> 24:26.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that he had a stalled
car and that
the officer, Betty Shelby, was
responding

24:26.665 --> 24:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to a different call and came
upon him.

24:29.902 --> 24:35.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, there is some
missing video
-- or not missing video -- there
was no video

24:35.074 --> 24:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
leading up to what we now see.

24:38.677 --> 24:41.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's pretty clear that he
had his hands
up.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can see other officers
responded.

24:44.283 --> 24:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then you had the aerial view.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And he was shot.

24:48.087 --> 24:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was Tasered and then shot.

24:50.022 --> 24:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so people are coming to
their own conclusions
watching the video, and other
people have

24:54.727 --> 25:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lingering questions about what
led up to that,
how he responded, and then how
the officers

25:00.866 --> 25:04.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
responded directly after that,
because he
was left on the street.

25:04.636 --> 25:05.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

25:05.637 --> 25:07.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was left on the street for
some time.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Was there -- is there a
distinction or a dispute
between what the police account
of the incident

25:10.743 --> 25:12.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is and what others are saying?

25:12.745 --> 25:15.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GINNIE GRAHAM: Not so much right
now.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The police aren't saying too
much.

25:17.883 --> 25:20.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are launching their own
investigation.

25:21.019 --> 25:25.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will be returning those
results over
to the district attorney, who
will decide

25:25.224 --> 25:26.358 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on a charge.

25:26.392 --> 25:29.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is also another
investigation going
on.

25:29.161 --> 25:35.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police chief had called the
Justice Department
early on, and the U.S. attorney
is looking

25:35.267 --> 25:40.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into this as an independent and
parallel investigation
to see if there are any federal
civil rights

25:40.272 --> 25:41.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
violations that occurred.

25:41.607 --> 25:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he will be releasing
those results
at the same time.

25:45.411 --> 25:50.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We got to see this
video relatively
quickly, more quickly than we
often see in

25:50.449 --> 25:52.217 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these cases.

25:52.251 --> 25:56.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think what happened in
Tulsa with the
police rapid response, or
relatively rapid

25:56.088 --> 25:59.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
response, is the result of what
we have seen
happen in other cities and other
places?

25:59.825 --> 26:02.728 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GINNIE GRAHAM: It could be.

26:02.761 --> 26:07.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are also efforts
throughout the year
to talk about race in Tulsa.

26:07.199 --> 26:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had a dubious history of
dealing with
race issues.

26:12.738 --> 26:18.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so for the last decade or
two decades,
there have been various groups
to try to forge

26:18.677 --> 26:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationships in between these
tense times.

26:22.114 --> 26:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this is going to be a
challenge for
the city's leaders on how they
move forward.

26:26.718 --> 26:31.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think the other cities and
how they
have dealt with that are
certainly a caution.

26:31.623 --> 26:36.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's also a call for
transparency to
get the information out quickly,
put it out

26:36.995 --> 26:43.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the public, and then we can
make decisions
from there on what -- if they
acted correctly.

26:43.669 --> 26:48.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: When you talk about
Tulsa's dubious
history, you're referring not
only to instances

26:48.574 --> 26:53.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
where there have been
police-involved shootings,
but going all the way back to
1921, right?

26:53.378 --> 26:55.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GINNIE GRAHAM: Exactly.

26:55.147 --> 27:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had an infamous 1921 race
riot, and it
burned a section of the city to
the ground.

27:01.153 --> 27:04.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was the part of the city
referred to
as Black Wall Street.

27:04.556 --> 27:09.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And for decades, that wound was
left to fester.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That part of town was never
rebuilt.

27:11.230 --> 27:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The families were never given
any sort of
help to rebuild.

27:15.634 --> 27:20.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was only in the 1990s
that a commission
was established to investigate
what happened

27:20.639 --> 27:22.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during that time.

27:22.574 --> 27:28.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And since then, there is the
John Hope Reconciliation
Center that holds a national
forum on race.

27:28.080 --> 27:34.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other groups in the
city that hold
seminars, symposiums, dialogues
and talks.

27:35.020 --> 27:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But all of that is going to be
tested right
now, as I said, because, right
now, people

27:40.893 --> 27:41.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are upset.

27:41.894 --> 27:42.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're grieving.

27:42.895 --> 27:44.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're angry.

27:44.730 --> 27:47.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so how the city responds,
whether they're
going to be straightforward,
whether they're

27:47.833 --> 27:53.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to live up to their
promises, that's
what's going to determine the
relationships

27:53.939 --> 27:55.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from here on out.

27:55.807 --> 28:03.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, hopefully, our city has
learned some lessons
on how to heal, how to deal with
this in a

28:03.081 --> 28:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
peaceful, yet justful manner.

28:05.784 --> 28:13.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, and it should
be said that,
right up until now, we haven't
seen riots

28:13.125 --> 28:17.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or unrest or fires or looting,
have we?

28:17.629 --> 28:20.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GINNIE GRAHAM: Not in Tulsa.

28:20.165 --> 28:26.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we have had a couple
incidents before
where, last year, we had our
county deputy

28:26.939 --> 28:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sheriff, a reserve officer, shot
and killed
an unarmed black man as well.

28:32.244 --> 28:37.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And our district attorney filed
charges in
that with a secondary
manslaughter conviction.

28:37.783 --> 28:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there is some history that
our city leaders
will do the right thing.

28:43.722 --> 28:49.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there have been calls from
the family
and from other leaders to be
patient, but

28:49.127 --> 28:57.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet, you know, keep up the
oversight, because
protests are more than welcome.

28:57.502 --> 29:02.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our city -- our police chief
even said he
invites protesters.

29:02.407 --> 29:04.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They came into the press
conference.

29:04.209 --> 29:08.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hope is that they can remain
peaceful
and that we can sit down and
have this discussion

29:08.680 --> 29:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about, you know, how can we be
safe on our
streets and how can we build
trust that people

29:13.418 --> 29:17.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are living in North Tulsa
and all over
Tulsa feel safe with the police
that are on

29:17.990 --> 29:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the streets and find out what
happened and
to act swiftly.

29:21.660 --> 29:25.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ginnie Graham,
columnist for the
Tulsa World, thank you very
much.

29:25.430 --> 29:30.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GINNIE GRAHAM: Thank you.

29:30.202 --> 29:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

29:39.077 --> 29:44.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": Ken
Burns' newest
film about a couple who dared to
defy the

29:44.683 --> 29:50.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nazis; and the overlooked
challenges of first-generation
college students.

29:50.222 --> 29:55.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, our coverage of the
issues in
this presidential campaign
continues.

29:55.527 --> 29:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're taking the opportunity
to focus
on where they stand on
education, as part

29:59.665 --> 30:02.501 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of our weekly series Making the
Grade.

30:02.534 --> 30:06.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
gets us started
with this primer.

30:06.104 --> 30:09.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It is a wide
education gap.

30:10.008 --> 30:16.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidates disagree not just
on how to
fix schools, but also on what
the problems

30:16.248 --> 30:17.215 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
First, Donald Trump.

30:18.984 --> 30:20.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
That's why I'm proposing a plan
to provide

30:20.252 --> 30:23.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
school choice to every
disadvantaged student
in America.

30:23.622 --> 30:29.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Republican
wants a $12,000
voucher for every child living
in poverty.

30:29.127 --> 30:35.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: That means parents
will be able
to send their kids to the
desired public,

30:35.100 --> 30:38.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
private, or even religious
school of their
choice.

30:38.336 --> 30:47.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Here's Trump's
math; $12,000
times 11 million kids, that's
over $130 billion.

30:47.212 --> 30:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To pay for that, Trump would
kick in $20 billion
in federal funds, and he'd like
states to

30:52.551 --> 30:57.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
find the rest, over $100
billion.

30:57.122 --> 31:02.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Libertarian Gary Johnson has
long pushed for
vouchers, but he is to the right
of Trump

31:02.327 --> 31:03.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on something else.

31:03.962 --> 31:09.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would close the Department of
Education
and send savings back to the
states.

31:09.301 --> 31:14.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, on the other
hand, strongly
opposes vouchers, charging that
Trump's plan

31:14.172 --> 31:16.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would gut public school funding.

31:16.775 --> 31:22.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of her biggest changes would
be for even
younger kids, a universal
preschool plan that

31:22.347 --> 31:24.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was part of her campaign launch
last year.

31:24.716 --> 31:29.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Our country won't be competitive
or fair if

31:29.454 --> 31:34.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we don't help more families give
their kids
the best possible start in life.

31:34.726 --> 31:39.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another
contrast, the Common
Core education standards.

31:39.364 --> 31:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump regularly touts his full
opposition.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to
terminate Common
Core out of Washington.

31:45.871 --> 31:49.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're going to bring our
education local.

31:49.141 --> 31:54.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton doesn't
talk Common
Core much, but she does support
it.

31:54.379 --> 31:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, her marquee education
plan is about
a different rung.

31:58.116 --> 32:03.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We came
up with a
plan that makes public college
tuition-free

32:03.355 --> 32:06.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for working families and
debt-free for everyone.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

32:08.293 --> 32:13.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton's idea,
inspired
in part by former opponent
Bernie Sanders,

32:13.165 --> 32:15.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is threefold.

32:15.033 --> 32:21.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One, she'd make in-state
universities tuition-free
for families earning less than
$125,000.

32:21.306 --> 32:25.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two, community college would be
tuition-free
for everyone.

32:26.011 --> 32:29.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, three, she'd address those
who have to
pay now.

32:30.015 --> 32:36.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: If you
already have
debt, we will help you refinance
it and pay

32:36.254 --> 32:43.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it back as a percentage of your
income, so
you're never on the hook for
more than you

32:43.061 --> 32:44.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can afford.

32:44.062 --> 32:45.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

32:45.897 --> 32:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton would
raise taxes
on the wealthy to pay for her
college plans.

32:47.799 --> 32:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Green Party's Jill Stein
would go further
and erase all student debt with
a kind of

32:51.903 --> 32:53.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
government bailout.

32:53.805 --> 32:58.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In contrast, Trump has no
specific plans for
college costs, though, in a
Twitter video,

32:58.777 --> 33:02.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
he did criticize the
government's role in
student lending.

33:02.581 --> 33:08.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The candidates hit nearly
opposite education
issues, even as they fight for
the same student

33:08.153 --> 33:09.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and parent votes.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

33:11.990 --> 33:17.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now Jeffrey Brown
looks more deeply
into the differences between the
two major

33:17.495 --> 33:19.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nominees on education.

33:19.231 --> 33:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And for that, we
turn to two
journalists who cover this
closely.

33:24.035 --> 33:27.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrew Ujifusa is with our
partners at Education
Week.

33:27.372 --> 33:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scott Jaschik is the editor of
Inside Higher
Education.

33:30.909 --> 33:31.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Andrew, let me start with you.

33:33.745 --> 33:38.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's start with K through
12 and these
differences over vouchers and
school choices.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
School choice, dramatic
differences.

33:40.385 --> 33:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW UJIFUSA, Education Week:
Yes, very
dramatic differences.

33:42.921 --> 33:48.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recently, Donald Trump proposed
a $20 billion
federal school choice program,
which a lot

33:48.059 --> 33:50.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of conservatives like.

33:50.262 --> 33:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not entirely clear how that
would work
in many instances, but it does
have the backing

33:54.666 --> 33:56.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of many Republicans.

33:56.301 --> 33:58.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton very much opposed to it.

33:58.236 --> 34:04.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we should keep in mind
here that the
two national teachers unions,
which very closely

34:04.209 --> 34:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back Clinton and have for some
time, they
are very much opposed to
vouchers as well.

34:08.980 --> 34:12.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Because they're
historically
worried about its implications
for public

34:12.517 --> 34:13.485 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
education.

34:13.518 --> 34:14.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW UJIFUSA: Yes, that's
exactly right.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is it clear how
Donald Trump
would pay for this?

34:16.888 --> 34:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW UJIFUSA: No, he has not
made that clear.

34:19.557 --> 34:25.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has not said, for example,
where the money
would come from within the
federal government.

34:25.130 --> 34:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think he wants to raise
taxes to pay
for his school choice program.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That wouldn't go over well with
fellow Republicans.

34:31.069 --> 34:34.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a lot of the details about
that program
are still unclear.

34:34.306 --> 34:38.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And with Hillary
Clinton, she
has expressed in the past some
support for

34:38.843 --> 34:40.879 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
charter schools, right, but
where is she?

34:40.912 --> 34:42.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is she saying these days?

34:42.080 --> 34:43.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW UJIFUSA: That is a very
good question.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's hard to say.

34:45.517 --> 34:50.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, in the past, it's fair
to say she's
been more supportive of charter
schools.

34:50.755 --> 34:57.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But ever since she hit the 2016
campaign trail,
she has voiced more concerns
about charter

34:57.462 --> 35:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
schools, such as the type of
students they
enroll.

35:00.398 --> 35:04.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Again, that might reflect a lot
of the concerns
that teachers unions have about
charters.

35:04.636 --> 35:08.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then let me
stay with you
for the question of Common Core,
because there,

35:08.740 --> 35:12.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
again, you have Donald Trump,
who has referred
to it as a disaster.

35:12.711 --> 35:13.678 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he's pretty clear.

35:13.712 --> 35:14.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW UJIFUSA: Yes.

35:14.713 --> 35:15.747 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

35:15.780 --> 35:16.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Hillary Clinton,
measured support?

35:16.848 --> 35:18.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where would you put the two of
them right
now?

35:18.783 --> 35:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW UJIFUSA: I think she does
support the
standards.

35:21.753 --> 35:23.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She doesn't talk a lot about it.

35:23.989 --> 35:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think concerns with the Common
Core on the
Democratic side mostly have to
do with tests

35:29.227 --> 35:30.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are connected to the Common
Core.

35:30.929 --> 35:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The unions have a lot of
concerns about those
tests and how they're used.

35:35.467 --> 35:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump has made it very
clear he doesn't
like the Common Core.

35:39.104 --> 35:42.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That reflects in particular the
position of
the Republican base.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has not explained why he
thinks it's a
bad idea.

35:46.811 --> 35:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has said that he will get rid
of the Common
Core, but there's no real clear
avenue for

35:51.583 --> 35:53.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him to do that if he's elected.

35:53.385 --> 35:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Scott Jaschik,
where do you
see, when you're looking at K
through 12,

35:56.955 --> 36:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kind of school reform
movement that we
have watched over the many years
now?

36:01.393 --> 36:03.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where do you see these two
candidates?

36:03.128 --> 36:06.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK, Inside Higher
Education: I
see the two candidates on school
reform and

36:06.631 --> 36:10.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually a bit on higher ed
reform in the
same place.

36:10.802 --> 36:16.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Barack Obama very much embraced
school reform,
innovation, online education,
new ways of

36:16.241 --> 36:18.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
delivering education.

36:18.443 --> 36:22.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, a little more
skeptical,
and I think that relates to her
being close

36:22.080 --> 36:25.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the teachers unions, as we
were talking
about.

36:25.250 --> 36:31.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, aside from a few
speeches, has
not given much detail at all.

36:31.089 --> 36:35.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, take us now
more directly
into the higher ed part,
because, here, Hillary

36:35.660 --> 36:40.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton has taken a real strong
position,
right, with her idea for free
public higher

36:40.932 --> 36:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
education for many.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.735 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT JASCHIK: Correct.

36:43.768 --> 36:49.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's proposing that everyone be
entitled
to free public tuition at public
colleges

36:49.174 --> 36:54.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their home state if you're
from family
incomes up to $125,000.

36:54.546 --> 36:58.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That covers more than 80 percent
of the population.

36:58.216 --> 37:03.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She would give grants to states
to distribute
to the universities, which the
states would

37:03.855 --> 37:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to match $1 for $3, so that
there would
be money to replace the lost
tuition revenue.

37:10.662 --> 37:14.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And this one
comes with a big
price tag, I saw, $500 million.

37:14.332 --> 37:19.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: It's a lot of
money, and she
has said that increased taxes on
wealthier

37:19.537 --> 37:20.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Americans would pay for it.

37:20.638 --> 37:22.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, what about
Donald Trump?

37:22.340 --> 37:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much has he said -- he has
-- well, he
has said less, I know, in this
area.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: He's said very
little.

37:27.445 --> 37:32.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have had two interviews with
one of his
top advisers, who has described
a desire to

37:32.183 --> 37:40.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reform the student loan system
to have banks
and colleges mutually decide who
is creditworthy.

37:40.191 --> 37:45.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has also opposed the free
public tuition,
public higher education tuition,
and also

37:45.997 --> 37:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposed President Obama's free
community college
plan.

37:48.766 --> 37:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You were telling
me just before
we started something
interesting, that a lot

37:51.903 --> 37:57.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of people in the higher
education community
are focused on Donald Trump for
what he said

37:57.108 --> 38:01.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about integration, even more
than anything
he said about -- specifically
about education.

38:01.646 --> 38:03.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SCOTT JASCHIK: Right.

38:03.448 --> 38:06.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's gone through several
iterations, but
he says he wants to make it much
more difficult

38:06.451 --> 38:10.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for people to get a visa to come
to the United
States for a variety of
purposes, including

38:10.889 --> 38:12.357 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to study.

38:12.390 --> 38:17.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This worries U.S. academic
leaders, who want
and need foreign students.

38:17.128 --> 38:21.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Andrew, when
you look at
the education -- you have been
following this

38:21.466 --> 38:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
throughout the campaign -- are
you surprised
by how much or how little
attention it has

38:26.871 --> 38:29.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gotten and in what forms it's
gotten?

38:29.440 --> 38:32.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW UJIFUSA: I can't say I'm
surprised.

38:32.076 --> 38:35.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Education is never a top-tier
issue, you know,
in the election.

38:35.813 --> 38:39.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's particularly
true this
go-around.

38:39.050 --> 38:44.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that we should have
expected that
Donald Trump would bring up the
Common Core

38:44.489 --> 38:49.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because it is such a hot-button
topic, particularly
in the Republican base.

38:49.260 --> 38:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's also important to keep in
mind that we
have a new federal education law
that President

38:53.998 --> 38:58.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama signed at the end of last
year that
sort of has taken education off
the front

38:58.403 --> 39:00.171 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
burner for now in several ways.

39:00.205 --> 39:06.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is the Every
Student Succeeds,
right, Act that picked up on the
No Child

39:06.377 --> 39:07.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Left Behind.

39:07.378 --> 39:08.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that was a big deal just a
year ago.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW UJIFUSA: It was a big
deal.

39:09.914 --> 39:12.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It remains to be a big deal.

39:12.417 --> 39:18.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it returns a lot of the
control over several
key policy decisions to states
and districts.

39:18.456 --> 39:21.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there's a little bit less for
Washington
to do.

39:21.226 --> 39:24.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And states and other folks are
still figuring
out what exactly it means.

39:24.262 --> 39:27.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Scott, what do
you see when
you look broadly at the campaign
and how much

39:27.265 --> 39:29.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this has gotten...

39:29.100 --> 39:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: I think we are
going to hear
more about Clinton's higher
education plan.

39:32.003 --> 39:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her aides clearly see this as
something that
will reach middle-class voters.

39:36.541 --> 39:41.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many middle-class families are
deeply concerned
about paying for their
children's college.

39:41.112 --> 39:45.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, likewise, many people in
academia worry
about the future of public
higher education,

39:45.149 --> 39:48.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as states have in many ways
walked away from
their historic obligations.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And do you expect
to hear more
from Donald Trump as well?

39:50.955 --> 39:54.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: I doubt we will
see or hear
more from Donald Trump.

39:54.459 --> 39:59.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One challenge he has is that,
when he talks
about education, people talk
about Trump University.

39:59.497 --> 40:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while that's not really
typical of higher
education, I don't think his
aides view that

40:04.969 --> 40:07.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
as a positive topic of
discussion.

40:07.171 --> 40:10.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, an
issue to be continued
in the campaign.

40:11.009 --> 40:14.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Scott Jaschik and Andrew
Ujifusa, thank you
both very much.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW UJIFUSA: Thank you.

40:15.280 --> 40:17.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCOTT JASCHIK: Thank you.

40:17.081 --> 40:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have compiled the
candidates'
stances on education into a

40:22.420 --> 40:28.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can find that on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

JUDY WOODRUFF: A new Ken Burns
documentary
airs tonight on PBS, and for
this story, he

40:40.705 --> 40:45.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
co-directs with another
filmmaker for whom
the details are very personal.

40:45.610 --> 40:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked with the men at the
United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum about
the cloak

40:51.015 --> 40:55.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and dagger story behind "Defying
the Nazis:
The Sharps' War."

40:55.687 --> 41:03.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: A telephone rang, and it
was probably
the most momentous telephone
call that I ever

41:03.594 --> 41:05.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
received.

41:05.129 --> 41:10.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I knew whose voice it was, the
voice of my
closest friend, Everett Baker.

41:10.635 --> 41:16.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, "Waitstill, Martha, I
am inviting
you to undertake the first
intervention against

41:17.008 --> 41:21.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
evil by the denomination to be
started immediately
overseas."

41:21.245 --> 41:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with that
call in 1939,
the life of unitarian minister
Waitstill Sharp

41:28.820 --> 41:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and his wife, Martha, would
never be the same,
nor would the world.

41:36.427 --> 41:42.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Sharps, who lived in
Wellesley, Massachusetts,
were sent by their church to
lead a secret

41:42.066 --> 41:48.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and perilous rescue of refugees
and dissidents
in Europe before and after the
start of World

41:48.573 --> 41:50.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War II.

41:50.408 --> 41:57.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They directly helped over 100
people escape
and had a part in helping over
2,000 people

41:57.115 --> 42:00.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
avoid deportation to Nazi death
camps.

42:00.651 --> 42:06.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They expected to be gone for
several months,
and instead were gone two years.

42:06.224 --> 42:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MORDECAI PALDIEL, Holocaust
Scholar: They
were motivated from the
beginning to go out

42:10.595 --> 42:13.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there into the kingdom of hell
and try to
get some people out.

42:13.898 --> 42:17.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They left two
young children
at home.

42:17.935 --> 42:24.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Artemis Joukowsky is the
grandson of the Sharps,
and son of the Martha Sharp who
was named

42:24.442 --> 42:26.444 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after her courageous mother.

42:26.477 --> 42:30.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Artemis, this really has been
almost a lifelong
project for you, since you were,
what, in

42:30.882 --> 42:32.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
high school?

42:32.650 --> 42:34.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY, "Defying the
Nazis: The
Sharps' War": Yes, I was in
ninth grade, and

42:34.051 --> 42:37.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was given an assignment to
interview someone
of moral courage.

42:37.755 --> 42:40.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I went home and I said to my
mom, "Who
should I interview?"

42:40.491 --> 42:42.360 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She said: "Talk to your
grandmother.

42:42.393 --> 42:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She did some cool things during
World War
II."

42:45.830 --> 42:47.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that interview changed my
life.

42:47.131 --> 42:49.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What was it that
she shared
with you?

42:49.967 --> 42:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, obviously, you were
young.

42:51.803 --> 42:55.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were -- but she shared
something with
you that stayed.

42:55.540 --> 42:56.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY: Yes.

42:56.541 --> 42:58.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What was it?

42:58.376 --> 43:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY: I think a
love for people,
a love for difference, a love
for celebrating

43:01.646 --> 43:05.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is good in the world and
what makes the
world so rich.

43:05.283 --> 43:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ken, you have so
many different
film ideas to choose from.

43:09.821 --> 43:11.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What was it about this story?

43:11.589 --> 43:14.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN BURNS, "Defying the Nazis:
The Sharps'
War": You know, this is a story
that chose

43:14.158 --> 43:15.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
me.

43:15.159 --> 43:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I didn't start this project.

43:16.994 --> 43:20.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was started years and years
ago by Artemis.

43:20.064 --> 43:21.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he brought it to me.

43:21.065 --> 43:25.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I looked at the germ of the
story.

43:25.636 --> 43:29.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was so stunned, that I had
to drop everything.

43:29.607 --> 43:35.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's its these two lone figures
in the face
of this gigantic tidal wave of
the greatest

43:35.680 --> 43:39.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cataclysm in human history, the
Second World
War.

43:39.684 --> 43:44.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what happens is, is that
cataclysm becomes
so big that it's undefinable.

43:44.322 --> 43:49.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We say six million Jews, and we
can't actually
personalize it in a way.

43:49.193 --> 43:54.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, here was an opportunity, a
kind of back
door, a stage door to go through
these two

43:54.232 --> 44:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extraordinary, but improbable
heroes, courageous
people who are throwing us, the
audience,

44:01.272 --> 44:05.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into an espionage story, a spy
story.

44:05.343 --> 44:09.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, this is a story of
courage, but also
of sacrifice.

44:09.914 --> 44:15.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In fact, the more
he dug for
documents, the more complicated
and interesting

44:15.119 --> 44:16.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the story became.

44:16.220 --> 44:18.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY: I didn't even
know what
I had.

44:18.756 --> 44:25.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, over the next 15
years, and working
with Ken's team, we have now
begun to create

44:25.129 --> 44:31.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not just the story of what we're
sharing with
the world, but an archive that
is all over

44:31.369 --> 44:33.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

44:33.170 --> 44:36.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have archives now in France,
in Germany,
in the Czech Republic that are
connected to

44:36.941 --> 44:38.676 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our collections.

44:38.709 --> 44:43.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have discovered over 200,000
documents
that are now archived here at
the museum.

44:43.748 --> 44:46.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's extraordinary is how
the documents
come alive.

44:46.717 --> 44:52.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you also lost
a lot of
documents, because documents,
thousands, millions

44:52.790 --> 44:55.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of pages had to be burned to
keep them from
the Nazis.

44:55.826 --> 44:56.794 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY: Yes, exactly.

44:56.827 --> 44:58.663 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

44:58.696 --> 45:01.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is so remarkable about this
project is
how many people are coming
forward today saying,

45:01.933 --> 45:03.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Sharps helped us in this
way.

45:03.935 --> 45:06.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have documents that show the
Sharps helped
us.

45:06.737 --> 45:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this very large network of
underground,
you know, rescuers, both the
Jewish community,

45:13.210 --> 45:17.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Protestant community, the
Catholic community,
others who saw rescue as
something that they

45:17.949 --> 45:19.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had to do for their faith.

45:19.216 --> 45:21.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN BURNS: What he'd sent was
this diamond
in the rough.

45:21.652 --> 45:26.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you realize that the story
was everything,
and that you can always find a
way to tell

45:26.357 --> 45:27.425 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a story.

45:27.458 --> 45:29.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there's no pictures, then you
find the
documents.

45:29.226 --> 45:33.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If there are no documents, then
you find the
pictures, or you get live
cinematography,

45:33.464 --> 45:35.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or you do something.

45:35.299 --> 45:40.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Dr. Otto Meyerhof, the
Jewish Nobel
Prize-winning biochemist, who
was hiding out

45:40.371 --> 45:42.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a small coastal village north
of...

45:42.239 --> 45:46.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To that end, some
of those
rescued are portrayed in the
film through

45:46.077 --> 45:47.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
narration and photos.

45:47.878 --> 45:52.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Lion Feuchtwanger, a
German-Jewish novelist
and playwright, is one:

45:52.883 --> 45:55.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: Why are you here doing
what you're
doing?

45:55.219 --> 46:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ACTOR: I'm just as capable of
the many sins
of human nature as anyone else,
but I believe

46:00.591 --> 46:04.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the will of God is to be
interpreted
by the liberty of the human
spirit.

46:04.695 --> 46:10.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are
interviews with those
who are still alive, like
Rosemarie Feigl

46:10.301 --> 46:12.103 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Vienna.

46:12.136 --> 46:15.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROSEMARIE FEIGL, Holocaust
Survivor: My father
went from consulate to consulate
trying to

46:15.139 --> 46:20.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get visas to go anywhere that
was plausible.

46:20.745 --> 46:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's how he met Martha Sharp,
who saved
my life.

46:24.715 --> 46:28.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And my mother just packed my
things.

46:28.819 --> 46:35.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Martha gave us all beige berets,
and there
are pictures of us in those
beige berets.

46:35.326 --> 46:41.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTRESS: We realized that we
were in the front
lines against Nazism.

46:41.132 --> 46:45.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Waitstill looked at me and,
holding my hand
tightly, whispered, "Courage."

46:45.202 --> 46:51.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you have a
sense of what,
for her, was the hardest, the
scariest moment?

46:51.275 --> 46:56.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY: I think
facing up to a
Nazi official, knowing that this
could be

46:56.414 --> 46:58.182 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
death.

46:58.215 --> 47:06.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think negotiating with people
who she viewed
in her mind as being not
connected to human

47:06.757 --> 47:08.325 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reality.

47:08.359 --> 47:12.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think she felt afraid for
everyone she tried
to help.

47:12.363 --> 47:17.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that notion of this
being just a drop
in the bucket of how many people
could have

47:17.768 --> 47:23.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been saved, I think she lived
with that pain
and that regret all her life.

47:23.240 --> 47:26.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This story is not just about
celebrating their
lives.

47:26.310 --> 47:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an instruction manual for
what -- how
we need to operate today as
people and as

47:32.750 --> 47:34.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civilizations.

47:34.585 --> 47:39.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, at the same
time, as Ken
said, there was a personal toll
on your family,

47:39.190 --> 47:40.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on your mother.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY: Yes.

47:41.192 --> 47:42.993 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

47:43.027 --> 47:46.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there was
some suggestion
that the project is an effort to
do some healing.

47:46.263 --> 47:47.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY: Yes.

47:47.264 --> 47:48.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
that?

47:48.265 --> 47:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY: I think it
happened.

47:50.034 --> 47:54.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think my mother saw the film
in the last
month, as we're getting ready to
share this

47:54.705 --> 47:55.673 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the world.

47:55.706 --> 47:58.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she said, it's brilliant.

47:58.042 --> 48:00.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she understands how she felt
as a child.

48:00.945 --> 48:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We portray her in the film as a
vulnerable
child, just as the children my
grandmother

48:06.884 --> 48:07.985 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was rescuing.

48:08.018 --> 48:11.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN BURNS: It has something that
is universal
to it.

48:11.322 --> 48:13.124 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's what I love.

48:13.157 --> 48:18.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see in action, particularly
today, where
we're wrestling in our own
country with what

48:18.095 --> 48:23.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
direction we want to take, do we
wish to go
this way or do we wish to go
that way, that

48:23.734 --> 48:25.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these people opened their
hearts.

48:25.503 --> 48:27.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He could give a sermon every
Sunday.

48:27.238 --> 48:31.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He could minister to the common
problems of
his parishioners.

48:31.876 --> 48:39.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, all of a sudden, he's
in Nazi-occupied
Prague, suddenly learning how to
launder money.

48:39.817 --> 48:42.953 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she's trying to escape the
Gestapo tail.

48:42.987 --> 48:45.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you suddenly realize, but
this is all
true.

48:45.222 --> 48:46.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARTEMIS JOUKOWSKY: Right.

48:46.223 --> 48:48.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEN BURNS: It is all true.

48:48.826 --> 48:58.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Towards the end,
the film shows
the Sharps' daughter, Martha
Sharp Joukowsky,

48:58.068 --> 49:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aided by Rosemarie Feigl,
lighting the Eternal

Sharps were honored
as the Righteous Among the
Nations.

49:11.415 --> 49:18.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are two of only five
Americans honored
among 25,000 people with that
distinction.

GWEN IFILL: We close with an
essay.

Novelist Jennine Capo Crucet
grew up in Miami
and attended Cornell University
in Upstate

49:49.053 --> 49:50.888 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New York.

49:50.921 --> 49:55.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to adjusting to the
cold, Jennine
learned to navigate campus as a
first-generation

49:55.926 --> 49:57.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
college student.

49:57.761 --> 50:02.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, she shares thoughts on
why colleges
need to do better at welcoming
students like

50:02.166 --> 50:03.934 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

JENNINE CAPO CRUCET, Author,
"Make Your Home
Among Strangers": It took me
going away to

50:05.736 --> 50:08.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
college to learn that, by doing
so, I would
become something called a
first-generation

50:08.706 --> 50:10.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
college student.

50:10.374 --> 50:14.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This means I was the first in my
family to
go to college, but it also meant
I had no

50:14.378 --> 50:16.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
idea how much I didn't know.

50:16.780 --> 50:21.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, my family stuck
around for all
of freshman orientation because
the paperwork

50:21.218 --> 50:25.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about move-in day didn't
explicitly state
when they should leave, so we
assumed they

50:25.456 --> 50:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
need to be there the whole week.

50:27.524 --> 50:31.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Long after other families had
taken off, mine
was still following me around as
I registered

50:31.462 --> 50:34.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for classes or during the
school-mandated
swim test.

50:34.632 --> 50:37.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was glad to have them there,
but it did
make for some awkward meals in
the dining

50:37.968 --> 50:39.770 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hall.

50:39.803 --> 50:42.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aside from going to class, I had
no road map
for what I was supposed to do as
a newly minted

50:42.706 --> 50:44.475 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
college student.

50:44.508 --> 50:48.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I navigated those first weeks by
carefully
watching what I thought of as
real students,

50:48.979 --> 50:54.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those whose parents had gone to
college, who'd
gotten a lifelong rundown of
what was in store.

50:54.151 --> 50:57.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's how I knew to wear
flip-flops in the
shower or to take notes in class
or that visits

50:57.955 --> 51:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the writing center were
covered by tuition.

51:00.891 --> 51:03.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there was still a lot I
couldn't figure
out this way.

51:03.060 --> 51:07.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, I dropped a class
after realizing
the textbooks would cost a
couple hundred

51:07.064 --> 51:08.799 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
dollars.

51:08.832 --> 51:11.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the time I learned that
professors often
put books on course reserve, it
was too late

51:11.535 --> 51:15.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to add it back that semester, or
like when
my professors kept saying, "See
me in office

51:15.906 --> 51:17.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hours," as if we all knew what
that meant.

51:17.841 --> 51:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it took a bad grade on a
paper for him
to explain to me what office
hours were, that

51:23.080 --> 51:27.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he was just waiting around in
one place, ready
to answers all my questions.

51:27.818 --> 51:31.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What could my college have done
to show me
how much I needed to know
without making me

51:31.889 --> 51:34.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feel dumb or out of my league in
the process?

51:34.458 --> 51:39.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is where well-meaning
administrators
usually start throwing around
the word mentorship.

51:39.063 --> 51:44.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But too many colleges still
think of mentoring
as just meetings between two
people, one who

51:44.268 --> 51:48.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
knows some stuff and another who
doesn't yet
know that stuff.

51:48.105 --> 51:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Technically, I had a mentor my
first year
in college, but when I finally
met him, he

51:52.209 --> 51:55.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't seem to understand how
confused I was,
in part because he came from a
long line of

51:55.980 --> 51:57.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
college-going folks.

51:57.081 --> 52:00.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't know how much I didn't
know either.

52:00.517 --> 52:04.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Formal mentors like the one my
college assigned
me need to be first-generation
college students

52:04.888 --> 52:09.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves or have been trained
by people
intimately familiar with the
challenges students

52:09.560 --> 52:10.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like me faced.

52:10.761 --> 52:13.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They need to do more than send
us concerned
e-mails:.

52:13.831 --> 52:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They need to knock on our
literal doors.

52:16.367 --> 52:20.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they should be compensated
for their work
as mentors, not asked to
volunteer or serve

52:20.337 --> 52:24.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out of some sense of obligation
to help out
a past version of themselves.

52:24.274 --> 52:28.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They need to be concretely
valued for the
resource they are, for the
unique survival

52:28.145 --> 52:30.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
skills they bring to campus.

52:30.781 --> 52:34.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I now work as a novelist and,
believe it or
not, a professor.

52:34.785 --> 52:39.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whenever I'm in front of a group
of new readers
or students, I ask those who
identify as first-generation

52:39.923 --> 52:42.059 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
college people to raise their
hands.

52:42.092 --> 52:43.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I then congratulate them.

52:43.861 --> 52:47.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I tell them how much it means to
me to meet
them, and I tell them that I'm
one of them.

52:47.564 --> 52:51.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, later, after whatever talk
or lecture
I have given, there's almost
always someone

52:51.635 --> 52:54.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who comes up to me and admits
they didn't
raise their hand because they
didn't know

52:54.838 --> 52:59.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being a first-generation college
student was
a fact they could be proud of.

52:59.209 --> 53:04.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only then do I admit to them
something I know
that they don't: When I was in
their place,

53:04.481 --> 53:06.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wouldn't have raised my hand
either.
