JUDY WOODRUFF: Russia is denying
that it tried to hack U.S.
voting computer software and

00:04.833 --> 00:08.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
equipment before last year's
presidential election.

00:08.100 --> 00:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The online magazine
The Intercept reported
the allegation, based
on a National Security

00:13.766 --> 00:15.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Agency document.

00:15.900 --> 00:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Kremlin spokesman dismissed
it today, saying - - quote --
"This assertion has absolutely

00:21.100 --> 00:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
nothing to do with reality."

00:23.200 --> 00:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Washington, the U.S.
secretary of homeland
security, John Kelly,
was asked about it at

00:27.633 --> 00:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Senate hearing.

00:28.633 --> 00:31.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

00:31.033 --> 00:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CLAIRE MCCASKILL (D),
Missouri: Are you deferring
the investigation of
this to the FBI, or is

00:33.700 --> 00:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the department actually actively
engaged in investigating
the penetration or attempts

00:40.733 --> 00:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to penetrate the voter files in
this country immediately before
the election by the Russian

00:42.866 --> 00:44.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government?

00:44.866 --> 00:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KELLY, U.S. Homeland
Security Secretary:
I share your concern.

00:46.866 --> 00:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't disagree with anything
you said relative to the
sanctity of our voting process.

00:49.033 --> 00:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, it's an interagency
-- it should be an
interagency investigation.

00:53.566 --> 00:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that is taking place.

00:55.466 --> 00:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DHS will be part of that.

00:57.500 --> 01:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
ranking Democrat on
the Senate Intelligence
Committee, Virginia's

01:01.600 --> 01:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Warner, told USA Today
that the Russian cyber-attacks
were even more extensive.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But he said he doesn't think
that actual votes were changed.

01:11.500 --> 01:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Reality Winner, the Georgia
woman charged, apparently, with
leaking the NSA report, remained

01:17.800 --> 01:18.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in jail.

01:18.800 --> 01:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her mother called her a patriot.

01:21.900 --> 01:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump today waded into
the political conflict over the
Persian Gulf nation of Qatar,

01:28.033 --> 01:30.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
where the U.S.
has 10,000 troops.

01:30.066 --> 01:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bahrain
and the UAE all broke ties
with the kingdom on Monday and

01:36.100 --> 01:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accused it of supporting
terror groups and Iran.

01:39.733 --> 01:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jordan scaled back ties today.

01:41.900 --> 01:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Mr. Trump appeared to
endorse the move in a tweet
that said: "Perhaps this will be

01:48.366 --> 01:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the beginning of the end to
the horror of terrorism."

01:50.900 --> 01:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This in contrast to yesterday,
when the White House said the
president wanted to work with

01:55.366 --> 01:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all the parties to
de-escalate the situation.

01:59.500 --> 02:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
British police have identified
the third suspect in Saturday's
deadly knife and van attack

02:05.100 --> 02:07.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in London.

02:07.066 --> 02:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was 22-year-old Youssef
Zaghba, an Italian national
of Moroccan descent.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All three attackers were
shot dead by police.

02:14.766 --> 02:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also today, hundreds across the
country gathered for a minute
of silence to remember those

02:19.466 --> 02:21.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who died or were wounded.

02:21.766 --> 02:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the mayor of
London, Sadiq Khan, brushed off
criticism from President Trump.

02:28.733 --> 02:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president has written a
series of tweets ridiculing the
mayor since Saturday's attack.

02:34.966 --> 02:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, Khan said he's
much more concerned about the
invitation extended last year to

02:38.166 --> 02:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump to come
to Great Britain.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SADIQ KHAN, Mayor of London:
I really couldn't be bothered
about what Donald Trump tweets.

02:42.966 --> 02:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm not -- I don't how
to tell you this, but
I really don't care.

02:45.933 --> 02:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's the important issue is
that, you know, Prime Minister
Theresa May offered Donald

02:52.366 --> 02:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump a state visit moments
after he was elected president.

02:54.566 --> 02:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I said at the time,
I don't think a state
visit was appropriate,
and my views haven't

02:58.700 --> 03:00.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
changed.

03:00.266 --> 03:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
didn't respond directly to Khan.

03:02.366 --> 03:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, a spokesman said
the president appreciates
the queen's invitation.

03:07.100 --> 03:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In France, a man swinging a
hammer attacked police outside
Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris

03:12.633 --> 03:15.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

03:15.200 --> 03:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He allegedly shouted
"This is for Syria" and
struck one officer before
being shot and wounded.

03:20.633 --> 03:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dozens of police took over the
scene, and blocked at least
600 people from leaving the

03:25.033 --> 03:26.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cathedral.

03:26.433 --> 03:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

released later in the evening.

03:28.933 --> 03:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's word that ride-sharing
giant Uber has fired 20 people
after an internal investigation

03:35.733 --> 03:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
into sexual harassment
and other complaints.

03:38.633 --> 03:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Various news outlets report
that the moves were announced
today at a staff meeting in

03:43.200 --> 03:45.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
San Francisco.

A law firm investigated more
than 200 allegations of sexual
harassment going back to 2012.

03:51.600 --> 03:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average lost
47 points to close at 21136.
