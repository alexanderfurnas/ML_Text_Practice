00:44.645 --> 00:45.746
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING AND

00:45.746 --> 00:46.647
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.948
WE BEGIN WITH THE MASSIVE RESCUE

00:47.948 --> 00:49.349
EFFORT AND GROWING HUMANITARIAN

00:49.349 --> 00:51.051
CRISIS OFF THE COAST OF LIBYA.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.552
THE ITALIAN COAST GUARD SAYS IT

00:52.552 --> 00:54.288
HAS SAVED MORE THAN 4,200

00:54.288 --> 00:56.390
MIGRANTS IN 22 SEPARATE OCEAN

00:56.390 --> 00:58.759
RESCUE OPERATIONS OVER THE PAST

00:58.759 --> 01:00.460
24 HOURS.

01:00.460 --> 01:01.495
THE MIGRANTS ARE TRYING TO REACH

01:01.495 --> 01:03.030
EUROPE, TO ESCAPE WAR, POVERTY

01:03.030 --> 01:04.464
AND PERSECUTION IN AFRICA AND

01:04.464 --> 01:05.465
THE MIDDLE EAST.

01:05.465 --> 01:06.934
BUT SMUGGLERS ARE PUTTING THEM

01:06.934 --> 01:08.468
ON SHIPS WHICH END UP STRANDED

01:08.468 --> 01:09.870
IN ROUGH SEAS.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.805
MORE THAN 78,000 MIGRANTS HAVE

01:11.805 --> 01:13.006
REPORTEDLY REACHED EUROPEAN

01:13.006 --> 01:14.408
SHORES SINCE JANUARY.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.642
MOST ARE SCATTERED THROUGHOUT

01:15.642 --> 01:17.144
ITALY AND GREECE.

01:17.144 --> 01:18.345
WHILE THE BRITISH, BELGIAN,

01:18.345 --> 01:20.180
IRISH AND GERMAN NAVIES HAVE

01:20.180 --> 01:21.915
JOINED THE RESCUE OPERATION,

01:21.915 --> 01:23.583
MOST ARE AGAINST A PROPOSED

01:23.583 --> 01:25.185
QUOTA SYSTEM TO DISTRIBUTE THE

01:25.185 --> 01:27.154
REFUGEES ACROSS EUROPE.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.555
AN EARTHQUAKE THAT STRUCK OFF

01:28.555 --> 01:30.090
THE COAST OF ONE OF JAPAN'S MOST

01:30.090 --> 01:32.025
REMOTE ISLANDS WAS SO DEEP AND

01:32.025 --> 01:34.361
SO POWERFUL IT SHOOK BUILDINGS,

01:34.361 --> 01:36.096
STOPPED TRAIN SERVICE AND CUT

01:36.096 --> 01:38.832
POWER TO PARTS OF TOKYO, 620

01:38.832 --> 01:40.767
MILES NORTH OF THE EPICENTER.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.171
THE QUAKE STRUCK 421 MILES DEEP,

01:44.171 --> 01:46.306
BUT DID NOT TOUCH OFF A TSUNAMI.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.507
NO ONE WAS HURT AND NO SERIOUS

01:47.507 --> 01:48.675
DAMAGE WAS REPORTED.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.043
TODAY THE U.S. IS ISSUING ITS

01:50.043 --> 01:51.545
STRONGEST MESSAGE YET ON CHINA'S

01:51.545 --> 01:53.080
EXPANSION INTO THE SOUTH CHINA

01:53.080 --> 01:54.014
SEA.

01:54.014 --> 01:55.182
DEFENSE SECRETARY ASH CARTER

01:55.182 --> 01:56.550
CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE AND

01:56.550 --> 01:58.552
LASTING HALT, TO STOP CHINA FROM

01:58.552 --> 01:59.853
BUILDING AND OCCUPYING

01:59.853 --> 02:01.421
ARTIFICIAL ISLANDS IN THE

02:01.421 --> 02:03.056
HIGHLY-CONTESTED REGION.

02:03.056 --> 02:04.424
THIS FOLLOWS NEWS THAT U.S.

02:04.424 --> 02:05.859
SURVEILLANCE IMAGERY REPORTEDLY

02:05.859 --> 02:08.228
SHOWS CHINA POSITIONING WEAPONS

02:08.228 --> 02:09.896
ON ONE OF THE ISLANDS.

02:09.896 --> 02:11.331
VIETNAM AND THE PHILIPPINES

02:11.331 --> 02:12.833
CLAIM THEY HAVE MINERAL RIGHTS

02:12.833 --> 02:13.867
THERE.

02:13.867 --> 02:15.035
BUT SECRETARY CARTER SAYS CHINA

02:15.035 --> 02:16.636
HAS ALREADY RECLAIMED MORE THAN

02:16.636 --> 02:18.005
2,000 ACRES.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.172
CARTER IS CALLING FOR A

02:19.172 --> 02:20.674
DIPLOMATIC APPROACH, SAYING:"

02:20.674 --> 02:22.309
THERE'S NO MILITARY SOLUTION"

02:22.309 --> 02:23.977
TO THE LAND DISPUTE.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.245
THE PENTAGON IS LAUNCHING A

02:25.245 --> 02:26.646
HIGH-LEVEL INVESTIGATION INTO AN

02:26.646 --> 02:28.248
ANTHRAX MIX-UP.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.583
THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SAYS

02:29.583 --> 02:31.018
IT ACCIDENTALLY SHIPPED LIVE

02:31.018 --> 02:32.986
ANTHRAX TO 24-LABORATORIES IN 11

02:32.986 --> 02:34.154
STATES AND TWO FOREIGN

02:34.154 --> 02:35.856
COUNTRIES, POSSIBLY SOUTH KOREA

02:35.856 --> 02:37.357
AND AUSTRALIA.

02:37.357 --> 02:38.825
THE C.D.C. SAYS THE SAMPLES WERE

02:38.825 --> 02:40.227
SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN KILLED,

02:40.227 --> 02:41.762
BUT CONTAINED LIVE SPORES

02:41.762 --> 02:42.696
INSTEAD.

02:42.696 --> 02:44.031
OFFICIALS SAY THERE'S NO KNOWN

02:44.031 --> 02:45.499
RISK TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND

02:45.499 --> 02:47.100
AN EXTREMELY LOW RISK TO LAB

02:47.100 --> 02:48.402
WORKERS.

02:48.402 --> 02:49.903
MORE THAN 20 MILITARY PERSONNEL

02:49.903 --> 02:51.471
ARE BEING MONITORED FOR ANTHRAX

02:51.471 --> 02:53.006
EXPOSURE.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.341
PAKISTAN HAS LAUNCHED A MAJOR

02:54.341 --> 02:55.675
MANHUNT TO FIND THE GUNMEN WHO

02:55.675 --> 02:57.110
DRESSED UP LIKE SECURITY

02:57.110 --> 02:59.413
OFFICERS, HIJACKED TWO BUSES AND

02:59.413 --> 03:01.448
KILLED 22 PASSENGERS.

03:01.448 --> 03:02.649
ONE WITNESS SAID THE ATTACKERS

03:02.649 --> 03:04.117
CAPTURED DOZENS OF PEOPLE, THEN

03:04.117 --> 03:05.886
DIVIDED THEM UP BY ETHNICITY,

03:05.886 --> 03:07.587
SHOOTING THE PASHTUNS, AND

03:07.587 --> 03:09.723
LETTING THE OTHERS GO FREE.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.191
TEXAS GOVERNOR GREG ABBOTT IS

03:11.191 --> 03:12.592
PLANNING TO SIGN NEW GUN

03:12.592 --> 03:14.594
LEGISLATION ALLOWING CITIZENS TO

03:14.594 --> 03:16.797
OPENLY CARRY HANDGUNS IN PUBLIC

03:16.797 --> 03:18.065
PLACES.

03:18.065 --> 03:18.999
THE LEGISLATURE EASILY PASSED

03:18.999 --> 03:20.600
THE BILL YESTERDAY, OVERTURNING

03:20.600 --> 03:22.702
A BAN ON OPEN-CARRY THAT DATES

03:22.702 --> 03:24.471
BACK TO THE CIVIL WAR.

03:24.471 --> 03:26.473
IF ABBOTT SIGNS IT, TEXAS WILL

03:26.473 --> 03:29.443
JOIN 44 OTHER STATES WHICH ALLOW

03:29.443 --> 03:31.211
PEOPLE TO CARRY A HANDGUN EITHER

03:31.211 --> 03:33.213
WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY VISIBLE IN A

03:33.213 --> 03:35.315
BELT OR SHOULDER HOLSTER.

03:35.315 --> 03:37.017
TEXAS GUN OWNERS WOULD ALSO BE

03:37.017 --> 03:38.985
REQUIRED TO HAVE A GUN LICENSE

03:38.985 --> 03:41.555
AND BE AT LEAST 21 YEARS OF AGE.

03:41.555 --> 03:42.856
THE LAW WOULD TAKE EFFECT

03:42.856 --> 03:44.257
JANUARY 1ST.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.425
ANOTHER DEMOCRAT HAS LAUNCHED A

03:45.425 --> 03:46.560
QUEST FOR THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL

03:46.560 --> 03:47.461
NOMINATION.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.962
FORMER BALTIMORE MAYOR AND

03:48.962 --> 03:50.263
MARYLAND GOVERNOR MARTIN

03:50.263 --> 03:51.665
O'MALLEY ANNOUNCED HIS CANDIDACY

03:51.665 --> 03:53.200
TODAY, POINTING TO NEW

03:53.200 --> 03:55.435
LEADERSHIP AS A CAMPAIGN THEME.

03:55.435 --> 03:57.104
A RECENT QUINNIPIAC UNIVERSITY

03:57.104 --> 03:58.638
POLL OF DEMOCRATS NATIONWIDE

03:58.638 --> 03:59.840
GAVE O'MALLEY ONE PERCENT

03:59.840 --> 04:00.941
SUPPORT.

04:00.941 --> 04:02.576
HILLARY CLINTON TOPPED THE FIELD

04:02.576 --> 04:04.444
WITH 57%.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.655
>> Sreenivasan: TONIGHT, ISIS IS

04:15.655 --> 04:17.324
MAINTAINING CONTROL OF THE CITY

04:17.324 --> 04:19.025
OF PALMYRA IN SYRIA.

04:19.025 --> 04:20.327
NOW WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT

04:20.327 --> 04:22.262
HOW ISIS IS TREATING THE PEOPLE

04:22.262 --> 04:23.530
OF PALMYRA.

04:23.530 --> 04:24.631
FOR SOME INSIGHT WE ARE JOINED

04:24.631 --> 04:25.966
VIA SKYPE FROM ISTANBUL BY ANNE

04:25.966 --> 04:27.534
BARNARD OF THE "NEW YORK TIMES."

04:27.534 --> 04:29.136
SO THIS WAS THE FIRST CITY THAT

04:29.136 --> 04:30.871
ISIS TOOK CONTROL OF FROM THE

04:30.871 --> 04:32.172
SYRIAN GOVERNMENT.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.540
HAVE THEIR TACTICS CHANGED IN

04:33.540 --> 04:34.641
WHAT THEY DO WHEN THEY GET INTO

04:34.641 --> 04:36.109
TOWN?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.310
>> WELL, IT SEEMS THERE'S A

04:37.310 --> 04:39.279
CERTAIN SET OF STEPS THAT ISIS

04:39.279 --> 04:41.481
HAS HONED DURING THE TWO YEARS

04:41.481 --> 04:42.749
IT STARTED TO ACCUMULATE

04:42.749 --> 04:44.751
TERRITORY IN IRAQ AND SYRIA.

04:44.751 --> 04:45.986
THEY COME IN.

04:45.986 --> 04:46.920
THEY CARRY OUT SOME

04:46.920 --> 04:48.321
WELL-PUBLICIZED ATROCITIES --

04:48.321 --> 04:51.158
BEHEADINGS, ATTACKING PEOPLE WHO

04:51.158 --> 04:53.927
THEY THINK MIGHT OPPOSE THEM AND

04:53.927 --> 04:55.262
TRY TO COURT FAVOR WITH SOME

04:55.262 --> 04:57.297
OTHER POPULATIONS AND ALTERNATE

04:57.297 --> 04:58.431
BETWEEN THE TWO.

04:58.431 --> 04:59.399
NOW, THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT

04:59.399 --> 05:00.734
THEY'VE TAKEN A TOWN FROM THE

05:00.734 --> 05:02.903
GOVERNMENT AND NOT FROM

05:02.903 --> 05:04.104
INSURGENTS WHO HAD TAKEN IT

05:04.104 --> 05:05.238
PREVIOUSLY.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.807
SO STRANGELY, HERE, THEY DON'T

05:07.807 --> 05:10.377
EXPECT TO HAVE A RIVAL FOR THE

05:10.377 --> 05:12.012
ANTIGOVERNMENT MANTLE, SO TO

05:12.012 --> 05:13.580
SPEAK.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.716
SO SOME PEOPLE ARE SURPRISED

05:16.716 --> 05:18.385
THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN HARSHER

05:18.385 --> 05:19.786
WITH THE GENERAL POPULATION,

05:19.786 --> 05:21.021
ESPECIALLY SINCE PALMYRA IS A

05:21.021 --> 05:22.255
PLACE THAT MADE ITS LIVING OFF

05:22.255 --> 05:23.490
THE TOURIST TRADE AND WAS QUITE

05:23.490 --> 05:24.791
OPEN WITH THE WEST.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.560
>> Sreenivasan: YOU SAID

05:26.560 --> 05:28.695
BESIDES THE BEHEADINGS AND

05:28.695 --> 05:30.697
EXECUTIONS, THEY'RE TRYING TO

05:30.697 --> 05:32.299
TAKE ON MUNICIPAL MATTERS,

05:32.299 --> 05:35.502
TURNING ON THE WATER AND FUEL.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.970
>> ONE OF THEIR GOALS IS TO

05:36.970 --> 05:38.138
CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT THEY REALLY

05:38.138 --> 05:40.974
ARE A STATE, AND THAT THEY CAN

05:40.974 --> 05:43.009
TAKE OVER INSTITUTIONS AND

05:43.009 --> 05:45.011
FACILITIES AND PROVIDE SERVICES.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.314
SO WITHIN HOURS OF COMING

05:47.314 --> 05:49.316
TOWN, THEY HAD EXECUTED PEOPLE

05:49.316 --> 05:50.584
PUBLICLY IN THE STREETS.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.885
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY WERE

05:51.885 --> 05:52.819
TRYING TO CARRY OUT VERY

05:52.819 --> 05:54.087
ORDINARY FUNCTIONS-- OPENING THE

05:54.087 --> 05:56.156
BAKERIES, GIVING BREAD FOR FREE,

05:56.156 --> 05:59.292
AND FIXING THE POWER PLANT AND

05:59.292 --> 06:01.261
THE WATER PUMPS WHICH HAD BEEN

06:01.261 --> 06:04.631
LEFT NOT WORKING BY SOLDIERS.

06:04.631 --> 06:08.401
TRAIMENT, BOMBING STARTED, SO

06:08.401 --> 06:09.936
SERVICES HAVE BEEN COMING IN AND

06:09.936 --> 06:11.304
OUT.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.372
>> Sreenivasan: THE PEOPLE OF

06:12.372 --> 06:13.907
PALMYRA ARE CAUGHT IN A BIT--

06:13.907 --> 06:15.742
BETWEEN A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE.

06:15.742 --> 06:17.711
ON THE ONE HAND, IF THEY

06:17.711 --> 06:19.212
DON'T COOPERATE WITH ISIS, THEY

06:19.212 --> 06:20.313
COULD MEET WITH DEATH.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.481
AND ON THE OTHER HAND, REALLY,

06:21.481 --> 06:22.582
IT'S THE GOVERNMENT THAT THEY

06:22.582 --> 06:24.050
DON'T FEEL A TREMENDOUS LOYALTY

06:24.050 --> 06:25.719
TO, ANYWAY.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.586
>> YEAH.

06:26.586 --> 06:27.621
I MEAN, LIKE EVERYWHERE IN

06:27.621 --> 06:29.089
SYRIA-- I VISITED PALMYRA A YEAR

06:29.089 --> 06:30.657
AGO, SO WE GOT TO KNOW A LOT OF

06:30.657 --> 06:31.992
PEOPLE THERE.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.426
THERE'S CERTAINLY A RANGE OF

06:33.426 --> 06:34.661
SENTIMENT ABOUT THE

06:34.661 --> 06:36.463
GOVERNMENT FROM PRO TO ANTI.

06:36.463 --> 06:39.566
BUT PALMYRA WAS A PLACE WHERE

06:39.566 --> 06:41.134
THERE WAS A LOCAL REBELLION THAT

06:41.134 --> 06:42.636
WAS PUT DOWN IN 2012.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.004
IT'S AN ALMOST ENTIRELY SUNNI

06:44.004 --> 06:45.772
TOWN WHERE THE SECURITY FORCES

06:45.772 --> 06:47.173
HAD NEVER FELT EXTREMELY

06:47.173 --> 06:48.742
COMFORTABLE, ESPECIALLY THOSE

06:48.742 --> 06:49.709
THAT WERE FROM OTHER PARTS OF

06:49.709 --> 06:51.878
THE COUNTRY.

06:51.878 --> 06:53.213
THEY TOLD US A YEAR AGO THAT

06:53.213 --> 06:54.948
THEY FELT THAT THE PEOPLE-- THEY

06:54.948 --> 06:57.484
COULDN'T TRUST THE LOCAL PEOPLE.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.385
SO THERE DEFINITELY WAS

06:58.385 --> 06:59.719
ANTIGOVERNMENT SENTIMENT THERE.

06:59.719 --> 07:00.720
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE

07:00.720 --> 07:02.122
FEELING AMONG SOME PEOPLE ON THE

07:02.122 --> 07:03.456
GROUND THAT ISIS COULD BE A

07:03.456 --> 07:04.858
VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE SIR

07:04.858 --> 07:06.426
YOON GOVERNMENT?

07:06.426 --> 07:08.862
>> WELL, I ASKED A GUY WHO SAY

07:08.862 --> 07:10.363
LONGTIME ANTIGOVERNMENT ACTIVIST

07:10.363 --> 07:11.264

07:13.133 --> 07:15.201

07:16.403 --> 07:17.871
HE SAID THAT HE WAS REMAINING

07:17.871 --> 07:19.139
OPPOSED TO BOTH ISIS AND THE

07:19.139 --> 07:20.073
GOVERNMENT.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.775
HE SAID, "PEOPLE DON'T REALLY

07:21.775 --> 07:23.009
HAVE A CHOICE.

07:23.009 --> 07:24.077
THEY CAME INTO TOWN AND IT WAS

MAKING THE ISLAMIC STATE'S CASE

07:29.983 --> 07:31.818
FOR THEM?

07:31.818 --> 07:32.986
>> WELL, YES.

07:32.986 --> 07:35.422
PEOPLE WERE VERY AFRAID OF ISIS

07:35.422 --> 07:36.923
WHEN THEY CAME IN, AND THEIR

MAIN FOCUS OF THE EXECUTIONS IN

GOING TO TREAT THE POPULATION

14:20.860 --> 14:22.462
GOING ON NOW IN MEXICO.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.396
>> Reporter: STILL, THERE ARE

14:23.396 --> 14:24.731
HOPES THAT PRESIDENT PENA

14:24.731 --> 14:26.065
NIETO'S GOVERNMENT WILL BE ABLE

14:26.065 --> 14:27.600
TO PUT ITS AMBITIOUS ECONOMIC

14:27.600 --> 14:29.235
REFORMS INTO ACTION FOR THE

14:29.235 --> 14:30.737
ENTIRE ECONOMY.

14:30.737 --> 14:32.038
THOSE REFORMS YOU'RE MENTIONING

14:32.038 --> 14:34.107
HAVE BEEN SIGNED INTO LAW, BUT

14:34.107 --> 14:35.475
HAVE YET FOR THE MOST PART TO BE

14:35.475 --> 14:36.342
IMPLEMENTED.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.210
>> ABSOLUTELY.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.444
>> Reporter: AND THE DISTANCE

14:38.444 --> 14:40.012
FROM SIGNING A PIECE OF PAPER TO

14:40.012 --> 14:42.515
IMPLEMENTING THEM IS A LONG WAY.

14:42.515 --> 14:44.684
>> WELL REFORM IS CHANGE, AND

14:44.684 --> 14:45.952
THERE'S ALWAYS RESISTANCE TO

14:45.952 --> 14:46.919
CHANGE.

14:46.919 --> 14:47.954
>> Reporter: ALREADY THE

14:47.954 --> 14:48.988
TEACHER'S UNION HAS LAUNCHED A

14:48.988 --> 14:50.990
SERIES OF BITTER PROTESTS,

14:50.990 --> 14:52.358
WHILE ANALYSTS, LIKE POLITICAL

14:52.358 --> 14:54.193
SCIENTIST DENISE DRESSER -

14:54.193 --> 14:55.595
BELIEVE THE BILLIONAIRE LEADERS

14:55.595 --> 14:56.929
OF INDUSTRY WILL NOT EASILY GIVE

14:56.929 --> 14:58.564
UP THEIR POWER.

14:58.564 --> 14:59.799
>> WHAT PEÑA NIETO WOULD LIKE TO

14:59.799 --> 15:04.036
SEE IS A MORE COMPETITIVE, LEVEL

15:04.036 --> 15:07.039
PLAYING FIELD FORM OF ECONOMIC

15:07.039 --> 15:08.207
DEVELOPMENT.

15:08.207 --> 15:09.475
BUT THE VESTED INTERESTS ARE

15:09.475 --> 15:10.710
VERY STRONG.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.044
AND THOSE VESTED INTERESTS ARE

15:12.044 --> 15:13.146
NOT GOING TO GIVE UP WITHOUT A

15:13.146 --> 15:14.247
FIGHT.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.181
>> Reporter: CAN PEÑA NIETO

15:15.181 --> 15:16.916
CARRY OUT HIS REFORMS?

15:16.916 --> 15:18.117
WHAT IS SURE IS THAT HE IS

15:18.117 --> 15:19.619
DEFLECTING MEXICO'S NARRATIVE

15:19.619 --> 15:22.054
AWAY FROM THIS, THE DRUG WAR.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.456
TO PARTLY THIS.

15:23.456 --> 15:24.657
>> PEPSI ANNOUNCING PLANS TO

15:24.657 --> 15:28.795
INVEST $5 BILLION IN MEXICO.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.296
FROM DRUGS AND THUGS TO

15:30.296 --> 15:32.131
MANUFACTURING HUBS.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.332
THAT'S THE STORY THE GOVERNMENT

15:33.332 --> 15:34.567
WANTS TO TELL.

15:34.567 --> 15:35.768
AND THERE'S A LOT OF TRUTH IN

15:35.768 --> 15:37.303
THE STORY OF MEXICO'S INDUSTRIAL

15:37.303 --> 15:38.771
GROWTH.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.206
DEMAND FOR MEXICAN-MADE GOODS

15:40.206 --> 15:41.440
HAS HELPED DRIVE THE

15:41.440 --> 15:42.542
MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN THE

15:42.542 --> 15:43.476
COUNTRY.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.677
MEXICO'S TRADE WITH THE UNITED

15:44.677 --> 15:45.978
STATES AMOUNTS TO HALF A

15:45.978 --> 15:47.513
TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR, AND

15:47.513 --> 15:50.183
BOTH SIDES WANT THAT TO GROW.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.617
MEXICO'S ALREADY AMERICA'S THIRD

15:51.617 --> 15:53.419
LARGEST TRADING PARTNER AFTER

15:53.419 --> 15:55.087
CANADA AND CHINA.

15:55.087 --> 15:56.656
AND MEXICO'S ADVANTAGES OVER

15:56.656 --> 15:59.125
CHINA ARE CLEAR-- IT'S CLOSER,

15:59.125 --> 16:01.294
SO HAS LOWER TRANSPORT COSTS.

16:01.294 --> 16:03.196
AND ITS LABOR COSTS ARE STATIC,

16:03.196 --> 16:04.997
WHILE CHINA'S ARE GROWING.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.299
AND IT'S NOT JUST FACTORIES THAT

16:06.299 --> 16:07.767
ARE GROWING HERE.

16:07.767 --> 16:08.835
>> THIS IS JUST HALF OF THE

16:08.835 --> 16:09.869
PROJECT.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.771
BACK IN QUERETARO, ROBERT IBAÑEZ

16:20.246 --> 16:21.781
IN HERE, WE HAVE TWO HOTELS.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.049

16:23.049 --> 16:24.283
COMPANIES RENT SPACE HERE, HALF

16:24.283 --> 16:25.718
FROM OVERSEAS.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.254

16:37.330 --> 16:38.164

16:38.164 --> 16:39.031
THOSE BUILDINGS HAVE ALREADY

16:39.031 --> 16:39.899
BEEN RENTED OUT?

16:39.899 --> 16:41.167
>> THREE.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.902
I ALREADY HAVE THREE RENTED.

16:42.902 --> 16:43.936
>> Reporter: STILL, SKILLED

16:43.936 --> 16:45.204
LABOR IS KEY TO MEXICO'S

16:45.204 --> 16:47.173
CONTINUED GROWTH.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.241
SO QUEREÉTARO'S LEADERS

16:48.241 --> 16:49.542
ESTABLISHED AN AERONAUTICAL

16:49.542 --> 16:51.510

16:58.217 --> 16:59.785
100 GRADUATES A YEAR FIND JOBS

16:59.785 --> 17:01.320
IN MEXICO'S GROWING AVIATION

17:01.320 --> 17:02.622
INDUSTRY.

17:02.622 --> 17:04.023

17:05.491 --> 17:06.893
THIS THE STUDENTS' FIRST EXAM

17:06.893 --> 17:08.928
AFTER THREE WEEKS OF SCHOOL.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.296
THE PLANE SHOULD STAY IN THE AIR

17:10.296 --> 17:13.165
FOR FOUR SECONDS.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.634
IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS, LIKE

THE MEXICAN ECONOMY.

17:28.948 --> 17:29.882

17:29.882 --> 17:30.917
STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALLY

17:30.917 --> 17:32.318
LIFTED ITS DESIGNATION OF CUBA

17:32.318 --> 17:34.520
AS A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.588
IT'S ONE OF THE MANY RECENT

17:35.588 --> 17:36.522
STEPS BY THE OBAMA

17:36.522 --> 17:37.990
ADMINISTRATION TO RE-ESTABLISH

17:37.990 --> 17:39.258
DIPLOMATIC TIES BETWEEN THE

17:39.258 --> 17:40.359
ISLAND NATION AND THE UNITED

17:40.359 --> 17:41.160
STATES.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.194
HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE

17:42.194 --> 17:43.329
IMPLICATIONS OF THAT MOVE IS

17:43.329 --> 17:44.597
CARLA ROBBINS, AN ADJUNCT SENIOR

17:44.597 --> 17:45.698
FELLOW AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN

17:45.698 --> 17:46.565
RELATIONS.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.967
SO, FIRST OF ALL, THIS WAS ON

17:47.967 --> 17:49.635
THE LIST SINCE THE EARLY 80s.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.337
WHAT PUT THEM ON THIS LIST OF

17:51.337 --> 17:52.338
STATE-SPONSORED TERROR IN THE

17:52.338 --> 17:53.306
FIRST PLACE?

17:53.306 --> 17:55.775
>> EXPORTING REVOLUTION, COZY

17:55.775 --> 17:59.745
RELATIONS WITH THE TERRORISTS

17:59.745 --> 18:02.381
AND WE DIDN'T LIKE THEM.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.116
>> AND NOW IF THEY'RE OFF THIS

18:04.116 --> 18:05.718
LIST WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

18:05.718 --> 18:06.786
>> IT MEANS, MORE THAN ANYTHING

18:06.786 --> 18:08.621
ELSE, THAT U.S. BANKS CAN HAVE

18:08.621 --> 18:11.557
RELATIONS WITH CUBAN BANKS,

18:11.557 --> 18:12.825
WHICH WILL MAKE IT MUCH EASIER

18:12.825 --> 18:14.760
TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE EASING

18:14.760 --> 18:17.163
OF FINANCIAL RELATIONS THAT

18:17.163 --> 18:18.664
OBAMA IS PROMOTING, AND THE

18:18.664 --> 18:20.833
CUBANS SAID IT WAS THE BIGGEST

18:20.833 --> 18:23.669
PRECONDITION FOR REESTABLISHING

18:23.669 --> 18:25.037
DIRECT DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS AND

18:25.037 --> 18:26.339
OPENING THE EMBASSIES.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.573
>> Sreenivasan: IN A PRACTICAL

18:27.573 --> 18:29.108
MATTER, THIS MEANS IF A TOURIST

18:29.108 --> 18:31.110
IS VISITING CUBA, THEIR A.T.M.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.412
CARDS OR CREDIT CARDS WILL WORK.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.948
>> THAT'S THE IDEA.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.116
RIGHT NOW, MASTERED CARD IS

18:37.116 --> 18:38.284
THERE.

18:38.284 --> 18:39.251
I BELIEVE AMERICAN EXPRESS IS

18:39.251 --> 18:40.219
THERE.

18:40.219 --> 18:41.220
BUT YOU CAN'T-- THERE'S NO

18:41.220 --> 18:42.455
AMERICAN BANK THAT CAN DO IT

18:42.455 --> 18:44.523
BECAUSE OF FEAR THAT THE

18:44.523 --> 18:45.524
TREASURY DEPARTMENT WILL PUNISH

18:45.524 --> 18:46.392
YOU.

18:46.392 --> 18:47.560
YOU KNOW, THESE TERRORISM LISTS,

18:47.560 --> 18:48.995
PARTICULARLY SINCE 9/11, I MEAN,

18:48.995 --> 18:50.162
U.S. BANKS HAVE BEEN PAYING

18:50.162 --> 18:51.731
VERY, VERY HIGH PENALTIES FOR

18:51.731 --> 18:52.431
IT.

18:52.431 --> 18:54.467
NOW YOU'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.302
MORE THAN ANYTHING, WHILE THE

18:56.302 --> 18:57.570
EMBARGO IS STILL IN PLACE AND

18:57.570 --> 18:58.704
WILL REMAIN IN PLACE FOR A VERY

18:58.704 --> 19:01.674
LONG TIME, I SUSPECT, YOU CAN DO

19:01.674 --> 19:03.843
BUSINESS WITH PRIVATE BUSINESSES

19:03.843 --> 19:05.077
IN CUBA, A VARIETY OF OTHER

19:05.077 --> 19:05.878
TRADE.

19:05.878 --> 19:06.912
WE CAN SELL MEDICINES.

19:06.912 --> 19:07.913
WE CAN SELL AGRICULTURE.

19:07.913 --> 19:08.881
WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT FOR

19:08.881 --> 19:10.182
QUITE A WHILE, BUT THE CUBANS

19:10.182 --> 19:11.617
HAD TO PAY BEFORE.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.419
THEY HAD TO SEND THE MONEY HERE,

19:13.419 --> 19:14.253
COULDN'T DO IT THROUGH AN

19:14.253 --> 19:15.121
AMERICAN BANK.

19:15.121 --> 19:15.855
IT WAS A VERY COMPLICATED

19:15.855 --> 19:16.856
PROCESS.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.257
NOW THEY'LL BE ABLE TO CLEAR

19:18.257 --> 19:19.291
CHECKS IN CUBA AND THAT'S A BIG

19:19.291 --> 19:20.292
DEAL.

19:20.292 --> 19:24.130
THERE WON'T BE A HUGE GOLD RUSH

19:24.130 --> 19:25.998
HERE BUT IT WILL BE EASIER TO DO

19:25.998 --> 19:27.033
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

19:27.033 --> 19:28.067
>> Sreenivasan: YOU POINTED

19:28.067 --> 19:29.502
OUT DISTINCTION THAT THIS DOES

19:29.502 --> 19:31.203
NOT MEAN THE EMBARGO WILL BE

19:31.203 --> 19:36.609
LISTED.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.110
>> THE EMBARGO WAS AN EXECUTIVE

19:38.110 --> 19:40.446
ORDER SINCE KENNEDY ALL THE

19:40.446 --> 19:41.914
WAY THROUGH TO CLINTON.

19:41.914 --> 19:42.882
IT WAS WRITTEN INTO LAW DURING

19:42.882 --> 19:44.016
THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.918
NOT THE BEHEST OF THE WHO IS THE

19:45.918 --> 19:47.420
REPUBLICANS PUSHED THROUGH IT.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.587
AND NOW CONGRESS HAS TO AGREE TO

19:48.587 --> 19:49.455
DO IT.

19:49.455 --> 19:51.724
I WAS UP ON THE HILL AND I WAS

19:51.724 --> 19:53.993
SURPRISED TO SEE NOBODY ON THE

19:53.993 --> 19:55.394
HILL WAS GOING TO MAKE A BIG

19:55.394 --> 19:56.695
FIGHT OVER THE LIFTING OF THE

19:56.695 --> 20:00.399
TERRORISM LIST.

20:00.399 --> 20:01.801
ON THE OTHER HAND, NOBODY IS

20:01.801 --> 20:02.935
GOING TO PUSH VERY HARD TO LIFT

20:02.935 --> 20:04.036
THE EMBARGO.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.204
THIS IS A VERY LONG PROCESS.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.272
>> Sreenivasan: AND THERE ARE

20:06.272 --> 20:07.373
STILL SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS

20:07.373 --> 20:09.175
THE TWO COUNTRIES HAD.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.076
THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAID THAT

20:10.076 --> 20:10.876
YESTERDAY.

20:10.876 --> 20:11.777
THERE ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF

20:11.777 --> 20:12.745
CONGRESS SAYING THAT.

20:12.745 --> 20:13.679
>> HAVING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS

20:13.679 --> 20:15.181
DOESN'T MEAN WE LOVE THEM.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.583
AND THEY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT

20:17.583 --> 20:19.452
GOALS FOR THAT RAPPROCHEMENT.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.253
OBAMA HAS BEEN CLEAR-- HIS GOAL

20:21.253 --> 20:25.191
IS TO PROMOTE DEMOCRATIC CHANGE

20:25.191 --> 20:26.225
IN CUBA.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.327
THE CUBANS' GOAL FOR THIS IS TO

20:28.327 --> 20:30.729
GET ENOUGH COMK BAILOUT SO THEY

20:30.729 --> 20:31.831
CAN MAINTAIN THEIR REPRESSIVE

20:31.831 --> 20:34.900
SOCIETY FOR A LITTLE BIG LONGER.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.001
THE CASTRO BROTHERS ARE VERY

20:36.001 --> 20:37.536
OLD, AND ULTIMATELY CUBA WILL

20:37.536 --> 20:41.340
MOVE TOWARD SOME REFORMS AND AS

20:41.340 --> 20:43.075
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID, AFTER 50

20:43.075 --> 20:44.610
YEARS, IT DIDN'T WORK.

20:44.610 --> 20:46.011
>> Sreenivasan: WHEN THE TWO

20:46.011 --> 20:47.947
COUNTRIES START TO ESTABLISH

20:47.947 --> 20:49.615
EMBASSIES OFFICIALLY IN EACH

20:49.615 --> 20:51.083
OTHER'S COUNTRIES WHAT, ARE THE

20:51.083 --> 20:53.285
KIND OF STEPS WE'LL SEE TOWARDS

20:53.285 --> 20:54.253
THE DIPLOMATIC

20:54.253 --> 20:55.955
NORMALIZATION.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.289
>> THE BIGGEST ISSUE RIGHT NOW--

20:57.289 --> 20:58.991
AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW SOON THE

20:58.991 --> 21:00.593
OPENING COULD COME, THE OFFICIAL

21:00.593 --> 21:02.461
OPENING-- PROBABLY SOONER RATHER

21:02.461 --> 21:03.696
THAN LATER-- THE BIGGEST

21:03.696 --> 21:04.864
QUESTION I THINK IS WHAT THEY'VE

21:04.864 --> 21:06.132
BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH IS THE

21:06.132 --> 21:07.800
CUBANS KEEP SAY, WE DON'T WANT

21:07.800 --> 21:09.335
YOU TO BE USING THE EMBASSY TO

21:09.335 --> 21:10.536
CONTINUE TO DO WHAT YOU'VE BEEN

21:10.536 --> 21:13.172
DOING WHICH IS MEETING WITH

21:13.172 --> 21:14.273
DISSIDENTS AND THE AMERICANS

21:14.273 --> 21:15.307
KEEP SAYING, WHAT ARE YOU

21:15.307 --> 21:16.175
TALKING ABOUT?

21:16.175 --> 21:17.109
WE WANT TO DO THIS."

21:17.109 --> 21:18.144
I HOPE THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION

21:18.144 --> 21:18.978
DOESN'T GIVE UP TOO MUCH ON

21:18.978 --> 21:19.979
THAT.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.547
THEY HAVE BEEN SIGNALING IN

21:21.547 --> 21:22.781
OTHER AUTHORITARIAN SOCIETIES

21:22.781 --> 21:24.150
THERE ARE RESTRICTIONS AND THERE

21:24.150 --> 21:25.084
WILL BE RESTRICTIONS ON THE

21:25.084 --> 21:29.522
CUBANS ITSELF.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.222
>> Sreenivasan: CARLA ROBBINS,

21:30.222 --> 21:32.124
THANKS SO MUCH.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.002
>> Sreenivasan: BEFORE WE

21:43.002 --> 21:44.370
LEAVE YOU TONIGHT, THE PRICE OF

21:44.370 --> 21:46.972
EGGS HAS JUMPED 120% IN THE

21:46.972 --> 21:48.574
MIDWEST WHERE THE AVIAN FLU

21:48.574 --> 21:50.476
EPIDEMIC IS DEVASTATING FARMS.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.044
IN IOWA ALONE, THE DISEASE IS

21:52.044 --> 21:53.445
BLAMED FOR THE DEATHS OF ALMOST

21:53.445 --> 21:54.947
30 MILLION CHICKENS SINCE

21:54.947 --> 21:56.448
MID-DECEMBER.

21:56.448 --> 21:57.516
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVEN

21:57.516 --> 21:58.918
YEARS, AMERICANS SAY THEY'RE

21:58.918 --> 22:01.453
MORE PRO-CHOICE THAN PRO-LIFE.

22:01.453 --> 22:03.222
A NEW GALLUP POLL SHOWS 50% OF

22:03.222 --> 22:04.490
THOSE SURVEYED CONSIDER

22:04.490 --> 22:07.226
THEMSELVES PRO-CHOICE, AND 44%

22:07.226 --> 22:09.228
CONSIDER THEMSELVES PRO-LIFE.

22:09.228 --> 22:10.763
THE BIGGEST SHIFT WAS AMONG

22:10.763 --> 22:12.131
MIDDLE AGED AMERICANS.

22:12.131 --> 22:13.332
THAT'S IT FOR THIS EDITION OF

22:13.332 --> 22:14.233
PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

22:14.233 --> 22:15.301
