10:46.079 --> 10:51.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what's truly been heroic efforts
and as
of tonight the roads are
potentially

10:51.117 --> 10:55.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still cut off access and egress
to
Eureka

10:56.022 --> 11:03.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interstate 44 I went on I W I
will still
cut off we're starting to see
some of

11:03.563 --> 11:08.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the roadways open up a portion
of
highway 109 open up south of
Eureka

11:08.301 --> 11:13.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which will give us access back
to a
large subdivision now there's
some 300

11:13.673 --> 11:20.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Holmes it was cut off so I
think it
won't be long before we're
getting the

11:20.613 --> 11:28.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interstate open the MoDOT is
gonna have
some stuff it open but hopefully
we'll

11:28.588 --> 11:37.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get some path of travel into
roadways
out on the western or just rate
really

11:37.430 --> 11:42.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the past couple days and they're
not
signed in the traffic that they
have

11:42.969 --> 11:50.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been in so no doubt being the
Missouri
Department of Transportation and
the

11:50.710 --> 11:52.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ericsson assessed

11:52.345 --> 11:56.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take us more broadly assess what
the
situation is now in the entire
region

11:56.382 --> 12:01.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right so the American Red Cross
first of
all our hearts just go out to
the

12:01.688 --> 12:06.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
families who lost everything
this
holiday season the Red Cross
we've got a

12:06.059 --> 12:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of shelters that we've
opened up
throughout Missouri as well as
in

12:09.295 --> 12:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Illinois providing residents
just with a
safe place to stay a warm place
we're

12:14.500 --> 12:20.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
providing them with comfort kits
and and
meals and we've got a game area
44 kids

12:20.406 --> 12:23.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of times when you're in a
disaster
situation

12:23.610 --> 12:27.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evacuating very quickly you
forget some
of the essential things that you
need

12:27.480 --> 12:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and so the Red Cross is there we
had a
family the other night that came
in an

12:33.219 --> 12:34.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
older couple in the gentleman

12:34.887 --> 12:39.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
actually didn't have his
dialysis for
that day and so R Red Cross
nurse was

12:39.092 --> 12:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to help get him to that
life-sustaining treatment that
he needed

12:43.363 --> 12:46.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what is the biggest challenge
people who
are literally homeless driven
from their

12:46.933 --> 12:48.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
homes

12:48.201 --> 12:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people who are in need of health
services are people who are just

12:50.737 --> 12:53.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bewildered about what happens
next

12:53.072 --> 12:57.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well you know what it's a little
bit
about all of that because unlike

12:57.810 --> 13:04.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flooding it's very different so
when you
have tornados the tornado comes
in it

13:04.450 --> 13:08.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hits and you know what the
disaster is
in flooding it's so different
because

13:08.354 --> 13:13.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're waiting for the water to
recede
and your families a lot of
stress

13:13.860 --> 13:16.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're waiting to get
back into
their homes they can't yet
because it's

13:16.929 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not safe or they're also waiting
that
possibly their homes could be
flooded

13:21.634 --> 13:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they're in the flood
plain area
so it's just really a lot of
stress and

13:26.973 --> 13:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so they're red cross and are our
priority providing those basic
needs of

13:31.244 --> 13:36.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
food shelter and clothing and
then as
was mentioned then that really
that next

13:36.349 --> 13:40.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
step is starting to recovery in
the
quicker we can get people into
recovery

13:40.820 --> 13:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to start to get back to that
normal
life that's when healing really
starts

13:44.390 --> 13:45.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to start to take place

13:45.858 --> 13:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me ask you and Scott bar as well
starting with you Cindy Erickson
how

13:49.862 --> 13:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
does this compare to other
disasters in
terms of magnitude in this
region you

13:55.802 --> 14:00.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know what this is just been
incredible
you know many have compared it
to the 93

14:00.840 --> 14:06.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flood in for the American Red
Cross it
certainly is a huge disaster
because

14:06.679 --> 14:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's just not in one area it's
in
multiple areas and so the red
cross I

14:11.084 --> 14:16.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mean we plan for disasters 365
days a
year 24 7 over ninety percent of
our

14:16.889 --> 14:20.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workforce are volunteers and so
we're
able to deploy at a moment's
notice so

14:20.927 --> 14:26.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be able to stand up numerous
a dozen
shelters within a couple days is
pretty

14:26.299 --> 14:30.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
remarkable of the community and
the
community's resilience got
bottom is how

14:30.803 --> 14:32.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
does it compare for a small town

14:32.839 --> 14:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a on a big river you know
what we've
been shot we actually are are
just

14:37.243 --> 14:41.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recovered 83 square miles so we
we
actually serve multiple
communities you

14:41.380 --> 14:46.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recall being the main city in
the center
of our history and it is there a

14:46.753 --> 14:52.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
historic flooding in 1982 some
suggest
letting in 2008 but we have not
seen

14:52.592 --> 15:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devastation like this and I
think the
Red Cross saloon others that
this is the

15:00.500 --> 15:02.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
fun event will come to an end

15:02.568 --> 15:08.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recovery effort will last for
weeks
maybe some people years and get
their

15:08.141 --> 15:12.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
business is back up to where
they were
in their homes in the like I
might have

15:12.678 --> 15:16.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to believe you cuz I've got some
of the
things that are pending but we
do

15:16.282 --> 15:21.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appreciate you covering the
story and
and again you know I saw through
the

15:21.120 --> 15:25.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community as they stood up to
this is
where firefighters on the line
that had

15:25.391 --> 15:35.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done some incredible things in
the air
and Scott Barnes thank you very
much

15:35.434 --> 15:41.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done some incredible things in

much

Isis

15:49.415 --> 15:54.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could this be a turning point
and does
represent a model going forward

16:51.777 --> 16:58.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
militias had already scored
their first
major victory in March retaking
the city

16:58.117 --> 17:04.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Tikrit 100 miles north of
Baghdad in
June they drove Isis out of the

Kurdish fighters in the North
retook the
town of censure but the push for
Ramadi

17:11.964 --> 17:16.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
took seven months and though the
city
centre fell on Monday soldiers
are still

told us yesterday it's a
milestone

17:31.083 --> 17:36.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
retaking from idea is it
symbolic sense
that we are telling the world
that you

17:36.322 --> 17:42.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rocky army re taking the
initiative and
that ice is is will be kicked
out of

17:42.061 --> 17:43.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Iraq once and for all

17:43.763 --> 17:47.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how long will it take them to
clear the
city enough that the tens of
thousands

17:47.500 --> 17:51.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who fled the civilians will feel
comfortable returning it will
not be an

17:51.938 --> 17:54.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
overnight way because that would
attract

17:54.073 --> 17:59.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the great deal to create when we
close
it that it took a few few weeks
just

17:59.946 --> 18:04.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make sure that some of the
places are
will be trusted have used
tremendous

18:04.583 --> 18:08.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
using colored ones as well
that's
another issue we are dealing
with an

18:08.254 --> 18:14.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enemy who gather any rule of
engagement
just the same Prime Minister
Hyderabadi

18:14.126 --> 18:20.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
visiting Ramadi this week vowed
to set
his sights on a far larger prize
in the

18:20.066 --> 18:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question Dr Isis known as
dilation
Arabic out of Iraq

18:24.737 --> 18:29.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we will raise the flag and purge
this
land from the last month the
Islamic

18:29.875 --> 18:33.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state we tell the people of
Mosul that
we are coming to liberate you
from day

18:33.913 --> 18:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ash and they will be defeated
and flee
as they were defeated in Ramadi

18:40.753 --> 18:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two hundred and fifty miles
north of
Baghdad had a population of two
million

18:45.191 --> 18:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before I just took it five times
the
size of Ramadi and the largest
city in

18:50.763 --> 18:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the militants control do you
think the
approach that you used in buying
your

18:56.268 --> 19:01.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces with a lot of american
apparel
airpower is that enough of a
model to

19:01.173 --> 19:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Van retake mosul in Ramadi we
focused on
the local tribes

19:05.378 --> 19:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our counterterrorism forces and
strong
cooperation of the other sources
in

19:11.250 --> 19:16.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
relation to the supremacy of the
air we
need to carry on with such a
model in

19:16.689 --> 19:22.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retaking of them however we also
have
the Kurdish partners of ours we
have the

19:22.828 --> 19:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tribe's we have local as well as
the
government and as well as
anybody would

19:28.200 --> 19:32.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like to contribute including the
allies
and really taking a liberating
of

19:32.471 --> 19:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
partial that's the biggest
project
that's a much bigger project a
different

19:36.609 --> 19:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take come from Jim Jefferies us'
ambassador to Iraq from 2010 to
2012 he

19:42.415 --> 19:48.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says romani is a significant
victory but
not a guarantee of future
success to

19:48.054 --> 19:52.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what degree did the way Ramadi
was
retaken which was using the
Iraqi army

19:52.258 --> 19:58.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trained by the united states
backed up
by a lot of us' bombing offer a
model

19:58.898 --> 20:03.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for taking the much larger city
of Mosul
it offers a model with several

20:03.502 --> 20:05.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
exceptions first of all in

20:05.104 --> 20:09.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run by province in Ramadi we
have a lot
of Sunni police Sunni members of
the

20:09.742 --> 20:14.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
military and Sunni Arab tribes
fighting
along with us that is not going
to be

20:14.747 --> 20:19.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the case up in Mosul to the same
degree
Moses bigger Isis will fight
harder for

20:19.485 --> 20:21.053 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it

20:21.087 --> 20:24.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the USS gonna have to put a lot
more
ground forces and a lot more
firepower

20:24.890 --> 20:29.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the scene in order to take
that down
anytime in the near future

20:29.895 --> 20:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ethical actually take american
quote

were going into combat that

20:41.674 --> 20:46.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trained in at least some

we call maneuver battalions to

not

21:12.805 --> 21:17.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

again ambassador failing you
don't think

21:17.810 --> 21:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need that we think it might
be easier
for us to say yes at this moment
but it

21:23.149 --> 21:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would cost more than the cost
political
regional and domestic tourists
and we

21:28.721 --> 21:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were very worried about that and
we're
very clear on the nuances of it

21:32.658 --> 21:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reclaiming the whole of Iraq
also hinges
on whether the country's

21:36.228 --> 21:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shiite-dominated government can
bring
together its rival ethnic groups

disappear
iraq will not remain united if
you

22:22.174 --> 22:26.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cannot find a way to reach out
to the
Sunni Arabs and Kurds anything
doesn't

22:26.312 --> 22:31.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take that advice this is going
to be a
long difficult struggle the end
of the

22:31.617 --> 22:38.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day we face the specter of a
Sunni Shia
cataclysm in the entire region
if we get

22:38.257 --> 22:43.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this one it's that serious at
this point
for his part and master failing
insisted

22:43.229 --> 22:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his government has gotten the
message we
already decentralized thing in a
lot of

22:47.766 --> 22:51.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues we have already learned
we will
carry on doing that model that's

22:51.503 --> 22:56.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
workable model porous but at the
same
time we need to be clear
everybody have

22:56.075 --> 23:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to pull their weights la also
argues
that a body facing a parliament
with

23:00.879 --> 23:07.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many uncompromising shiite
figures as a

his best is pulling all the

account is East has a sense of
urgency

23:11.090 --> 23:16.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in addressing this reform and
others as
well I think others need to
understand

23:16.295 --> 23:19.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that and I think they need to be
fair
enough what they are asking the
prime

tonight we thought it made sense
to take

knit a better organized creative

really try

to focus a little more save more
money
actually gonna work harder and
harder to

24:31.804 --> 24:39.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do this so new year's
resolutions people
make them and just about as
often they

24:39.078 --> 24:44.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
break why because they are
formulated in
a way that the general good
intentions

24:44.083 --> 24:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but it's not a plan if there's a

the book is based on half a
century of
research by Michelle and others
began

25:08.774 --> 25:13.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a simple experiment now
among the
most famous and replicated in
the

25:13.746 --> 25:18.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history of psychology as a

can either wait and I'll bring
you back

25:18.650 --> 25:20.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not over do it now

25:20.986 --> 25:24.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michelle ran this self control

25:48.113 --> 25:53.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Michelle found that the
successful self
deniers have a pretty simple
strategy

25:53.352 --> 25:58.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which is they transform an
impossibly
difficult situation into a
relatively

25:58.424 --> 26:03.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
easy one by distracting
themselves by
turning around by putting the

do it by

may no longer work so if I have
a new
year's resolution to drink a
little less

27:17.402 --> 27:26.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than I do what I do why do you
need is a
plan that says at the end of the
day I

blog is the time that I am

have a drink I have to have a
substitute

27:33.685 --> 27:37.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

will be
an alternative and it'll be very
very

27:37.589 --> 27:41.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

27:59.011 --> 28:00.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just to be safe

28:00.412 --> 28:03.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the idea that the charge that
most

restaurant kitchen may have had
a
cockroach happy little break the

28:06.985 --> 28:11.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standard first behavioral
economist Dean
Karlan has pioneered a different

28:11.557 --> 28:17.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach to a fancy restaurant
with some
friends I know I've had my wine
when

28:17.696 --> 28:21.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there's a new console order
dessert even
if I swear I wasn't going to
offer an

28:21.133 --> 28:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alternative my friend and as
they will
find yes let's get the wine but
if I eat

28:27.773 --> 28:34.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dessert then I $1 carlin first
became
involved with such so-called
commitment

28:34.479 --> 28:39.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
contracts in grad school
researching
them even making one with a
friend who

28:39.585 --> 28:44.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like arlen wanted to lose weight
and
keep it off the contractors for
$10,000

28:44.823 --> 28:49.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point was to make it for a lot
of money
that would be really really
painful to

28:49.528 --> 28:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
write that track how much do I
lost 40
pounds growing out of that
experience

28:55.634 --> 29:01.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
carlin co-founded a website
called stick
in part

29:01.039 --> 29:06.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for its distinctly 9 carat like
approach
to helping people reach their
goals if

29:06.578 --> 29:10.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you put monitors takes up then
you can
have it so that your money goes
to say a

29:10.415 --> 29:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
friend who's gonna hold you
accountable
or one of the more popular
options of

29:14.252 --> 29:18.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the anti charity now the money
goes to
something that you hate the NRA

29:18.557 --> 29:22.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foundation is one of the most
popular
causes the people don't like and
use on

29:22.160 --> 29:26.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this site the National Rifle the
national deficit we also have
super PACs

29:26.264 --> 29:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both left and right and those
are very
popular because they can tackle
the

29:29.201 --> 29:32.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues all in one bundle keep in
mind
that they would have to be some

29:32.437 --> 29:38.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reporting of the failure then
the money
goes to some truly odious cause
I mean

29:38.176 --> 29:41.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
odious committees to you that's
a key
part and the other point that
also is

29:41.313 --> 29:44.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very popular in value very
effective for
people is not the monetary part
because

29:44.916 --> 29:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the public aspect of it so you
have to
admit that you failed on
Facebook or

29:49.254 --> 29:55.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twitter but why do I resolutions
so
often fail because humans like
you and

29:55.994 --> 30:02.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me and Walter Mischel both of us
former
smokers temporarily discount
valuing

30:02.534 --> 30:07.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immediate rewards much more than
those
in the future so if it's not now
it's

30:08.006 --> 30:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
essentially never because the
future for
example the cancer that I could
get if I

30:13.645 --> 30:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kept smoking is probably still
it's it's
distant we don't know for sure
and so it

30:20.052 --> 30:24.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might as well not be there
unless I do
something that makes the faraway

31:14.506 --> 31:21.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way to have control is by
transforming
what the stimulus means but of
course

31:21.480 --> 31:25.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
everything follows from making
that
resolution in the first place

31:25.684 --> 31:30.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
starts the conversation about
trying to
change something you have to
really want

31:30.255 --> 31:36.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to because you're taking that
late goal
to live longer to live healthier
to have

31:36.728 --> 31:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retirement funds when you need
them
rather than to not have them it
is what

31:42.267 --> 31:46.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we want and how we think about
what we
want that controls the regulates
what

31:46.705 --> 31:52.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're able to do paul Solman
reporting
for the PBS Newshour from
hopefully the

31:52.911 --> 32:04.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
land of self-control

32:04.923 --> 32:10.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have you seen any good movies
lately for
our end of the year review we
passed a

32:10.962 --> 32:13.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
couple of film critics to ponder
just
that question

32:13.865 --> 32:18.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
jeffrey Brown has our look for
our quick
walk through the year in films
were

32:18.703 --> 32:22.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
joined by film critics and where
today
of the washington post and Mike
surgent

32:22.908 --> 32:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Pacifica Radio and welcome to
both of
you not your top 10 or top five
we made

32:29.147 --> 32:35.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you pick one to start either
best or
favorite and you chose to
spotlight as

32:35.687 --> 32:41.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my number one movie of the year
well
full disclosure it happens to
feature my

32:41.293 --> 32:46.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boss I have to get that out of
the way
but even if it didn't even if I
didn't

32:46.064 --> 32:49.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happen to know one of the people
portrayed in this film I would
have

32:49.434 --> 32:53.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chosen it this is the story of
the
Boston Globe's investigation
into sexual

32:53.438 --> 32:59.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
abuse within the Catholic Church
that
they did in 2001 2002 and is a

32:59.511 --> 33:04.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dramatization of the reportorial
process
is just an exquisite piece of
kind of

33:04.916 --> 33:10.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
shoe leather journalism
filmmaking about
shoe leather journalism all
fashion and

33:10.689 --> 33:15.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what I've said in the past is
it's
really legacy filmmaking about
legacy

33:15.093 --> 33:18.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
journalism because it really
does sort
of marker return to some very
solid

33:18.296 --> 33:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fundamental values of narrative
filmmaking ok we've got a short
clip of

33:21.833 --> 33:24.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that lets take a look

33:24.402 --> 33:31.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
like that that's why the
reaction senior
there are others I think that's
the

33:31.943 --> 33:36.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bigger story the numbers clearly
indicate that there was a senior
so all

33:36.948 --> 33:43.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they do is start with fifty
pedophile
priests involved again to the
same

33:43.188 --> 33:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
catfight you got into on Porter
which
made a lot of noise but change
things

33:47.626 --> 33:49.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not one bit

33:49.227 --> 33:57.269 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
we need to focus on the
institution the
individual priests practice and
policy

33:57.302 --> 34:01.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show me the church manipulate
the system
so these guys would have to face
charges

34:01.473 --> 34:06.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show me they put those same
priests back
into parishes time and time
again show

34:06.144 --> 34:10.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me this was that it came from
the top
down

34:10.148 --> 34:16.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wonderful actors understated
film very
yes it's just a superb exercise
in

34:16.655 --> 34:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
restraint on almost every level

34:19.024 --> 34:24.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
written and directed by Tom
McCarthy who
is just a fantastic filmmaker
and just

34:24.396 --> 34:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his choices throughout this film
are at
spot on in terms of never really
put in

34:28.800 --> 34:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
too much spin on the ball there
are no
kind of billboard scenes telling
the

34:33.338 --> 34:39.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
audience how to seal is just a
very slow
burn very scrupulous Lee
restrained

34:39.811 --> 34:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ensemble piece and that's the
other
reason why I love it is it is a
true

34:43.348 --> 34:48.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ensemble piece redo see these
fantastic
actors really subsumed in their
own ego

34:48.153 --> 34:53.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you know desire for the
spotlight
and working as a real team
sergeant so

34:53.391 --> 34:58.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you chose a very different kind
of film
writers sci-fi film ex machina
tell us

34:58.196 --> 34:59.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about it will take a look

34:59.965 --> 35:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well I told because of course I
love
genre films in this is does what
I think

35:04.602 --> 35:08.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
best science fiction does where
it says
something that say about the
human

35:08.039 --> 35:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
experience and there's a film
about it
inventor who creates essentially
an AI

35:12.644 --> 35:17.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the form of a female robot
and it
stars Alicia vikander and Oscar
Isaac

35:17.482 --> 35:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Domhnall Gleeson both da
mortgage
and and Oscar Isaac also in the
new Star

35:22.320 --> 35:23.855 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wars movies well-adjusted

35:23.888 --> 35:28.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but it's a really really
interesting
study in human nature what it is
to be

35:28.693 --> 35:33.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
human you know where do we draw
the line
and it's got fantastic
performances is a

35:34.032 --> 35:38.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
film that not enough people so
as well I
think I let's take a quick look
at that

35:38.136 --> 35:47.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happened to me perfectly

35:47.812 --> 35:52.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you think I might be switched
off
because I don't function as far
as i'm

35:52.183 --> 35:53.818 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
supposed to

35:53.852 --> 36:00.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know the answer to your
question
it's not up to me why is it up
to anyone

36:00.392 --> 36:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do you have people know what is
it to be
human rights who's the human use
the

36:12.337 --> 36:16.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
robot is what is it to be
definitely end
you know one of the things I
loved about

36:16.408 --> 36:21.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it was it's it's it's a morality
play it
deals with the application of
women it's

36:21.446 --> 36:25.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just so many issues and tell me
things
it deals with the internet
things about

36:25.917 --> 36:29.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us being known that we don't
even
realize we're giving out
information

36:29.254 --> 36:34.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system really probably the most
one of
the most thoughtful piece i've
seen this

36:34.559 --> 36:36.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year

36:36.161 --> 36:39.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ok so I next category for both
of you
was best a great performance and
and you

36:39.964 --> 36:47.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
picked on in in Brooklyn yes
indeed
let's look at a clip of that
first then

36:47.138 --> 36:53.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you can tell us about ok this is
her as
a young Irish woman falling for
tough

36:53.845 --> 36:59.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Italian kid

36:59.484 --> 37:06.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't the Italians have done so
and I
wouldn't want to take you to 10
p.m.

37:06.391 --> 37:12.831 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like Italians on what does that
mean

37:12.864 --> 37:24.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too many of them just because
you know
where he lives and listen

37:24.876 --> 37:33.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I came to the Irish stands
because I'm
really like Irish girls and I
was the

37:33.384 --> 37:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
only one who dumps it wasn't a
new actor
who you are or breakout I
performance

37:48.266 --> 37:52.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what would you do that well is
definitely a breakout
performance for

37:52.070 --> 37:57.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her I had seen her before she
was in Joe
Wright's movie atonement the
adaptation

37:57.709 --> 38:00.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the novel I think that was
probably
the first time that she came to
my

38:00.912 --> 38:04.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attention I've been a fan ever
since but
this is just truly a
transcendent

38:04.949 --> 38:10.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
performance for her as this
young Irish
women coming to America and it's
it's

38:10.522 --> 38:15.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
similar to spotlight its really
very
restrained it's a little old
fashioned

38:15.126 --> 38:19.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not eg there's not an ounce
of
cynicism in it but there's also
not

38:19.397 --> 38:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announcing cheap sentiment in it
either
in the way that she holds the
camera and

38:24.068 --> 38:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hold the audience's attention as
this
young woman who's sort of
transforming

38:28.173 --> 38:33.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before our eyes from a young
country
girl to a woman of the city in
an

38:33.244 --> 38:38.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American and a woman of the
future it's
all there in her face I mean
it's an

38:38.283 --> 38:43.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
extraordinary physical
performance you
became quiet films for us maybe
it's

38:43.188 --> 38:50.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just getting old like you chose
to you
judge Tom Hardy who was into
films right

38:50.261 --> 38:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to great performances legend
actually he
was in 33 growth ok well tell me
I know

38:56.134 --> 39:01.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
legend in the revenue yeah ok he
was in
he was in the revenue but he was
also in

39:01.172 --> 39:03.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mad Max which was also great fun
this
year

39:03.174 --> 39:07.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ok well let's start with that we
got a
little clip from legend and this
is

39:07.111 --> 39:11.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where he plays he's playing both
of the
famous criminal twins the Kray
brothers

39:11.449 --> 39:21.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you had a piece in mind you
actually
very much the big boy we're
talking

39:21.492 --> 39:27.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about any living I will talk
about be
gangsters walk which is what we
are you

39:27.565 --> 39:34.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of these days from your
miserable
life will swallow you whole so
Mike tell

39:34.072 --> 39:38.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us about Tom Hardy you like him
well Tom
Hardy time artist and actor who
i think

39:38.943 --> 39:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really kind of coming into
his own
he's got a lot of roles and we
first saw

39:42.247 --> 39:47.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him in Inception and he kind of
stole
the picture away from the United
capital

39:47.652 --> 39:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but this film like you said he
plays
both the Kray brothers one is a

39:50.922 --> 39:55.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
soft-spoken kind of a gentleman
the
other one is a brutal you know
killer

39:55.960 --> 40:01.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one street and the other was
homosexual
it really creates two very
separate

40:01.132 --> 40:04.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
characters you completely
believe that
there are just two people in the
world

40:04.969 --> 40:08.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his accent there a lot of
times
where you almost can't
understand

40:08.439 --> 40:12.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because got such a thick accent
coming
from the part of England he did
but I

40:12.877 --> 40:17.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to say his performances
it's just
it's mesmerizing and he's in a
very the

40:17.548 --> 40:21.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
force of nature i think im
already and
he's he's going to be winning an
Oscar

40:21.686 --> 40:25.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sometime soon I want it we got
one more
category my collect you start
this one

40:25.990 --> 40:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is the sort of under
appreciated in
the film you'd really like to
tell

40:30.828 --> 40:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people about that they really
should see
that they might have missed
while the

40:34.799 --> 40:38.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
film I really like this and
again these
these are my taste so i cant say
that

40:38.603 --> 40:42.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a form of my favorite films
of the
year I don't know if it's the
best was

40:42.340 --> 40:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my favorite at the film I think
people
should see age of Adeline and it
stars

40:46.044 --> 40:51.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Blake Lively but about a woman
who
accidentally is given the
ability to not

40:51.282 --> 40:57.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
age it's also got a great
performance
from Harrison Ford who I think
you

40:57.088 --> 40:58.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really sells it

40:58.723 --> 41:03.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is a really really well
done films
the film that easily could have
fallen

41:03.161 --> 41:07.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
apart many times before me kept
an
internal logic I cared about the

41:07.598 --> 41:11.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
characters the performances were
great
knows every Blake Lively fan to
begin

41:11.436 --> 41:15.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with but I thought this was a
really
really good film and and what's
your

41:15.440 --> 41:19.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
under-appreciated film of the
year my
underappreciated film is love
and mercy

41:19.944 --> 41:25.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a beautiful film about
Brian Wilson

things that comes up with people
who are

48:37.982 --> 48:41.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immensely successful but what
they
choose is what brought about the

you
