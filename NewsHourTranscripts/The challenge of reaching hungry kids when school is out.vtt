JUDY WOODRUFF: For American
children, summer is supposed
to be a time of fun and games,

00:04.733 --> 00:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but, for many, it is
also a time of true need.

00:08.033 --> 00:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the school year,
roughly 22 million children
in this country get
free and reduced-price

00:13.800 --> 00:15.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lunch.

00:15.233 --> 00:17.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the summer, those
numbers drop dramatically.

00:17.766 --> 00:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Just under four million have
access to subsidized meals.

00:21.400 --> 00:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are 50,000 locations
providing summer meals, but
reaching those who need the food

00:27.133 --> 00:29.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be a challenge.

00:29.200 --> 00:33.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special PBS correspondent Lisa
Stark of our partner Education
Week traveled to Nebraska

00:35.066 --> 00:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to see how one food bank
is trying to fill the gap.

00:38.733 --> 00:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: It's a scorching
summer day in Plattsmouth,
Nebraska, about 40 minutes south

00:45.333 --> 00:49.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Omaha, as the food
truck lumbers into view.

00:49.466 --> 00:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite the heat, families are
lining up for lunch at what's
called Kids Cruisin' Kitchen.

00:54.433 --> 00:56.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BECKY HAM, Parent:
They get milk.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They get fruit and vegetables.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's really a nice program.

01:00.966 --> 01:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Becky Ham and
her children rely on the food
truck a few times a week.

01:04.633 --> 01:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BECKY HAM: We started doing this
about three summers ago when
my husband lost his job right

01:08.633 --> 01:10.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before the end of
the school year.

01:10.833 --> 01:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we were really panicked
about how we were going
to make everything work.

01:15.300 --> 01:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Ham's husband
has a new job, but the
budget remains tight.

01:19.933 --> 01:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The family still qualifies for
free school lunches, and is
thankful for the summer help.

01:24.933 --> 01:27.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
BECKY HAM: It's really
helping kids out.

01:27.133 --> 01:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's really helping families
out when they need it.

01:29.866 --> 01:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Kids Cruisin'
Kitchen was launched six years
ago by Omaha's Food Bank for the

01:34.233 --> 01:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Heartland and Salvation Army.

01:36.666 --> 01:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With four food trucks and
10 fixed locations, it
serves 1,300 children a day.

01:42.866 --> 01:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Do you get enough to
eat at the food truck?

01:46.033 --> 01:49.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHILD: ÑMD-ULÑ They
give us a lot of meals.

01:49.766 --> 01:52.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: A lot of
meals and a lot of food?

01:52.166 --> 01:53.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHILD: ÑMD-ULÑ Yes.

01:53.166 --> 01:54.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
LISA STARK: Yes?

01:54.466 --> 01:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Susan Ogborn is the
food bank president.

01:55.433 --> 01:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who are you trying to help?

01:56.966 --> 01:59.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who's your target here
for the summer meals?

01:59.000 --> 02:00.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN OGBORN, President,
Food Bank for the Heartland:
Primarily, the children of the

02:00.500 --> 02:02.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
working poor.

02:02.033 --> 02:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are the folks who won't
tell you that they need help.

02:05.100 --> 02:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are the folks whose
children qualify for free
or reduced price-lunches.

02:09.233 --> 02:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Preparing
these meals begins early
in the morning in an
industrial kitchen run

02:15.166 --> 02:17.200 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
by an Omaha area
school district.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They make meals for Kids
Cruisin' Kitchen and other
summer meal programs.

02:21.033 --> 02:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE CAMBRIDGE, Meal Service
Manager: We do about 3,000
meals a day during the summer.

02:24.333 --> 02:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: In less than three
hours on this morning, corn
dogs are cooked, bananas packed,

02:31.233 --> 02:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
chocolate milk readied, sack
lunches bagged, chicken patties,
fruit and veggies prepped

02:35.166 --> 02:36.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for later in the week.

02:36.433 --> 02:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JACKIE CAMBRIDGE: It's
the five food groups.

02:37.633 --> 02:40.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's grains, meat,
fruit, vegetables, milk.

02:40.866 --> 02:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Meals are paid
for by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, $3.83 each, and

02:47.766 --> 02:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
must meet government nutrition
standards, which are a
bit looser in the summer.

02:53.866 --> 02:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jackie Cambridge manages
this summer meal service.

02:55.866 --> 03:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACKIE CAMBRIDGE: There's
always a whew when we
get it out the door.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then we just hope that
it's getting to kids in need,
and that they're enjoying it,

03:06.300 --> 03:08.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and we do it all
again the next day.

03:08.300 --> 03:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Shortly after 9:00
a.m., the Kids Cruisin' Kitchen
truck pulls up to load its

03:13.900 --> 03:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
food, hot meals to go.

03:15.933 --> 03:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The truck makes four
stops each weekday during
most of the summer break.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After that first stop
in Plattsmouth, it's
off to a public library,
followed by a public

03:24.633 --> 03:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
housing project, then onto an
affordable housing development,
areas where more than half of

03:31.600 --> 03:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
children quality for free
and reduced-price lunch,
although anyone is welcome.

03:36.133 --> 03:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHILD: You got corn dogs today?

03:40.600 --> 03:42.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Bananas.

03:42.666 --> 03:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Summer lunches
are an outgrowth of subsidized
school lunches, which expanded

03:46.300 --> 03:48.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the 1960s.

03:48.266 --> 03:51.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: A good lunch provides
from a third to one-half of
the student's daily needs.

03:51.866 --> 03:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: As part of President
Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty.

03:55.033 --> 04:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LYNDON JOHNSON, Former President
of the United States: Children
just must not go hungry.

04:01.266 --> 04:03.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: The programs
have grown enormously.

04:03.366 --> 04:08.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, 85 percent of all
breakfasts served at schools
and 73 percent of school lunches

04:10.333 --> 04:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are subsidized by the USDA;
12 million students depend on
breakfast, 22 million on lunch.

04:16.533 --> 04:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nationwide, nearly 20
percent of children under
age 18 live in poverty.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's 14.5 million children.

04:24.400 --> 04:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA HATCH, No Kid Hungry:
Sometimes, schools are providing
the only meals that kids get

04:28.300 --> 04:30.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
during the week.

04:30.300 --> 04:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Laura Hatch is
With No Kid Hungry, a national
advocacy group trying to reduce

04:35.033 --> 04:36.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
childhood hunger.

04:36.300 --> 04:38.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She says school meals
make a big difference.

04:38.366 --> 04:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LAURA HATCH: We know that
kids that eat breakfast
do better on math tests.

04:42.433 --> 04:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know that serving breakfast
as part of the school day can
actually keep kids in their

04:47.333 --> 04:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seat and lessen absenteeism.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA STARK: Serving
school meals is easier.

04:52.433 --> 04:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Students are all in one place.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Summer meals are tougher.

04:55.600 --> 04:58.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The food has to get to
where the children are.

04:58.200 --> 05:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To make it work, the food bank
hires 10 temporary staffers, and
relies on 200 volunteers from

05:04.300 --> 05:06.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Mutual of Omaha.

05:06.033 --> 05:08.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is Gary Hering's
third year helping out.

05:08.733 --> 05:10.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He understands hunger.

05:10.866 --> 05:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY HERING, Volunteer: There
were times when, as a family,
I know we struggled, and we'd

05:13.333 --> 05:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go visit relatives just to eat,
you know, have food every day.

05:16.300 --> 05:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA STARK: Do you think that's
true for some of these kids?

05:18.466 --> 05:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Or what do you think?

05:19.466 --> 05:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY HERING: You bet.

05:21.566 --> 05:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the best part about it
today, that these kids aren't
going to be hungry at lunch.

05:23.700 --> 05:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Despite all this
effort by the food bank and
others, Nebraska ranks near

05:27.800 --> 05:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the bottom of all 50 states
when it comes to summer meals.

05:31.900 --> 05:36.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For every 100 children
who depend on the school
lunch program, only
eight are getting help

05:38.166 --> 05:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
during the summer.

05:40.966 --> 05:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's according to the Food
Research and Action Network,
which found that, last year,

05:45.266 --> 05:50.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nationwide, that gap between
filling the need during the
school year and the summer got

05:50.733 --> 05:52.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wider.

05:52.233 --> 05:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's especially difficult to
reach children in rural areas.

05:54.966 --> 05:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are spread out, and USDA
rules require all summer meals
to be served and eaten in

06:00.766 --> 06:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one place at one time.

06:03.066 --> 06:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: You guys going to
eat it over here today, OK?

06:05.800 --> 06:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: Regulars, like
Michelle Brown and her sisters,
are well aware of the rules.

06:09.533 --> 06:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHILD: You just have to,
like, eat here, and you
have to come on time.

06:13.300 --> 06:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: USDA has a pilot
program in seven states and two
tribal areas to help families

06:20.300 --> 06:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in need during the summer
by temporarily increasing
food stamps benefits.

06:25.633 --> 06:29.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Advocates would like this
program offered more widely.

06:29.633 --> 06:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Agriculture Secretary Sonny
Perdue, who recently visited a
summer meal site in Washington,

06:35.800 --> 06:37.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
D.C., says he's
open to the idea.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SONNY PERDUE, U.S. Agriculture
Secretary: I don't think
any of us want to fast over

06:39.833 --> 06:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the summer, so just because
school stops doesn't mean that
the needs for good, nutritious,

06:45.733 --> 06:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
healthy food and a good
environment doesn't stop.

06:47.800 --> 06:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: The food bank's
Susan Ogborn is eager to see
regulations relaxed to make it

06:53.500 --> 06:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
easier to expand summer meals.

06:55.033 --> 06:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SUSAN OGBORN: The problem is,
children are hungry every day.

06:57.700 --> 07:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we hope that Secretary
Perdue and the rest of his team
at USDA get their rules and

07:04.533 --> 07:06.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
regulations figured
out pretty quickly.

07:06.633 --> 07:11.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA STARK: For now, the food
bank will continue to roll along
with its current program, hoping

07:13.500 --> 07:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one day to reach many more
children, but committed
to the mostly satisfied
customers it already

07:18.333 --> 07:19.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
has.

07:19.533 --> 07:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you think
about the food truck?

07:21.066 --> 07:25.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHILD: I like it, but I would
love it if they added donuts.

07:26.566 --> 07:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA STARK: Maybe next summer.

07:29.000 --> 07:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Education Week, I'm Lisa
Stark in Omaha, Nebraska.

07:35.200 --> 07:36.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We
love donuts, too.
