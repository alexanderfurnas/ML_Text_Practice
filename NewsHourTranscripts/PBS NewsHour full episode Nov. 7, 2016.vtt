Donald Trump and

01:14.041 --> 01:16.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton are campaigning
late into
the night.

01:16.944 --> 01:22.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their final blitz came as a last
round of
national polls gave Clinton a
lead of three

01:22.149 --> 01:23.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

She accused him of worsening the
country's
divisions.

strange trip
to Election Day.

02:10.998 --> 02:16.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just yesterday, FBI Director
James Comey lifted
the cloud he placed over
Clinton's campaign

02:16.737 --> 02:18.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and her handling of classified

with NBA superstar LeBron James
of the champion
Cleveland Cavaliers.

02:32.586 --> 02:36.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

second visit to
Cleveland in three days.

02:42.095 --> 02:46.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This weekend, she followed an
itinerary set
by polling results and the math
of getting

02:46.600 --> 02:47.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to 270 electoral votes.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

this a hearty
group.

02:50.570 --> 02:53.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Rain or shine, you're ready.

Manchester, New Hampshire.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Her path circled back to
Cleveland.

03:18.732 --> 03:25.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The swing state of Ohio is again
a key battleground,
and this city is the Democrats'
beachhead.

03:25.272 --> 03:29.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This weekend, a new poll showed
the race in
Ohio a dead heat.

03:29.109 --> 03:31.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Yes, I'm worried.

03:31.578 --> 03:33.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I weren't worried, I wouldn't
be here in
Ohio.

03:33.747 --> 03:37.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: I do lose sleep over this
at night.

03:37.350 --> 03:38.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

JOHN YANG: Cindy Demsey is chair
of the Cuyahoga
County Democratic Women's
Caucus.

03:43.023 --> 03:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why is the vote here in Cuyahoga
County so
important for Democrats?

03:46.293 --> 03:48.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CINDY DEMSEY, Chair, Cuyahoga
County Democratic
Women's Caucus: So, Cuyahoga
County is the

03:48.295 --> 03:50.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
densest population of Democrats.

03:50.964 --> 03:56.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what we need to get all of
our Democrat
votes in to compensate for the
rest of the

03:56.470 --> 03:57.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
state.

03:57.504 --> 03:59.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Without that, Hillary
cannot take Ohio.

03:59.372 --> 04:05.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That explains the
frenetic activity
at the campaign's office in
Shaker Square.

04:05.545 --> 04:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among the volunteers being

who lives in

04:11.585 --> 04:13.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Rochester, New York.

04:13.220 --> 04:16.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why come from New York to
Cleveland, Ohio,
to canvass for Hillary?

04:16.823 --> 04:20.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONNA STERN, Clinton Volunteer:
Well, New
York state is not one of the
swing states.

04:20.193 --> 04:25.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we decided we need to come to
Ohio to help
swing some votes here for Ohio.

04:25.332 --> 04:31.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In every presidential
election
since 2008, Stern's come to Ohio
to talk to

04:31.538 --> 04:32.906 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONNA STERN: We are willing to
travel four
hours for your state.

04:35.375 --> 04:40.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's -- you know, that's
important to
say, you know, and to vote.

04:40.180 --> 04:44.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Ain't no party like the
Democratic
Party, because the Democratic
Party don't

04:44.951 --> 04:45.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stop.

04:45.952 --> 04:47.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: The goal?

04:47.787 --> 04:50.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Get people to the Cuyahoga
County Board of
Elections, where early vote
ballots were cast

04:50.423 --> 04:51.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all weekend.

04:51.424 --> 04:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Please have patience.

04:52.826 --> 04:56.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

quickly and
as smoothly as possible.

04:56.796 --> 05:02.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Taking a page from
President Obama's
2012 reelection, the Clinton
campaign is trying

05:02.502 --> 05:08.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to build a firewall of early
votes in key
states like Ohio, seeking to
roll up a big

05:08.508 --> 05:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lead even before polls open on
Election Day.

05:11.912 --> 05:12.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

I got a chance to participate in
the democratic
process.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: What's more important
than doing this?

05:20.687 --> 05:24.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A sign of potential
trouble for
Clinton in Ohio?

05:25.025 --> 05:29.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Including this weekend, early
voting in Cleveland
is behind 2012.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One early voter was Clara
Parrish.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this your first time?

05:32.566 --> 05:33.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CLARA PARRISH, Ohio: Voting
early?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.368 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

05:35.402 --> 05:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And it was because of
the calls
and the urgings from one -- from
the Democratic

05:39.806 --> 05:40.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign?

05:40.807 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CLARA PARRISH: Correct.

05:42.042 --> 05:48.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The campaign even
enlisted Jay-Z
and Beyonce.

Elections, where

06:00.660 --> 06:03.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people were encouraged to vote
early.

06:03.129 --> 06:07.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The concert was intended to
energize two of
the voting blocs campaign
officials say are

06:07.867 --> 06:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crucial to Clinton's potential
success: African-Americans
and millennials.

06:11.271 --> 06:14.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOE SIMS, Ohio: I have always
been Democratic.

06:14.074 --> 06:17.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Win or lose, I will be a
Democrat all my life.

06:17.410 --> 06:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The black vote is
especially important
in Cleveland, which is about 53
percent African-American.

06:23.683 --> 06:29.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Sunday services at the Olivet

JAWANZA COLVIN, Institutional

It's in our hands to decide who
is going to

06:34.794 --> 06:35.762 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
win on Tuesday.

06:35.795 --> 06:36.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's in our hands.

06:36.796 --> 06:41.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are going to vote on Tuesday.

06:41.401 --> 06:53.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to make sure
that every black
person we know votes.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Somebody say amen.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We always do our jobs.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Black churches don't
just talk
the talk.

06:57.384 --> 07:00.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They walk the walk, picking up
worshipers
from services to take them to
early voting,

07:00.987 --> 07:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a program they call Souls to the

WOMAN: Do you want to help us
stop Donald
Trump?

07:06.059 --> 07:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Amid concerns about
African-American
turnout, millennials could give
Clinton the

07:10.563 --> 07:12.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
edge she needs in Ohio.

07:12.399 --> 07:17.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This weekend, volunteers from
NextGen Climate
talked to voters around the

Western Reserve University.

07:19.773 --> 07:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the closing days of what's
been a remarkably
negative and personal campaign,
Clinton has

07:25.312 --> 07:30.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
finally turned to a more
positive and uplifting
message, something the campaign
had been promising

07:30.317 --> 07:32.085 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do for weeks.

07:32.118 --> 07:37.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: If you
give me the
privilege of your vote tomorrow,
that's what

07:37.257 --> 07:43.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will do every single day of my
presidency,
to knock down barriers, to
create opportunities

07:43.596 --> 07:48.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that you have the chance to
fill your own
dreams.

07:48.668 --> 07:53.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You see, I believe America's
best days are
still ahead of us.

07:53.306 --> 07:55.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

07:55.275 --> 08:01.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For this Clinton
rally in Philadelphia
on Independence Mall, it's an
all-star lineup.

08:01.381 --> 08:06.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She will be with President
Obama, Michelle
Obama, former President Bill
Clinton and Bruce

08:06.619 --> 08:08.421 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Springsteen.

08:08.455 --> 08:13.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has the feel of a grand
finale, but there's
one more event, a midnight rally
in another

08:13.560 --> 08:16.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
key state, North Carolina --
Judy.

08:16.262 --> 08:19.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John, tell us
about the
choice of states.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.935 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know at the end it's all
about location.

08:21.968 --> 08:26.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is ahead in Michigan, in
Pennsylvania,
North Carolina a little bit
closer.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why are they going to these
places on this
last day?

08:29.776 --> 08:35.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The campaign wants to
nail the
door shut, they say, on a
possible path for

08:35.682 --> 08:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump to 270 electoral
votes.

08:38.852 --> 08:43.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another reason why they're
coming back here
to Pennsylvania, this is the
third stop here

08:43.456 --> 08:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in three days and in Michigan
today, these
states don't have early voting,
so unlike

08:49.696 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other states, they don't know
who's been voting
because of canvassing fieldwork.

08:54.067 --> 08:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They want to make sure they get
people out
to the polls tomorrow.

08:57.337 --> 09:02.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John Yang
reporting to us from
Philadelphia, thank you.

09:02.041 --> 09:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to Jeffrey
Brown, who's
been following Donald Trump in
this final

09:06.246 --> 09:07.514 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign push.

09:07.547 --> 09:15.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The next president of the
United States,
Donald J. Trump!

09:15.622 --> 09:20.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How much does
Donald Trump
need North Carolina?

09:20.326 --> 09:25.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Count the ways and count the
days he's been
here as the election nears.

09:25.799 --> 09:28.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
By all accounts, this is a
must-win state.

09:28.134 --> 09:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this afternoon, he was back
again, before
a large crowd at Raleigh's J.S.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Dorton Arena.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
This is amazing.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What a great place.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

09:38.711 --> 09:43.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Following FBI
Director Comey's
latest dramatic announcement,
Trump didn't

09:43.583 --> 09:45.385 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back down.

09:45.418 --> 09:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Of course the FBI,
the director,
was obviously under tremendous
pressure, so

09:53.460 --> 09:58.264 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they went through 650,000
e-mails in eight
days.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Yeah, right.

09:59.999 --> 10:04.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That issue was
also on the
minds of his supporters, some of
whom had

10:04.370 --> 10:05.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
waited outside for hours.

10:05.839 --> 10:08.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: I think there's something
there.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that it's kind of being
covered up.

10:09.976 --> 10:12.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think a lot of people here
think it's being
covered up.

10:12.779 --> 10:18.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's been a mad
dash, with
stops all over the electoral map
in Minnesota,

10:18.218 --> 10:21.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michigan, Pennsylvania and
several more states
just this weekend.

10:21.888 --> 10:26.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We joined the campaign yesterday
in Iowa at
the Sioux City Convention
Center.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We're going to win
the great
state of Iowa, and we are going
to win back

10:29.529 --> 10:32.699 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the White House.

10:32.732 --> 10:38.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: First-time voter
Kailey Bledsoe
said she likes Trump's
independence.

10:39.005 --> 10:42.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAILEY BLEDSOE, Trump Supporter:
I'm voting
for Trump because I believe he
has the best

10:42.141 --> 10:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
intentions for our country.

10:43.409 --> 10:47.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like that he's not -- he's
never been like
into politics.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I like that he's supporting
himself.

10:49.849 --> 10:54.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really that he's -- he
really has his
own beliefs and that he's not
listening him

10:54.721 --> 10:55.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to anyone.

10:55.722 --> 10:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Nobody is paying him to say
anything.

10:57.557 --> 11:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That youthful
enthusiasm was
reflected in a new Des Moines
Register poll

11:01.594 --> 11:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
showing Trump up by a healthy
seven-point
margin in Iowa, his largest lead
to date,

11:07.567 --> 11:12.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this after Barack Obama won the
state twice
and Democrats have carried six
of the last

11:12.505 --> 11:14.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seven presidential elections.

11:14.307 --> 11:18.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER, Selzer &amp; Company,
Inc.: He's
winning among independents in
Iowa right now.

11:18.044 --> 11:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Trump has reached
beyond his
core constituency here, says
pollster Ann

11:22.782 --> 11:24.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Selzer.

11:24.551 --> 11:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER: The other thing
that we're
seeing here is a change in the
character of

11:28.121 --> 11:29.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the younger voter.

11:29.956 --> 11:35.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in Iowa, part of the
backbone of the Obama
coalition were young voters, and
he won here

11:36.029 --> 11:40.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by substantial margins with
people under the
age of 35.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump is now winning with that
group.

11:43.002 --> 11:45.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're more likely to identify
as Republicans.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He's winning
among young people?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER: He's winning
among young people.

11:48.541 --> 11:54.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Iowa's
demographics help Trump,
a population mostly white, more
rural, less

11:54.547 --> 11:57.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
affluent and fewer college
graduates.

11:57.350 --> 12:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his campaign strategy has
been to ignite
these voters in battleground
states across

12:02.021 --> 12:03.890 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

12:03.923 --> 12:08.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also helping Trump, leading
party members
here, including Governor Terry
Branstad, have

12:08.761 --> 12:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
supported him even through low
points in the
campaign.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The governor's son Eric, in
fact, serves as
Trump's Iowa director.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIC BRANSTAD, Trump Iowa
Campaign Director:
This is a campaign like I have
never seen

12:17.737 --> 12:19.505 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

12:19.539 --> 12:24.277 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Usually, when I go to a
Republican rally,
spending a lifetime in politics,
I know everybody

12:24.310 --> 12:25.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a campaign that has
brought in Democrats,
independents.

12:27.647 --> 12:32.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFF KAUFMANN, Chairman,
Republican Party
of Iowa: This election is bigger
than Donald

12:32.385 --> 12:34.153 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

12:34.187 --> 12:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But at a rally to
energize
volunteers, Trump himself was
rarely mentioned.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
State Republican chairman Jeff
Kaufmann said
this:

12:40.093 --> 12:42.328 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFF KAUFMANN: Now, is our
candidate perfect?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.329 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nope.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Any of you people perfect?

12:45.365 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nope.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Am I perfect?

12:47.367 --> 12:49.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nope.

12:49.202 --> 12:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The only way that grassroots
politics works
is for us to accept the nominee
that the people

12:54.340 --> 12:56.109 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
give us.

12:56.142 --> 12:59.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To make sure core
Republicans
actually vote, the party had
canvassers out

12:59.379 --> 13:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this weekend, employing an app
similar to
what Democrats have long used;
20-year old

13:04.751 --> 13:07.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Jillian Dunker grew up outside
Des Moines.

13:07.253 --> 13:10.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JILLIAN DUNKER, Iowa: So you can
click on
this, it will show you their
name, their age,

13:10.723 --> 13:12.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their gender.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It shows you their registered
party and also
their modeled party.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.830 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, modeled in
this case like
hard Republican.

13:17.864 --> 13:18.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JILLIAN DUNKER: Yes.

13:18.865 --> 13:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, you know
that's the core.

13:19.899 --> 13:20.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JILLIAN DUNKER: Yes.

13:20.900 --> 13:21.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

13:21.901 --> 13:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we also see how often they
vote.

13:23.703 --> 13:27.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we know the tactics that we
have to use
when we go to that door to try
and get them

13:27.306 --> 13:30.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to, A, vote for our candidates
and, B, get
them to go actually vote.

13:30.510 --> 13:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How to explain
Donald Trump's
popularity?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Veteran pollster Ann Selzer:

13:35.481 --> 13:39.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
J. ANN SELZER: I have been
listening to people
talk about a candidate like
Donald Trump and

13:39.252 --> 13:43.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sometimes by name for 12 years.

13:43.056 --> 13:47.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are looking for something
else, something
different.

13:47.794 --> 13:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if Donald Trump isn't
something different,
I don't know who is.

13:50.830 --> 13:51.798 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Hello.

13:51.831 --> 13:52.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you today?

13:52.832 --> 13:53.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
WOMAN: Good.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.801 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Would you like a guide?

13:54.834 --> 13:56.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Something
different, for sure.

13:56.836 --> 14:00.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But can that win here in North
Carolina as
well?

14:00.440 --> 14:05.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Voters in Cary this weekend
waited in lines
up to three hours to cast their
early ballots,

14:05.244 --> 14:10.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a diverse group of people
reflecting an increasingly
diverse state, including many
with college

14:10.450 --> 14:14.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
degrees and higher incomes, a
challenge for
Trump.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNC Professor Ferrel Guillory.

14:16.355 --> 14:21.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FERREL GUILLORY, University of
North Carolina:
So the Trump-Clinton election in
this state

14:21.694 --> 14:28.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
represents this clash of people
who look back
to what they see as a better
America, and

14:28.634 --> 14:35.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who look forward to the --
to rising
affluence and a more tolerant
society that

14:35.308 --> 14:36.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they want to live in, in the
future.

14:36.876 --> 14:40.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: North Carolina
has been a classic
flip-flop state.

14:40.546 --> 14:45.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It voted for Barack Obama by the
slimmest
of margins in 2008 and then went
back to the

14:45.651 --> 14:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican column with Mitt
Romney by another
small margin in 2012.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ZAN BUNN, North Carolina
Federation of Republican
Women: Did you already vote?

14:50.556 --> 14:51.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Yes, we have.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ZAN BUNN: OK.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.526 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Would you like a sticker?

14:53.559 --> 14:54.527 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
OK.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you so much.

14:56.362 --> 15:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Zan Bunn, head of
the North
Carolina Federation of
Republican Women, wants

15:00.066 --> 15:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reach beyond the party's
core.

15:02.435 --> 15:06.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She canvassed around Raleigh
this weekend,
including at the Wendell Harvest
Festival.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ZAN BUNN: Diversity is always a
positive.

15:09.942 --> 15:15.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it's important for
Republicans to message
well to everyone.

15:15.214 --> 15:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that is perhaps not as well
announced
as it should be.

15:22.054 --> 15:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But we just continue to try.

15:24.423 --> 15:29.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As Donald Trump
arrived here
this afternoon, polls showed a
very close

15:29.796 --> 15:36.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race, meaning all eyes will be
on this key
battleground state when the
votes are tallied

15:36.335 --> 15:38.004 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tomorrow.

15:38.037 --> 15:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump finished up his
rally at the
arena behind me just a short
time ago.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was able to talk to a Trump
official earlier
today.

15:43.342 --> 15:46.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He told me they were cautiously
optimistic
here in North Carolina.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.581 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That sounds about right.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think anybody can be
completely confident
about what will happen tomorrow
-- Hari.

15:51.651 --> 15:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jeff, you have
been on the
trail with Trump for the last
couple of days.

15:54.554 --> 15:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is his closing argument to
his supporters?

15:57.590 --> 16:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Hari, he is
staying on message.

16:01.727 --> 16:04.330 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the message is, I am an
agent of change.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will change what's happening
in Washington.

16:06.432 --> 16:08.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I will change what's been
happening with the
government.

16:08.768 --> 16:11.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I will lead you to make America
great.

16:11.437 --> 16:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the argument we have
been hearing.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But this is a Donald Trump very
much on message.

16:15.474 --> 16:21.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He goes through the list of
negatives and
positives, from Hillary Clinton
corruption,

16:21.681 --> 16:25.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as he refers to it, to
Obamacare, to his own
attributes.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he stays on message.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is it working?

16:28.654 --> 16:30.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does it connect with the crowd?

16:30.489 --> 16:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I think it seems
to be working
the crowds we have seen,
certainly.

16:35.795 --> 16:41.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's speaking, really, to
the core right
now, and the whole idea at this
point is get

16:41.200 --> 16:42.935 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out the vote.

16:42.969 --> 16:44.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Jeff Brown joining
us from Raleigh, North Carolina,
tonight,

16:44.270 --> 16:46.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
Justice Department
announced it is sending more
than 500 staffers

16:50.676 --> 16:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to 28 states to watch for civil
rights violations
at the polls.

16:55.047 --> 16:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's down a third from four
years ago.

16:57.550 --> 17:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme
Court refused
today to reimpose curbs on
partisan poll watchers

17:02.588 --> 17:04.190 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Ohio.

17:04.223 --> 17:07.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Democrats wanted the
restrictions, citing
fears of voter intimidation.

17:07.159 --> 17:12.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wall Street shot
higher today,
as investors appeared to shed
doubts about

17:12.131 --> 17:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the election outcome.

17:14.000 --> 17:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That came after the FBI said
newly found e-mails
warrant no action against
Hillary Clinton.

17:20.039 --> 17:26.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 371
points to close at 18259.

17:26.712 --> 17:31.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 120, and
the S&amp;P 500
added 46.

17:31.651 --> 17:36.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Syria,
Kurdish-led forces
pressed toward Raqqa today, the
Islamic State's

17:36.422 --> 17:38.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
de facto capital.

17:38.224 --> 17:42.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They announced the offensive on
Sunday, beginning
what promises to be a prolonged
fight.

17:42.361 --> 17:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. military is providing
the coalition
of Kurdish and Arab fighters
with air support.

17:47.133 --> 17:50.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An estimated 5,000 ISIS fighters
are in the
city.

17:50.536 --> 17:56.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Iraqi troops are
still advancing
on ISIS forces holding Mosul,
and now they

17:56.342 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have found a mass grave with 100
beheaded
victims.

18:00.446 --> 18:03.215 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The site was uncovered just
south of the city.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not known if the bodies are
civilians
or soldiers.

18:06.519 --> 18:10.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A thick layer
of acrid smog
hung over large parts of India
today, the

18:10.990 --> 18:12.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
worst in 17 years.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A million schoolchildren stayed
home, and
people lined up to buy face
masks around the

18:16.963 --> 18:18.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
capital of New Delhi.

18:18.831 --> 18:23.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The gray haze contains smoke,
ash and other
pollutants, causing shortness of
breath, watery

18:23.102 --> 18:24.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
eyes and coughing.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Environmentalists urged new
government action.

18:26.973 --> 18:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUNITA NARAIN, India's Center
for Science
and Environment (through
translator): It is

18:31.043 --> 18:32.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a public health emergency.

18:32.912 --> 18:36.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We hope that the Supreme Court
will advise
the government to take some
strict measures

18:36.983 --> 18:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to clean the air around Delhi.

18:38.851 --> 18:42.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: One plan
that's under consideration,
bringing back a curb on road
traffic.

18:42.955 --> 18:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: China has barred
two elected
lawmakers in Hong Kong from
taking office,

18:48.594 --> 18:50.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
after they openly advocated
independence.

18:50.696 --> 18:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first time that Beijing
has gone
that far since Britain returned
Hong Kong

18:55.801 --> 18:57.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Chinese rule in 1997.

18:57.703 --> 19:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The maneuver has sparked new
protests in the
city against the communist
government's control.

19:03.409 --> 19:07.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back in this
country: The
people of Cushing, Oklahoma,
surveyed earthquake

19:07.346 --> 19:09.081 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
damage today.

19:09.115 --> 19:13.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sunday's magnitude-5 tremor hit
just west
of the city, a major commercial
hub for oil.

19:13.719 --> 19:17.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Up to 50 buildings were damaged,
and officials
cordoned off parts of city.

19:17.456 --> 19:19.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was no damage to oil
facilities.

19:19.325 --> 19:24.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oklahoma has had thousands of
quakes in recent
years, caused mainly by
injecting oil industry

19:24.063 --> 19:25.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wastewater into the ground.

19:25.898 --> 19:31.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Janet Reno, the
first woman
to be U.S. attorney general, has
died in Miami

19:31.170 --> 19:33.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Parkinson's disease.

19:33.039 --> 19:37.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She served almost eight years
under President
Clinton, and was known for her
blunt manner,

19:37.610 --> 19:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
once declaring, "I don't do
spin."

19:40.813 --> 19:46.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she drew criticism for
authorizing a deadly
raid on the Branch Davidian cult
in Waco,

19:46.052 --> 19:53.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas, in 1993, and the return
of a Cuban
boy, Elian Gonzalez, to Havana
in 2000.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She looked ahead on the
"NewsHour" in 2001.

19:55.895 --> 20:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET RENO, Former U.S. Attorney
General:
Until the day I die, or until
the day I can't

20:00.399 --> 20:04.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think anymore, I want to be
involved in the
issues that I care about, how we
make the

20:04.570 --> 20:08.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law real for all people, how we
give people
access to the law.

20:08.774 --> 20:14.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm vitally interested in
cyber-crime and
in preparing law enforcement for
a time when

20:14.380 --> 20:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crime is international in its
origins and
its consequences.

20:17.550 --> 20:22.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In a statement
today, President
Obama called Reno an American
original who

20:22.822 --> 20:24.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
left the nation a better place.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Janet Reno was 78 years old.

20:27.193 --> 20:31.330 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And in
Philadelphia, a weeklong
transit strike has come to an
end just in

20:31.363 --> 20:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time to avoid affecting voter
turnout tomorrow.

20:34.333 --> 20:38.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Public transportation workers
and the main
transit agency reached a
tentative agreement

20:38.237 --> 20:39.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on a new contract early today.

20:39.939 --> 20:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will boost wages, and provide
better pensions
and health care coverage.

20:44.043 --> 20:49.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a full analysis
of what to watch for on Election
Day; reconnecting

20:49.281 --> 20:54.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a Syrian family one year
after they fled
their home; students give their
advice for

20:54.320 --> 21:05.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whichever candidate becomes the
next president
of the United States; and much
more.

21:05.831 --> 21:13.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tomorrow on
Election Day, we
will be following a lot of
numbers and data

21:13.172 --> 21:14.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
here at the "NewsHour."

21:14.540 --> 21:17.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A big part of that are the
so-called exit
polls.

21:17.676 --> 21:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're also part of what's used
to project
winners before the final real
vote counts

21:23.149 --> 21:24.917 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
come in.

21:24.950 --> 21:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We thought we'd talk about how
that works
and take a look at the
all-important electoral

21:28.387 --> 21:31.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vote map, with our friend
Domenico Montanaro.

21:31.557 --> 21:34.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's NPR's lead editor for
politics.

21:34.627 --> 21:35.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Domenico, it's great to see you.

21:35.961 --> 21:36.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Great to be here.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, let's look at this map.

21:38.264 --> 21:40.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is your map, the NPR map.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us what it shows.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO, Political
Editor, NPR:
Well, first of all, going into
Election Day,

21:44.370 --> 21:47.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hillary Clinton quite clearly
has the advantage.

21:47.339 --> 21:55.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She could get over 270 electoral
votes, 274
by our count, because I moved
Nevada from

21:55.047 --> 21:59.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
our last map to now lean
Democratic, where
it had been in tossup.

21:59.685 --> 22:02.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I moved New Hampshire back to
tossup.

22:02.188 --> 22:06.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you look at it here,
just all of
the states that are leaning
towards Clinton's

22:06.525 --> 22:11.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, if those Democratic base
voters hold
and show up to vote, Hillary
Clinton would

22:11.797 --> 22:13.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
win.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is even
without the so-called
tossup states?

22:15.501 --> 22:16.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Absolutely.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which you haven't
even put
those in his or her category.

22:18.704 --> 22:21.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Well, think
about the
fact that you could have
somebody win without

22:21.040 --> 22:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Florida and Ohio and Iowa and
North Carolina.

22:25.811 --> 22:29.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, that's pretty unheard of
in recent modern
American political history.

22:29.448 --> 22:34.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But because of demographic
change and where
we're at in this election,
that's totally

22:34.053 --> 22:35.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
possible.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What she could
do.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, then, If that's the case,
what is Donald
Trump's path?

22:38.457 --> 22:40.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does he have to do?

22:40.226 --> 22:43.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Well,
clearly, Donald
Trump is going to have to break
off a piece

22:43.095 --> 22:44.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that blue wall.

22:44.897 --> 22:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We were thinking possibly it was
in Nevada,
maybe it could be New Hampshire.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wouldn't be enough for him
right now.

22:50.169 --> 22:52.705 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He have to pick off a state like
Nevada.

22:52.738 --> 23:00.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's why you have seen now
he's barnstorming
the country in what are
traditionally lean-Democratic

23:00.479 --> 23:04.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
states, places that have gone
Democratic in
a lot of the last six elections
-- in all

23:04.750 --> 23:08.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the last six elections,
places like Minnesota,
Wisconsin, Michigan.

23:08.354 --> 23:12.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They feel better about Michigan,
but the Clinton
campaign is saying that they're
still up there.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you have President Obama
going back to
make sure that African-American
voters get

23:15.661 --> 23:16.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out to vote.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They feel like if they get their
voters out,
then they will win.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump would have to pick off one
of those
cinder blocks.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If he can do it, all bets are
off.

23:23.669 --> 23:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when you say
the big blue
wall, we're talking about that
Upper Midwest.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we see that in light blue
color.

23:29.541 --> 23:32.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Domenico, I want to turn you now
to talk about
exit polls.

23:32.845 --> 23:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something that comes up
every election
year.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.617 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Remind us, what are they, who
runs them?

23:38.651 --> 23:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: So, exit
polls are commissioned
by the national media, the big
broadcast organizations,

23:44.690 --> 23:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some print organizations like
The New York
Times, The Washington Post, ABC,
NBC, CNN,

23:50.029 --> 23:51.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for example.

23:51.864 --> 23:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They pay a group called Edison
Research, which
does -- creates what's called
the National

23:55.801 --> 23:57.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Exit Poll Consortium.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a lot of money.

23:59.805 --> 24:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The public broadcasters, we
should say, PBS,
NPR, we're not participating in
it this time

24:04.476 --> 24:05.944 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
around.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So when you see those numbers,
they will be
coming from that consortium.

24:07.813 --> 24:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And they -- what
they do is,
they have, what, thousands of
people who go

24:11.550 --> 24:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out around the country and
interview people
after they have left the polls.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: That's
right.

24:16.388 --> 24:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You will see about 100,000
people as part
of the sample.

24:19.158 --> 24:24.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And why that's really amazing is
that, when
you think about a normal
national poll, there's

24:24.496 --> 24:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about 1,000 people sampled, with
about 3.5
percent margin of error.

24:27.866 --> 24:32.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're talking about 100,000
people over the
entire country, so much smaller
margin of

24:33.005 --> 24:34.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
error when it comes to that.

24:34.807 --> 24:39.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be every fourth person
who leaves
the exit polling place, an exit
pollster would

24:39.345 --> 24:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try to approach them and try to
get them to
take a questionnaire, fill it
out and then

24:44.516 --> 24:46.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that information is relayed
back.

24:46.251 --> 24:49.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Domenico, we
have heard
so much this year about how big
the early

24:49.455 --> 24:54.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vote is, something like, what,
40-some million
people voting early.

24:54.226 --> 24:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do they measure those votes,
or absentee
votes, for example?

24:57.062 --> 25:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Well, when
it comes to
exit polling early voters, they
will do a

25:01.433 --> 25:03.168 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
phone, a normal phone poll.

25:03.202 --> 25:07.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So they will call a place like
Washington
state or Oregon or Colorado,
where they do

25:07.139 --> 25:13.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of mail-only ballots, so
that they can
get demographic information to
plug into the

25:13.145 --> 25:15.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
exit poll.

25:15.180 --> 25:17.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then so those
news organizations
that are part of this, they're
the ones, including

25:17.549 --> 25:22.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Associated Press, which we
at the "NewsHour"
will be relying on, they take
that information,

25:22.321 --> 25:25.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then how do they turn that
into a projected
winner?

25:25.157 --> 25:28.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: And us at
NPR, too, we
should say, are relying on the
Associated

25:28.394 --> 25:29.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Press' calls.

25:29.495 --> 25:31.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they do is they take three
different
things.

25:31.196 --> 25:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They take historical data, they
take the exit
polls, and they take actual
results.

25:34.166 --> 25:39.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they will do with exit
polling information
is, they will go into places
that are barometer

25:39.037 --> 25:40.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
precincts, for example.

25:40.973 --> 25:45.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they get some actual
information
or they get exit poll
information that shows

25:45.144 --> 25:47.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the direction of where that's
headed, then
they can make a call.

25:47.679 --> 25:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, I should say one thing.

25:49.415 --> 25:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you see a lot of the places
that call
a state with zero percent in or
1 percent

25:52.818 --> 25:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in, it's very rarely that state
that gets
it wrong, because, historically,
that's usually

25:58.190 --> 26:00.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a state that's pretty far apart
and the exit
polls back it up.

26:00.559 --> 26:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In other words, a
state that's
been reliably Republican or
reliably Democratic.

26:04.363 --> 26:06.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Yes, like a
New York or
California or something.

26:06.598 --> 26:10.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And those are the
states that
we expect to be called as soon
as the polls

26:10.335 --> 26:12.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
close, or very shortly after.

26:12.137 --> 26:13.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: That's
right.

26:14.006 --> 26:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's the ones
where it's close
where we will be waiting and
waiting and maybe

26:16.608 --> 26:17.910 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
waiting.

26:17.943 --> 26:19.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Right, in
those states
too close to call.

26:19.711 --> 26:21.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if they are too close to
call, you're
looking at later in the night,
11:00 at the

26:21.880 --> 26:25.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very least most likely, because
that's when
it's been called in the last two
elections.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We can't wait.

26:26.785 --> 26:27.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're all on the edge of our
seats.

26:27.953 --> 26:29.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: It's almost
over.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:30.489 --> 26:33.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Domenico
Montanaro, NPR, thank
you so much.

26:33.725 --> 26:39.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOMENICO MONTANARO: Thank you.

26:39.565 --> 26:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now for our
election eve
edition of Politics Monday.

26:45.704 --> 26:50.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're joined by Amy Walter of
The Cook Political
Report, Susan Page, Washington
bureau chief

26:50.642 --> 26:54.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of USA Today, and Andra
Gillespie of Emory
University.

26:54.847 --> 26:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's great to have all of you
with us.

26:56.548 --> 27:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy, we just heard a little from
Domenico
Montanaro of NPR about what he
thinks the

27:00.853 --> 27:01.920 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
map looks like.

27:01.954 --> 27:03.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think it looks like
right now?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I don't
really disagree with that at
all.

27:05.424 --> 27:11.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think every election, I
come in with
the grand hopes that we look at
the map, and

27:11.663 --> 27:16.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we look at when the polls close,
and we say
we're going to be able to
project out how

27:16.702 --> 27:19.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this map is going to come
together over the
course of the night.

27:19.538 --> 27:23.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, as you all discussed,
sometimes, a state
is a little bit too close to
call.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, a state comes in
earlier than you
expected.

27:25.711 --> 27:28.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, really, what I'm really
looking for are
the anomalies.

27:28.547 --> 27:32.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's a state that we didn't
expect to go
one way that is going that way?

27:32.317 --> 27:34.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What is that going to tell us?

27:34.119 --> 27:37.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, if Georgia goes
to Hillary
Clinton, that tells us she is
going to have

27:37.523 --> 27:39.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a really, really, really big
night.

27:39.358 --> 27:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If a state like Michigan does
end up going
to Donald Trump, that says maybe
that Rust

27:43.362 --> 27:45.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Belt strategy paid off.

27:45.731 --> 27:50.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is more likely the --
that's what I'm
going to be looking for.

27:50.536 --> 27:55.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, really, the three states
that I'm going
to be paying attention to, that
everybody

27:55.474 --> 27:59.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in America will be paying
attention to, Florida,
North Carolina, and
Pennsylvania.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Susan, what
are your early
indicators if you're looking out
to...

28:01.980 --> 28:05.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
Ohio I would put on that list as
well.

28:05.150 --> 28:06.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

28:06.151 --> 28:07.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

28:07.953 --> 28:09.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Because, if you look
at Florida,
North Carolina, Ohio, Donald
Trump needs to

28:09.187 --> 28:10.989 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
win all of them.

28:11.023 --> 28:14.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Hillary Clinton wins one of
them, that's
a pretty good sign that she is a
path to victory.

28:14.760 --> 28:18.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you look at early closing
states, Georgia,
the polls close at 7:00.

28:18.263 --> 28:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that's, as you say, a state
that ought
to go red.

28:21.066 --> 28:23.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, if it goes blue, that's a
big sign.

28:23.101 --> 28:25.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Virginia also closes as 7:00.

28:25.103 --> 28:26.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a state that ought to go
blue.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if that goes red, that is a
sign that
Donald Trump is going to have a
better night

28:29.441 --> 28:31.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than we think.

28:31.343 --> 28:34.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the interesting things
about this year's
map is that it's different, I
think, from

28:34.413 --> 28:39.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
previous years because of Donald
Trump's appeal
to white working-class voters
and because

28:39.585 --> 28:41.486 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of changing demographics with
Latino voters.

28:41.520 --> 28:47.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have seen Southwestern
states, like,
Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico
being more likely

28:47.826 --> 28:52.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to go blue than in the past and
these Industrial
Midwestern states more likely to
go red.

28:52.831 --> 28:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in some ways, I think we're
in a kind
of transition in this country in
terms of

28:56.068 --> 28:58.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the coalition that are behind
each of the
parties.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Andra Gillespie,
you spend
a lot of time looking at
demographics.

29:01.139 --> 29:06.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you see when you look at
both the
African-American, the Latino
component of

29:06.211 --> 29:07.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this electorate?

29:07.913 --> 29:10.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDRA GILLESPIE, Emory
University: Well, I
am wondering whether or not 2016
is going

29:10.182 --> 29:12.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be for Latinos what 1964 was
for African-Americans.

29:12.851 --> 29:17.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, in particular, I'm
interested in the break
in the vote for Hillary Clinton
vs. Donald

29:17.723 --> 29:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump amongst Latino voters.

29:19.558 --> 29:23.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of the polling, Latino
Decisions, for
instance, is saying right now
that she will

29:23.128 --> 29:25.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get 75 percent of the Latino
vote.

29:25.097 --> 29:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I want to see is
whether or not that's
actually higher for the
undecideds, whether

29:28.300 --> 29:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or not they start to break
towards Clinton,
she actually gets upwards of 80
percent of

29:31.970 --> 29:33.205 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Latino vote.

29:33.238 --> 29:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that that suggests a
huge shift in
our politics.

29:36.675 --> 29:40.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it suggests that that new
Democratic majority
that is being made up of a
multicultural coalition

29:40.746 --> 29:42.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is something that's already
here.

29:42.614 --> 29:46.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Amy, in the
postmortem to
the Mitt Romney loss,
Republicans wanted to

29:46.385 --> 29:47.986 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go out and court the Latino
vote.

29:48.020 --> 29:48.987 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

29:49.021 --> 29:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They did that really well.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.490 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:51.523 --> 29:55.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: So, they nominated a
candidate
who has done two amazing things.

29:55.594 --> 29:59.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, not only did he not reach
out and broaden
the Romney coalition.

29:59.131 --> 30:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So he's doing much worse among
all non-white
voters, but he also found a way
to actually

30:04.069 --> 30:05.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
split up the Romney coalition.

30:06.004 --> 30:09.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, among these white
working-class voters,
he's doing a little bit better
than Mitt Romney,

30:09.941 --> 30:14.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but among white voters with a
college education,
he's doing a lot worse.

30:14.946 --> 30:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, to me, what I'm most
fascinated to
see is, one, as Andra points to,
what the

30:19.584 --> 30:24.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new coalition is going to look
like, but then
to see whether or not it lasts
post this election

30:24.589 --> 30:26.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and these two unique
individuals.

30:26.491 --> 30:30.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're really
guilty at election
time of breaking the electorate
up into groups,

30:30.729 --> 30:32.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into this ethnic group and that
gender.

30:32.631 --> 30:37.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Susan, I do want to ask
about women,
because the polls do indicate
that Hillary

30:37.869 --> 30:41.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton is doing much better
among women voters
than Donald Trump.

30:41.173 --> 30:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would expect that of a
Democrat, but this
year it just seems to be
markedly more so.

30:45.310 --> 30:48.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And, of course,
she's our first
woman nominee of a major party
for president,

30:49.014 --> 30:50.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
so that may have some resonance.

30:50.816 --> 30:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, Donald Trump in particular
I think has
driven some women voters away
from the GOP

30:54.720 --> 30:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who might otherwise have voted
for the Republican
nominee, even with Democrats
nominating a

30:59.391 --> 31:01.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
women.

31:01.226 --> 31:05.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that would be white
college-educated women,
independent women, women in
suburban areas.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's one of the swing groups
that we should
be watching for.

31:07.599 --> 31:10.869 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the two -- you talk
about we break
groups down.

31:10.902 --> 31:12.003 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And that's true.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two critical groups in this
election are
Latinos.

31:14.139 --> 31:20.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And early voting in Nevada and
in Florida
indicate a big surge in Latino
turnout.

31:20.178 --> 31:25.250 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And white women, who
historically have voted
for the Republican Party, do
they move to

31:25.283 --> 31:26.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Democratic Party?

31:26.284 --> 31:27.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It looks like they will do that.

31:27.285 --> 31:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And to Amy's point, do they
stick?

31:29.588 --> 31:31.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it more than a one-election
affair?

31:31.623 --> 31:36.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How much did
the Comey news
over the weekend play into this,
and what

31:36.128 --> 31:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of an impact did it have,
considering
what happened a couple of weeks
ago and what

31:42.134 --> 31:43.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happened last night?

31:43.902 --> 31:45.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: What House Democrats
will tell
you is, they think that that
blunted their

31:45.737 --> 31:49.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
momentum enough -- they were
doing very well
up until this point, thinking
they could flip

31:49.775 --> 31:55.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a few more seats -- it blunted
their momentum
enough that it might cost them
five to 10

31:55.147 --> 31:56.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
seats.

31:56.815 --> 32:00.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they, of all the folks out
there, are
the most upset about the change
there.

32:00.819 --> 32:07.159 align:left position:0%,start line:66.67% size:100%
I think it also blunted the
ability for Hillary
Clinton to be able to try to
change her
favorable-to-unfavorable

32:07.192 --> 32:08.160 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ratio.

32:08.193 --> 32:09.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was starting to inch up.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her favorable ratings were
starting to inch
up.

32:11.429 --> 32:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now they're back a little bit
better than
Donald Trump's, not much better.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Andra, would
you agree
with that analysis?

32:18.103 --> 32:24.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we looking at mainly an
impact on Senate
and House races, less so on the
overall?

32:24.042 --> 32:25.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: I would agree.

32:25.944 --> 32:30.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I think about how hard,
fast people's
opinions were about this race,
they were actually

32:30.415 --> 32:33.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
fixed before this e-mail
investigation was
open.

32:33.318 --> 32:36.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, if you hated Hillary
Clinton, this wasn't
going to change your mind
because you were

32:36.454 --> 32:38.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not voting for her anyway.

32:38.323 --> 32:40.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you were already
committed to Clinton,
then you were already going to
vote for her.

32:40.425 --> 32:45.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I guess this gives Clinton
supporters
greater sort of support and
affirmation of

32:45.463 --> 32:46.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their decision to choose to vote
for her.

32:47.032 --> 32:50.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think, at this point, most
people had
already made up their mind.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Susan, what
about the spread?

32:52.103 --> 32:54.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that week, there were a lot
of early voters
that went to the polls.

32:54.573 --> 32:58.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: There were 40
million early voters
between the first Comey letter
and the second

32:58.877 --> 33:00.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Comey letter.

33:00.612 --> 33:03.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they went and voted on the
assumption
that there was probably
something serious

33:03.582 --> 33:05.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the FBI was going to look
at.

33:05.350 --> 33:09.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it probably had an
energizing
effect with some Republicans,
Republicans

33:09.654 --> 33:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe not that enthused about
Donald Trump,
but, man, this is a reminder of
why I don't

33:13.191 --> 33:16.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
want to vote for Hillary
Clinton, and probably
a depressive effect among some
Democratic

33:16.862 --> 33:18.196 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

33:18.230 --> 33:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think it swings a state,
but I think
hurt on the margins.

33:21.399 --> 33:25.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, like Amy, I have talked to
some strategists
for down-ballot races that think
it's probably

33:25.971 --> 33:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cost them a Senate seat or two
and a handful
of House races.

33:30.275 --> 33:34.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, it wouldn't
be election
eve, Amy, if I didn't ask you
about, what

33:34.379 --> 33:35.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are you looking for tomorrow
night?

33:35.413 --> 33:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The polls close officially at
7:00.

33:39.317 --> 33:41.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are you going to be
watching for?

33:41.119 --> 33:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, those states
that we just
discussed are really what I'm
going to be

33:42.921 --> 33:44.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looking for.

33:44.155 --> 33:47.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, let's see if -- I think Ohio
is a great
place to look.

33:47.158 --> 33:50.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a state where Donald
Trump has been
leading.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The expectation is that he --
this is a state
he can win.

33:53.498 --> 33:58.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But from what we're seeing on
the early vote
and on the ground, that Hillary
Clinton's

33:58.336 --> 34:00.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
closing that gap.

34:00.071 --> 34:03.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Hillary Clinton wins Ohio, I
think this
suggests this is going to be a
very good,

34:03.842 --> 34:05.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
big night for Hillary Clinton.

34:05.710 --> 34:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Susan, from
our reporters
on both these trails, we kind of
saw a mishmash

34:08.546 --> 34:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of different travel decisions on
where to
go.

34:11.549 --> 34:15.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is trying to make
inroads into
Michigan to crack that blue wall
of support.

34:15.854 --> 34:19.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then Hillary Clinton is
still trying to
shore up places like Arizona and
North Carolina.

34:19.457 --> 34:23.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, Hillary
Clinton has had
a very strategic plan that has
involved going

34:23.828 --> 34:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now to the states that didn't
have early voting,
like Pennsylvania and Michigan,
really focused

34:27.933 --> 34:32.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
there, very smart use of
surrogates, use of
Barack Obama to try go gin up
black turnout

34:32.671 --> 34:37.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Florida and North Carolina,
where the early
voting indicated black turnout
was down.

34:37.309 --> 34:39.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And with Donald Trump, you don't
see a strategy.

34:39.077 --> 34:43.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see a throw the spaghetti
against the
wall and hope it sticks
somewhere, because

34:43.081 --> 34:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's now in a place where he
needs to run
the table.

34:45.884 --> 34:49.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He needs every battleground
state that could
break his way to break his way.

34:49.487 --> 34:53.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he still needs another
state, which
is why he went to places like
Minnesota and

34:53.625 --> 34:54.793 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Michigan, where he's unlikely to
win.

34:54.826 --> 34:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Andra, I want to
ask you about
Georgia.

34:56.494 --> 34:57.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a state you know very well.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You're teaching there right now
at Emory.

35:00.098 --> 35:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not a state that Hillary
Clinton spent
time in, but the Democrats sure
are pulling

35:04.602 --> 35:08.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out all the stops trying to get
out the vote
that they think could go to her.

35:08.673 --> 35:10.442 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What does that look like right
now?

35:10.475 --> 35:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: Well, right
now, most of
the polls suggest that Donald
Trump will still

35:12.377 --> 35:17.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
win the state, but the margin is
probably
going to be even more narrow
than it was 2008.

35:17.382 --> 35:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So that's something that's
really, really
important to think about.

35:20.385 --> 35:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Democratic Party of Georgia
has spent
months trying to convince the
DNC that this

35:24.122 --> 35:26.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was a state that was worth
investing in.

35:26.157 --> 35:27.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this actually shows that.

35:27.826 --> 35:30.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In particular in Georgia, I'm
going to be
paying attention to Gwinnett
County.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.330 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a Republican stronghold.

35:32.364 --> 35:38.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, demographically, it has
shifted so a
majority of the voters are now
voters of color.

35:38.136 --> 35:42.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they vote Democratic, then
that represents
the change that the Democratic
Party in Georgia

35:42.407 --> 35:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been predicting for the last
five years
in the state.

35:44.743 --> 35:48.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And isn't it also
challenging
too because it also has a high
concentration

35:48.780 --> 35:49.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of white college-educated
voters.

35:50.015 --> 35:50.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: White
college-educated voters.

35:50.982 --> 35:52.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: So, you get both of
those.

35:52.817 --> 35:55.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: At the same
time, in addition
to sort of looking west in
Fulton and Cobb

35:55.387 --> 35:56.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
County as well.

35:56.388 --> 35:58.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Agreed.

35:58.223 --> 35:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which reminds us
that education
is something else we're going to
be watching

36:00.025 --> 36:02.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out for tomorrow night, those
voters with
and without a college education
and how they

36:02.494 --> 36:03.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
divide.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

36:04.763 --> 36:06.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, it's
great to have
all of you.

36:06.798 --> 36:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amy Walter, Andra Gillespie,
Susan Page, thank
you.

36:08.299 --> 36:09.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

36:09.300 --> 36:10.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDRA GILLESPIE: Thank you.

36:10.301 --> 36:12.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Thank you.

36:12.070 --> 36:16.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And please join
us tomorrow,
of course, for our special live
coverage.

36:16.341 --> 36:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Election Day 2016,
the historic
end to a long campaign.

36:23.915 --> 36:27.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who will voters elect as the
next president
of the United States?

36:28.019 --> 36:30.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Which party will control
Congress?

36:30.388 --> 36:33.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What else will we learn from the
voters?

36:33.792 --> 36:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join "PBS NewsHour" for special
election night
coverage, analysis you won't
find anywhere

36:39.431 --> 36:45.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else, Tuesday November 8,
starting at 8:00,
7:00 Central, only on PBS.

36:46.004 --> 36:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In this
campaign, the topic
of refugees from war-torn Syria
has been a

36:51.810 --> 36:53.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political flash point.

36:53.511 --> 36:56.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want to look at what it's
been like for
refugees themselves.

36:56.414 --> 37:01.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2015, just under 1,700 Syrian
refugees
were resettled in the United
States.

37:02.020 --> 37:06.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This year, that number has shot
up to more
than 12,000, a significant
increase, but few

37:06.658 --> 37:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in comparison to Canada, which
has taken in
33,000 this year, or Europe,
which has absorbed

37:12.464 --> 37:16.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hundreds of thousands of people
fleeing the
war at home.

37:16.267 --> 37:19.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, special correspondent
Marcia Biggs
introduced us to one Syrian
family that arrived

37:19.604 --> 37:22.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the U.S. as part of that
first group.

37:22.073 --> 37:26.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She recently checked back in
with them amid
a difficult transition to life
here, and sent

37:26.444 --> 37:28.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
us this report.

37:28.313 --> 37:33.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: A typical
afternoon in this
New Jersey home, mom in the
kitchen, son reading

37:33.885 --> 37:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the sofa and preteen daughter
chatting
on her smartphone.

37:38.123 --> 37:43.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a mundane reality compared
to the horror
they have fled, a war zone in
Syria, overcrowded

37:43.862 --> 37:46.765 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
refugee camps in Jordan.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We first met the Darbi family
last year.

37:49.601 --> 37:56.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newly arrived, they were five of
the roughly
1,700 Syrians resettled in the
U.S. in 2015,

37:56.708 --> 38:00.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
living with the help of grants
from the federal
government and Church World
Service, one of

38:00.979 --> 38:05.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
nine NGOs organizations
assisting refugee
resettlement, helping them find
housing and

38:05.450 --> 38:07.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enroll in language classes.

38:07.619 --> 38:12.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For husband and wife Mohamed and
Amira, it
was the chance for a new life.

38:12.257 --> 38:15.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their three children were
starting the first
week of school.

38:15.560 --> 38:16.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hope was in the air.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.830 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But today:

38:18.863 --> 38:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMED DARBI, Resettled Syrian
Refugee (through
translator): I'm surprised that,
a year later,

38:21.666 --> 38:23.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm still in the same place.

38:23.168 --> 38:24.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In fact, I feel that I have gone
backwards.

38:24.903 --> 38:26.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I feel like, next year, I might
fail.

38:27.005 --> 38:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They should have given us more
time for school,
so that we could learn the
language.

38:30.808 --> 38:36.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Five months after
their arrival,
the financial assistance ended
and Mohamed

38:36.981 --> 38:39.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
struggled to find a steady job.

38:39.751 --> 38:44.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Once a carpenter in Syria, he is
currently
doing manual labor at a
construction site,

38:44.923 --> 38:47.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
having abandoned language
classes.

38:48.026 --> 38:52.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without a car, he cycles to job
sites and
barely makes enough to afford
this two-bedroom

38:52.897 --> 38:54.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
apartment.

38:54.465 --> 38:57.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Six-year-old Shaker (ph) sleeps
in his parents'
room.

38:57.135 --> 39:00.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: When was the last
time you spoke
to someone from Church World
Service?

39:00.572 --> 39:03.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): It was
a long time ago.

39:03.841 --> 39:07.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the office, they treated us
as if we need
special connections for a simple
request.

39:07.579 --> 39:09.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How am I going to ask them for a
job?

39:10.014 --> 39:14.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: According to
Church World Service,
his frustration is typical of
refugees who

39:14.419 --> 39:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have high expectations and lack
understanding
of the concept of starting from
the ground

39:19.023 --> 39:20.091 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

39:20.124 --> 39:22.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We spoke with Sarah Krause,
director of programs.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH KRAUSE, Church World
Service: It's a
challenge to find something in
the refugee's

39:24.796 --> 39:26.064 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
chosen field.

39:26.097 --> 39:28.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's going to take a
little more time.

39:28.533 --> 39:30.702 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It also takes time to learn
English.

39:30.735 --> 39:36.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oftentimes, in families, both
the husband
and the wife need to work in
order to really

39:36.074 --> 39:39.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support the family, just as is
the case with
American families.

39:39.811 --> 39:45.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We receive a very limited amount
of money
to provide those initial
resettlement services.

39:45.984 --> 39:49.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's $2,025 per individual.

39:49.153 --> 39:53.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not a lot of money to get
someone started
in the United States.

39:53.291 --> 39:58.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Just over 300
Syrian refugees
arrived in New Jersey in the
last year.

39:58.129 --> 40:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like the Darbi family, most of
them were resettled
here in the shadow of New York
City's Freedom

40:02.867 --> 40:04.802 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Tower.

40:04.836 --> 40:08.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some people argue that
placing them here
may have actually hurt their
chances for integration.

40:08.039 --> 40:12.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMED KHAIRULLAH, Mayor of
Prospect Park,
New Jersey: Most of the Syrian
refugees that

40:12.043 --> 40:18.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are coming into New Jersey are
being settled
in either Jersey City or
Elizabeth, which

40:18.383 --> 40:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
really doesn't have any Syrian
community there.

40:24.455 --> 40:27.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Mohamed Khairullah
is also a
Syrian refugee.

40:27.859 --> 40:33.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Born in Aleppo, he was just a
child in 1980
when his family fled a crackdown
by Bashar

40:33.698 --> 40:36.134 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
al-Assad's father, Hafez.

40:36.167 --> 40:42.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He emigrated to the U.S. in
1991, settling
in Prospect Park, New Jersey,
about 20 miles

40:42.440 --> 40:43.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from the Darbis.

40:43.975 --> 40:47.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been mayor here for over a
decade.

40:47.245 --> 40:52.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He believes that resettling
refugees in Arab
neighborhoods like his would
provide a support

40:52.116 --> 40:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
network, and make finding them
the right job
and getting them into English
classes easier.

40:56.721 --> 41:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMED KHAIRULLAH: Most of
them, you speak
to them and they say, listen, we
want to work,

41:01.259 --> 41:02.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we want to provide for our
families.

41:03.027 --> 41:06.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't want to go from one
organization
to another, asking for help.

41:06.898 --> 41:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's humiliating to us.

41:08.733 --> 41:13.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these private organizations
need to speak
to us, need to communicate with
us, need to

41:13.971 --> 41:18.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
let us know ahead of time when
there is a
refugee family coming in, so we
could try

41:18.109 --> 41:21.679 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find a home for them in our
areas.

41:21.713 --> 41:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: While the Darbis
say their neighbors
are friendly, not one of them is
Arab, and

41:26.317 --> 41:28.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the family has very little
interaction with
them.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you have any kind of a
support network?

41:31.422 --> 41:33.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If there is an emergency, who do
you call?

41:33.057 --> 41:35.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): There
is no one.

41:35.526 --> 41:38.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The children are
their ray of
hope.

41:38.663 --> 41:44.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, then 11-year-old
Hajar and 13-year-old
Nabiha couldn't speak a lick of
English.

41:44.535 --> 41:45.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But this year:

41:45.737 --> 41:46.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your favorite music?

41:46.738 --> 41:48.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you dance to?

41:48.106 --> 41:49.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NABIHA DARBI, Resettled Syrian
Refugee: "Rolling
in the Deep."

41:49.674 --> 41:50.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Adele?

41:50.675 --> 41:51.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You like Adele?

41:51.676 --> 41:52.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NABIHA DARBI: Yes.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: One other change
we noticed?

41:54.512 --> 41:58.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hajar began wearing a hijab,
something she
says she was proud to do when
she turned 12

41:58.716 --> 42:02.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years old, and a decision her
parents say
she made on her own.

42:02.820 --> 42:05.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): I felt
that she was still young.

42:05.089 --> 42:06.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I told her maybe you should
wait.

42:06.724 --> 42:07.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But she insisted.

42:08.025 --> 42:10.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Do you know why
she wanted to
wear it earlier?

42:10.061 --> 42:12.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMIRA DARBI, Resettled Syrian
Refugee (through
translator): Maybe it was
because, after she

42:12.930 --> 42:17.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started school here in the
States, she wanted
to show people her culture and
traditions.

42:17.602 --> 42:21.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The girls say they
have been
bullied in school, often because
of their

42:21.873 --> 42:23.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
religion.

42:23.674 --> 42:25.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAJAR DARBI, Resettled Syrian
Refugee (through
translator): I didn't just wear
the hijab

42:25.410 --> 42:26.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
because I have to.

42:26.944 --> 42:29.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was because kids at school
were telling
my sister to take off her hijab.

42:30.014 --> 42:32.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were telling her that this
is America
and we don't wear hijab here.

42:32.984 --> 42:36.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few weeks later, I started
wearing the hijab
and the kids at school started
asking me,

42:36.621 --> 42:38.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are you Muslim, are you Muslim?

42:38.489 --> 42:40.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I said, yes, I am Muslim.

42:40.091 --> 42:41.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's nobody's business but mine.

42:41.993 --> 42:45.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Even with these
obstacles, the
girls say they are happy in
school, love their

42:46.030 --> 42:48.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
teachers, and their classes.

42:48.366 --> 42:52.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hajar still wants to be a
doctor, but Nabiha
says she wants to be an artist.

42:52.537 --> 42:54.372 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you feel like you're home
here?

42:54.405 --> 42:55.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HAJAR DARBI: Yes.

42:55.540 --> 42:57.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: You do?

42:57.074 --> 43:00.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAJAR DARBI: And our future is
here, not in
Syria.

43:00.845 --> 43:05.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Those are very big
words for
a young girl, and for Nabiha,
who has more

43:05.450 --> 43:08.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
memories of Syria, it's much
more complicated.

43:08.419 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NABIHA DARBI: I don't know.

43:10.354 --> 43:12.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is a good country.

43:12.323 --> 43:13.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I like it.

43:13.357 --> 43:21.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If there is no war in Syria, I
will come back.

43:21.432 --> 43:25.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I will visit this country.

43:25.837 --> 43:33.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know in which country I
would be better,
because my family, some of them
in Turkey,

43:33.544 --> 43:36.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of it in Syria, and some of
it in Jordan.

43:36.214 --> 43:38.616 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want all of them in one
country.

43:38.649 --> 43:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Her English
doesn't suffice
to describe the painful
separation of displacement.

43:44.522 --> 43:50.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NABIHA DARBI (through
translator): I am used
to having them around ever since
I was a child.

43:50.495 --> 43:55.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If I can't see them, I don't
think I can carry
on in this life.

43:55.433 --> 43:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every member of my family is in
a different
country.

43:57.635 --> 44:03.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can't even comprehend this.

44:03.908 --> 44:17.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The family also
arrived in one
of the most politically
polarizing times in

44:17.421 --> 44:23.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recent U.S. history, with parts
of that conflict
surrounding both Syrian refugees
and Islam,

44:23.961 --> 44:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New Jersey Governor Chris
Christie shutting
the door on Syrian refugees in
his state,

44:29.467 --> 44:34.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump calling for a
temporary ban on
all Muslims entering the U.S.
and making so-

44:34.772 --> 44:38.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called extreme vetting of
refugees a campaign
issue.

44:38.276 --> 44:41.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
And we now have them in our
country, and wait

44:41.045 --> 44:42.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
until you see.

44:42.046 --> 44:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is going to be the great
Trojan horse.

44:43.948 --> 44:47.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): He's talking
about a plan he doesn't know
anything about.

44:47.218 --> 44:50.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It took a whole year of vetting
before we
were allowed to come here.

44:50.154 --> 44:52.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does he want a 10-year vetting
process?

44:52.456 --> 44:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The war would be over by then.

44:54.959 --> 44:57.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We didn't come to America with
any bad intentions.

44:57.128 --> 44:58.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We came here asking for safety.

44:59.030 --> 45:01.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If our country weren't
completely destroyed,
we wouldn't have left.

45:01.799 --> 45:04.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: How do those
comments make you
feel?

45:04.602 --> 45:08.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): I feel
like an innocent man in jail for
a crime I

45:08.940 --> 45:09.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
didn't commit.

45:09.941 --> 45:11.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I feel frustrated.

45:11.676 --> 45:15.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I keep asking myself, is it
possible that
some people here might think
this way?

45:15.446 --> 45:17.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I think of Americans, they
are innovators.

45:17.048 --> 45:18.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They reached the moon.

45:18.616 --> 45:20.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But with this type of thinking,
you can't
reach the moon.

45:20.985 --> 45:23.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So, have we
disappointed you?

45:23.387 --> 45:25.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): No.

45:25.623 --> 45:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm telling you, the American
people do not
disappoint me.

45:28.292 --> 45:31.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as the saying goes, the
politicians are
throwing gasoline on a fire.

45:31.996 --> 45:36.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Despite the
difficulties, the
Darbis remain grateful, even
hospitable.

45:36.934 --> 45:40.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMED DARBI (through
translator): The children
have become safe and secure, and
now they

45:40.905 --> 45:41.906 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have a future.

45:41.939 --> 45:44.275 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It means they are living a
normal life.

45:44.308 --> 45:45.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm beyond exhausted.

45:45.509 --> 45:47.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was expecting better.

45:47.078 --> 45:49.513 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But when it comes to normal
life, it's wonderful.

45:49.547 --> 45:53.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: A normal life and
a hope for
a better tomorrow.

45:53.784 --> 45:58.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Marcia Biggs in
Jersey City, New Jersey.

45:58.155 --> 46:02.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Since our
interview, Church
World Service has reached out to
both Mayor

46:02.326 --> 46:10.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Khairullah and the Darbi family
in an attempt
to improve the process of
integration.

46:10.835 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
on this last
evening before Election Day, we
hear from

46:24.582 --> 46:29.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the next generation of voters
about the issues
they care about most.

46:29.320 --> 46:34.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We challenged our nationwide
network of Student
Reporting Labs to record young
people voicing

46:34.792 --> 46:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the concerns closest to their
hearts.

46:37.161 --> 46:39.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here is a sample of their
responses.

46:39.063 --> 46:42.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The project is called Letters to
the Next
President.

46:42.266 --> 46:46.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CYNCERE PRESTON, Student: Both
candidates
should consider affordable
tuition plans,

46:46.971 --> 46:50.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
because no one should be
deprived their right
to further their education.

46:50.174 --> 46:54.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My mother works a second job
just to help
pay for my college fees, so I'm
working extra

46:54.412 --> 46:57.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard in school, so I can receive
as many scholarships
as possible.

46:57.682 --> 47:00.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DULCE SANABRIA, Student: I would
like our
next president to talk about
environmental

47:00.151 --> 47:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues in a way that actually
makes us feel
inclined to do something about
them.

47:04.388 --> 47:07.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's difficult to put ourselves
in a place
where we actually understand the
negative

47:07.825 --> 47:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact that we're creating with
the pollution
that we make with things that we
think are

47:11.295 --> 47:14.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
necessities like cars or
factories, when,
in reality, those things are not
going to

47:14.999 --> 47:17.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
matter at all if we don't have a
healthy enough
planet to live on.

47:17.301 --> 47:20.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAZLYN MIRANDA-MORALES, Student:
I want the
next president to focus on the
immigration

47:20.938 --> 47:22.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crisis.

47:22.707 --> 47:26.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people are living with fear
of being
deported and having their
families destroyed.

47:26.377 --> 47:30.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The next president should find a
path toward
citizenship for immigrants who
have been longtime

47:30.848 --> 47:32.750 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
residents of our country.

47:32.783 --> 47:37.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead of being treated like
criminals, they
should be rewarded for the
positive contributions

47:37.855 --> 47:40.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are making in our economy
and society.

47:40.057 --> 47:43.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW RUIZ, Student: What I
want to tell
the next president is that we
need to bring

47:43.828 --> 47:45.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
God back into our government.

47:45.629 --> 47:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The term separation of church
and state means
that, -- and according to
letters written

47:49.900 --> 47:54.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Thomas Jefferson -- that the
government
shall not interfere with church
teachings.

47:54.171 --> 47:57.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is important, because we
have taken it
out of context saying that the
church has

47:57.975 --> 47:59.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no right to be in the
government.

47:59.944 --> 48:03.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When God was in our government,
our country
was truly good.

48:03.280 --> 48:05.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No Democrat or Republican can
fix it.

48:05.483 --> 48:07.351 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Only God can.

48:07.384 --> 48:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABBY ROSS, Student: And I want
the next president
to know that women deserve equal
pay to men.

48:09.820 --> 48:12.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is America, and we are
known for our
freedom.

48:12.289 --> 48:16.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women are earning more college
and graduate
degrees than men, but are still
earning 79

48:16.460 --> 48:17.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cents to the dollar.

48:17.995 --> 48:20.865 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is our time to be paid
equally, and it
was our time a long time ago.

48:20.898 --> 48:25.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENEVA VANHORN, Student: I
believe that homelessness
is something that we need to
address in the

48:25.169 --> 48:26.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
upcoming election.

48:26.837 --> 48:31.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I believe that we need to help
people who
have lower privileges get up off
of their

48:31.876 --> 48:36.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
feet, because it's not always
their fault
why they made it their in the
first place.

48:36.447 --> 48:40.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could have been something
like a spike
in taxes that caused them to
lose their home

48:41.018 --> 48:42.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and end up on the streets, like
I did.

48:42.853 --> 48:47.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While I was on the streets, I
realized basic
necessities like food and water
were almost

48:47.892 --> 48:52.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impossible to come by, and
people treated
you as if you were a lesser
human being.

48:52.196 --> 48:54.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we need to come together.

48:54.198 --> 48:58.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And whatever excess we have, we
have to use
to bring those people up off
their feet, so

48:58.502 --> 49:00.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they can be a useful member of
our communities.

49:00.538 --> 49:04.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAYLOR KIKU ISHIMOTO, Student: I
would like
to tell the next president that
there are

49:04.074 --> 49:07.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
415,000 children all over
America in foster
care systems.

49:07.845 --> 49:11.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they exit the foster care
system, 50
percent of them will be
unemployed, 50 percent

49:11.916 --> 49:15.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of them will be homeless, and 33
percent will
have to go on public assistance.

MICHAEL INTRIERI, Student: I
want the next
president to help protect
children like me

49:20.991 --> 49:24.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from violence that has been
going around our
nation.

49:24.461 --> 49:35.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going to school every day is
hard for us thinking
that we are unsafe and our lives
can be threatened

49:35.739 --> 49:37.608 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
at any moment.

49:37.641 --> 49:40.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANTE FAISON, Student: So, Mrs.
Chief Executive
or Mr. Head of State, if you
want to get these

49:40.344 --> 49:42.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
votes, then you have got to be
the one to
make this change.

49:42.947 --> 49:47.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Give us peace of mind and
equality if you
are going to step onto this
grander stage,

49:47.218 --> 49:51.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because I'm tired of being
scared to walk
the streets as blood and bullets
rain.

49:51.222 --> 49:55.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's to stop another brother
from taking
a gunshot to the head or through
his chest?

49:55.893 --> 49:59.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dear America, I'm another
statistic, depending
on which way you see me.

49:59.964 --> 50:02.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You built him a statue, but your
law enforcement
soils what he was dreaming.

50:02.800 --> 50:05.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a whole monument to him
because he
signed off on our freedom.

50:05.402 --> 50:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clearly, you all don't see the
greatness that
they were seeing.

50:08.939 --> 50:09.907 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But I digress.

50:09.940 --> 50:11.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I wish you both the best.

50:11.442 --> 50:14.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we give you the keys to our
world, you
got to promise us true freedom.

50:14.945 --> 50:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Truly yours, the black nation,
the people
you should be healing.
