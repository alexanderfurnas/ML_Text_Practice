GWEN IFILL: One sign that
presidential primaries
are near, candidates are
starting to ramp

00:05.873 --> 00:08.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up their TV ad spending.

00:08.075 --> 00:12.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins takes a
look at the mountain of cash
being spent on

00:12.446 --> 00:14.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ads, and whether it's worth it.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
I'm Marco Rubio.

00:16.650 --> 00:23.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The much-used
and often reviled
campaign ad faces a real test in
2016. First,

00:23.156 --> 00:28.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the sheer numbers could break
records: Some
experts estimate we will see an
astonishing

00:28.328 --> 00:35.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$4.4 billion in political TV
ads. But ads
so far have not brought results
for some.

00:35.235 --> 00:39.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: Serious
times require serious
leadership.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republican Jeb
Bush has spent
more on ads than any other
candidate, but

00:43.477 --> 00:46.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he is stalled in fifth or sixth
place.

00:46.179 --> 00:51.418 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PETER FENN, Democratic
Strategist: I have
to say it's pay more, get less.
TV advertising

00:51.451 --> 00:55.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is not nearly as effective as it
once was,
especially high-level races.

00:55.789 --> 00:59.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Peter Fenn is
president of
Fenn Communications and has
worked in over

00:59.459 --> 01:01.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
300 campaigns.

01:01.261 --> 01:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER FENN: Jeb Bush's idea
initially was
to buy a lot of advertising, to
use the $100

01:06.300 --> 01:11.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
million that he'd raise for the
super PAC
and to flood Iowa and flood New
Hampshire.

01:11.338 --> 01:16.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It has not
worked yet. But
front-runner Donald Trump is
trying ads nonetheless,

01:16.777 --> 01:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
launching his first this week.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: Donald Trump calls it
radical Islamic
terrorism.

01:21.381 --> 01:26.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: With dark
colors and striking
music, the spot talks of fears,
but it may

01:26.153 --> 01:28.488 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also address one of Trump's
worries.

01:28.522 --> 01:34.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER FENN: I think his fear is
that he needs
a strong turnout. If people
don't see him

01:34.962 --> 01:40.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in paid ads, don't see him going
all out in
these states, it might
discourage some of

01:40.834 --> 01:42.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his voters from voting.

01:42.636 --> 01:48.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another ad with
strong tones
from Ted Cruz using a visual
metaphor at the

01:48.342 --> 01:50.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
border.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
I understand that when the
mainstream covers

01:51.478 --> 01:54.181 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
immigration, it often doesn't
see it as an
economic issue.

01:54.214 --> 01:59.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER FENN: Cruz, I think with
his ad this
time of people dressed in suits
and women

01:59.619 --> 02:06.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in high heels walking across
what would be
the border, visually, people now
are looking

02:06.526 --> 02:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for more creativity in their
advertising.

02:08.628 --> 02:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Contrast those
hard-hitting
ads in the crowded GOP race with
the approach

02:13.700 --> 02:16.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the smaller Democratic field,
which is
more biographical.

02:16.903 --> 02:20.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: Praised as one of
America's best
mayors, who governed as a
pragmatist.

02:20.774 --> 02:24.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
When I think about why I'm doing
this, I think

02:24.911 --> 02:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about my mother, Dorothy.

02:26.713 --> 02:31.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Both of those
got big play
online. But Fenn says 70 percent
of campaign

02:31.752 --> 02:33.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ad dollars still go to on-air.

02:33.854 --> 02:39.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER FENN: My sense is, this is
changing,
but we're still going to see, in
this election

02:39.426 --> 02:41.194 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cycle, television will be king.

02:41.228 --> 02:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But for all the
dollars it
brings, we don't yet know how
much television

02:46.066 --> 02:48.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will influence the choice for
president.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

02:50.704 --> 02:55.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We follow the money
now with Matea
Gold. She's a national political
reporter

02:55.542 --> 02:57.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for The Washington Post.

02:57.377 --> 03:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matea, you have covered a lot of
these campaigns,
as have I. We're not going to
say how old

03:00.881 --> 03:05.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we are. But compare this to last
cycle. How
is the money being raised
differently and

03:05.185 --> 03:06.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
spent differently?

03:06.920 --> 03:09.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD, The Washington Post:
So, what
we have seen in this cycle is
the real full

03:09.122 --> 03:14.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flowering of the super PAC
effect, and nearly
every presidential candidate,
with the exception

03:14.594 --> 03:18.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Bernie Sanders and most
recently Donald
Trump, are running with the
support of super

03:18.899 --> 03:20.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PACs this time.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's changed everything.
That's changed
the way they have gotten in the
race, how

03:23.236 --> 03:27.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they have raised money, and it's
changed the
way money is being spent. And
already through

03:27.040 --> 03:32.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mid-December, we saw more than
40 percent
more ads on TV than in the last
cycle at that

03:32.446 --> 03:35.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point. And eight out of 10 of
those ads were
by outside groups.

03:35.382 --> 03:39.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And as Lisa pointed
out in her
piece, it's not biographical.
It's not let

03:39.886 --> 03:41.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
me tell you who I am anymore.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, one of the
things that I
think we're seeing in the
Republican contest

03:44.391 --> 03:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, because it is so incredibly
competitive,
and it's really been focused on
issues about

03:50.097 --> 03:54.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism and ISIS, that those
issues have
really come to the fore in the
advertising

03:54.367 --> 03:56.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much sooner than I think you
usually see at
this point in a campaign.

03:57.003 --> 04:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So who benefits so
far, especially
in the crowded Republican field,
from this

04:02.175 --> 04:04.511 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
approach? For whom is this
approach resonating?

04:04.544 --> 04:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, I think there
is a really
big question about whether the
super PAC is

04:08.849 --> 04:13.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be the real panacea
that some people
thought it was going to be in
this election.

04:13.386 --> 04:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We already saw two candidates,
Scott Walker
and Rick Perry, forced out of
the contest,

04:17.958 --> 04:22.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even though they had millions of
dollars left
in their super PACs. There is a
real question

04:22.062 --> 04:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about whether you can succeed
with the support
of super PACs or whether you
need really more

04:25.899 --> 04:28.168 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
substantial resources in your
campaign.

04:28.201 --> 04:31.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, so then,
explain for us
just one example.

04:31.605 --> 04:36.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Jeb Bush -- you wrote about
this in a
big piece in The Washington Post
this week.

04:36.076 --> 04:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Jeb Bush got into the
field, people thought
he was going to be able to do
what his brother

04:41.148 --> 04:45.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did, clear the field by the
sheer amount of
money he raised. He raised the
money, but

04:45.719 --> 04:47.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he clearly didn't clear the
field. What happened?

04:47.721 --> 04:51.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Money is very
different in this
election than in past elections.

04:51.191 --> 04:56.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the past, it's been seen as a
predictor
of success. When money comes,
there's also

04:56.296 --> 05:02.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a sense that there is a
grassroots support
behind that. Now that donors
that are incredibly

05:02.202 --> 05:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wealthy can give these massive
donations,
it's not necessarily indicative
of any deeper

05:06.873 --> 05:08.608 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
support.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, one of the challenges I
think that Jeb
Bush has had is translating the
support he

05:10.944 --> 05:15.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has among the millionaire class,
who really
put in amazing amount of
resources in the

05:15.115 --> 05:19.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
super PAC, to support on the
ground. And so
while he had a huge amount of
money, other

05:19.586 --> 05:23.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates also had their own
billionaires
supporting them, and they
weren't scared away

05:23.390 --> 05:25.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by his coffers.

05:25.058 --> 05:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Another example, Ben
Carson was
raising money hand over fist for
a while.

05:28.862 --> 05:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was reflecting his
standing in the
polls. Now his standing in the
polls has dropped.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.135 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is it because he didn't spend
the money correctly?

05:35.168 --> 05:40.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, he still is
raising a substantial
amount. He raised $20 million in
the last

05:40.106 --> 05:41.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
quarter.

05:41.942 --> 05:46.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things that online
fund-raising
allows you to do is reach out to
a cohort

05:46.913 --> 05:51.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of non-traditional donors. These
aren't professional
donors that get involved in
party politics.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ben Carson brought a lot of new
people into
the process. And it looks like a
lot of them

05:54.821 --> 05:55.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are still giving him money.

05:55.722 --> 05:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But how is he
spending it?

05:57.490 --> 06:00.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, a lot of that
money has
gone back into raising more
money. And we

06:00.427 --> 06:04.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to get some more
details about his
finances when the reports come
out at the

06:04.197 --> 06:08.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
end of this month. But that is
going to be
a real indicator of a campaign's
success,

06:08.768 --> 06:12.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how much cash they actually have
left on hand
heading into this last final
stretch.

06:12.372 --> 06:17.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We talked about the
billionaires.
What is it? Bernie Sanders calls
them the

06:17.978 --> 06:19.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
millionaires and billionaires.

06:19.713 --> 06:22.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Who are they this time? Are they
spending
their money differently? Last
time, I remember

06:22.816 --> 06:27.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sheldon Adelson kept Newt
Gingrich in the
race simply by writing a check
for a long

06:27.454 --> 06:33.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time, and I think also Rick
Santorum. And
last time, we saw Ron Burkle,
another millionaire,

06:33.693 --> 06:38.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving money to the Clintons.
This time, he
is supporting John Kasich, at
least for now.

06:38.598 --> 06:42.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That seems to be a different --
I don't know,
just a different way of
organizing this.

06:42.936 --> 06:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: One of the things
that's so interesting
is that the donor class has
expanded. We're

06:46.640 --> 06:50.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing new names that are not
your traditional
political givers.

06:50.410 --> 06:56.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the biggest backers of
Senator Ted
Cruz are a family in Texas, the
Wilks brothers,

06:56.883 --> 07:01.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who have made a lot of money
through fracking.
And they have put together $15
million worth

07:01.421 --> 07:04.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of contributions into a super
PAC supporting
Ted Cruz.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a lot of folks who are
not bold-faced
names in the political world are
getting engaged,

07:08.662 --> 07:11.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in part because there are these
new mechanisms
for them to do so.

07:11.531 --> 07:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, and here is
something that
is completely different than
anything we have

07:14.134 --> 07:17.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen before, which is, of
course, is the rise
of Donald Trump before he had
even spent a

07:17.637 --> 07:21.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of money. And even though
now he's starting
to put ads on the air, it seems
like he's

07:21.341 --> 07:23.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
changed the formula as well.

07:23.276 --> 07:28.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: The Trump impact has
completely
transformed how money is being
spent and whether

07:28.148 --> 07:30.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's even effective this time.

07:30.417 --> 07:35.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His rivals complain he's
basically getting
free airtime. And so their paid
media is not

07:35.288 --> 07:39.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to be as potent, because
he's getting
even more airtime just getting
on cable news.

07:39.893 --> 07:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is going to be a real
question. He's
started to spend money now, but
will he actually

07:43.963 --> 07:46.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be able to succeed largely
through earned
media?

07:46.232 --> 07:51.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is this something
that the candidates
are scrambling to counter,
specifically to

07:51.137 --> 07:55.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do with Trump or specifically to
do with his
approach, by maybe, I don't
know, talking

07:55.575 --> 07:57.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about issues?

07:57.444 --> 08:01.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: The issues are
different in each
part of the race, and obviously
the Republicans

08:01.381 --> 08:06.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now are trying to really
outdo each
other with warnings about the
threats facing

08:06.219 --> 08:07.987 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
America.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That seems to be consuming the
Republican
electorate right now. I mean,
concerns about

08:11.825 --> 08:16.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ISIS and terrorism have
overtaken, we have
found, concerns about taxes and
health care

08:16.162 --> 08:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the polls. So, whereas
Obamacare looked
like it was going to be a
driving issue, right

08:20.133 --> 08:23.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, that's not something that
gets as much
attention, at least not on the
air.

08:23.336 --> 08:26.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Who does that
benefit and who
does that hurt so far, at least
in fund-raising?

08:26.873 --> 08:31.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: Well, in
fund-raising, we're going
to see at the end of this month,
but I think

08:31.244 --> 08:35.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ted Cruz and Ben Carson have had
the most
success in their campaigns, and
Donald Trump

08:35.515 --> 08:37.384 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is doing the best in the polls.

08:37.417 --> 08:40.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: OK. Well, we will
see how it shakes
out when people actually start
to vote very

08:40.820 --> 08:41.221 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
soon.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MATEA GOLD: Yes.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Matea Gold of The
Washington Post,
thank you.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Always a pleasure.
Thanks.
