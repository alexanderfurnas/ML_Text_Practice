02:09.000 --> 02:10.733
WITH THE NUCLEAR PROGRAM

02:10.733 --> 02:11.967

02:11.967 --> 02:13.500
GESTURE TO HARD LINERS

02:13.500 --> 02:14.567
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THE OVERTURES

THE SECRETARY OF STATE JOH

02:25.567 --> 02:26.833
NEGOTIATE A DEAL THAT COUL

02:26.833 --> 02:29.200
RESULT IN THE LIFTING OF SOME OF

02:29.200 --> 02:30.967
THE ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AGAINST

02:30.967 --> 02:31.267
IRAN

02:31.267 --> 02:32.467
>> WE ARE NOT BLIND AND I DON'

02:32.467 --> 02:33.700
THINK WE'RE STUPID

02:33.700 --> 02:34.900
I THINK WE HAVE A PRETTY STRON

02:34.900 --> 02:37.067
SENSE OF HOW TO MEASURE WHETHE

02:37.067 --> 02:38.500
OR NOT WE ARE ACTING IN TH

INTERESTS OF OUR COUNTRY AND O

OUR ALLIES, LIKE ISRAEL AND GULF

02:45.233 --> 02:45.933
STATES WILL.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.333
>> BUT REPUBLICAN SENATO

02:47.333 --> 02:48.767
LINDSEY GRAHAM SAID TODAY,

02:48.767 --> 02:49.700
LIFTING THE SANCTIONS WOULD BE A

02:49.700 --> 02:51.100
BIG MISTAKE.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.767
>> WE BELIEVE THAT SANCTIONS AND

02:52.767 --> 02:54.000
THE THREAT OF MILITARY FORCE I

02:54.000 --> 02:55.567
THE ONLY THING THAT WILL BRING

02:55.567 --> 02:57.633
THE IRANIANS TO THE TABLE.

02:57.633 --> 02:59.533
IF WE BACK OFF NOW, I THINK THAT

02:59.533 --> 03:02.267
IS EXACTLY THE WRONG SIGNAL.

03:02.267 --> 03:04.200
>> FOLLOWING HIS LAND SLID

03:04.200 --> 03:05.667
RE-ELECTION LAST TUESDAY, NE

03:05.667 --> 03:07.333
JERSEY GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE

03:14.567 --> 03:15.567
MINORITY VOTERS.

03:15.567 --> 03:17.100
>> YOU GO AND YOU SHOW UP AN

03:17.100 --> 03:18.667
YOU LISTEN AND YOU START TO MAKE

03:18.667 --> 03:20.767
YOUR ARGUMENT ABOUT YOUR

03:20.767 --> 03:21.800
POLICIES

03:21.800 --> 03:26.967
I THINK THE RESULTS SHOW THA

03:26.967 --> 03:28.267
WHAT WE NEED ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

03:28.267 --> 03:29.733
TO LISTEN UP AND SHOW UP I

03:29.733 --> 03:31.200
PLACE WHERE WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN

03:31.200 --> 03:33.967
GREAT AMOUNT OF VOTE BEFORE.

03:33.967 --> 03:36.967
>> CHRISTIE WON 21% OF THE

03:36.967 --> 03:38.167
AFRICAN-AMERICAN VOTE AND

03:38.167 --> 03:39.933
MAJORITY OF THE HIS SPANNI

03:39.933 --> 03:40.200
VOTES.

03:40.200 --> 03:41.633
NUMBERS THAT FAR EXCEED WHAT

03:41.633 --> 03:44.033
REPUBLICANS HAVE DONE IN RECEN

03:44.033 --> 03:44.433
ELECTIONS.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.100
>>> THERE WAS STREET VIOLENCE IN

03:46.100 --> 03:47.467
SAUDI ARABIA FOLLOWING A

03:47.467 --> 03:49.333
WEEK-LONG CRACKDOWN ON

UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS

THOUSANDS AND TWO PEOPLE WER

03:56.167 --> 03:57.967
KILLED

03:57.967 --> 03:58.500
THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT I

03:58.500 --> 04:01.567
ATTEMPTED TO DRASTICALLY ALTER

04:01.567 --> 04:04.167
ITS LABOR FORCE BY OUT MOSTL

04:04.167 --> 04:05.533
AFRICAN LOW SKILLED WORKERS TO

04:05.533 --> 04:07.933
CREATE JOBS FOR A GROWING SAUD

04:07.933 --> 04:08.200
POPULATION

04:08.200 --> 04:10.733
>> THERE IS WORD A MEMOI

04:10.733 --> 04:12.833
WRITTEN BY THE TEENAGER HAS BEEN

04:12.833 --> 04:15.100
BANNED FROM LIBRARIES AND TENS

04:15.100 --> 04:16.567
OF THOUSANDS OF PAKISTAN

04:16.567 --> 04:16.833
SCHOOLS.

04:16.833 --> 04:18.833
AN EDUCATION OFFICIAL SAID THE

04:18.833 --> 04:20.067
BOOK DID NOT SHOW ENOUGH RESPECT

04:20.067 --> 04:20.733
FOR ISLAM.

04:20.733 --> 04:22.433
HE CALLED THE 16-YEAR-OLD,

04:22.433 --> 04:24.000
QUOTING NOW, A TOO

04:24.000 --> 04:25.600
WESTERN POWERS

04:25.600 --> 04:28.000
MEMBERS OF THE TALIBAN SHO

MALALA IN THE HEAD FOR

04:29.733 --> 04:30.900
ADVOCATING FOR THE EDUCATION O

04:30.900 --> 04:31.600
GIRL LAST YEAR

04:31.600 --> 04:33.733
>> CHINA IS NOW THE WORLD'

04:33.733 --> 04:34.967
SECOND LARGEST ECONOMY

04:34.967 --> 04:36.833
WHAT HAPPENS THERE NATURALLY HAS

04:36.833 --> 04:38.200
GREAT ILL REPLY INDICATIONS FO

04:38.200 --> 04:39.400
THE REST OF THE WORLD.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.033
WE WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME

04:41.033 --> 04:42.467
TALKING ABOUT A VERY IMPORTANT

04:42.467 --> 04:43.400
MEETING IN BEIJING

04:43.400 --> 04:45.700
IT INVOLVES THE TOP LEADERS OF

04:45.700 --> 04:48.100
THE RULING PARTY AND IS EXPECTED

04:48.100 --> 04:50.267
TO PRODUCE MAJOR ECONOMI

04:50.267 --> 04:50.433
REFORMS.

04:50.433 --> 04:53.933
THIS IS THE DIRECTOR OF ASIA

04:53.933 --> 04:54.200
STUDIES.

04:54.200 --> 04:55.900
SO HOW IN THIS DAY AND AGE THE

04:55.900 --> 04:57.933
ARE HAVING A CLOSED DOOR MEETING

04:57.933 --> 05:01.600
ABOUT THEIR ECONOMIC POLIC

05:01.600 --> 05:03.333
REFORMS, WHY IS IT S

05:03.333 --> 05:03.600
CONSEQUENTIAL?

05:03.600 --> 05:05.800
THIS IS A GATHERING OF THE TOP

05:05.800 --> 05:07.100
LEADERSHIP OF THE COMMUNIS

05:07.100 --> 05:09.333
PARTY ABOUT THE TOP NOT QUIT

05:09.333 --> 05:10.600
400 MEMBERS OF THE CENTRAL

05:10.600 --> 05:11.333
COMMITTEE AND THE ALTERNAT

05:11.333 --> 05:11.633
MEMBERS.

05:11.633 --> 05:13.133
AND THEY'RE GATHER ORDERING TH

05:13.133 --> 05:14.667
LAY OUT THE TRAJECTORY O

05:14.667 --> 05:16.100
ECONOMIC REFORM FOR THE NEXT

05:16.100 --> 05:17.467
FIVE TO TEN YEARS.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.967
SO IT IS HIGHLY CONSEQUENTIAL.

05:18.967 --> 05:20.200
AND THEY'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT

05:20.200 --> 05:22.567
NOTHING LESS THAN REFORMING TH

05:22.567 --> 05:24.100
FUNDAMENTAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE

05:24.100 --> 05:25.033
CHINESE ECONOMY.

05:25.033 --> 05:26.867
SO WHETHER THEY'RE ABLE TO

05:26.867 --> 05:28.200
ACCOMPLISH THAT, AT THIS MEETING

05:28.200 --> 05:29.500
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS IS

05:29.500 --> 05:31.033
REALLY GOING TO BE INCREDIBL

05:31.033 --> 05:32.533
IMPORTANT FOR CHINA FOR FIVE T

05:32.533 --> 05:33.400
TEN YEARS OUT.

05:33.400 --> 05:36.000
>> SO HAS THE CHINESE MODE

05:36.000 --> 05:36.267
SLOWED

05:36.267 --> 05:41.967
ON THE ONE HAND, THEY'VE LIFTE

05:41.967 --> 05:43.267
600 MILLION PEOPLE OUT O

05:43.267 --> 05:43.967
POVERTY BY MANUFACTURING

05:43.967 --> 05:46.267
EVERYTHING THE REST OF THE WORLD

05:46.267 --> 05:46.533
USES

05:46.533 --> 05:48.200
ARE THEY RUNNING OUT OF STEAM?

05:48.200 --> 05:49.833
>> NOT ONLY IS THE ECONOMI

05:49.833 --> 05:51.433
GROWTH DROPPING FROM 10 TO 9 T

05:51.433 --> 05:55.433
8 AND NOW CLOSER TO 7%

05:55.433 --> 05:58.000
GDP GROSS BUT THERE IS A SENSE

05:58.000 --> 06:00.600
THEY HAVE TO UNDERTAKE SOM

06:00.600 --> 06:01.833
FUNDAMENTAL TRANSFORMATION

06:01.833 --> 06:02.800
WITHIN THE ECONOMY IF THEY'R

06:02.800 --> 06:04.100
GOING ON SUSTAIN THEIR GROWT

06:04.100 --> 06:05.667
MOVING FORWARD

06:05.667 --> 06:06.800
HOW WILL YOU TRANSFORM CHINA

06:06.800 --> 06:07.800
FROM BEING A MANUFACTURING

06:07.800 --> 06:11.000
NATION TO AN INNOVATION NATION

06:11.000 --> 06:11.867
REBALANCING THE ECONOMY, MOVIN

06:11.867 --> 06:14.367
AWAY FROM INVESTMENT LED, EXPORT

06:14.367 --> 06:15.967
LED GROWTH TO CONSUMPTION BASE

06:15.967 --> 06:16.100
ECONOMY.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.200
AND HOW ARE YOU GOING TO REDUC

06:18.200 --> 06:19.400
THE ROLE OF VESTED INTERESTS

06:19.400 --> 06:22.633
WITHIN THE CHINESE ECONOMY

06:22.633 --> 06:24.300
THE ENTERPRISE THAT'S SUCK UP SO

06:24.300 --> 06:27.467
MUCH OF THE BANK LENDING AND

06:27.467 --> 06:29.767
RELY SUCH GREAT SUBSIDIES THAT

06:29.767 --> 06:32.100
THEY'RE CRUSHING PRIVATE

06:32.100 --> 06:35.367
ENTERPRISE

06:35.367 --> 06:37.633
>> SO SO MANY PEOPLE DISPLACED

06:37.633 --> 06:39.400
38 COMMITTING SUE SIDES IN

06:39.400 --> 06:41.033
CERTAIN PARTS OF THE COUNTRY

06:41.033 --> 06:42.333
WE'RE HEARING THERE ARE CERTAI

06:42.333 --> 06:44.167
70s ARE ALMOST GHOST CITIES THAT

06:44.167 --> 06:45.300
HAVE BEEN BUILT AND NOBODY I

06:45.300 --> 06:46.000
LIVING IN THEM

06:46.000 --> 06:48.033
AND WE SEE A REAL ESTATE BUBBL

06:48.033 --> 06:48.533
EMERGING TOO

06:48.533 --> 06:52.733
>> SO A BIG PART OF THE ECONOMIC

06:52.733 --> 06:54.300
CHALLENGE AT THIS POINT IS THE

06:54.300 --> 06:55.033
MISALLOCATION OF CAMDEN.

06:55.033 --> 06:57.433
THE WAY THE CENTER AND LOCAL

06:57.433 --> 06:58.600
GOVERNMENTS INTERACT

06:58.600 --> 07:01.367
THE RELIANCE OF LOCA

07:01.367 --> 07:03.133
GOVERNMENTS ON REAL ESTATE O

07:03.133 --> 07:06.333
LAND SALES FOR 70 TO 90% OF TH

07:06.333 --> 07:08.100
REVENUES

07:08.100 --> 07:09.067
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE THEM TAKIN

07:09.067 --> 07:10.467
THE LAND FROM THE FARMER

07:10.467 --> 07:11.400
ILLEGALLY AND YOU HAVE THA

07:11.400 --> 07:13.367
SOCIAL UNREST.

07:13.367 --> 07:16.833
SO ALL OF THESE SMALL AREAS OF

07:16.833 --> 07:17.767
REFORM HAVE HUGE SOCIA

07:17.767 --> 07:18.033
CONSEQUENCES

07:18.033 --> 07:19.600
AND THESE ARE PRECISELY TH

07:19.600 --> 07:23.167
KINDS OF ISSUES THAT THEY NEED

07:23.167 --> 07:24.133
TO DEAL WITH

07:24.133 --> 07:25.300
>> SO SOMETHING WE'LL WATCH FO

07:25.300 --> 07:26.200
ON TUESDAY

07:26.200 --> 07:27.933
THAT'S WHEN THEY RELEASE THE

07:27.933 --> 07:28.200
POLICY

07:28.200 --> 07:29.600
>> THEY'LL RELEASE ON IT TUESDAY

07:29.600 --> 07:30.700
BUT I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO

07:30.700 --> 07:33.767
BEAR IN MINE, THAT'S STAGE ONE

07:33.767 --> 07:35.267
STAGE TWO IS RELEASING THE

07:35.267 --> 07:35.500
POLICY

07:35.500 --> 07:36.900
STAGE TWO AND THREE ARE PUTTIN

11:35.733 --> 11:37.800
AND THAT I THINK IS THE SUCCES

WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT BECAUS

12:14.333 --> 12:16.700
OUR HORIZON IS SO SHORT, YOU

12:16.700 --> 12:18.933
SOMETIMES HAVE TO FORC

YOURSELF, BASICALLY ASK SOMEBODY

ELSE, I KNOW THAT I'M KIND O

12:22.533 --> 12:23.500
SHORT-SIGHTED.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.667
I AM MYOPIC.

IF YOU DO NOT FORCE ME, I KNOW

12:29.200 --> 12:30.733
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.600
THAT'S BASICALLY HOW IT WORKS.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.700
IT HAS TO DO WITH HUMA

12:34.700 --> 12:34.833
BEHAVIOR

12:34.833 --> 12:36.833
BECAUSE FOR SOMEBODY WHO IS 25

12:36.833 --> 12:39.600
OR 30 OR EVEN 40, IT IS VERY

12:39.600 --> 12:39.833
ABSTRACT

12:39.833 --> 12:42.767
WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU'RE 65.

12:42.767 --> 12:44.967
>> 26-YEAR-OLD MELANIE MARTINS

12:44.967 --> 12:46.633
IS THE KIND OF PERSON HE I

12:46.633 --> 12:47.433
TALKING ABOUT.

SHE LIVES WITH HER PARENTS SOUTH

12:49.833 --> 12:50.667

BETTER JOB

13:06.833 --> 13:08.500
MAYBE IF I SAVE UP SOME MONE

13:08.500 --> 13:12.200
MYSELF ON TOP OF MY PENSION.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.433
IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE.

13:13.433 --> 13:16.167
IT IS HARD TO THINK ABOU

13:16.167 --> 13:21.067
SOMETHING THAT IS 40 YEARS

13:21.067 --> 13:21.333
FUTURE

13:21.333 --> 13:23.867
>> JOHN MARTINS, HER DAD, IS A

13:23.867 --> 13:25.100
50-YEAR-OLD RAILWAY ENGINEER AND

13:25.100 --> 13:26.233
HE IS WORRIED ABOUT MELANIE'

13:26.233 --> 13:26.633
FUTURE

13:26.633 --> 13:28.700
THAT SHE WON'T HAVE TH

13:28.700 --> 13:30.233
COMFORTABLE RETIREMENT HE IS

13:30.233 --> 13:30.467
EXPECTING.

13:30.467 --> 13:35.267
BUT EVEN HIS RETIREMENT HA

13:35.267 --> 13:36.367
ALREADY BEEN DELAYED

13:36.367 --> 13:39.567
I COUNTED ON UNTIL I WAS 61.

13:39.567 --> 13:41.500
THEN I WORKED FOR 40 YEARS FOR

13:41.500 --> 13:42.600
THE DUTCH RAILWAY.

13:42.600 --> 13:44.367
THE GOVERNMENT SAID I HAVE T

13:44.367 --> 13:46.033
WORK UNTIL I'M 67 SO THAT'

13:46.033 --> 13:47.367
STILL QUITE A WHILE.

13:47.367 --> 13:49.233
>> THE RETIREMENT AGE IS GOING

13:49.233 --> 13:50.833
UP BECAUSE IN THE NETHERLANDS,

13:50.833 --> 13:52.700
MUCH LIKE THE U.S., THEI

13:52.700 --> 13:54.233
POPULATION IS GETTING OLDER.

13:54.233 --> 13:55.967
THERE ARE MORE RETIREES AN

13:55.967 --> 13:57.900
THEY'RE LIVING LONGER.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.300
FOR THE DUTCH, THAT MEAN MOR

14:00.300 --> 14:01.167
PAYMENTS COMING OUT OF PENSION

14:01.167 --> 14:02.800
FUNDS FOR LONGER AND ALSO LIKE

14:02.800 --> 14:04.867
THE U.S., THERE ARE FEWER YOUN

14:04.867 --> 14:06.333
WORKERS SO THERE ARE FEWER

14:06.333 --> 14:07.933
PEOPLE PAYING INTO THE FUNDS

14:07.933 --> 14:10.267
THIS IMBALANCE IS ONLY EXPECTE

14:10.267 --> 14:12.367
TO ACCELERATE.

14:12.367 --> 14:13.700
WHAT'S MORE, THE FUNDS

14:13.700 --> 14:15.300
THEMSELVES, MANY OF WHICH AR

14:15.300 --> 14:17.100
INVESTED TOOK A HUGE HIT DURIN

14:17.100 --> 14:19.800
FINANCIAL CRISIS SO SOMETHIN

14:19.800 --> 14:20.767
HAD TO GIVE.

14:20.767 --> 14:22.733
IN THE SPRING OF 2013, THE DUTCH

14:22.733 --> 14:23.933
PENSION FUNDS WERE FORCED TO

14:23.933 --> 14:27.067
TAKE AN UNPRECEDENTED STEP

14:27.067 --> 14:30.000
66 OF THE COUNTRY'S 415 FUND

14:30.000 --> 14:30.967
ANNOUNCE THEY HAD WOULD MAKE

14:30.967 --> 14:32.067
CUTS TO THE PAYMENTS THEY MADE

14:32.067 --> 14:33.267
TO PENSIONERS.

14:33.267 --> 14:36.000
SOME OF THE CUTS WERE MODEST A

14:36.000 --> 14:37.100
HALF OF 1%

14:37.100 --> 14:39.800
SOME WERE STEEPER AT UP TO 7%.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.200
THOSE CUTS CAME ABOUT BECAUS

14:41.200 --> 14:42.767
DUTCH LAW REQUIRES THAT PENSIO

14:42.767 --> 14:46.000
FUNDS TO HAVE SOCK AWAY AT LEAST

14:46.000 --> 14:47.167
105% OF ALL THEIR CURREN

14:47.167 --> 14:47.833
LIABILITIES.

14:47.833 --> 14:50.500
IF A FUND DROPS BELOW THAT

14:50.500 --> 14:52.167
LEVEL, PENSION MANAGERS HAVE THE

14:52.167 --> 14:54.400
AUTHORITY TO MAKE WORKERS PA

14:54.400 --> 14:56.900
MORE OR GIVE OUT LESS TO

14:56.900 --> 14:57.233
RETIREES

14:57.233 --> 14:59.533
>> IT IS THIS CHECKIVE SHARING

14:59.533 --> 15:01.567
OF RISK THAT IS ANOTHER HALLMARK

15:01.567 --> 15:03.200
OF THE DUTCH SYSTEM.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.033
UNLIKE PUBLIC PENSIONS IN TH

15:05.033 --> 15:06.367
U.S.,ERS WOULD ARE GUARANTEED

15:06.367 --> 15:07.300
SET PAYMENT.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.300
WHETHER THERE ARE FUNDS IN THE

15:08.300 --> 15:09.233
PLAN OR NOT.

15:09.233 --> 15:10.967
OR INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT PLANS

15:10.967 --> 15:15.500
LIKE IRAs OR 401(k)s WHERE EAC

15:15.500 --> 15:17.200
INDIVIDUAL BEARS THE SOLE RICK

15:17.200 --> 15:19.100
THE DUTCH HAVE SPREAD THOS

15:19.100 --> 15:20.500
RISKS AND THE BENEFITS ACROS

15:20.500 --> 15:21.967
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS

15:21.967 --> 15:23.167
THAT MAKES THEIR SYSTEM MUCH

15:23.167 --> 15:26.767
MORE RESILIENT IN TOUGH TIMES.

15:26.767 --> 15:29.300
>> MOST PEOPLE FIND PENSIONS

15:29.300 --> 15:30.133
FAIRLY BORING.

15:30.133 --> 15:35.267
LIKE MORTGAGES, THEY DON'T THINK

15:35.267 --> 15:38.767
ABOUT FINANCIAL STUFF.

15:38.767 --> 15:40.333
>> SHE IS THE ECONOMICS EDITOR

15:40.333 --> 15:42.333
OF ONE OF THE BIGGEST NEWSPAPERS

15:42.333 --> 15:43.033
IN THE COUNTRY

15:43.033 --> 15:45.167
SHE SAYS YES, THE DUTCH SYSTEM

15:45.167 --> 15:47.967
IS RESILIENT BUT SHE ARGUES,

15:47.967 --> 15:49.933
DESPITE THE WISHFUL THINKING O

15:49.933 --> 15:51.133
MANY, THESE DEMOGRAPHI

15:51.133 --> 15:54.800
CHALLENGES ARE NOT GOING AWA

15:54.800 --> 15:57.267
ANY TIME SOON.

15:57.267 --> 15:58.033
>> IT IS A STRUCTURAL THING.

15:58.033 --> 15:59.467
NOT ONLY THE CRISIS.

15:59.467 --> 16:00.767
I THINK PART OF THE POPULATION

16:00.767 --> 16:02.033
DOESN'T GET IT YET

16:02.033 --> 16:03.500
THEY THINK WHY DO WE HAVE TO

16:03.500 --> 16:05.500
LOWER THE PENSIONS NOW

16:05.500 --> 16:07.400
BECAUSE IT IS ONLY TEMPORARY

16:07.400 --> 16:09.167
YOU JUST HAVE TO SIT OUT THE

16:09.167 --> 16:13.533
CRISIS AND THEN WE CAN GO BACK

16:13.533 --> 16:20.000
TO THE OLD WAYS.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.367
>> THE QUESTION BECOMES TO KEE

16:21.367 --> 16:22.567
THE SYSTEM GOING, WHO EXACTL

16:22.567 --> 16:24.567
HAS TO ADJUST?

16:24.567 --> 16:26.433
JOHN MARTINS WORRIES IN THE END,

16:26.433 --> 16:28.200
YOUNGER WORKERS LIKE HIS

16:28.200 --> 16:32.533
DAUGHTER MELANIE WILL HAVE T

16:32.533 --> 16:34.100
SHOULDER MORE OF THE BURDEN BY

16:34.100 --> 16:39.000
PAYING MORE IN AND GETTING LES

16:39.000 --> 16:39.467
OUT.

16:39.467 --> 16:41.767
I GET THAT MONEY BECAUSE I

16:41.767 --> 16:43.567
ALREADY BUILD UP FOR 30 YEARS.

16:43.567 --> 16:44.933
SO IN THE END IT WILL BE OKA

16:44.933 --> 16:45.767
FOR ME

16:45.767 --> 16:47.967
BUT FOR MELANIE, IT WON'T BE

16:47.967 --> 16:48.267
ENOUGH

16:48.267 --> 16:50.033
>> HE UNDERSTANDS, HE MAY HAVE

16:50.033 --> 16:51.900
TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO HELP OU

16:51.900 --> 16:55.400
HIS DAUGHTER'S GENERATION.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.567
>> IF I HAVE TO PAY HIGHER

16:58.567 --> 16:59.633
PENSION PREMIUMS OR RECEIVE

16:59.633 --> 17:00.933
LOWER PENSION TO MAKE SURE M

17:00.933 --> 17:02.200
DAUGHTER WILL HAVE A PENSION

17:02.200 --> 17:05.333
THAT'S WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN.

17:05.333 --> 17:06.433
>> POLICE OFFICER JOSEPHINE JUST

17:06.433 --> 17:08.833
A FEW YEARS FROM RETIREMEN

17:08.833 --> 17:10.567
BELONGS TO ONE OF THE PENSIO

17:10.567 --> 17:12.000
FUNDS THAT ALREADY DID MAKE

17:12.000 --> 17:15.567
SMALL CUT TO RETIREES.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.100
>> IT COULD BE IF THE CRISIS

17:18.100 --> 17:19.500
CONTINUES IT WILL HAVE TO BE

17:19.500 --> 17:20.800
LOWERED AGAIN.

17:20.800 --> 17:21.833
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

17:21.833 --> 17:22.700
I HOPE NOT

17:22.700 --> 17:24.333
IT IS LESS THAN I EXPECTED BUT

17:24.333 --> 17:25.133
IT ENOUGH.

17:25.133 --> 17:27.133
I THINK I CAN BE HAPPY WITH TH

17:27.133 --> 17:28.100
PENSION I'LL RECEIVE

17:28.100 --> 17:30.933
>> DESPITE HIS RECENT TROUBLES

17:30.933 --> 17:32.000
IT IS WORTH REMEMBERING TH

17:32.000 --> 17:33.667
DUTCH PENSION SYSTEM IS NEARLY

17:33.667 --> 17:34.700
100% FUNDED.

17:34.700 --> 17:35.900
COVERS A HUGE MAJORITY OF TH

17:35.900 --> 17:37.633
COUNTRY AND REMAINS A MODEL FO

17:37.633 --> 17:39.567
THE REST OF THE YEAR

17:39.567 --> 17:40.767
JOSEPHINE USED A COMMON DUTC

17:40.767 --> 17:42.267
EXPRESSION TO REFLECT HE

17:42.267 --> 17:46.433
REALISM ABOUT THE FUTURE

17:46.433 --> 17:47.567
>> Translator: I DON'T THINK THE

17:47.567 --> 17:50.000
TREE CAN KEEP GROWING INTO THE

17:50.000 --> 17:50.267
HEAVENS.

17:50.267 --> 17:52.333
>> HOW DOES A DUTCH RETIREMENT

17:52.333 --> 17:53.667
SYSTEM COMPARE WITH WHAT WE HAVE

17:53.667 --> 17:54.300
IN THE UNITED STATES

17:54.300 --> 17:56.267
EARLIER I SAT DOWN WITH JUSTIN

17:56.267 --> 17:57.833
FOX, THE EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE

17:57.833 --> 17:58.867
HARVARD BUSINESS REVIEW.

17:58.867 --> 18:00.333
I STARTED BY ASKING HIM ABOU

18:00.333 --> 18:04.567
THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TW

18:04.567 --> 18:04.867
COUNTRIES.

18:04.867 --> 18:06.867
>> THE U.S. SYSTEM STARTED AFTER

18:06.867 --> 18:08.400
WORLD WAR II A BIT LIKE TH

18:08.400 --> 18:09.333
DUTCH SYSTEM

18:09.333 --> 18:09.800
CORPORATIONS PROVIDING PENSION

18:09.800 --> 18:10.567
FOR PEOPLE

18:10.567 --> 18:12.300
AND THAT KIND OF FELL APAR

18:12.300 --> 18:15.367
DURING THE 1970s

18:15.367 --> 18:16.400
CORPORATIONS WITH PENSIONS OUT

18:16.400 --> 18:18.033
THERE AND THERE ARE LOTS O

18:18.033 --> 18:19.667
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT

18:19.667 --> 18:20.067
GIVE THEM.

18:20.067 --> 18:21.900
SO WHAT WE SWITCHED TO IN TH

18:21.900 --> 18:23.633
U.S. IS THE DUTCH PUT THIS

18:23.633 --> 18:25.567
EMPHASIS ON KEEPING IT

18:25.567 --> 18:25.967
COLLECTIVE

18:25.967 --> 18:27.633
HAVING EVERYBODY IN AN INDUSTRY,

18:27.633 --> 18:29.367
IN A PENSION TOGETHER.

18:29.367 --> 18:31.900
OR SOME LARGE CORPORATIONS HAV

18:31.900 --> 18:34.967
THEIR PENSIONS

18:34.967 --> 18:36.900
IN THE U.S. WE MOVED TO THIS

18:36.900 --> 18:39.433
TOTALLY ATOMIZED 401(k) SYSTEM

18:39.433 --> 18:40.867
WHERE MOST PEOPLE ARE BASICALL

18:40.867 --> 18:42.200
RESPONSIBLE ON THEIR OWN FOR

18:42.200 --> 18:44.267
SAVING FOR RETIREMENT.

18:44.267 --> 18:45.500
>> WHAT CAN WE TAKE AWAY FRO

18:45.500 --> 18:46.833
THAT SYSTEM THAT WE COUL

18:46.833 --> 18:50.000
POSSIBLY INSTITUTE HERE?

18:50.000 --> 18:50.967
>> WELL, ONE THING THAT IS

18:50.967 --> 18:52.700
ALREADY HAPPENING IS SORT OF

18:52.700 --> 18:54.400
AUTOMATICALLY SETTING PEOPLE U

18:54.400 --> 18:56.633
SO THEY SAVE IN A 401(k)

18:56.633 --> 18:58.133
I THINK MORE AND MORE EMPLOYERS,

18:58.133 --> 18:59.633
MY EMPLOYER, HARVARD UNIVERSITY,

18:59.633 --> 19:00.733
JUST ANNOUNCED THIS.

19:00.733 --> 19:03.533
THAT BASICALLY UNLESS YOU TELL

19:03.533 --> 19:06.333
THEM NOT TO, THEY'RE GOING T

19:06.333 --> 19:07.467
AUTOMATICALLY START TAKING,

19:07.467 --> 19:10.433
THINK IT IS INITIALLY 3% OF YOUR

19:10.433 --> 19:12.233
SALARY AND PUTTING IT ASIDE AN

19:12.233 --> 19:15.200
INCREASING IT EVERY YEAR BY ON

19:15.200 --> 19:16.267
MORE PERCENTAGE POINT UNTIL YO

19:16.267 --> 19:17.667
REACH THE STATUTORY LIMIT.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.300
THAT'S ALREADY HAPPENING OUT

19:19.300 --> 19:19.433
THERE.

19:19.433 --> 19:25.200
THE OTHER THING IS ON A PAYOUT

19:25.200 --> 19:27.600
END WHERE HERE YOU RETIRE.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.600
YOU GET SOCIAL SECURITY BU

19:28.600 --> 19:30.067
YOU'RE LIKELY TO JUST, IF YO

19:30.067 --> 19:43.967
DID A GOOD JOB AND SAVED, IT I

19:43.967 --> 19:45.467
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT TO HAV

19:45.467 --> 19:46.700
GUARANTEED INCOME THEY THEY DI

19:46.700 --> 19:48.400
RATHER THAN A BIG PILE OF MONEY.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.667
IF I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GOING T

19:49.667 --> 19:51.967
BE LIVING TO 100 OR 75, I NEED

19:51.967 --> 19:53.567
TO SAVE A TON OF MONEY TO MAKE

19:53.567 --> 19:55.667
IT TO 100.

19:55.667 --> 19:57.233
IF YOU'VE GOT THOUSANDS OF

19:57.233 --> 19:58.567
PEOPLE ALL IN THE SAME SYSTE

19:58.567 --> 20:01.167
AND IT IS JUST GUARANTEEING

20:01.167 --> 20:02.700
PAYOUT UNTIL THEY KEEL OVER,

20:02.700 --> 20:05.000
THAT'S A LOT CHEAPER

20:05.000 --> 20:07.233
AND IT'S BEEN A LOT OF PRESSUR

20:07.233 --> 20:08.833
IN THE UNITED STATES TO, IT IS

20:08.833 --> 20:11.400
CALLED ANNUITIZE THEIR 401(k

20:11.400 --> 20:13.067
BUT SO FAR NOT MANY PEOPLE ARE

20:13.067 --> 20:14.033
DOING IT

20:14.033 --> 20:15.633
>> I THINK HE BROUGHT THIS UP IN

20:15.633 --> 20:15.933
THE PIECE.

20:15.933 --> 20:17.933
WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES THIS S

20:17.933 --> 20:20.100
UNAMERICAN TO BE TOLD FORCIBLY

20:20.100 --> 20:21.467
TO SAVE VERSUS HAVING THE OPTION

20:21.467 --> 20:22.167
TO SAVE?

20:22.167 --> 20:24.167
IS IT A CULTURAL THING

20:24.167 --> 20:26.667
IS IT A PSYCHOLOGICAL THING?

20:26.667 --> 20:28.200
A BEHAVIORAL ECONOMIC THING?

20:28.200 --> 20:31.467
>> I THINK WE HAVE THE FORCE

20:31.467 --> 20:32.200
SAVING IN THE U.S.

20:32.200 --> 20:35.367
THE BULK OF THE WORK FORCE WAS

20:35.367 --> 20:37.100
DOING CORPORATE WORK FORCE

20:37.100 --> 20:39.500
I DON'T THINK THERE IS ANY

20:39.500 --> 20:40.500
PEOPLE DIDN'T PROTEST.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.100
MARCH THROUGH THE STREETS ABOU

20:42.100 --> 20:42.500
IT

20:42.500 --> 20:43.733
WHEN THAT SYSTEM STARTED RUNNING

20:43.733 --> 20:46.167
INTO TROUBLE, IT HAD ITS

20:46.167 --> 20:46.500
LIMITATIONS.

20:46.500 --> 20:47.600
YOU COULDN'T MOVE COMPANIES.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.400
AND ANOTHER WAS, IF YOUR COMPANY

20:49.400 --> 20:51.100
WENT BELLY UP, THERE WAS

20:51.100 --> 20:51.333
TROUBLE.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.733
NOW WE'RE SEEING THAT WITH

20:52.733 --> 20:54.667
STATES AND MUNICIPALITIE

20:54.667 --> 20:59.033
RUNNING INTO TROUBLE WITH THEI

20:59.033 --> 21:16.700
PENSIONS

21:16.700 --> 21:18.133
YOUR WORK FORCE ISN'T GROWIN

21:18.133 --> 21:19.467
AND IT IS GROWING VERY FAST.

21:19.467 --> 21:20.667
THAT PUTS PRESSURE ON TH

21:20.667 --> 21:21.133
SYSTEM

21:21.133 --> 21:23.800
AND ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR

21:23.800 --> 21:25.233
REPORT, THEIR CONCERNS ARE REA

21:25.233 --> 21:27.267
BUT STILL WE'RE TALKING ABOU

21:27.267 --> 21:30.500
SLIGHT DECREASED IN HOW MUCH

21:30.500 --> 21:32.433
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH

21:32.433 --> 21:33.533
THEY'LL GET IN THE FUTURE.

21:33.533 --> 21:35.700
THE U.S. IS IN BETTER SHAPE WITH

21:35.700 --> 21:35.800
THAT

21:35.800 --> 21:37.567
BECAUSE WE'RE A YOUNGER COUNTRY.

21:37.567 --> 21:38.400
WE HAVE MORE IMMIGRATION

21:38.400 --> 21:40.267
WE HAVE A FASTER GROWING WOR

21:40.267 --> 21:40.867
FORCE.

21:40.867 --> 21:41.867
