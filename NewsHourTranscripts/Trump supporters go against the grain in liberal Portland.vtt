JUDY WOODRUFF: We turn now to
the second half of our series on
political divisions in unlikely

00:04.766 --> 00:06.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
places.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In May, "NewsHour" producer
Elizabeth Flock wrote about a
group of women in a conservative

00:10.666 --> 00:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
West Virginia coal mining town
who spoke out against President
Trump and received backlash

00:16.400 --> 00:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from their neighbors.

00:18.500 --> 00:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Her new piece, out this week,
is an in-depth look at a group
of conservative women trying

00:24.533 --> 00:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to find their voice in a city
known for its progressive
politics, Portland, Oregon.

00:28.466 --> 00:29.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And Liz joins me now.

00:29.566 --> 00:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Liz, welcome back.

00:30.966 --> 00:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You were in Portland for
several days and just got back.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why did you choose that city?

00:35.566 --> 00:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: In part, I
chose Portland just because
it was a progressive city, and

00:39.833 --> 00:44.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was really interested to see,
what is it like to be a Trump
supporter in such a liberal

00:44.566 --> 00:46.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
place?

00:46.533 --> 00:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there had also been a
number of recent pro-Trump
rallies even after the election

00:50.433 --> 00:55.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Portland and the surrounding
area, and those had ended in
some violent clashes between

00:56.200 --> 00:57.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the left and the right.

00:57.733 --> 00:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I was really interested
to see what was going on there.

00:59.733 --> 01:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we
actually covered --
covered some of those.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did you find these women?

01:04.333 --> 01:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did you get in touch with
them and how easy was it to
get them to trust you, to talk

01:07.300 --> 01:08.300 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to you?

01:08.300 --> 01:10.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Yes.

01:10.200 --> 01:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I found all of them online
through pro-Trump Facebook
groups, Women for Trump.

01:15.466 --> 01:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was really hard
to gain their trust.

01:16.833 --> 01:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of them had no
interested in speaking to me.

01:18.900 --> 01:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a perception that the
media is very liberal, very
biased, produces fake news.

01:25.233 --> 01:28.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some of them said they'd
speak to me and later
made the decision that
they didn't want to.

01:28.100 --> 01:33.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one of the women I met in
a public park because she said:
"I'm concerned about meeting

01:33.000 --> 01:34.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

01:34.466 --> 01:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know what you're
going to do when I meet you.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maybe you will try to hurt me.

01:37.033 --> 01:39.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think we should met
in a public place."

01:39.033 --> 01:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So there was a lot of
fear of the media and
how they're portrayed.

01:41.866 --> 01:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tell us about
what it's like for them?

01:46.100 --> 01:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do they go through as they
express their political views?

01:49.866 --> 01:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Well,
they certainly get a lot of
pushback for their beliefs.

01:53.733 --> 01:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And some of them do have more
extreme beliefs, to be certain.

01:58.033 --> 02:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others hold more moderate
views, but they're all sort of
clumped together as one thing.

02:02.866 --> 02:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're called racists
and bigots regularly.

02:07.066 --> 02:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they're attacked online.

02:08.700 --> 02:11.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're told that
they should go die.

02:11.066 --> 02:15.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One woman told me, one day,
when she was walking her dog and
wearing a Trump hat, a man just

02:15.333 --> 02:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
stopped to say to her: "Your
kind isn't wanted here.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You should just leave."

02:21.066 --> 02:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they go to these
rallies, they face even
more of an extreme reaction.

02:28.066 --> 02:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many people in Portland, in the
Pacific Northwest come out to
counterprotest these rallies.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And some of them are
more liberal Portlanders
who just want to say,
I don't agree with what

02:35.733 --> 02:37.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you have to say.

02:37.733 --> 02:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But others are militant leftists
that show up and basically
say, we're unapologetic about

02:43.066 --> 02:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
using physical violence
against these Trump supporters.

02:45.166 --> 02:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, certainly, violence happens
on both sides, but the militant
leftists are very unapologetic

02:50.900 --> 02:52.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and open about it.

02:52.933 --> 02:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I think, for
people who didn't realize
it, it's eye-opening.

02:54.466 --> 02:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of the women you talked
to, Liz, is transgender.

02:57.233 --> 02:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Yes.

02:58.400 --> 03:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Her name is Athena Brown.

03:00.933 --> 03:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Athena switched parties
from being a Democrat
to being a Republican
in mid-2016, just before

03:06.733 --> 03:08.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the election.

03:08.800 --> 03:12.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She became fed up, she said,
with what she saw as political
correctness on the left and

03:13.833 --> 03:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the liberal LGBT community.

03:16.666 --> 03:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she told me: "You know,
when I became - - when I came
out as transgender, I lost

03:20.533 --> 03:22.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two friends.

03:22.033 --> 03:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When I came out as Republican,
I lost 100 friends on Facebook."

03:25.433 --> 03:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so she really saw that
as an example of the left's
intolerance to people who do not

03:31.166 --> 03:32.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
share their views.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do
these women keep going?

03:34.466 --> 03:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In that environment, where
they are such a minority,
what keeps them going?

03:39.700 --> 03:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do they deal with it?

03:41.733 --> 03:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: I think they're
actually invigorated by the
pushback that they're getting.

03:47.433 --> 03:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they really feel that
it's worth, it's important to
go out and defend what they

03:52.166 --> 03:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
see as an attack on free speech.

03:54.800 --> 03:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, one of the
interesting things I saw is, as
the left tried to shut down what

04:01.800 --> 04:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they had to say, these Trump
supporters, these women were
more determined to go out and to

04:06.266 --> 04:08.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speak.

04:08.366 --> 04:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just wanted to get more
active and became more even
strident in their beliefs.

04:10.833 --> 04:15.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, in a way,
it was a mirror image of the
anti-Trump women you talked to

04:16.700 --> 04:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in conservative West Virginia.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Absolutely.

04:20.066 --> 04:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In both places, I think, as
people tried to shut down what
they had to say, these women

04:23.766 --> 04:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just wanted to speak out louder.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They wanted to get more
involved and more active.

04:28.133 --> 04:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in both places, it felt
like people on opposite sides
of the political divide were

04:34.266 --> 04:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not speaking to each other.

04:36.233 --> 04:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were speaking past each
other, and there was no interest
in really hearing what the

04:40.366 --> 04:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
other side had to say.

04:41.866 --> 04:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Discouraging,
but some great reporting.

04:45.166 --> 04:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Liz Flock, thank you very much.

04:47.533 --> 04:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH FLOCK: Thanks.

04:49.166 --> 04:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
