21:10.336 --> 21:11.837 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRITIC I READ OF THIS MOVE SAID

21:11.837 --> 21:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE COMPANIES LIKE AETNA AND

21:13.539 --> 21:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED HEALTH JUST ARE DOING

21:14.773 --> 21:15.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESS A DIFFERENT WAY.

21:15.741 --> 21:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT HAVE

21:16.675 --> 21:18.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONE BUSINESS WITH EXCHANGES

21:18.210 --> 21:20.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH ARE DOING JUST FINE, THAT

21:20.112 --> 21:21.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY HAVE NOT ADJUSTED TO THE

21:21.747 --> 21:22.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARKETPLACE.

21:22.148 --> 21:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE COMPANIES THAT ARE

21:24.350 --> 21:25.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOING WELL THAT SAY THEY'RE

21:25.951 --> 21:27.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAKING MONEY ON THE EXCHANGES.

21:27.653 --> 21:28.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE'S CLEARLY SOME

21:28.921 --> 21:29.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRATEGIES, SOME THINGS INSURERS

21:29.922 --> 21:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BIG NATIONAL INSURERS, JUST

21:36.996 --> 21:38.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T APPEAR TO HAVE HIT ON

21:38.364 --> 21:39.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:39.698 --> 21:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:43.102 --> 21:45.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT DO I DO IN 2017?

21:45.104 --> 21:46.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PROBLEM FOR FOLKS.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

21:50.976 --> 21:52.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
