JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.672 --> 00:06.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.673 --> 00:08.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.508 --> 00:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH, Supreme Court
Nominee: Any one,
any law is going to get a fair
and square

00:12.980 --> 00:14.848 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deal with me.

00:14.882 --> 00:18.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump's
Supreme Court
pick is grilled by Senate
Judiciary Committee

00:18.785 --> 00:22.923 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats during the second day
of his confirmation
hearing.

00:22.956 --> 00:28.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then: President Trump lobbies
Republican members
of Congress to vote for the
revised health

00:28.762 --> 00:33.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care replacement bill, warning
them their
reelection is at risk.

00:33.934 --> 00:39.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a Denver community focuses
on all aspects
of early education to give kids
a better start.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNA SMITH, Runs Aquaponics
Greenhouse: Healthy
food is foundational to overall
health and

00:44.177 --> 00:45.879 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
well-being.

00:45.913 --> 00:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very important component
to having
-- helping kids to grow up, pay
attention

00:50.918 --> 00:53.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in class, you know, be strong
and active.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:57.024 --> 01:01.328 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.361 --> 01:14.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's been an
all-day interrogation
for Supreme Court nominee Neil
Gorsuch at

01:14.274 --> 01:16.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his Senate confirmation hearing.

01:16.310 --> 01:22.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The federal appeals judge fended
off Democrats'
efforts today to ferret out his
views on hot-button

01:22.282 --> 01:24.084 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

01:24.117 --> 01:27.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He also worked to show
independence from the
man who picked him under
friendly questioning

01:27.988 --> 01:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from Republican Lindsey Graham.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.258 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Had you
ever met President Trump
personally?

01:33.226 --> 01:36.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH, Supreme Court
Nominee: Not until
my interview.

01:36.296 --> 01:37.931 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:37.965 --> 01:40.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LINDSEY GRAHAM: In that
interview, did he
ever ask you to overrule Roe v.
Wade?

01:41.001 --> 01:41.969 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: No, Senator.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.236 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:43.270 --> 01:44.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM: What would you
have done if
he had asked?

01:44.538 --> 01:50.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, I would
have walked
out the door.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not what judges do.

01:53.113 --> 01:57.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't do it at that end of
Pennsylvania
Avenue, and they shouldn't do it
at this end

01:57.250 --> 01:59.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
either, respectfully.

01:59.119 --> 02:03.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will have
extensive excerpts
from and analysis of today's
hearing in just

02:03.657 --> 02:05.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a moment.

02:05.492 --> 02:09.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, the other big story
of this day,
a full-court press by the
president and the

02:09.730 --> 02:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speaker of the House, Paul Ryan,
to pass a
new health care bill that aims
to replace

02:14.668 --> 02:20.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major components of the current
law, the Affordable
Care Act, known as Obamacare.

02:20.040 --> 02:25.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Time is ticking before a crucial
vote in the
House on Thursday, and
Republicans know there

02:25.912 --> 02:29.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may not be any Democrats who
will support
it then.

02:29.383 --> 02:32.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins reports from
Capitol Hill.

02:32.452 --> 02:36.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Witness the art
of trying
to close the deal.

02:36.289 --> 02:37.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Do you have the votes,
Mr. President?

02:37.791 --> 02:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Think so.

02:39.960 --> 02:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: President Trump
at the Capitol
pushing for votes on the GOP
health care bill,

02:44.498 --> 02:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
telling members privately their
jobs are at
risk if they don't pass a repeal
bill.

02:50.404 --> 02:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House spokesman Sean
Spicer summed up
the argument later.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
Yes, I think there's going to be
a price to

02:55.375 --> 02:57.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be paid, and it's going to be
with their own
voters.

02:57.778 --> 03:03.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're going to have go
back and explain
to them why they made a
commitment to them

03:03.183 --> 03:05.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then didn't follow through.

03:05.052 --> 03:08.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As the White
House pushes,
GOP leaders at the Capitol are
sounding more

03:08.288 --> 03:09.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enthusiastic.

03:09.289 --> 03:10.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: I
just got to say, editorial, the
president

03:12.492 --> 03:14.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just came here and knocked the
ball out of
the park.

03:14.327 --> 03:16.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He knocked the cover off the
ball.

03:16.096 --> 03:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a big moment, and I think
our members
are beginning to appreciate just
what kind

03:19.466 --> 03:21.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of rendezvous with destiny we
have right here.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But destiny
requires votes.

03:23.970 --> 03:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To win them, Speaker Ryan and
his team did
more than invite a president;
they changed

03:28.375 --> 03:36.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their bill, adding 21 pages of
policy amendments
last night geared to win key
groups, for conservatives,

03:36.283 --> 03:41.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some Medicaid changes, like
letting states
add a work requirement for the
program and

03:41.321 --> 03:46.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
giving states the option of a
block grant
Medicaid payment that would
likely cut the

03:46.293 --> 03:48.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
program.

03:48.128 --> 03:53.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally, a new limit from
Republicans: No
new states could join the
Medicaid expansion.

03:53.200 --> 03:57.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Add to that, again, for
conservatives, faster
tax cuts.

03:57.204 --> 04:03.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This new version would repeal of
all Obamacare
taxes immediately, instead of
next year.

04:03.677 --> 04:08.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But those changes didn't go far
enough for
some in the conservative Freedom
Caucus, like

04:08.482 --> 04:09.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ohio's Jim Jordan.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Congratulations on
the...

04:10.484 --> 04:11.685 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM JORDAN (R), Ohio: Oh, it
wasn't as good
as we hoped.

04:13.253 --> 04:17.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He is still a
hard no, as
the Freedom Caucus seems split.

04:17.657 --> 04:22.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is why last night's changes
also offer
something to a different group:
moderates.

04:22.395 --> 04:28.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For them, Republicans added
roughly $85 billion
in tax deductions for health
care, with the

04:28.869 --> 04:33.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
idea that the Senate will target
that money
more to seniors.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a result, Representative Tom
MacArthur
of New Jersey is now a yes.

04:37.244 --> 04:38.979 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:39.012 --> 04:40.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TOM MACARTHUR (R), New Jersey:
The speaker,
the majority leader of the
Senate and the

04:40.814 --> 04:45.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president have all agreed that
they would
publicly make it clear that's
the only purpose

04:45.385 --> 04:50.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for which they will support the
use of the
$85 billion that we put into the
bill.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But it's close.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Freshman Dan Donovan is still
thinking.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.262 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.164 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN DONOVAN (R), New York: I'm
not saying
yet.

04:57.197 --> 05:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's close
enough that GOP
leaders are looking for votes
from small groups,

05:00.634 --> 05:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like members from Upstate New
York.

05:03.370 --> 05:08.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, Republicans added a
provision
saying billions in county
Medicaid costs must

05:08.608 --> 05:11.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be picked up by New York State.

05:11.444 --> 05:13.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Representative Chris Collins
pushed the idea.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.881 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:14.915 --> 05:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS COLLINS (R), New York: It
shifts the
burden from the local taxpayer
back to the

05:18.451 --> 05:22.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state government, which is how
it's handled
in every other state in the
nation.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But New York
Democrat Joe
Crowley balked.

05:24.391 --> 05:26.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE CROWLEY (D), New York: This
will significantly
hurt individuals in New York who
could face

05:28.628 --> 05:34.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a multibillion-dollar Medicaid
shortfall if
this amendment were to be
included.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:35.635 --> 05:37.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Their
bill is such a miss.

05:37.504 --> 05:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Another key New
York Democrat,
Senate Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer, railed

05:42.309 --> 05:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
against the bill and aimed
squarely down Pennsylvania
Avenue.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:48.081 --> 05:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: President Trump,
who has tried
to put his name on nearly
everything in his

05:50.684 --> 05:56.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
career, ties, steaks, water,
doesn't want
his name on this bill.

05:56.623 --> 06:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, the president himself is
here on the
Hill today to sell the bill to
House Republicans.

06:02.929 --> 06:05.065 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Make no mistake.

06:05.098 --> 06:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is Trumpcare.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Democrats hope
this health
care vote sinks some of these
Republicans

06:10.870 --> 06:14.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in two years and the president
in four.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Mr. President Trump is
selling the opposite
message,

06:16.176 --> 06:19.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: There are going to
be adjustments
made, but I think we will get
the vote on

06:19.779 --> 06:20.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thursday.

06:20.780 --> 06:22.115 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

06:22.148 --> 06:24.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: ... that
Republicans need
this bill to survive.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The vote remains very close at
this hour.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And tomorrow could be a key day.

06:28.255 --> 06:32.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House leadership sources tell me
they expect
a kind of updated score from the
Congressional

06:32.459 --> 06:34.361 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Budget Office on their bill.

06:34.394 --> 06:39.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Remember, that initial
conclusion from the
CBO on the first bill came up
with the forecast

06:39.733 --> 06:44.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that 24 million Americans fewer
would have
insurance under the House GOP
plan.

06:44.804 --> 06:47.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see if the changes
affect that conclusion
-- Judy.

06:48.008 --> 06:51.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa, that
would be interesting
if the Congressional Budget
Office came out

06:51.344 --> 06:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with a different analysis.

06:53.213 --> 06:58.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also striking today, the
president's warning
to lawmakers that they could
lose their seats,

06:58.518 --> 07:00.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as you were reporting.

07:00.253 --> 07:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How close does the White House
and do the
Republican leaders on the Hill
think this

07:04.557 --> 07:06.226 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
is?

07:06.259 --> 07:09.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I spoke with a
spokeswoman
from House Speaker Paul Ryan's
office.

07:09.296 --> 07:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she said to me -- I said, is
it close?

07:11.564 --> 07:12.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She said, yes, absolutely.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We know that it's close.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we're pushing forward to
that Thursday
vote.

07:16.569 --> 07:19.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's talk about the more kind
of concrete
numbers, Judy.

07:19.506 --> 07:25.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Essentially, House Republicans
can lose 21
of their members, maybe 22 on
this vote, and

07:25.378 --> 07:27.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still get it across the finish
line.

07:27.147 --> 07:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I spoke to some members of the
Freedom Caucus,
like Tom Massie.

07:30.350 --> 07:35.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He told me his personal whip
count has 30
hard no's, way more than the 21.

07:35.355 --> 07:36.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's very fluid right now.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are those hard no's or not?

07:38.525 --> 07:40.327 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Very difficult to say, Judy.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's incredibly close, if
not leaning
away from the direction where
House Speaker

07:44.564 --> 07:46.299 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ryan wants it to go.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then, Lisa,
as you just
reported, this afternoon, Lisa,
the White

07:49.469 --> 07:54.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House called in more moderate
Republicans
to try to persuade them.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are the arguments they're
using with
them?

07:56.476 --> 07:58.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This is part of
the full-court
press.

07:58.545 --> 08:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They want those moderate votes.

08:00.780 --> 08:05.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are telling those moderates
that they
believe that this whole plan
will, in fact,

08:05.919 --> 08:10.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make health care better for
those in their
districts by bring down
premiums, offering

08:10.590 --> 08:12.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
more choices.

08:12.459 --> 08:15.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the kind of core Republican
arguments
we have seen, but they have got
to stare straight

08:15.061 --> 08:19.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the face of many of these
moderates who
have heavy Medicaid populations,
lots of folks

08:19.933 --> 08:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Medicaid, and they are
concerned about
what will happen to them.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I talked to Charlie Dent.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is one of those moderate
members concerned
about Medicaid.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He walked out of that White
House office.

08:28.541 --> 08:29.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I spoke to him.

08:30.009 --> 08:32.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said he still has the
same reservations
that he had going in.

08:32.912 --> 08:37.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Lisa,
finally, if they
are able to get it through the
House, what

08:37.083 --> 08:39.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are the early indications in the
Senate?

08:39.152 --> 08:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There's trouble
there too,
Judy.

08:41.821 --> 08:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, we know of at least
two Republican
senators, Rand Paul and Mike
Lee, who say

08:47.027 --> 08:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they are no's on this exact
bill, Mike
Lee restating his emphatic
opposition in the

08:52.899 --> 08:54.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
past day.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they can't lose any more
Republicans than
that.

08:57.003 --> 08:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But not just talking about
moderates.

08:58.938 --> 09:03.910 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some core members of the
Republican leadership
over there like Bob Corker are
questioning

09:03.943 --> 09:08.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this bill and questioning what
it would mean
for health care in their states,
so, a lot

09:08.348 --> 09:11.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of questions, not just here, but
also on the
Senate side.

09:11.117 --> 09:13.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Remember, Judy, this is on a
very fast pace.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The idea is to go through House
Rules tomorrow.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.558 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would have a long day on
the House floor
Thursday.

09:18.591 --> 09:23.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, the earliest it could get
to the Senate
is maybe even for a vote on
Tuesday.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the best-case scenario
for Republicans,
maybe getting this whole thing
to the White

09:26.766 --> 09:28.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
House next week.

09:28.601 --> 09:32.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Judy, right now, it also
looks like a
worst-case is possible, which
you and I are

09:32.038 --> 09:35.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
standing here talking about the
House vote
still next week.

09:36.009 --> 09:37.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All to be determined.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a lot of
moving parts.

09:39.145 --> 09:40.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lisa, thank you very much.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I know you're watching it all.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will be talking to you
more about it.

09:42.782 --> 09:55.962 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you, Lisa.

09:55.995 --> 10:00.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now back to examination of the
second day
of Senate hearings to confirm
federal Judge

10:00.700 --> 10:03.002 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme
Court.

10:03.036 --> 10:08.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joining me at the table today,
"PBS NewsHour"
hour Supreme Court analyst
Marcia Coyle of

10:08.408 --> 10:12.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"The National Law Journal," Amy
Howe, editor
of SCOTUSblog.com.

10:12.879 --> 10:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pam Karlan, she's a professor of
law at Stanford
University.

10:17.484 --> 10:21.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She worked in the Justice
Department during
the Obama administration.

10:21.087 --> 10:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Ilya Shapiro is a senior
fellow in constitutional
studies at the Cato Institute.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a libertarian think tank.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome all of you to the
program.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thanks for being here.

10:32.866 --> 10:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's take a look first at just
a couple of
the exchanges that came this
morning, starting

10:37.437 --> 10:42.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with a question from the
chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, Senator Chuck
Grassley.

10:42.408 --> 10:44.110 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES GRASSLEY (R), Iowa: Tell
us whether
you would have any trouble
ruling against

10:47.747 --> 10:49.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a president who appointed you.

10:49.616 --> 10:52.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH, Supreme Court
Nominee: That's
a softball, Mr. Chairman.

10:52.719 --> 10:58.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have no difficulty ruling
against or for
any party, other than based on
what the law

10:58.391 --> 11:02.462 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the facts in the particular
case require.

11:02.495 --> 11:09.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm heartened by the support I
have received
from people who recognize that
there's no

11:09.035 --> 11:13.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
such thing as a Republican judge
or a Democratic
judge.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We just have judges in this
country.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.811 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.281 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D),
California: President
Trump and others have said you
are the next

11:21.314 --> 11:23.149 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Scalia.

11:23.182 --> 11:28.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's only fair to
ask you, do
you disagree with any of the
majority opinions

11:28.555 --> 11:31.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Judge Scalia joined in
these cases?

11:31.457 --> 11:36.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: If I indicate my
agreement or
disagreement with a past
precedent of the

11:36.763 --> 11:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States Supreme Court, I'm
doing two
things that worry me, sitting
here.

11:42.368 --> 11:47.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first thing I'm doing is,
I'm signaling
to future litigants that I can't
be a fair

11:47.040 --> 11:48.141 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
judge in their case.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.976 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:50.009 --> 11:54.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Then how do we
have confidence
in you that you won't just be
for the big

11:54.314 --> 11:57.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
corporations, that you will be
for the little
man?

11:57.951 --> 12:02.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: So, what I think
can give you
comfort in this area is,
Senator, I know a

12:02.355 --> 12:04.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
case or two has been mentioned
yesterday.

12:04.991 --> 12:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Respectfully, I suggest that
doesn't represent
the body of my work.

12:09.929 --> 12:18.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have written 2,700 -- I
participated in
2,700 opinions over 10.5 years.

12:18.738 --> 12:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you want cases where I
have ruled for
the little guy, as well as the
big guy, there

12:23.309 --> 12:24.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are plenty of them, Senator.

12:24.711 --> 12:26.079 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:26.112 --> 12:29.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PATRICK LEAHY (D), Vermont:
President Trump
promised a Muslim ban.

12:29.315 --> 12:36.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He still has on his Web site to
this day -- he's
called for a total and complete
shutdown of

12:36.289 --> 12:39.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Muslims entering the United
States.

12:39.425 --> 12:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a Republican congressman
recently said
the best thing the president
could do for

12:45.632 --> 12:53.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his Muslim ban is to make sure
he has Gorsuch
on the Supreme Court before the
appeals get

12:53.239 --> 12:54.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to that point.

12:54.607 --> 12:58.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, a lot of
people say
a lot of silly things.

12:58.077 --> 12:59.045 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:59.078 --> 13:00.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PATRICK LEAHY: Well, that's more
than silly.

13:00.947 --> 13:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a -- he wants -- this
congressman wants
you on the court so they can
uphold a Muslim

13:05.451 --> 13:06.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ban.

13:06.819 --> 13:10.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, he has no
idea how
I would rule in that case.

13:10.823 --> 13:16.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Senator, I am not going to
say anything
here that would give anybody any
idea how

13:16.663 --> 13:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would rule in any case like
that that could
come before the Supreme Court or
my court

13:20.566 --> 13:21.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the 10th Circuit.

13:21.668 --> 13:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would be grossly improper of
a judge to
do that.

13:24.671 --> 13:29.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be a violation of the
separation
of powers and judicial
independence if someone

13:29.142 --> 13:34.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sitting at this table, in order
to get confirmed,
had to make promises or
commitments about

13:34.814 --> 13:39.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
how they would rule in a case
that's currently
pending and likely to way its
way to the Supreme

13:39.619 --> 13:40.586 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Court.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:42.488 --> 13:49.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PATRICK LEAHY: Are -- the
president's national
security determinations, are
those reviewable

13:49.729 --> 13:50.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by the court?

13:50.797 --> 13:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, no man is
above the
law.

13:53.399 --> 13:57.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Those are just a
few excerpts.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those were mainly this morning.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are more we're going to
show you in
just a minute.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But let's talk about what we
just saw.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we want to remind our
viewers that these
hearings are still going on.

14:04.877 --> 14:08.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're expected to go into the
evening tonight
here in Washington.

14:08.781 --> 14:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia Coyle, first, we heard
Judge Gorsuch
say, I have -- he has no idea
how he would

14:13.786 --> 14:15.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rule in that case.

14:15.621 --> 14:17.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is basically saying to
these senators,
I'm not going to tell you how
I'm going to

14:17.824 --> 14:21.160 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
do, what I'm going to think
about any case.

14:21.194 --> 14:24.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Was he successful in really not
sharing that
kind of information?

14:24.997 --> 14:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well, I think the senators are
accustomed

14:27.467 --> 14:30.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to hearing that from Supreme
Court nominees.

14:30.670 --> 14:37.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is a very common response
to questions
about particular cases that
might come before

14:37.276 --> 14:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Supreme Court or older
decisions of the
Supreme Court.

14:41.114 --> 14:48.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Judy, the thing I took away
from the
early exchange is the emphasis
in the questions

14:48.755 --> 14:54.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and in the defense by
Republicans of the judge's
independence from President
Trump.

14:54.994 --> 14:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is a burden for Judge
Gorsuch.

14:57.130 --> 15:03.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's entirely of
President Trump's
creation, based on his speech in
the campaign

15:03.970 --> 15:10.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he would appoint judges who
would overrule
Roe v. Wade, as well as his
criticism of federal

15:10.309 --> 15:12.178 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
judges.

15:12.211 --> 15:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the question -- to
me, that was
a dominant theme on both sides,
one, the Democrats

15:18.117 --> 15:23.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to show he may not be
independent,
and the Republicans buttressing
his independence.

15:23.189 --> 15:27.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ilya Shapiro with
the Cato
Institute, is that how you heard
what was

15:28.027 --> 15:29.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
going on today?

15:29.862 --> 15:32.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ILYA SHAPIRO, Cato Institute:
Well, I think
he did a good job in rebutting
any charges

15:32.932 --> 15:35.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that he was a stooge of
President Trump of
some sort.

15:36.002 --> 15:39.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not sure what a Trumpian or
a populist
kind of judge would be.

15:39.806 --> 15:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, he was straight from
Federalist Society
central casting.

15:43.042 --> 15:46.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm a card-carrying member of
that so-called
far-right extremist
organization, as some

15:46.846 --> 15:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
senators called it, by the way.

15:48.781 --> 15:53.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think it's not going to
stick to
the wall, trying to call him an
associate

15:54.020 --> 15:57.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
with some of the more
controversial pronouncements
of the president.

15:57.190 --> 16:01.294 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Pam Karlan, same
question.

16:01.327 --> 16:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Were these senators able to pin
Judge Gorsuch
in one direction or another
today?

16:07.567 --> 16:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM KARLAN, Stanford Law School:
Well, I think
there was one place -- and this
is kind of

16:11.771 --> 16:15.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interesting, given your excerpt
-- where he
did give an indication, because
having said

16:15.408 --> 16:19.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Senator Feinstein that he
wouldn't say
anything about which opinions he
agreed with

16:19.278 --> 16:25.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or not, he then went out of his
way several
times to praise Justice Scalia's
opinion in

16:25.051 --> 16:28.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a case called United States
against Jones
about GPS devices on cars.

16:28.788 --> 16:32.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, well, you know, the
principles
of the Fourth Amendment don't
change, but

16:32.892 --> 16:34.627 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
technology does.

16:34.660 --> 16:38.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's interesting here is, the
question,
as Senator Klobuchar kind of
made clear in

16:38.831 --> 16:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her questioning is, well, what
else changes?

16:41.500 --> 16:45.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because if Judge Gorsuch can say
the Fourth
Amendment carries through, even
though James

16:45.671 --> 16:51.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Madison didn't know about DNA or
GPS, what
about the fact that the framers
didn't know

16:51.944 --> 16:56.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the fact that gay people
can have loving
relationships the same way
straight people

16:56.082 --> 16:57.817 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can?

16:57.850 --> 17:01.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when Judge Gorsuch says, no
man is above
the law, the real question is,
what's the

17:01.320 --> 17:03.155 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law?

17:03.189 --> 17:07.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does the Constitution prohibit
the president
from making xenophobic or
religiously bigots

17:07.927 --> 17:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exclusions of people from the
United States,
or doesn't it?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, saying no man is above the
law doesn't
answer the question of what the
law is.

17:13.833 --> 17:18.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's the stake of
what's going
on today in the hearings.

17:18.271 --> 17:22.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Howe with
SCOTUSblog, so,
what did you pick up from all
this?

17:22.041 --> 17:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY HOWE, SCOTUSblog.com: As
Marcia said,
I mean, there wasn't a lot of
substance.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, again, that's something
that the senators
do expect.

17:28.981 --> 17:33.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that carried over even to
some other areas
where we have gotten some
substantive responses

17:33.853 --> 17:36.055 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
from nominees in the past.

17:36.088 --> 17:41.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Amy Klobuchar of
Minnesota asked Judge
Gorsuch about his views on
cameras in the

17:41.961 --> 17:43.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
courtroom.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, normally, what we have
gotten from the
last few nominees is, you know,
something

17:47.266 --> 17:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
along the lines of, well, that
sounds interesting.

17:49.368 --> 17:54.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, I would have to talk
to my colleagues
about it once I was on the
Supreme Court,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if I were fortunate enough to be
appointed.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Gorsuch wouldn't even go
that far.

17:59.612 --> 18:03.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said that he hadn't really
thought about
it, which was kind of
surprising, given that

18:03.783 --> 18:07.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it has come up at the last few
confirmation
hearings.

18:07.453 --> 18:11.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he said he
was open to
it, but he wouldn't -- he
certainly wouldn't

18:11.891 --> 18:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
commit in either direction.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Marcia, back to you.

18:15.294 --> 18:20.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the -- when Senator Leahy was
trying to
get him to talk about the travel
ban, the

18:20.266 --> 18:26.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notion, comments that President
Trump made
during the campaign about
whether he would

18:26.539 --> 18:31.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- whether people who were
Muslim should be
banned and trying to tie it to
what's happened

18:31.877 --> 18:38.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more recently, you spoke earlier
about this
effort to figure out how
independent he is

18:38.384 --> 18:39.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from the president.

18:39.385 --> 18:41.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Right.

18:41.287 --> 18:43.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Was he
successful, do you think,
in persuading these senators
that he is his

18:43.322 --> 18:45.157 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
own man?

18:45.191 --> 18:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, I think,
probably, a number
of senators have already made up
their minds

18:49.762 --> 18:55.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about Judge Gorsuch and how
they're going
to vote or not vote for him.

18:55.634 --> 19:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Judge Gorsuch did the
best he could
in terms of answering the
questions.

19:02.308 --> 19:08.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Leahy also did the best
he could to
get him to respond to even broad
questions,

19:08.647 --> 19:14.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like, is a religious test
constitutional under
the First Amendment?

19:14.920 --> 19:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He tried a back-door way, a
front-door way.

19:18.357 --> 19:25.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it ultimately -- the judge
would only
talk in broad terms, and finally
said, it

19:25.264 --> 19:30.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seems to me the facts that
you're giving sound
very much like cases that are
now pending

19:30.603 --> 19:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
around the country, meaning the
travel ban.

19:33.039 --> 19:36.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so he wasn't going to tip
his hand on
that.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But you're right.

19:37.610 --> 19:39.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This all has to do with
independence.

19:39.478 --> 19:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can tell you, Judy, I have
never seen
in recent Supreme Court
confirmation hearings

19:45.151 --> 19:51.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so much emphasis on trying to
find out if
a nominee is independent of the
appointing

19:51.190 --> 19:52.425 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's
listen to two other
excerpts.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now, these came this afternoon.

19:56.228 --> 20:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They begin with Rhode Island
Democratic Senator
Sheldon Whitehouse, raised the
question of

20:01.600 --> 20:03.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so-called dark money.

20:03.402 --> 20:10.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is money in the political
campaigns in
American politics that is spent
anonymously.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We don't know who is giving the
money.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's how that exchange
started.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then you will hear another
one.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:17.716 --> 20:21.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE (D), Rhode
Island: Now,
we have this $10 million that is
being spent

20:21.520 --> 20:25.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on behalf of your confirmation.

20:25.091 --> 20:32.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think, for instance, that
we on this
panel ought to know who is
behind that?

20:32.198 --> 20:35.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, that's a
policy question
for this body.

20:35.267 --> 20:42.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's ample room for this
body to pass
disclosure laws for dark money
or anything

20:43.008 --> 20:44.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
else it wishes to.

20:44.710 --> 20:46.412 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It can be tested in the courts.

20:46.445 --> 20:49.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Senator, with all respect,
the ball is
in your court.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

20:51.417 --> 20:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: Is it any
cause of concern
to you that your nomination is
the focus of

20:56.755 --> 21:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a $10 million political spending
effort, and
we don't know who is behind it?

21:01.594 --> 21:05.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, there is
a lot about
the confirmation process today
that I regret.

21:05.197 --> 21:06.165 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
A lot.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: Yes?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEIL GORSUCH: A lot.

21:10.836 --> 21:16.509 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When Byron White sat here, it
was 90 minutes.

21:16.542 --> 21:18.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was through this body in two
weeks.

21:18.944 --> 21:22.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he smoked cigarettes while
he gave his
testimony.

21:22.148 --> 21:25.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a great deal about this
process I
regret.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I regret putting my family
through this.

21:27.887 --> 21:28.854 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:28.888 --> 21:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: But to my
question?

21:31.590 --> 21:36.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, the fact
of the matter
is, it is what it is, and it's
this body that

21:36.929 --> 21:38.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
makes the laws.

21:38.731 --> 21:44.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you wish to have more
disclosure, pass
a law, and a judge will enforce
it, Senator.

21:44.737 --> 21:46.105 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL FRANKEN (D), Minnesota: Well,
let's think
back to 2004 election.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's look at Ohio, where you
volunteered.

21:49.175 --> 21:55.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ohio is one of 11 states in 2004
where Republicans
working to support the
reelection campaign

21:55.481 --> 21:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also worked to put anti-gay
marriage amendments
on the ballot.

21:58.717 --> 22:01.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, you were a campaign worker
in Ohio.

22:01.253 --> 22:04.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were a member of the group
Lawyers for
Bush/Cheney.

22:04.089 --> 22:08.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a lawyer and as a student of
the Constitution,
how did you feel about the right
the marry

22:08.594 --> 22:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being put to a popular vote?

22:11.330 --> 22:18.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, I don't
recall any
involvement in that issue during
that campaign.

22:18.704 --> 22:20.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I remember going to Ohio.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.140 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:21.173 --> 22:22.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: Were you aware of
that issue at
all?

22:22.274 --> 22:23.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Oh, certainly I
was aware of
it.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.009 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AL FRANKEN: And how did you feel
about it?

22:25.911 --> 22:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL GORSUCH: Senator, my
personal views -- any
revelation of my personal views
about this

22:27.880 --> 22:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
matter would indicate to people
how I might
rule as a judge, mistakenly, but
it might.

22:33.485 --> 22:35.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have to be concerned about
that.

22:35.921 --> 22:41.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to
come right out
of that to Ilya Shapiro and say,
the Democratic

22:41.527 --> 22:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senators made a point of noting
that Judge
Gorsuch has worked in the past
in Republican

22:48.400 --> 22:50.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political campaigns.

22:50.236 --> 22:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does that have an effect, should
it have any
effect on how senators consider
these nominees?

22:55.207 --> 22:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ILYA SHAPIRO: I don't think
that's unusual.

22:57.509 --> 23:02.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Kagan, for example,
during her hearing,
it came up how she worked from
her college

23:02.715 --> 23:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
days all the way through the
Clinton White
House in very political roles.

23:06.485 --> 23:12.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She wrote an article in my
former newspaper,
The Daily Princetonian, about
her experiences

23:12.424 --> 23:13.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in a congressional race.

23:13.959 --> 23:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's not disqualifying.

23:15.794 --> 23:19.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it would be odd for
someone who wants
to be involved in public life to
never have

23:19.665 --> 23:23.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expressed any sort of political
views or acted
on some firmly held beliefs.

23:23.535 --> 23:29.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Pam Karlan,
and then, of course, going on to
note that

23:29.041 --> 23:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the judge declined to say
anything about what
he remembered about the role of
gay rights

23:36.482 --> 23:39.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being on the ballot in that Ohio
campaign
back in 2004?

23:39.385 --> 23:44.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAM KARLAN: Well, the thing is,
everybody
who is nominated to the Supreme
Court gives

23:44.189 --> 23:48.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exactly the same kinds of
answers to those
questions.

23:48.227 --> 23:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we all recognize that the
justices are
going to differ when those
issues come up

23:53.165 --> 23:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Supreme Court.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the real question is, how
do they go
about thinking about those
issues?

23:57.536 --> 24:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Senator Klobuchar
made a major
effort to get Judge Gorsuch to
talk about

24:03.676 --> 24:05.377 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
originalism.

24:05.411 --> 24:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was willing to talk about
it when it
came to technology, and say that
technology

24:08.981 --> 24:10.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had changed.

24:10.649 --> 24:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for example, movies are now
protected,
even though there were no movies
in 1789,

24:15.621 --> 24:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and GPS devices are -- on cars
constitute
a search because they would be a
trespass

24:21.593 --> 24:23.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1789.

24:23.128 --> 24:28.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he didn't recognize, for
example, that
society changes in the same way.

24:28.567 --> 24:32.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I thought it was really
quite striking
that he admits that the word he
and his in

24:32.204 --> 24:37.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Constitution now include
women, but he
doesn't seem interested or
willing in talking

24:37.843 --> 24:43.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about those issues when they
don't involve
the kinds of claims that
movement conservatives

24:43.415 --> 24:46.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have raised in the past.

24:46.218 --> 24:51.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also made another point that
I just want
to kind of get out there, and
that is that

24:51.857 --> 24:57.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judge Gorsuch a number of times
in some of
the cases that he likes the
highlight as his

24:57.096 --> 25:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more liberal or little guy
decisions then
goes on after the narrow
pro-little guy ruling

25:05.104 --> 25:11.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to put in these concurrences the
kind of hints
where he might want to go if he
were on the

25:11.110 --> 25:12.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Supreme Court.

25:12.911 --> 25:16.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, well, I'm just kind
of raising
my hand to show my bosses what
questions are

25:16.048 --> 25:17.816 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

25:17.850 --> 25:22.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really educational what
those questions
are, because one of the ones
that he's raised

25:22.454 --> 25:29.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is whether campaign
contributions should be
subject to the same kind of
strict scrutiny

25:29.128 --> 25:33.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under the First Amendment that
other forms
of spending get.

25:34.032 --> 25:35.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's a really big issue,
because...

25:35.634 --> 25:37.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:37.703 --> 25:40.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I just want to
interrupt, because
I do want to get to -- I think
that's an interesting

25:40.639 --> 25:41.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
point that you raise.

25:42.007 --> 25:43.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Amy Howe, did we learn
something about
that from him today?

25:43.909 --> 25:48.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY HOWE: He -- as Pam said, he
really sort
of talked about it in terms of,
well, it's

25:48.814 --> 25:50.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not my job to decide this issue.

25:50.749 --> 25:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can't overrule the Chevron
case, the idea
that you should defer to an
agency's determination,

25:56.755 --> 25:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but I wanted to flag it for my
bosses.

25:59.758 --> 26:04.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the point about politics,
I think there
was a little Democrats trying to
have their

26:04.363 --> 26:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cake and eat it, too, here,
because, on the
one hand, one of the Democratic
senators was

26:08.834 --> 26:13.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lamenting that there wouldn't be
anyone on
the Supreme Court who held
public office.

26:13.472 --> 26:19.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, on the other hand, Senator
Al Franken
was essentially accusing Judge
Gorsuch of

26:19.411 --> 26:25.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
having been involved in politics
in the context
of talking about Judge Garland,
because Judge

26:25.651 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gorsuch such put off questions
about Judge
Garland earlier with a sentence
about, well,

26:30.656 --> 26:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's politics, and I don't get
involved
in politics.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who was President
Obama's nominee
-- Who was President Obama's...

26:34.660 --> 26:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ILYA SHAPIRO: You know, his one
campaign finance
case that he was on was a
unanimous decision

26:39.131 --> 26:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
written by an Obama appointee.

26:40.899 --> 26:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't think -- you know,
it just goes
into, he really does a good job
of reading

26:44.636 --> 26:48.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the cases before him; 97 percent
of them were
unanimous.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he had fewer dissents
from his opinions
than his colleagues on the 10th
Circuit.

26:52.010 --> 26:54.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And yet, Marcia,
you have pointed
out that it's different on an
appellate court

26:54.913 --> 26:55.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than it is at the Supreme Court.

26:56.014 --> 26:57.483 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: It is.

26:57.516 --> 27:01.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think this is really hard
stuff to get
across in a Senate hearing.

27:01.153 --> 27:09.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senator Franken's question,
especially about
LGBT, same-sex marriage, he
couldn't say,

27:09.194 --> 27:18.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well, you know, how does an
originalist view
this, and would you have been
with Justice

27:18.770 --> 27:24.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scalia in dissent on those cases
that broaden
the rights?

27:24.376 --> 27:30.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just very hard, so he had
to go in a
backward sort of way to try to
see what the

27:30.782 --> 27:32.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
judge was thinking.

27:32.551 --> 27:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, at one point, Judge
Gorsuch sort
of criticized one of the
senators for picking

27:37.923 --> 27:41.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one case to show he was against
the little
guy.

27:41.126 --> 27:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, if you're going to pick
and choose
cases, well, I can pick and
choose cases that

27:45.664 --> 27:47.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
show I'm for the little guy.

27:47.466 --> 27:53.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the senators said, we pick
and choose
because we're trying to find out
who you are.

27:53.972 --> 27:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And this is what they have got.

27:55.874 --> 27:58.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have got to hone in on
things like that.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Pam Karlan,
speaking of
who he is, I thought he showed
more personality,

28:01.747 --> 28:07.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, than we expected to see
today, and
I guess a little bit yesterday.

28:07.052 --> 28:08.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
There was humor.

28:08.420 --> 28:12.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a sort of jockeying
with the senators
a little bit.

28:12.457 --> 28:14.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But just quickly, I want to get
each one of
you.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We only have about a minute.

28:15.861 --> 28:19.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you think the senators did
the job they
needed to do today to pull out
of him what

28:20.032 --> 28:20.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they should?

28:21.033 --> 28:24.036 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to ask you each in 10 or
15 seconds.

28:24.069 --> 28:27.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAM KARLAN: Well, I can do it in
one second.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.173 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.174 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

28:29.207 --> 28:30.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

28:30.208 --> 28:31.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That calls for a follow-up
tomorrow.

28:31.443 --> 28:32.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Amy Howe?

28:32.444 --> 28:34.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY HOWE: I think they did.

28:34.146 --> 28:37.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was a little subdued
in the first
-- the morning, but I think that
Senators

28:37.115 --> 28:41.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whitehouse, Klobuchar and
Franken in particular
tried to really talk substance
with him.

28:41.787 --> 28:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
think, Ilya?

28:43.589 --> 28:47.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ILYA SHAPIRO: I think there
wasn't that much
here that we didn't already
know, if you had

28:47.492 --> 28:50.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already been doing your homework
and reading
his opinions beforehand.

28:50.596 --> 28:54.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I doubt this hearing will change
anybody's
vote on either the filibuster or
the nomination

28:55.000 --> 28:56.768 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

28:56.802 --> 28:59.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, hopefully, it educates the
public about
the sorts of issues that
senators and judges

28:59.504 --> 29:00.472 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deal with.

29:00.505 --> 29:01.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's -- the last
point is
what I agree with.

29:03.542 --> 29:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think they did the job they
had to do in
order to lay out for the
American public what

29:08.480 --> 29:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of the concerns are with
Judge Gorsuch's
nomination.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

29:13.452 --> 29:14.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You all were terrific.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

proceedings.

29:39.945 --> 29:47.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

29:47.319 --> 29:56.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Wall
Street took its worst losses of
the year amid

29:56.094 --> 30:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investor angst over the Russia
investigation,
the health care fight and the
implications

30:01.667 --> 30:04.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for President Trump's larger
agenda.

30:04.169 --> 30:10.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost nearly
238 points, to close at 20, 668.

30:10.709 --> 30:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 107 points, and
the S&amp;P gave
up 29.

30:15.914 --> 30:20.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Trump administration
signaled today it's
reviewing the longstanding U.S.
goal of a

30:20.619 --> 30:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world without nuclear weapons.

30:23.488 --> 30:27.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christopher Ford, who is a
senior official
at president's National Security
Council,

30:27.893 --> 30:33.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that the White House is
evaluating if
that remains -- quote --
"realistic."

30:33.131 --> 30:39.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also said that, pending a
review, the U.S.
will strictly adhere to the Iran
nuclear deal

30:39.037 --> 30:41.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that President Trump has
previously condemned.

30:41.773 --> 30:46.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Northern Ireland today marked
the death Of
Martin McGuinness, one-time
commander of the

30:46.778 --> 30:50.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Irish Republican Army who
ultimately made
peace.

30:50.449 --> 30:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A funeral procession snaked
through Londonderry,
as remembrances poured in.

30:55.554 --> 31:00.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former British Prime Minister
Tony Blair worked
with McGuinness to achieve
Northern Ireland's

31:00.459 --> 31:02.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
1998 peace accords.

31:02.227 --> 31:07.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY BLAIR, Former British Prime
Minister:
The same fierceness that he
bought to the

31:07.432 --> 31:10.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
armed struggle, he then brought
to the cause
of peace.

31:10.168 --> 31:16.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he was determined to give
Northern Ireland
a different future from the past
that he had

31:16.475 --> 31:18.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
grown up in.

31:18.376 --> 31:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that leadership and the
courage in bringing
his movement with him was, for
me, and will

31:25.717 --> 31:27.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be the defining legacy of Martin
McGuinness.

31:27.753 --> 31:32.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: McGuinness was
deputy first
minister in Northern Ireland
from 2007 until

31:32.724 --> 31:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he resigned in January due to a
rare heart
condition.

31:36.361 --> 31:39.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Martin McGuinness was 66 years
old.

31:39.931 --> 31:45.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump signed a bill
today that makes
human exploration of Mars a
priority.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of a NASA funding
bill.

31:47.272 --> 31:52.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Oval Office ceremony
included senators,
congressmen and former
astronauts.

31:52.210 --> 31:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump said the new law
reaffirms the space
agency's core mission.

31:57.783 --> 32:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this was the first ever
National Rosie
the Riveter Day.

32:01.486 --> 32:06.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Events across the country today
paid tribute
to women who worked in American
factories

32:06.224 --> 32:09.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and shipyards during World War
II.

32:09.694 --> 32:12.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Most are now in their 80s and
90s.

32:12.164 --> 32:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They redefined gender roles in
the workplace
after male workers went off to
war.

32:18.503 --> 32:20.305 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Bless them.

32:20.338 --> 32:24.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
checked baggage,
new rules for electronics on
direct flights

32:24.543 --> 32:32.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the U.S. on foreign airlines
from 10 cities;
all in one, a preschool,
greenhouse and mental

32:32.384 --> 32:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care center; the big
show, recognizing
the nation's most celebrated
artists amid

32:38.290 --> 32:53.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the country's political and
cultural divides;
and much more.

32:53.138 --> 32:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Department of Homeland
Security has added
new security precautions to
flights from 10

32:58.743 --> 33:01.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
specific airports in the Middle
East.

33:01.346 --> 33:03.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

33:03.281 --> 33:07.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Passengers
flying out of
these airports can no longer
take large electronic

33:07.519 --> 33:12.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devices, things like laptops or
mobile gaming
devices or tablets, on board
with them.

33:12.591 --> 33:15.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those devices have to be in
checked luggage
only.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cell phones are still allowed on
board.

33:17.863 --> 33:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new restrictions apply to
flights from
10 specific airports in Jordan,
Egypt, Turkey,

33:23.635 --> 33:28.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Morocco,
Qatar, and
the United Arab Emirates.

33:28.306 --> 33:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The British today announced a
similar move,
but they included some different
airports

33:32.010 --> 33:33.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in their ban.

33:33.245 --> 33:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We turn now to Matthew Olsen for
more on this.

33:35.680 --> 33:40.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was the director of the
National Counterterrorism
Center during the Obama
administration.

33:40.318 --> 33:42.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he now teaches at Harvard
University.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.722 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

33:43.755 --> 33:46.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wonder if you could just tell
me a little
bit, what is going on here?

33:46.524 --> 33:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW OLSEN, Former Director,
National Counterterrorism
Center: Well, it would appear
that, almost

33:49.594 --> 33:54.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certainly, there is some new
intelligence
that the intelligence community
has gathered,

33:54.532 --> 34:00.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether on its own or from one
of our partners
in the region, that has given
the government,

34:00.071 --> 34:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in particular the Department of
Homeland Security,
increased concern about the
possibility that

34:05.677 --> 34:10.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a terrorist organization has
developed some
type of bomb that it can hide in
a device

34:10.582 --> 34:12.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like a laptop.

34:12.651 --> 34:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, whether that is
brand-new intelligence
or maybe just new analysis of
existing intelligence,

34:19.157 --> 34:23.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
it's hard to say, but,
certainly, there is
some new piece of information
that has given

34:23.528 --> 34:27.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the government more cause for
concern in this
particular context.

34:27.132 --> 34:31.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean,
clearly, it also
seems that we have lost faith in
these particular

34:31.336 --> 34:35.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
airports, either in their
ability to screen
luggage or their ability to weed
out infiltrators

34:35.674 --> 34:36.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
amongst their staff.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

34:38.543 --> 34:42.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW OLSEN: Well, we have
always had concern
about airports in this region,
and we have

34:42.414 --> 34:49.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
always placed additional
screening requirements
on flights that leave from these
airports

34:49.654 --> 34:53.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and don't stop before reaching
the United
States.

34:53.825 --> 34:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the truth is that the best
place to stop
a terrorist attack, a plot like
this, is at

34:58.697 --> 35:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the earliest possible stage,
where you can
have intelligence that allows
you to identify

35:02.500 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those individuals who are
responsible for
the plot.

35:05.503 --> 35:10.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The last opportunity really is
at those airports,
and really you are at least
hoping that you're

35:10.642 --> 35:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to be able to stop a bomb
once it reaches
the airport gate.

35:13.611 --> 35:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, you
were in the
Obama administration when these
kinds of decisions

35:16.815 --> 35:19.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were being made all the time, I
imagine.

35:19.517 --> 35:23.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you give us a sense of what
kind of intelligence
would trigger this kind of an
action?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW OLSEN: Sure.

35:25.991 --> 35:30.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, for one, this was a
source of constant
concern when I was at the
National Counterterrorism

35:30.829 --> 35:32.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Center.

35:32.630 --> 35:38.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, if you will recall, there
have been three
plots just since 2009 to try to
put a bomb

35:38.970 --> 35:40.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on an airplane bound for the
United States.

35:40.772 --> 35:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this has been an area of
real concern
because of the determination of
terrorist

35:45.110 --> 35:48.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
groups to blow up an airplane
bound for the
United States.

35:48.046 --> 35:52.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the way this information may
well come
to light is a number of ways.

35:52.717 --> 35:58.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One is through intercept of
communications
between terrorists talking about
something

35:58.490 --> 36:00.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this.

36:00.291 --> 36:04.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It could come from our allies in
the region
and their intelligence sources,
whether those

36:04.396 --> 36:09.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are electronic surveillance or
-- come from
electronic surveillance or from
human sources.

36:09.634 --> 36:14.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, certainly, there is some
new information
from one of these types of
sources that then

36:14.773 --> 36:19.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gets put into the system here,
and analysts
go over it, and they compare it
to what we

36:19.210 --> 36:23.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know from the past, and come up
with a judgment
that then is supplied to the
Department of

36:23.715 --> 36:27.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Homeland Security, which
ultimately makes
the decision about what
limitations to enforce

36:27.786 --> 36:29.621 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on planes bound for the U.S.

36:29.654 --> 36:34.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Can you
explain the distinction
here between carry-on vs.
checked luggage?

36:35.026 --> 36:39.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if I have somehow
smuggled a bomb
onto a computer or some
electronic device,

36:39.664 --> 36:43.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what difference does it make if
it's with
me in the cabin or just below my
feet in my

36:43.701 --> 36:45.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
checked luggage?

36:45.570 --> 36:50.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW OLSEN: Well, there are
some instances
where we have seen devices --
think back to

36:50.642 --> 36:59.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the underwear bomb in Detroit in
2009 -- where
the actual detonation of the
device required

36:59.250 --> 37:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actual human interaction.

37:00.718 --> 37:04.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the person had to have
access to the device
in order to detonate it.

37:04.889 --> 37:09.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that is obviously a clear
distinction
between having checked luggage
and why there

37:09.060 --> 37:14.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a greater concern with
somebody who has
got immediate access to --
potentially immediate

37:14.299 --> 37:18.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access to a device because they
were able
to bring it on to an airplane,
as opposed

37:18.503 --> 37:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to being required to check it.

37:20.338 --> 37:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Does the fact
that the British
have also instituted a similar
ban, albeit

37:24.175 --> 37:27.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with some slightly different
airports, does
that you greater confidence that
this is really

37:27.879 --> 37:29.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a substantive threat?

37:29.647 --> 37:34.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW OLSEN: Well, it
certainly does, at
least in the sense that the
United Kingdom

37:34.752 --> 37:41.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the United States work
incredibly closely
together on all these types of
issues and

37:42.026 --> 37:43.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
share intelligence.

37:43.795 --> 37:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It certainly suggests to me at
least that
the U.K. and the U.S. are in
lockstep in how

37:48.566 --> 37:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're reading whatever new
information there
may be that has caused this
concern.

37:53.071 --> 37:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean,
obviously, the administration
says that this is not related to
its recent

37:58.143 --> 38:02.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
travel bans, but it's sort of
hard to overlook
the timing, that these things
are happening

38:02.213 --> 38:03.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the same time.

38:03.281 --> 38:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do you see a relation between
those?

38:05.483 --> 38:10.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW OLSEN: You know, I
really don't, I
think, because this has been an
issue that's

38:10.054 --> 38:14.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been around for several years
through a number
of administrations going back to
President

38:15.026 --> 38:17.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bush, President Obama, and now
President Trump.

38:17.195 --> 38:22.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This appears to be a
continuation of a concern
that has been in place -- that
has been in

38:22.634 --> 38:23.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
place for some time.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right.

38:24.869 --> 38:28.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Matthew Olsen of Harvard
University, thanks
very much.

38:28.573 --> 38:34.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW OLSEN: Sure.

38:34.846 --> 38:43.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After years of
neglect, parents
in one of Denver's poorest
neighborhoods hoped

38:43.655 --> 38:46.858 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that a new preschool would be
built in their
community.

38:46.891 --> 38:49.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Instead, they got much more.

38:49.160 --> 38:52.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
William Brangham recently
visited there, and
he is back again with this
report.

38:53.031 --> 38:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's part of our weekly series
Making the
Grade.

38:55.967 --> 39:01.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Fish swim in
giant tanks.

39:01.072 --> 39:04.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Collard greens grow in abundance
in a massive
greenhouse.

39:04.409 --> 39:08.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Down the hall, there's a
dentist's office,
as well as a mental health
center.

39:08.513 --> 39:15.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the other end of the
building, 3-,
4-, and 5-year-olds run around
like mad.

39:15.520 --> 39:21.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some might say it's an unusual
mix here in
the heart of one of Denver's
poorest neighborhoods,

39:21.759 --> 39:23.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but not according to the woman
who runs the
place.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.430 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:25.463 --> 39:25.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYDIA PRADO, Dahlia Campus for
Health and
Well-Being: It's taking a new
approach to

39:26.030 --> 39:27.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
community well-being.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Lydia
Prado is the driving
force behind this place.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's called the Dahlia Campus
for Health and
Well-Being.

39:32.503 --> 39:34.305 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

39:34.339 --> 39:36.541 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LYDIA PRADO: My initial
conversations were
with two folks who had --
together, they have

39:36.574 --> 39:39.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over 80 years of residence in
this community.

39:39.877 --> 39:43.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just floated the idea, I
want to take
integrated care to the next
level.

39:43.648 --> 39:46.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to think comprehensively
about health.

39:46.217 --> 39:49.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to be able to talk about
mental health,
and went to talk to them about
it, and it's

39:49.621 --> 39:51.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like, what do you think?

39:51.089 --> 39:52.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they're like, oh.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, you know, they were very
honest about
it.

39:54.125 --> 39:58.029 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are going to be
challenges, but if anybody's
going to give it a shot -- and
we're behind

39:58.062 --> 39:59.497 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

39:59.530 --> 40:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For Prado,
building partnerships
early on was key.

40:02.634 --> 40:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heidi Heissenbuttel came on
board early, bringing
a branch of her Sewall Child
Development Center

40:08.106 --> 40:09.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the new campus.

40:09.907 --> 40:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sewall's been a pioneer in
what's known as
inclusive education, teaching
children with

40:14.646 --> 40:19.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
special needs -- that is, kids
with autism
or those with emotional or
behavioral issues

40:19.417 --> 40:24.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- and putting them in
classrooms with their
more typically developing peers.

40:24.689 --> 40:29.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heissenbuttel says the evidence
is clear that
this approach works for all
kids.

40:29.127 --> 40:32.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI HEISSENBUTTEL, Sewall
Child Development
Center: They learn to expect
that every child

40:32.430 --> 40:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
learns differently, and they go
on to their
elementary classrooms, and they
become advocates

40:37.335 --> 40:39.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for kids who learn differently.

40:39.137 --> 40:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they will tell teachers, you
need to work
with that child, or why can't he
participate

40:44.075 --> 40:46.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the playground, or we want
him in our group.

40:46.978 --> 40:50.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We observed
three classrooms.

40:50.281 --> 40:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, the Tigers have circle
time.

40:53.217 --> 40:58.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then they moved on to center
time, an hour
when the children get to pick
what they want

40:58.589 --> 41:04.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to do, as teachers float through
the classroom
facilitating vocabulary-building
and individual

41:04.429 --> 41:06.397 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lessons.

41:06.431 --> 41:11.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One-third of the children here
have some special
need, some with diagnosed
developmental problems.

41:11.703 --> 41:16.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus, 40 percent of the kids
here suffer from
what's known as toxic stress.

41:16.641 --> 41:24.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEIDI HEISSENBUTTEL: Toxic
stress is the result
of poverty, abuse and neglect,
domestic violence,

41:24.115 --> 41:30.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just life's circumstances, when
you -- when
a family lives under stress.

41:30.388 --> 41:35.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what the best treatment, for
children
to have loving, stable
relationships in their

41:35.393 --> 41:37.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lives.

41:37.128 --> 41:40.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Arnesha Poke's
son Adrian
(ph) attends the pre-K, and she
says this

41:40.331 --> 41:43.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inclusive approach is important
to her.

41:43.067 --> 41:47.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ARNESHA POKE, Mother: Instead
of, like, separating
the kids off and stuff, they
need to all be

41:47.338 --> 41:52.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
together, so they can learn each
other and
learn each other's emotional
ways, and stuff

41:52.410 --> 41:53.378 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

41:53.411 --> 41:55.346 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

41:55.380 --> 41:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LYDIA PRADO: In the community
conversation,
it was extremely important, this
idea of inclusivity,

41:59.484 --> 42:07.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because it was -- it's parallel
to a community's
desire to be included and
inclusive.

42:07.291 --> 42:09.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a lot of experience of
being separated
out.

42:09.994 --> 42:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE GREENBERG, Mother: I
thought she would
kind of fall in with the rest of
the kids

42:14.065 --> 42:18.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and just do -- not have any
problems, issues
at all.

42:18.669 --> 42:22.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Diane
Greenberg and her
daughter Karai (ph) used to live
in a homeless

42:22.340 --> 42:23.307 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shelter.

42:23.341 --> 42:25.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She says this preschool has been
life-changing.

42:25.443 --> 42:32.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE GREENBERG: I love this
place because
it helps me understand how to
deal with that.

42:32.283 --> 42:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It helps me understand how to
help her.

42:34.519 --> 42:39.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
staff-to-child ratio
here is one to five, whereas the
state only

42:39.524 --> 42:41.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mandates a 1-10 ratio.

42:41.426 --> 42:45.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRINA POKE, Teacher: I think we
all respect
each other and we all do like
each other enough.

42:45.296 --> 42:47.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Teachers Trina
Poke and
Christine Krall.

42:47.265 --> 42:51.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRINA POKE: We just kind of get
so used to
each other that we do just tend
to feed off

42:52.003 --> 42:53.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of each other like that.

42:53.805 --> 42:56.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE KRALL, Teacher: I
especially feel
sometimes that it's not easy to
see what I'm

42:56.541 --> 42:58.409 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doing.

42:58.443 --> 43:01.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's when I will share,
like, the rationale
and things like that during team
meetings,

43:01.779 --> 43:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so it doesn't look like I'm just
playing,
because there is a method to the
madness.

43:06.717 --> 43:11.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Some of the
madness is designed
to calm children down who may be
having a

43:11.222 --> 43:12.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tough time.

43:12.557 --> 43:14.258 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Heather Luehers is a social
worker.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER LUEHERS, Social Worker:
When kids
can't pay attention to parents,
when they

43:16.994 --> 43:24.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are so dysregulated, they have
problems, because
they move inside themselves, and
they just

43:24.202 --> 43:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
run around the classroom.

43:25.403 --> 43:27.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, in some of our
classrooms, you
see that.

43:27.738 --> 43:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what I'm doing with this
child is saying,
I'm the adult, I'm in charge,
you don't need

43:33.644 --> 43:38.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be in charge, because these
kids that need
to be in charge with parents
that are absent

43:38.182 --> 43:39.917 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
don't do well.

43:39.951 --> 43:43.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A full-day
preschool program
with all this staff doesn't come
cheap.

43:43.788 --> 43:47.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For a typically developing
child, it's $252
a week.

43:47.892 --> 43:51.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For a child with special needs
who requires
more staffing, it's $387.

43:51.996 --> 43:57.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And 90 percent of the families
in this neighborhood
need financial help.

43:57.301 --> 43:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many pay based on what they can
afford.

43:59.203 --> 44:03.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But research shows the return on
that investment
is high.

44:03.274 --> 44:09.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Every $1 spent on early
education returns
$13 in savings down the road.

44:09.547 --> 44:13.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition to being one of the
poorest neighborhoods
in Denver, this area is also
what's called

44:13.384 --> 44:15.152 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a food desert.

44:15.186 --> 44:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What that means is, according to
the USDA,
is that, if you live in a big
city, you don't

44:18.890 --> 44:22.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a good grocery store within
about a mile
of your house.

44:22.627 --> 44:26.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This neighborhood, it's over two
miles to
a good grocery store.

44:26.097 --> 44:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's about a 45-minute walk.

44:29.267 --> 44:33.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even worse, this is what's known
as a food
swamp, where all that's
available what's available

44:33.371 --> 44:38.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is fast food and the generally
poor nutrition
that comes with it.

44:38.276 --> 44:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's where those fish and
collard greens
come in.

44:40.478 --> 44:45.550 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tilapia and catfish were the
fish the community
said they want.

44:45.583 --> 44:49.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And collard greens and Swiss
chard were the
top choices for leafy greens.

44:49.287 --> 44:52.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNA SMITH, Runs Aquaponics
Greenhouse: And
so you will see the roots just
hang down into

44:52.290 --> 44:55.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the water, and they can just
soak it up as
they need it.

44:55.192 --> 44:56.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Wow.

44:56.994 --> 45:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jenna Smith runs this aquaponics
greenhouse,
which uses one continuous loop
of recycled,

45:02.199 --> 45:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
cleaned water for the entire
operation.

45:04.101 --> 45:08.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNA SMITH: Healthy food is
foundational
to overall health and
well-being.

45:08.406 --> 45:14.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a very important component
to having
-- helping kids to grow up, pay
attention

45:14.979 --> 45:18.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in class, you know, be strong
and active.

45:18.082 --> 45:21.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what better way to do that
than to have
it right on site?

45:21.719 --> 45:26.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Where these
greens now grow
used to be the site of the
country's largest

African-American-owned mall.

45:29.427 --> 45:34.265 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But the businesses went
bankrupt, and the
lot was abandoned for decades.

45:34.298 --> 45:38.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Longtime resident and urban
farmer Beverly
Grant talked to us in the huge
kitchen at

45:38.869 --> 45:43.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dahlia, a space where students
sort lettuce
for food boxes they take home,
and where community

45:43.808 --> 45:45.576 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
members can take cooking
classes.

45:45.610 --> 45:50.147 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BEVERLY GRANT, Business Owner:
We have shifted
from food desert to food oasis.

45:50.181 --> 45:55.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Grant runs her
own traveling
farm stand, and she met Lydia
Prado early

45:55.486 --> 45:57.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the planning stages.

45:57.355 --> 46:04.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BEVERLY GRANT: The blessing is
that Dr. Prado
had amazing listening ears and a
compassionate

46:04.328 --> 46:06.864 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
heart.

46:06.897 --> 46:13.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when she heard the stories
of people like
me and others, she was like,
hmm, we could

46:13.337 --> 46:15.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
probably do something about
that.

46:15.706 --> 46:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You get that little nod from
her, consider
that done.

46:18.676 --> 46:23.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As Grant likes
to say, from
seed to stomach.

46:23.047 --> 46:27.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During our visit, preschoolers
were learning
that very lesson, planting
seedlings that

46:27.451 --> 46:32.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will later be transplanted into
their urban
farm, and could very likely end
up on their

46:33.024 --> 46:34.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
own kitchen tables.

46:34.625 --> 46:44.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in Denver, Colorado.

46:44.468 --> 46:55.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Every two years
since 1932,
the Whitney Museum in New York
has put on

46:55.546 --> 47:01.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an exhibition meant to showcase
cutting-edge
American art, as chosen by that
year's curators.

47:01.819 --> 47:07.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Whitney Biennial is
sometimes loved, sometimes
hated, but it always gets huge
crowds and

47:07.858 --> 47:09.860 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attention from the critics.

47:09.894 --> 47:13.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown takes a look at
the latest edition
just opened in New York.

47:13.497 --> 47:19.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Whitney
Biennial, a must-see
exhibition for anyone interested
in contemporary

47:19.437 --> 47:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
art, a snapshot of American
creativity and
sometimes American culture.

47:25.342 --> 47:30.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Featuring 63 artists, this is a
relatively
intimate show as these go.

47:30.347 --> 47:35.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the first biennial at the
Whitney Museum's
new Lower Manhattan building,
which was designed

47:35.286 --> 47:42.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by architect Renzo Piano and
opened in 2015,
and the first in 20 years
organized during

47:42.226 --> 47:44.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a presidential campaign.

47:44.161 --> 47:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, what did curators
Christopher Lew and
Mia Locks find when talking with
artists and

47:49.400 --> 47:51.068 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
putting together the exhibition?

47:51.102 --> 47:54.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No surprise, perhaps, a sense of
unease and
anxiety.

47:54.939 --> 47:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIA LOCKS, Whitney Museum of
American Art:
It's been a tumultuous few
years.

47:58.642 --> 48:04.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For better or for worse, I think
a presidential
election can sometimes be a
moment when we,

48:04.615 --> 48:08.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a country and as a kind of
society, do
ask ourselves pretty hard
questions about

48:09.019 --> 48:11.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how we understand ourselves
individually and
collectively.

48:11.689 --> 48:13.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, what did you
see artists
saying?

48:13.924 --> 48:15.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHRISTOPHER Y.

48:15.726 --> 48:16.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEW, Whitney Museum of American
Art: They're
thinking about the world in
which they live

48:16.727 --> 48:18.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in, and that can be defined in
different ways.

48:18.929 --> 48:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they may be thinking about a
specific
neighborhood, or they're
thinking about the

48:22.767 --> 48:27.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city, and that what they're
making is intended
to kind of speak back to
society.

48:27.071 --> 48:32.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For them, it's not just a kind
of precious
bubble just to kind of look at,
in and of

48:32.343 --> 48:34.111 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
itself.

48:34.145 --> 48:37.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In a photography
series shot
over a year-and-a-half, Oto
Gillen captures

48:37.615 --> 48:42.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some of the mood and changes
brought about
by income disparities in his
native New York

48:42.753 --> 48:44.388 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
City.

48:44.421 --> 48:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OTO GILLEN, Artist: This kind of
sense of
anxiety that everyone is having
about the

48:46.824 --> 48:52.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
future, and the idea that the
future has arrived
faster than we thought it would,
and in a

48:52.696 --> 48:59.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way that we didn't expect to, to
show a certain
state of America that may not be
visible to

48:59.570 --> 49:03.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
everyone, but not in a
necessarily definitive
way.

49:03.374 --> 49:09.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, I want it to be open and
for people
to just be able to look at the
world around

49:09.680 --> 49:11.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them and ask questions.

49:11.582 --> 49:14.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Other works take
a more direct
approach.

49:14.485 --> 49:19.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Debtfair, by a group of artists
tied to the
Occupy movement, connects the
debt incurred

49:19.390 --> 49:25.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by college students to the
poverty many artists
face, while the vibrant
sculptures and stained

49:25.296 --> 49:31.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
glass windows by Raul de Nieves,
a young artist
making his first appearance in
the biennial,

49:31.402 --> 49:34.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
approach anxiety through
allegory.

49:34.038 --> 49:35.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What is that story that you're
trying to tell?

49:36.006 --> 49:37.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAUL DE NIEVES, Artist: The idea
of fear.

49:37.842 --> 49:40.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, how do we confront fear,
you know?

49:40.845 --> 49:47.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you realize what fear
is, it's like
you should acknowledge it and
greet it by

49:47.184 --> 49:52.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the hand and walk away, so that
you overcome
this idea of fear.

49:52.323 --> 49:56.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in a sense, like, being a
part of such
a grandiose show is a form of
fear.

49:56.861 --> 49:59.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Fear for you, you
mean as an
artist?

49:59.430 --> 50:01.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RAUL DE NIEVES: Yes.

50:01.098 --> 50:07.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm not afraid to say that,
because it
was -- you're like, what is this
going to

50:07.071 --> 50:11.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say, and how do I want to, like,
portray myself
and my work?

50:11.342 --> 50:13.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Other signs of
the times?

50:13.744 --> 50:20.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A video installation by a
collective called
Postcommodity shows several
miles of the U.S.-Mexico

50:20.351 --> 50:22.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
border fence.

50:22.253 --> 50:28.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the work here, like
Celeste Dupuy-Spencer's
drawing Trump Rally, is overtly
political.

50:28.726 --> 50:34.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Frances Stark's Censorship Now
is a different
kind of provocation, arguing
that censorship,

50:34.632 --> 50:39.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and not free expression, would
empower artists
by raising their profile.

50:39.236 --> 50:44.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, overall, this biennial, as
opposed to
some in the past, takes a less
aggressive

50:44.942 --> 50:45.910 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stance.

50:45.943 --> 50:47.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Whitney director Adam Weinberg:

50:47.678 --> 50:49.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ADAM WEINBERG, Director, Whitney
Museum of
American Art: I do see political
work, but

50:49.546 --> 50:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I do not think it's hectoring.

50:50.981 --> 50:52.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think it's
finger-wagging.

50:52.917 --> 50:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there's this sense of
connection, a sense
of people wanting to join
together, a sense

50:57.154 --> 51:03.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of -- I think a sense of
community and a feeling
that, even though these are
political times,

51:03.827 --> 51:05.329 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this is not an us-and-them
situation.

51:05.362 --> 51:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That includes
artists looking
hard at their own communities.

51:09.466 --> 51:15.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deana Lawson's photo series
evokes a family
album, presenting an intimate
look into lives

51:15.039 --> 51:16.774 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in her hometown.

51:16.807 --> 51:19.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEANA LAWSON, Artist: The reason
why I chose
photography is because of that
immediacy,

51:19.677 --> 51:21.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that sort of documentary feel.

51:21.478 --> 51:26.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's oftentimes very staged,
so it's that
dialogue that I'm interested in.

51:26.383 --> 51:29.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do want to pay a certain honor
to them,
at least in a sense.

51:29.486 --> 51:31.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: People who are
not the subject
of art so much.

51:31.689 --> 51:34.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DEANA LAWSON: Right, and
traditional art,
correct.

51:34.325 --> 51:39.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm from a working-class
family in Rochester,
so a lot of the subjects I'm
gravitated to

51:39.463 --> 51:41.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are from working-class
environments.

51:41.165 --> 51:45.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Henry Taylor's
large- scale
figurative paintings address the
mundane,

51:45.769 --> 51:51.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a summer barbecue, and conflict,
black men's
encounters with police.

51:51.542 --> 51:57.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a lot of painting here,
in fact, much
of it by first-time participants
and women.

51:57.414 --> 52:03.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aliza Nisenbaum spends hours
with her subjects
to depict scenes of everyday
life, but also

52:03.053 --> 52:05.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the immigrant experience.

52:05.189 --> 52:09.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dana Schutz uses a collage
effect of color
and energy.

52:09.259 --> 52:11.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then there's 87 year Jo
Baer.

52:11.595 --> 52:14.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You're sort of the elder
stateswoman here,
right?

52:14.498 --> 52:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JO BAER, Artist: Apparently.

52:15.799 --> 52:16.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.469 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Well, who knew?

52:18.502 --> 52:21.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Baer is a
renowned veteran
in the art world, still very
much at it with

52:21.939 --> 52:27.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new series of paintings, and
returning to
the biennial after several
decades.

52:27.277 --> 52:31.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's a number of younger,
especially women
painters in this show.

52:31.648 --> 52:32.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JO BAER: Yes.

52:32.649 --> 52:33.617 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

52:33.650 --> 52:34.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: How does that
make you feel?

52:34.651 --> 52:36.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JO BAER: Marvelous.

52:36.220 --> 52:37.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, look how well these
paintings go with
all these younger paintings.

52:37.721 --> 52:39.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look at this installation.

52:39.823 --> 52:41.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is so mind-boggling.

52:41.225 --> 52:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is such a joy to see that
what I'm doing
is what they're doing.

52:49.199 --> 52:54.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Taken altogether,
curators
Lew and Locks present artists
eager to engage

52:54.805 --> 52:58.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in ways not always associated
with contemporary
art.

52:58.042 --> 52:59.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
CHRISTOPHER Y.

52:59.910 --> 53:03.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEW: Even in artists that are
riffing on pop
culture or using more
appropriated imagery,

53:03.547 --> 53:09.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're doing it in a way that
comes out of
a certain sense of emotion and
kind of sincere

53:09.086 --> 53:11.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interest, and not just for a
kind of ironic
pastiche.

53:11.555 --> 53:15.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIA LOCKS: Actually, we were
surprised, in
some ways, that, as the show
came together,

53:15.893 --> 53:20.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there are a number of works that
do point
to or suggest maybe more healing
possibilities

53:20.798 --> 53:26.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of art, or this kind of sense of
kind of reparative
practices, which are -- maybe
that's symptomatic.

53:26.370 --> 53:27.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
