JUDY WOODRUFF: Reince Priebus
is out as White House chief of
staff tonight, after just six

00:05.300 --> 00:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
months on the job.

00:07.300 --> 00:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump announced in
a tweet late today that John
Kelly, the secretary of homeland

00:12.100 --> 00:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
security, will take his place.

00:14.200 --> 00:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president had more to say
after returning from a day trip
to New York, a trip that Priebus

00:19.666 --> 00:21.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was on.

00:21.333 --> 00:24.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
Reince is a good man.

00:24.200 --> 00:27.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
John Kelly will do
a fantastic job.

00:27.466 --> 00:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
General Kelly has been a star,
done an incredible job thus far,
respected by everybody, a great,

00:34.333 --> 00:35.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great American.

00:35.333 --> 00:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Reince Priebus, a good man.

00:36.766 --> 00:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

00:39.200 --> 00:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to help
unpack what led to this change
at the top, I'm joined now

00:43.333 --> 00:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Robert Costa, reporter
for The Washington
Post and moderator of
"Washington Week" here

00:48.833 --> 00:49.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on PBS.

00:49.566 --> 00:51.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Welcome, Robert.

00:51.666 --> 00:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as I go to you, I'm going
to share with everybody just
briefly what the president's

00:54.000 --> 00:56.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tweets were.

00:56.133 --> 00:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He tweeted -- this was late
this afternoon - - he said: "I
am pleased to inform you that

00:58.200 --> 01:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just named General
Secretary John F. Kelly as
White House chief of staff.

01:03.133 --> 01:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's a great American
and great leader.

01:05.133 --> 01:09.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said: "John has also
done a spectacular job
at Homeland Security.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's been a true star
of my administration."

01:12.266 --> 01:15.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And finally, he said: "I would
like to thank Reince Priebus
for his service and dedication

01:15.766 --> 01:17.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to this country.

01:17.166 --> 01:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We accomplished a lot together
and I'm proud of him!"

01:20.733 --> 01:22.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I guess it didn't work out.

01:22.866 --> 01:25.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: It was a sudden
change, Judy, but it was also
a change that was in the works

01:25.933 --> 01:28.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for months.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president brought on Reince
Priebus because he saw him as
a whisperer to House speaker,

01:31.533 --> 01:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Ryan, a close friend of
Priebus from Wisconsin and
he thought Priebus could help

01:35.600 --> 01:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get his legislative
agenda through.

01:37.866 --> 01:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as that agenda stalled on
health care and other fronts,
he began to muse in recent

01:41.866 --> 01:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
months with friends about
perhaps making a change at
the top of the White House.

01:45.833 --> 01:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kelly has been at the forefront
of his mind because he's
not a dramatic future and he

01:49.800 --> 01:52.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has executed for the president
on immigration policy.

01:52.133 --> 01:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There have
been so many ups and downs,
as you know very well, because

01:55.933 --> 01:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you have been covering it every
day, for this White House.

01:58.866 --> 02:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did the president
see Reince Priebus as
connected to that or not?

02:03.133 --> 02:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Did he blame him for
what's been going on?

02:05.233 --> 02:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: He thought
Priebus, because he had run the
Republican National Committee,

02:08.833 --> 02:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could be a stabilizing force.

02:10.766 --> 02:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Priebus as RNC chairman
was always a low-key presence.

02:14.633 --> 02:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wasn't who was known for
managing a large organization
in a military-style fashion.

02:21.100 --> 02:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president wanted that
kind of person to come in.

02:23.000 --> 02:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's important to note
that Kelly has a strong
relationship with Jared Kushner,

02:26.300 --> 02:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the senior adviser, and
actually Steve Bannon,
the chief strategist.

02:29.766 --> 02:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they represent the two poles
in this warring White House.

02:32.966 --> 02:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is an expectation now
from my sources that Kelly can
come in and try to be a calming

02:38.433 --> 02:40.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

02:40.466 --> 02:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned
the two poles, but we also
had the announcement the other

02:42.500 --> 02:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day from the president he is
bringing in a new communications
director, Anthony Scaramucci,

02:48.033 --> 02:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
who has been in a
very visible war.

02:51.066 --> 02:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the language that he used
in that conversation with a "New
Yorker" magazine reporter was

02:58.500 --> 03:01.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
making all kind of news
headlines yesterday.

03:01.300 --> 03:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does that fit into all this?

03:03.400 --> 03:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: No, it's a smart
observation, because it does
seem incongruent to have this

03:06.833 --> 03:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
swashbuckling New Yorker in
Anthony Scaramucci now working
alongside General Kelly, who is

03:13.033 --> 03:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
known for being a
very precise man.

03:15.133 --> 03:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it really reflects how the
president is trying to turn to
his loyalists from New York,

03:18.700 --> 03:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as well as to military figures
as he tries to right the ship.

03:23.133 --> 03:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He knows his health care
legislation is going nowhere
right now on Capitol Hill.

03:27.666 --> 03:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's trying to recover
his presidency, turning
to two different types,
the New Yorkers and

03:33.333 --> 03:35.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the military.

03:35.433 --> 03:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, does this
look to you, Robert, like
this is a team that can work

03:38.266 --> 03:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smoothly together, that can get
this White House back on some
semblance of a normal track?

03:45.233 --> 03:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: Well, General
Kelly has said publicly in
the past that he would like to

03:47.633 --> 03:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
maybe try to monitor the
president's calls, that
he thinks there could
be more organization

03:52.500 --> 03:54.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inside of the West Wing.

03:54.666 --> 03:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's going to be interesting
to see if he can really try
to contain the Oval Office.

03:57.400 --> 04:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an Oval Office
that's known for having
a lot of entryway, people
coming in and offering

04:01.733 --> 04:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their advice, often
unsolicited, to the president.

04:04.500 --> 04:08.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Kelly can get ahold of that
in a way Priebus never did,
maybe he can turn it around.

04:08.666 --> 04:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But he also has to navigate
all the different circles
around President Trump.

04:12.433 --> 04:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is someone who is known
not just for having a
straight chain of command.

04:15.466 --> 04:17.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He talks to a lot of
people all the time.

04:17.533 --> 04:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of which, what one hears is
that this is a president who

04:20.733 --> 04:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
really likes to be his
own chief of staff.

04:22.233 --> 04:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Indeed.

04:23.500 --> 04:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He likes
-- he's a detail person.

04:25.033 --> 04:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants to know what everybody
is doing, how they're doing it.

04:27.533 --> 04:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is likely to fit with
somebody like General Kelly?

04:30.700 --> 04:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: General Kelly
doesn't have a deep personal
relationship with President

04:34.600 --> 04:35.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

04:35.733 --> 04:37.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Will he stop the
president from tweeting?

04:37.566 --> 04:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's what all my
sources want to know.

04:39.733 --> 04:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Can he actually stop
the president from, as
you say, being his own
chief of staff, being

04:43.366 --> 04:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his own spokesman?

04:45.833 --> 04:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, it seems like
Scaramucci and others
are channeling the
president in their public

04:48.533 --> 04:50.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
presentation, not
trying to hold him back.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The other thing,
Robert, I have to raise are
the so-called -- what the

04:53.766 --> 04:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House and the president
like to call the leaks which
they say are coming from a

04:58.200 --> 05:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of people in the White
House and the administration
that shouldn't be, but
then the stories one

05:05.133 --> 05:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also hears that not only is
the president talking to the
press, but people at the highest

05:07.933 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
levels in the White House.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How is all that likely to change
or not as a result of this?

05:12.933 --> 05:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: It's a very
messy situation, because the
president is furious behind the

05:16.700 --> 05:18.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
scenes.

05:18.700 --> 05:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's telling his aides that
they need to stop the leaks,
but often these leaks are coming

05:20.866 --> 05:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from some of his own
White House officials.

05:23.333 --> 05:28.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a big difference
between intelligence
community leaks and leaks
about palace intrigue

05:29.000 --> 05:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
inside of the West Wing.

05:30.966 --> 05:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a lot of the president's
aides are just trying to reflect
his own unhappiness about

05:34.066 --> 05:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a White House he thinks
that is talking too much.

05:36.300 --> 05:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is --
as you and I were just saying,
it's one more tumultuous

05:39.833 --> 05:41.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day in what's been
nonstop tumult.

05:41.866 --> 05:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: And everyone was
thinking maybe Attorney General
Sessions would be the person

05:45.133 --> 05:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to go at the end of this week,
after all of his struggles
with President Trump, but it

05:48.666 --> 05:50.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was Priebus.

05:50.666 --> 05:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we don't
know what is going to happen
to the attorney general at this

05:53.100 --> 05:54.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
point.

05:54.166 --> 05:55.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: We do not.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Robert Costa, thanks.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're going to have much
more on "Washington Week"
on all these PBS stations.

05:58.033 --> 05:59.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

05:59.033 --> 05:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Thank you.
