TROOPS, SIMILAR TO THE ONES THAT

04:44.233 --> 04:48.100
WERE IN CRIMEA, RUSSIA INITIALLY

04:48.100 --> 04:50.000
DEFIED THAT THOSE WERE RUSSIAN

PUTIN IS DENYING THAT AS WELL.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.267
RUSSIAN TROOPS ON THE BORDER

04:59.267 --> 05:00.633
IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT

05:00.633 --> 05:03.133
THE DEMONSTRATIONS CAME ONLY

05:03.133 --> 05:04.333
AFTER THERE WAS THIS LARGE

05:05.233 --> 05:07.033
SIDE OF THE BORDER

05:07.033 --> 05:09.233

MILITIAS ARE LOOKING FOR CUE

05:11.000 --> 05:13.200
FROM MOSCOW FOR THEIR ACTIONS AS

THE SANCTIONS WE'VE IMPOSED SO

05:37.700 --> 05:38.167
FAR?

05:38.167 --> 05:41.300
>> THEY ARE WORKING IN THA

05:41.300 --> 05:43.167
THERE IS MUCH GREATE

05:43.167 --> 05:45.100
UNCERTAINTY WITH THE BANKS

05:45.100 --> 05:46.800
BANKS ARE UNWILLING TO LEN

05:46.800 --> 05:47.633
BECAUSE THEY'RE UNCERTAIN ABOU

05:47.633 --> 05:49.167
WHO IS TARGETED HERE

05:49.167 --> 05:50.367
WE HAVE THE NAMES ON THE LIST,

05:50.367 --> 05:52.433
BUT LET'S SAY THE FRIEND O

05:52.433 --> 05:53.433
RELATED COMPANY OF SOMEBODY ON

05:53.433 --> 05:55.167
THE LIST WANTS TO BORROW A

05:55.167 --> 05:57.533
WELL, BANKS ARE AFRAID TO LEND

05:57.533 --> 06:00.300
MONEY TO THEM FOR FEAR OF TRYING

06:00.300 --> 06:02.433
TO BE SEEN AS TRYING TO GE

06:02.433 --> 06:04.833
AROUND THE SANCTIONS

06:04.833 --> 06:07.733
SO WE'VE SEEN 60 BILLION FLY

06:07.733 --> 06:09.333
FROM RUSSIA IN THIS QUARTER.

06:09.333 --> 06:10.667
THE RUSSIAN ECONOMY IS THE SIXTH

06:10.667 --> 06:13.167
LARGEST IN THE WORLD, BUT VERY

06:13.167 --> 06:14.400
CONCENTRATED IN THE NATURA

06:14.400 --> 06:17.000
RESOURCES SECTOR

06:17.000 --> 06:19.100
THE CAPITAL SECTOR COMES FRO

06:19.100 --> 06:20.567
TWO STATE-OWNED BANKS.

06:20.567 --> 06:22.733
SO IN THIS SENSE, RUSSIA I

06:22.733 --> 06:23.300
VULNERABLE

06:23.300 --> 06:27.433
>> WHAT ROLE DOES EUROPE PLAY?

06:27.433 --> 06:28.200
THEY'RE A LARGER TRADING

06:28.200 --> 06:28.333
PARTNER.

06:28.333 --> 06:31.267
ARE THEY WILLING TO MAKE THOSE

06:31.267 --> 06:31.433
CHOICES?

06:31.433 --> 06:34.233
>> GERMANY IS THE IMPORTAN

TOWARDS RUSSIA THAN HE

06:42.500 --> 06:42.633
CONSTITUENTS

06:42.633 --> 06:43.900

06:43.900 --> 06:46.133
THE GERMANS TO GO ALONG.

06:46.133 --> 06:47.333
BUT IF WE SEE AGGRESSIVE ACTIO

06:47.333 --> 06:48.567
ON THE PART OF MOSCOW, THERE

06:48.567 --> 06:50.467
WOULD BE A RALLYING AROUND

06:50.467 --> 06:52.000
SANCTIONS IN EUROPE AND IN THE

06:52.000 --> 06:52.300
UNITED STATES.

06:52.300 --> 06:54.667
THE TRICKY PART, THOUGH, IS THAT

06:54.667 --> 06:56.500
IF RUSSIA CONTINUES TO PLAY TH

06:56.500 --> 06:58.933
ROLE THAT IT IS, AND THE

06:58.933 --> 07:00.500
SITUATION IN EASTERN UKRAINE

07:00.500 --> 07:01.767
CONTINUES TO BE UNSTABLE, WHAT

07:01.767 --> 07:03.167
WILL BE THE TRIGGERING EVENT

07:03.167 --> 07:06.233
THAT WOULD ALLOW THE U.S. TO

07:06.233 --> 07:08.033
RALLY THE EUROPEANS TO IMPOS

07:08.033 --> 07:09.100
NEW SANCTIONS AGAINST RUSSIA

07:09.100 --> 07:11.767

07:11.767 --> 07:15.133
EVENT IS TROOPS CROSSING THE

BORDER

07:15.267 --> 07:16.500

07:16.500 --> 07:17.867
PART OF THE BARGAINING THAT'

07:17.867 --> 07:19.733
GOING ON IS TRYING TO LET TH

07:19.733 --> 07:21.167
RUSSIANS GUESS, WHAT WOULD B

07:21.167 --> 07:22.733
THE KIND OF ACTIVITIES THA

TO DO THE THINGS HE COULD DO

08:42.467 --> 08:42.633
BEFORE

08:42.633 --> 08:44.933
>> HIS BONE MARROW WASN'

08:44.933 --> 08:46.000
PRODUCING ENOUGH BLOOD CELLS

08:46.000 --> 08:49.667
AND IF THE LEVELS DIP TOO LOW,

08:49.667 --> 08:52.100
IT COULD BE LIFE-THREATENING

08:52.100 --> 08:55.067
HE HAD TWO CHOICES, BLOO

08:55.067 --> 08:56.167
TRANSFUSIONS OR MEDICATION THA

08:56.167 --> 08:57.700
WOULD BOOST HIS RED BLOOD CELL

08:57.700 --> 08:57.833
COUNT.

08:57.833 --> 08:58.767
HE CHOSE THE MEDICATION.

08:58.767 --> 08:59.967
>> TOO TIRED TO DO THE THING

08:59.967 --> 09:02.433
YOU USED TO DO

09:02.433 --> 09:05.200
>> DELUCA'S MEDICATION IS KNOW

09:05.200 --> 09:07.300
AS A BIOLOGIC.

09:07.300 --> 09:09.800
A RELATIVELY YOUNG AND

09:09.800 --> 09:13.167
REVOLUTIONARY CLASS OF DRUGS

09:13.167 --> 09:17.033
OTHER POPULAR DRUGS ARE EMBREL

09:17.033 --> 09:19.167
USED TO TREAT ARTHRITIS AN

09:19.167 --> 09:23.200
MACULAR DEGENERATION

09:23.200 --> 09:28.067
UNLIKE PILLS MADE FROM

09:28.067 --> 09:28.800
CHEMICALS, THEY'RE MORE COMPLEX,

09:28.800 --> 09:32.467
MADE IN LIVING ORGANISMS

09:32.467 --> 09:34.333
RESULTING IN PROTEINS.

09:34.333 --> 09:39.500
THEY WORK WITH THE BODY TO

09:39.500 --> 09:41.400
NORMALIZE ITS IMMUNE SYSTEM IN A

09:41.400 --> 09:43.000
WAY CHEMICALS DON'T.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.767
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH

09:45.767 --> 09:46.700
AND DEVELOPMENT POLICY

09:46.700 --> 09:48.933
AMGEN IS ONE OF THE LARGES

09:48.933 --> 09:51.300
MANUFACTURERS OF BIOLOGIC,

09:51.300 --> 09:53.133
INCLUDING THE DRUG DELUCA TAKES.

09:53.133 --> 09:54.833
>> EVERYONE IS VERY EXCITE

09:54.833 --> 09:56.367
ABOUT WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS IN

09:56.367 --> 09:58.900
TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO TREA

09:58.900 --> 10:01.333
DISEASES LIKE HIGH CHOLESTEROL

10:01.333 --> 10:03.767
OR DISEASES LIKE ALZHEIMER'S AND

10:03.767 --> 10:04.767
FIGHTING CANCER.

10:04.767 --> 10:06.133
BUT ALSO FOR DISEASES WHERE

10:06.133 --> 10:08.400
PATIENT WILL HAVE A CHRONIC,

10:08.400 --> 10:10.433
LIFE-LONG DISEASE.

10:10.433 --> 10:13.467
SINCE DELUCA'S CONDITION I

10:13.467 --> 10:15.000
CHRONIC, EVERY MONDAY MORNING HE

10:15.000 --> 10:16.967
GOES TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A

10:16.967 --> 10:17.100
INJECTION.

10:17.100 --> 10:19.333
THE BIOLOGIC MEDICATION HA

10:19.333 --> 10:21.700
HELPED, THE DELUCAS SAY, BUT

10:21.700 --> 10:22.833
IT'S ALSO EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE.

10:22.833 --> 10:26.367
>> WHEN YOU HEARD THE PRICE OF

10:26.367 --> 10:29.000
THE SHOT, CAN YOU TELL US WHAT

10:29.000 --> 10:30.733
YOUR REACTION WAS?

10:30.733 --> 10:32.667
>> I WAS SHOCKED

10:32.667 --> 10:35.400
I WAS AB -- I HAD NO IDEA THAT

10:35.400 --> 10:36.800
THIS COULD COST THIS MUCH.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.400
>> HAD YOU SEEN A MEDICATION

10:38.400 --> 10:40.833
THAT HAS COST THAT MUCH BEFORE

10:40.833 --> 10:41.300
>> NO.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.533
>> ACCORDING TO A BILL DELUC

10:43.533 --> 10:46.167
SHOWED US, A SINGLE INJECTIO

10:46.167 --> 10:47.300
COSTS $1,500

10:47.300 --> 10:49.167
UNDER HIS INSURANCE PLAN, HI

10:49.167 --> 10:51.533
CO-PAY ENDED UP BEING $196

10:51.533 --> 10:53.267
AND REMEMBER, HE WAS GOING T

10:53.267 --> 10:54.933
THE HOSPITAL EVERY WEEK.

10:54.933 --> 10:57.033
SO THE CO-PAY TURNED OUT TO BE

10:57.033 --> 10:59.667
NEARLY $800 A MONTH.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.833
>> IT'S FINANCIALLY DIFFICULT.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.033
WE'RE ON A PENSION

11:03.033 --> 11:05.867
AND $196 A WEEK EXTRA COMING OUT

11:05.867 --> 11:07.033
OF THAT PENSION IS A LOT O

11:07.033 --> 11:07.700
MONEY FOR US

11:07.700 --> 11:09.133
>> CAN YOU AFFORD IT

11:09.133 --> 11:10.300
>> CAN I AFFORD IT

11:10.300 --> 11:12.000
>> I HAVE TO AFFORD IT

11:12.000 --> 11:14.300
I HAVE TO PAY IT

11:14.300 --> 11:14.667
IT'S A BILL.

11:14.667 --> 11:16.867
>> BUT WHY IS IT SO EXPENSIVE?

11:16.867 --> 11:18.733
SOME CRITICS SAY IT'S BECAUS

11:18.733 --> 11:19.933
THERE'S NO SYSTEM IN THIS PLAC

11:19.933 --> 11:22.667
IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WOULD MAK

11:22.667 --> 11:24.667
GENERIC BIOLOGICS AVAILABLE.

11:24.667 --> 11:26.367
BUT THEY ARE SOLD OVERSEAS AND

11:26.367 --> 11:29.133
AT A MUCH LOWER PRICE AND HAVE

11:29.133 --> 11:32.267
BEEN FOR NEARLY EIGHT YEARS.

11:32.267 --> 11:35.433
THERE THEY ARE KNOWN A

11:35.433 --> 11:35.633
BIOSIMILARS.

11:35.633 --> 11:37.533
>> THERE ARE ALREADY BIOSIMILARS

11:37.533 --> 11:39.167
ON THE MARKETPLACE, THE DISCOUNT

11:39.167 --> 11:42.033
IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 30 AND 50%.

11:42.033 --> 11:44.300
SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TENS OF

11:44.300 --> 11:46.433
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS OF SAVING

11:46.433 --> 11:47.767
ANNUALLY FOR EACH AND EVER

11:47.767 --> 11:48.133
PATIENT.

11:48.133 --> 11:49.833
>> SO EUROPE IS ALREADY USIN

11:49.833 --> 11:51.767
THESE BIOSIMILARS?

11:51.767 --> 11:52.867
>> MUCH OF THE WORLD IS WA

11:52.867 --> 11:54.500
AHEAD OF US.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.433
SO JAPAN, CANADA, MUCH OF EUROPE

11:57.433 --> 11:59.400
ALREADY HAS BIOSIMILARS IN THEIR

11:59.400 --> 12:01.000
MARKETPLACE, AND PATIENTS AR

12:01.000 --> 12:03.200
ALREADY BENEFITTING FROM BOT

12:03.200 --> 12:06.333
THE GREAT PRODUCTS AND THE

12:06.333 --> 12:07.233
DISCOUNT

12:07.233 --> 12:09.700
>> STEVE MILLER IS THE CHIEF

12:09.700 --> 12:12.667
MEDICAL OFFICER AT EXPRESS

12:12.667 --> 12:13.400
SCRIPTS WHICH NEGOTIATES PRICE

12:13.400 --> 12:17.200
WITH PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES.

12:17.200 --> 12:19.033
>> PATIENTS LIKE DELUCA AR

12:19.033 --> 12:20.300
FORCED TO PAY MUCH MORE FO

12:20.300 --> 12:21.967
THEIR BIOLOGICS BECAUSE THERE'

12:21.967 --> 12:23.533
NO COMPETITION IN THE U.S.

12:23.533 --> 12:25.900
IN EUROPE, THERE ARE AT LEAS

12:25.900 --> 12:28.500
FIVE VERSIONS OF DELUCA'

12:28.500 --> 12:30.300
BIOLOGIC, WHERE, ACCORDING T

12:30.300 --> 12:31.567
MANUFACTURERS, THEY ARE SOLD FOR

12:31.567 --> 12:33.433
UP TO 30% LESS THAN THE BRAN

12:33.433 --> 12:36.200
NAME BIOLOGIC.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.800
SO WHY AREN'T LESS EXPENSIVE

12:37.800 --> 12:41.900
VERSIONS OF DELUCA'S DRUG OR ANY

12:41.900 --> 12:43.867
BIOSIMILARS AVAILABLE IN THI

12:43.867 --> 12:44.233
COUNTRY?

12:44.233 --> 12:45.500
THAT'S BECAUSE WHEN CONGRESS

12:45.500 --> 12:48.667
PASSED THE HATCH-WAXMAN BILL 3

12:48.667 --> 12:51.233
YEARS AGO CREATING GENERIC

12:51.233 --> 12:53.900
DRUGS, BIOLOGICS BARELY EXISTED.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.433
>> IF THEY COULD BE SOLD, WOUL

12:56.433 --> 12:57.767
PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO SOMETHIN

12:57.767 --> 12:59.367
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO NO

12:59.367 --> 13:00.333
BECAUSE IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE

13:00.333 --> 13:04.067
>> JUST LIKE WHEN YOU USE

13:04.067 --> 13:07.033
GENERIC DRUG AND YOU HAVE A $4

13:07.033 --> 13:09.133
PAYMENT OR $10 PAYMENT, THE SAME

13:09.133 --> 13:11.467
THING WOULD HAPPEN WIT

13:11.467 --> 13:12.733
BIOLOJICS, YOU'D HAVE A MUCH

13:12.733 --> 13:13.833
LOWER CO-PAY

13:13.833 --> 13:18.200
>> IN 2009, THE FEDERAL TRAD

13:18.200 --> 13:21.900
COMMISSION REACHED A SIMILAR

13:21.900 --> 13:22.333
CONCLUSION

13:22.333 --> 13:24.733
COMPETITION MEANS LOWER PRICES

13:24.733 --> 13:28.933
HE SAYS HIS COMPANY IS OPEN TO

13:28.933 --> 13:29.433
COMPETITION, BUT CAUTIONS THAT

13:29.433 --> 13:30.967
BIOSIMILARS CANNOT BE APPROACHED

13:30.967 --> 13:34.067
THE SAME WAY AS TRADITIONA

13:34.067 --> 13:34.400
DRUGS.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.867
>> THEY'RE DIFFERENT

13:35.867 --> 13:36.800
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE IN DRUG

13:36.800 --> 13:38.900
AND CHEMICALS.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.433
THE PREVAILING THOUGHT IS THAT

13:41.433 --> 13:42.400
GENERICS ARE THE SAME AN

13:42.400 --> 13:45.200
THEY'RE THE SAME AS THE BRAN

13:45.200 --> 13:45.333
MEDICINE

13:45.333 --> 13:46.600
IN THE FUTURE WORLD, BECAUSE

13:46.600 --> 13:48.400
THEY'RE EXPRESSED IN LIVIN

13:48.400 --> 13:51.233
CELLS, EACH MEDICINE WILL HAVE

13:51.233 --> 13:53.667
ITS OWN PARTICULAR PROFILE

13:53.667 --> 13:54.867
>> THAT MEANS BIOSIMILARS WILL

13:54.867 --> 13:56.833
NEVER BE IDENTICAL TO TH

13:56.833 --> 13:59.133
ORIGINAL BIOLOGIC.

13:59.133 --> 14:01.967
ACCORDING TO THE NEW ENGLAND

14:01.967 --> 14:03.733
JOURNAL OF MEDICINE, GIVEN THE

14:03.733 --> 14:08.967
COMPLEX NATURE OF BIOLOGICS,

14:08.967 --> 14:11.500
IT'S UNLIKELY A ONE SIZE FIT

14:11.500 --> 14:14.633
ALL CAN BE DEVELOPED

14:14.633 --> 14:15.900
BUT PEOPLE THINK THEY SHOULD

14:15.900 --> 14:19.433
LOOK TO THE EUROPEAN UNION AS

14:19.433 --> 14:20.167
MODEL.

14:20.167 --> 14:22.100
THEIR AGENCY HAS BEEN APPROVIN

14:22.100 --> 14:23.033
BIOSIMILARS THERE FOR EIGH

14:23.033 --> 14:23.200
YEARS.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.100
>> THERE'S NOT BEEN A SINGLE

14:25.100 --> 14:26.800
EPISODE WITH A BIOSIMILAR IN

14:26.800 --> 14:28.300
EUROPE THAT HAS RISEN TO THE

14:28.300 --> 14:29.100
POINT OF CONCERN

14:29.100 --> 14:30.833
AND THEY'VE HAD A GREAT TRAC

14:30.833 --> 14:31.000
RECORD

14:31.000 --> 14:34.167
>> IN AN E-MAIL TO NEWS HOUR,

2006

14:43.233 --> 14:44.800
STILL, IKE SAYS NEW PROCEDURES

14:44.800 --> 14:46.633
HAVE TO BE IN PLACE BEFORE

14:46.633 --> 14:48.367
BIOSIMILARS HIT THE U.S. MARKET.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.167
>> YOU REALLY HAVE TO HAVE A

14:50.167 --> 14:51.200
PROGRAM IN PLACE THAT GETS THE

14:51.200 --> 14:52.833
FROM THE LAW THAT ENABLES THEM

14:52.833 --> 14:54.433
TO BE APPROVED, TO THE FDA

14:54.433 --> 14:55.500
APPROVAL, TO THE WAY THA

14:55.500 --> 14:56.700
THEY'RE GOING TO BE USED I

14:56.700 --> 14:57.767
HEALTH CARE.

14:57.767 --> 14:58.967
>> THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT

14:58.967 --> 15:01.267
PASSED IN 2010, AUTHORIZED THE

15:01.267 --> 15:02.867
FDA TO SET UP AN APPROVA

15:02.867 --> 15:04.233
PROCESS FOR BIOSIMILARS.

15:04.233 --> 15:06.500
BUT IN THE FOUR YEARS SINCE, NOT

15:06.500 --> 15:09.033
A SINGLE BIOSIMILAR HAS HIT TH

15:09.033 --> 15:09.567
U.S. MARKET.

15:09.567 --> 15:13.133
WHAT'S TAKING THE FDA SO LONG?

15:13.133 --> 15:16.400
>> IN AN E-MAIL TO THE NEWS HOUR

15:16.400 --> 15:18.267
AN FD SPOKESPERSON WROTE

15:18.267 --> 15:22.200
CONGRESS SET A HIGH BAR FOR

15:22.200 --> 15:23.167
BIOSIMILAR PRODUCT APPROVAL.

15:23.167 --> 15:24.900
THEY HAVE TO MEET THE STANDARD

15:24.900 --> 15:27.000
OF SAFETY, EFFICACY AND HIGH

15:27.000 --> 15:28.333
QUALITY THAT EVERYONE EXPECT

15:28.333 --> 15:29.167
AND COUNTS ON.

15:29.167 --> 15:31.733
BUT MILLER SAYS THE FDA HAS BEEN

15:31.733 --> 15:34.900
IMPEDED BY BIOLOGIC COMPANIE

15:34.900 --> 15:38.833
THAT HAVE LOBBIED CONGRESS T

15:38.833 --> 15:39.567
STALL COMPETITION.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.933
HE SAYS THE STRATEGY IS DESIGNED

15:41.933 --> 15:43.433
TO PROTECT THE HUGE PROFITS THEY

15:43.433 --> 15:45.067
MAKE OFF THEIR BIOLOGIC DRUGS.

15:45.067 --> 15:47.367
>> IF YOU THINK ABOUT JUST ONE

15:47.367 --> 15:50.533
DRUG MADE BY AMGEN, THEI

15:50.533 --> 15:54.233
PROFITS A MONTH ARE OVER $10

15:54.233 --> 15:54.367
MILLION.

15:54.367 --> 15:55.600
THAT PRODUCT CAME ON THE MARKE

15:55.600 --> 15:56.467
IN 1989.

15:56.467 --> 15:59.800
>> IKE SAYS THE HIGH PRICE O

15:59.800 --> 16:01.267
BIOLOGICS IS JUSTIFIED

16:01.267 --> 16:03.300
>> THEY ARE EXPENSIVE TO

16:03.300 --> 16:03.433
MANUFACTURE.

16:03.433 --> 16:05.867
THE WORKFORCE IS MADE UP O

16:05.867 --> 16:07.867
Ph.D. SCIENTISTS WHO ON A DAIL

16:07.867 --> 16:09.400
BASIS ARE MANAGING THE

16:09.400 --> 16:11.600
PRODUCTION OF THESE MEDICINES.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.700
SO THERE'S A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT

16:14.700 --> 16:15.733
OF INVESTMENT THAT GOES INTO

16:15.733 --> 16:16.900
MAKING AND MANUFACTURING HIG

16:16.900 --> 16:18.633
QUALITY BIOLOGIC MEDICINE.

16:18.633 --> 16:20.733
>> SOME PEOPLE SAY AMGEN IS ABLE

16:20.733 --> 16:22.633
TO CHARGE $50,000 A YEAR FOR A

16:22.633 --> 16:24.467
PARTICULAR MEDICATION BECAUSE IT

16:24.467 --> 16:24.600
CAN.

16:24.600 --> 16:25.867
BECAUSE IT'S ABLE TO

16:25.867 --> 16:27.067
THERE'S NO REGULATION.

16:27.067 --> 16:29.667
AND WHEN THOSE ISSUES COME UP, A

16:29.667 --> 16:31.433
COMPANY LIKE AMGEN HAS BEEN VERY

16:31.433 --> 16:34.267
SUCCESSFUL AT LOBBYING T

16:34.267 --> 16:35.733
PREVENT ANY MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF

16:38.833 --> 16:41.033
BUT WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THA

16:41.033 --> 16:42.300
WE'RE A COMPANY THAT'S FOCUSED

16:42.300 --> 16:43.067
ON THE FUTURE.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.767
SO IF THERE ARE REVENUES HERE,

16:44.767 --> 16:46.533
WE WANT TO INVEST IN CLINICA

16:46.533 --> 16:48.733
STUDIES FOR NEW CLINICAL TRIAL

16:48.733 --> 16:51.133
AND FOR NEW MEDICINES.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.733

16:53.733 --> 16:55.233
SO AGAINST BIOSIMILARS, IT

16:55.233 --> 16:56.733
WOULDN'T HAVE ITS OWN PLANS TO

16:56.733 --> 16:58.000
START SELLING THEM

16:58.000 --> 16:59.633
>> ONE OF THE POINTS AMGEN MAKES

16:59.633 --> 17:01.500
IS THEY TOO ARE GETTING INTO THE

17:01.500 --> 17:02.133
BIOSIMILAR MARKETPLACE

17:02.133 --> 17:03.233
THEY DON'T SEE ANYTHING THEY'R

17:03.233 --> 17:05.300
DOING AS A ROADBLOCK TO GETTIN

17:05.300 --> 17:06.833
BIOSIMILARS ON THE MARKET.

17:06.833 --> 17:09.067
IS THAT FAIR

17:09.067 --> 17:11.267
>> THE REALITY IS THAT THE

17:11.267 --> 17:12.633
ACTUALLY ARE WELL POSITIONED T

17:12.633 --> 17:15.333
MAKE BIOSIMILARS, BUT THEY

17:15.333 --> 17:17.967
PROBABLY MAKE MORE ON THEI

17:17.967 --> 17:19.533
BRANDED PRODUCT THAN THEIR

17:19.533 --> 17:20.000
BIOSIMILAR

17:20.000 --> 17:21.667
SO IT MAKES SENSE EVERY MONT

17:21.667 --> 17:23.133
THEY CAN DELAY, MAKES A LOT OF

17:23.133 --> 17:24.033
MONEY FOR THEM

17:24.033 --> 17:26.600
>> NOW, THESE MEDICINES THAT

17:26.600 --> 17:29.633

17:29.633 --> 17:31.333

18:34.467 --> 18:34.700
TARGETED

SO WHAT ARE THEY DOING IN THE UK

18:36.400 --> 18:37.900
WITH THIS CLINICAL TRIAL

18:37.900 --> 18:38.900
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING ABOUT IT

18:51.100 --> 18:53.367
TUMORS, AND THE DAMAGE BROUGHT

18:53.367 --> 18:55.700
ON BY THOSE GENES MAKES THOS

18:55.700 --> 18:58.533
CANCER CELLS VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO

18:58.533 --> 18:58.867

18:58.867 --> 19:01.833
SO IF YOU FIND ONE OF THES

19:01.833 --> 19:04.233
GENETIC CHANGES AND GIVE A

19:04.233 --> 19:07.700
PATIENT A DRUG TARGETING THAT,

19:07.700 --> 19:09.200
ALMOST SURELY THEIR CANCER WIL

NOT AFFECTED

19:12.700 --> 19:15.000
IT'S EXACTLY WHAT ONCOLOGIST

19:15.000 --> 19:15.633
HOPE TO DO

19:15.633 --> 19:17.667
WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE UK I

19:17.667 --> 19:20.733
DEVELOPING A NATIONWIDE PROGRA

19:50.600 --> 19:53.033
WE'RE USED TO TRIALS THAT'S ON

20:00.767 --> 20:02.633
WHEN EVERYONE GOT THE ONE,

20:02.633 --> 20:04.033
SOMETIMES IT HELPED, SOMETIMES

20:04.033 --> 20:04.533
IT DIDN'T.

20:04.533 --> 20:06.700
WE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW WHA

20:06.700 --> 20:07.933

20:07.933 --> 20:09.233
SHRINK OR NOT.

20:09.233 --> 20:11.100
THIS GENETIC INFORMATION IS

20:11.100 --> 20:13.967
WAY WE CAN DO THIS, PERSONALIZED

20:13.967 --> 20:16.600
MEDICINE, RIGHT DRUG FOR THE

20:16.600 --> 20:16.767
RIGHT PATIENT.

20:16.767 --> 20:19.300
>> SO IF THIS TRIAL HAPPEN

20:19.300 --> 20:21.167
SUCCESSFULLY IN THE UK, DOES I

20:21.167 --> 20:22.867
MEAN IT CAN HAPPEN HERE ON A

20:22.867 --> 20:27.967
LARGER SCALE IN THE U.S.

20:27.967 --> 20:30.333
>> IT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE

20:30.333 --> 20:30.833
WORLD.

20:30.833 --> 20:33.033
14 HOSPITALS HERE DID SOMETHIN

20:33.033 --> 20:34.233
VERY MUCH LIKE THIS.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.233
THERE ARE PROGRAMS IN FRANCE A

20:37.233 --> 20:37.533
WELL

20:37.533 --> 20:38.500
IT'S A WORLDWIDE MOVEMENT.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.633
THE FACT THAT THE UK IS DOIN

20:40.633 --> 20:42.033
IT, THEY'RE A LITTLE SOMETIMES

20:42.033 --> 20:43.833
SLOWER TO EMBRACE NE

20:43.833 --> 20:45.367
TECHNOLOGIES AND NEW DRUGS, AN

20:45.367 --> 20:47.200
THE FACT THAT THEY'RE DOING IT

20:47.200 --> 20:48.500
SAYS THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY, THI

20:48.500 --> 20:50.700
IDEA IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE

20:50.700 --> 20:50.967
MAINSTREAM

20:50.967 --> 20:53.133
IT'S REALLY GOING TO ACCELERAT

20:53.133 --> 20:53.300
PROGRESS

20:53.300 --> 20:56.000
>> SO, TELL ME ABOUT HOW THIS IS

20:56.000 --> 20:58.133
GOING TO MAKE THIS LARGER SHIFT,

20:58.133 --> 21:00.200
IN TERMS OF PERSONALIZED

21:00.200 --> 21:02.433
MEDICINE, ALMOST ON A GENETI

21:02.433 --> 21:04.200
LEVEL, TARGETING EACH PATIEN

21:04.200 --> 21:06.300
WITH THE SPECIFIC DRUG THA

21:06.300 --> 21:07.467
COULD CURE THEIR CANCER.

21:07.467 --> 21:09.233
>> SO THE WAY IT'S HAPPENING NOW

21:09.233 --> 21:12.200
IS THAT WHEN THE CANCER IS FIRST

21:12.200 --> 21:14.600
DISCOVERED, THESE GENETIC TEST

21:14.600 --> 21:15.600
ARE DONE

21:15.600 --> 21:18.167
IN THE PANEL AT SLOAN-KETTERING,

21:18.167 --> 21:21.833
WE TEST FOR 340 DIFFERENT GENES.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.900
THEN WHAT WE TRY TO DO IS FIND

21:23.900 --> 21:25.333
THE DRUGS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY

21:25.333 --> 21:27.233
TO HELP THE PERSON WHOSE CANCE

21:27.233 --> 21:32.000
IS DRIVEN BY THESE GENES

21:32.000 --> 21:35.633
THESE GENES MAKE A CANCER CELL

21:35.633 --> 21:40.767
HORRIBLY DEPENDENT THAT THES

21:40.767 --> 21:41.600
GENES PRODUCE.

21:41.600 --> 21:43.733
ACHILLES HEEL HAS BEEN THE TER

21:43.733 --> 21:44.967
THAT HAS BEEN USED

21:44.967 --> 21:47.833
SO IF YOU CAN GO AFTER THAT, THE

21:47.833 --> 21:49.567
CANCER CELLS DIE

21:49.567 --> 21:52.267
AND THESE DRUGS ARE MUCH LES

21:52.267 --> 21:53.200
DISRUPTIVE TO NORMAL PEOPLE.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.400
IF YOU KNOW THIS PERSON'S CANCER

21:55.400 --> 21:57.633
CELLS DON'T HAVE THIS MEDICINE

21:57.633 --> 21:59.033
