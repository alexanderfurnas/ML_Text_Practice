JUDY WOODRUFF: And now to
the day's other major story.

00:03.466 --> 00:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is in London, where a
fast-moving fire engulfed a
high-rise apartment building.

00:08.766 --> 00:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It killed at least 12
people and injured scores.

00:11.200 --> 00:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a report from Dan
Rivers of Independent Television
News, and with a warning: Some

00:15.733 --> 00:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the images and sounds
may be disturbing.

00:18.200 --> 00:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: With horrifying
ferocity, the fire consumed
Grenfell Tower in minutes, a

00:29.366 --> 00:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
24-floor inferno from which
there was no escape for some.

00:34.166 --> 00:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trapped by smoke and flames,
residents signaled their plight
from on high as the building

00:40.266 --> 00:45.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
disintegrated around them.

00:48.833 --> 00:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On this mobile phone footage,
the cries for help are chilling.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Help!

00:57.833 --> 00:59.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Help!

00:59.966 --> 01:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We saw people looking out
of the windows, screaming help,
screaming, help, help, flashing

01:06.466 --> 01:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their lights and everything.

01:07.900 --> 01:12.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And now all those windows,
people are gone, literally gone.

01:13.633 --> 01:15.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: I saw one person
trying to jump out.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One actually jumped out,
and obviously what happened.

01:17.300 --> 01:19.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's just a nightmare.

01:19.366 --> 01:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: The streets around
Grenfell Tower were soon full
of those who escaped its flames,

01:27.966 --> 01:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
children among those suffering
from the acrid fumes.

01:34.966 --> 01:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An exhausted little girl
is cradled as the shock
and bewilderment sink in.

01:42.433 --> 01:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many here have lost everything.

01:44.800 --> 01:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some are still unsure what's
happened to neighbors,
friends, loved ones.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, above them,
the fire raged on.

01:53.433 --> 01:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As the sky lightened,
the flames continued
to devour the building.

02:01.333 --> 02:06.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This was the view from the
SOUTH BANK, the plume of
smoke visible for 20 miles.

02:07.866 --> 02:10.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
With daylight, stories
of extraordinary escape
started to emerge.

02:10.533 --> 02:14.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMIRA LAMRANI, Witness: A
lady appeared at the window,
gesturing, body language, from

02:14.233 --> 02:17.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
what she was saying, I'm
about to throw my baby,
please catch the baby.

02:17.900 --> 02:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the baby, I think,
was wrapped in some sort
of bed sheet, blanket.

02:23.633 --> 02:25.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And she threw the baby.

02:25.766 --> 02:29.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the baby came down -- and
this was about approximately
from the ninth or 10th floor

02:29.166 --> 02:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
- - a member of the public,
a gentleman ran forward and
miraculously grabbed the baby.

02:33.833 --> 02:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, like I said, above you,
from the left, from the right,
mostly kids, it was harrowing,

02:39.966 --> 02:43.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
torturing screams
for help, young kids.

02:43.666 --> 02:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think also, where
the fire was now spread,
people were reaching out
from the front window,

02:50.633 --> 02:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to grasp a bit of
fresh air, trying to breathe
in like they were struggling.

02:52.733 --> 02:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there were, at one point,
one window about four or five
heads all squeezing their heads

02:57.666 --> 02:58.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
through.

02:58.900 --> 03:00.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It was honestly
like a horror movie.

03:00.933 --> 03:05.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: Some had
knotted sheets together
in an attempt to escape.

03:05.233 --> 03:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But even this left them
several floors short of safety.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: People were
jumping off buildings.

03:10.333 --> 03:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
People were screaming, saying,
help me, help me, help me.

03:13.200 --> 03:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: The cause
of the fire is unknown,
but one resident claims
it spread from her

03:17.733 --> 03:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neighbor's flat, possibly
a faulty appliance.

03:20.100 --> 03:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: The fire started from
the kitchen, but I don't know
exactly -- from which problem,

03:23.333 --> 03:24.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

03:24.800 --> 03:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it was from the kitchen,
because the flat door was open.

03:30.866 --> 03:34.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAN RIVERS: It's already
clear the death toll
will be significant.

03:34.033 --> 03:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Up to 600 people lived in
Grenfell House in 120 flats.

03:40.966 --> 03:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For those who were on the
very upper floors, the
odds of survival seem slim.

03:46.500 --> 03:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those fighting the fire
confirmed today how challenging
it's been to extinguish.

03:51.266 --> 03:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: This was an unprecedented
fire in terms of scale,
speed, and spread.

03:58.233 --> 04:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just to reiterate that
point, the incident continues
to be a challenging incident for

04:02.033 --> 04:04.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

04:04.033 --> 04:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN RIVERS: There is speculation
a gap behind a recently added
external cladding may have

04:09.433 --> 04:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
created a chimney effect,
allowing the flames to spread.

04:14.766 --> 04:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some had to wait all
night before they escaped.

04:17.100 --> 04:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This man was still
calling for help six hours
after the fire started.

04:24.133 --> 04:27.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At times, he disappeared
into clouds of smoke,
but, incredibly, he did
finally make it out,

04:29.600 --> 04:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of 65 rescued from
Grenfell Tower today.

04:33.733 --> 04:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, while most of the
flames have been put out, the
charred shell of the tower block

04:39.466 --> 04:41.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
continues to smolder.

04:41.533 --> 04:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It may be days before the
final death toll is known, and
much longer before the cause

04:47.400 --> 04:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of this tragedy is pinpointed.

04:49.500 --> 04:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Prime Minister
Theresa May promised a full
investigation, and the British

04:56.533 --> 04:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
government ordered safety
checks at other high-rises
undergoing renovations.
