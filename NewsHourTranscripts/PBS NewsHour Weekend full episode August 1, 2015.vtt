FOR SATURDAY, AUGUST 1: THE

00:13.180 --> 00:14.514
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S STUNNING

00:14.514 --> 00:16.250
INVESTIGATION OF DISCRIMINATION

00:16.250 --> 00:17.451
AGAINST BLACK CHILDREN IN THE

00:17.451 --> 00:19.519
ST. LOUIS FAMILY COURT SYSTEM;

00:19.519 --> 00:21.021
AND CANDIDATES COLLECTING

00:21.021 --> 00:22.923
MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF FACEBOOK DATA

00:22.923 --> 00:26.360
ON INDIVIDUAL VOTERS; AND IN OUR

00:26.360 --> 00:27.895
SIGNATURE SEGMENT, HOME OR

00:27.895 --> 00:28.862
HOTEL?

00:28.862 --> 00:29.997
A NEW BATTLE IN THE SHARING

00:29.997 --> 00:31.865
ECONOMY OVER AIRBNB.

00:31.865 --> 00:32.933
SO, WE'RE SITTING IN AN ILLEGAL

00:32.933 --> 00:33.700
HOTEL ROOM, ACCORDING TO THE

00:33.700 --> 00:34.434
STATE SENATOR.

00:34.434 --> 00:35.235
>> (LAUGHS)

00:35.235 --> 00:36.236
YES, I HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF

00:36.236 --> 00:37.437
OPINION WITH HER, FOR SURE.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.505
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO FEEL

00:38.505 --> 00:39.740
LIKE MY HOME IS A HOTEL.

00:39.740 --> 00:40.540
>> Sreenivasan: NEXT ON PBS

00:40.540 --> 00:41.842
NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

00:41.842 --> 00:44.211
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

00:44.211 --> 00:45.913
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

00:45.913 --> 00:47.481
HARI SREENIVASAN.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.382
>> Sreenivasan: GOOD EVENING,

00:48.382 --> 00:49.449
AND THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:49.449 --> 00:50.918
WE BEGIN WITH A SCATHING FEDERAL

00:50.918 --> 00:53.120
REPORT ON THE ST. LOUIS COUNTY

00:53.120 --> 00:54.621
JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:54.621 --> 00:55.722
THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

00:55.722 --> 00:57.291
SAYS THE COUNTY DISCRIMINATES

00:57.291 --> 00:58.725
AGAINST BLACK CHILDREN, TREATING

00:58.725 --> 01:00.193
THEM MORE HARSHLY THAN WHITE

01:00.193 --> 01:01.361
CHILDREN "BECAUSE OF THEIR

01:01.361 --> 01:02.195
RACE."

01:02.195 --> 01:03.297
ACCORDING TO THE JUSTICE

01:03.297 --> 01:04.398
DEPARTMENT'S CIVIL RIGHTS

01:04.398 --> 01:05.666
DIVISION, BLACK CHILDREN IN ST.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.968
LOUIS COUNTY ARE 1.5 TIMES MORE

01:07.968 --> 01:09.569
LIKELY THAN WHITE CHILDREN TO

01:09.569 --> 01:11.071
END UP IN FAMILY COURT IN THE

01:11.071 --> 01:12.272
FIRST PLACE.

01:12.272 --> 01:14.274
BLACK CHILDREN ARE 2.5 TIMES

01:14.274 --> 01:15.742
MORE LIKELY THAN WHITES TO BE

01:15.742 --> 01:17.611
DETAINED BEFORE THEIR TRIAL,

01:17.611 --> 01:19.346
AND, IF CONVICTED, THEY ARE MORE

01:19.346 --> 01:21.415
THAN 2.5 TIMES AS LIKELY TO BE

01:21.415 --> 01:23.517
HELD IN CUSTODY AFTER TRIAL.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.152
THE REPORT ALSO FOUND INADEQUATE

01:25.152 --> 01:26.787
REPRESENTATION FOR CHILDREN FROM

01:26.787 --> 01:28.422
LOW-INCOME FAMILIES NO MATTER

01:28.422 --> 01:30.624
WHAT RACE IN ST. LOUIS COUNTY,

01:30.624 --> 01:32.259
WHERE ONE JUVENILE PUBLIC

01:32.259 --> 01:35.662
DEFENDER HANDLED 394 CASES LAST

01:35.662 --> 01:36.663
YEAR.

01:36.663 --> 01:38.632
THE INVESTIGATION BEGAN IN 2013,

01:38.632 --> 01:40.133
NINE MONTHS BEFORE THE SHOOTING

01:40.133 --> 01:41.568
OF MICHAEL BROWN IN FERGUSON,

01:41.568 --> 01:43.170
MISSOURI, WHICH IS IN ST. LOUIS

01:43.170 --> 01:44.104
COUNTY.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.505
IN MARCH, THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

01:45.505 --> 01:46.873
ISSUED A SIMILARLY CRITICAL

01:46.873 --> 01:48.675
REPORT ABOUT DISPARATE RACIAL

01:48.675 --> 01:50.444
TREATMENT BY THE FERGUSON POLICE

01:50.444 --> 01:51.545
DEPARTMENT.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.647
YAMICHE ALCINDOR IS REPORTING ON

01:53.647 --> 01:55.182
THIS STORY FOR "U.S.A. TODAY,"

01:55.182 --> 01:56.350
AND SHE JOINS ME NOW FROM ST.

01:56.350 --> 01:57.117
LOUIS.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.552
SO THIS WAS A FAIRLY

01:58.552 --> 02:00.253
COMPREHENSIVE DIVE THAT THE

02:00.253 --> 02:01.388
D.O.J. TOOK.

02:01.388 --> 02:02.789
I MEAN, THEY LOOKED AT MORE THAN

02:02.789 --> 02:05.192
30,000 CASES OVER A THREE-YEAR

02:05.192 --> 02:06.293
PERIOD TO COME UP WITH THESE

02:06.293 --> 02:07.127
CONCLUSIONS.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.695
>> THEY DID.

02:08.695 --> 02:09.863
THEY REALLY TOOK THEIR TIME

02:09.863 --> 02:11.531
LOOKING AT THIS COURT SYSTEM

02:11.531 --> 02:12.766
BECAUSE I THINK THEY REALLY

02:12.766 --> 02:14.301
WANTED TO GO IN AND TALK TO THE

02:14.301 --> 02:15.202
PEOPLE.

02:15.202 --> 02:16.236
IF YOU LOOK AT THE REPORT THEY

02:16.236 --> 02:17.537
INTERVIEWED JUDGES.

02:17.537 --> 02:18.472
THEY INTERVIEWED PUBLIC

02:18.472 --> 02:19.373
DEFENDERS.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.007
THEY INTERVIEWED PRIVATE

02:20.007 --> 02:20.707
ATTORNEYS.

02:20.707 --> 02:21.541
THEY EVEN INTERVIEWED THE

02:21.541 --> 02:23.210
PARENTS OF THESE KIDS WHO THEY

02:23.210 --> 02:24.878
SAY RIGHTS WERE BEING VIOLATED.

02:24.878 --> 02:27.047
THEY DID A VERY DEEP DIVE AND

02:27.047 --> 02:30.817
TOOK THEIR TIME AND THIS IS

02:30.817 --> 02:32.352
SOMETHING THAT SHOWED BLACK

02:32.352 --> 02:33.854
CHILDREN WERE REALLY NOT BEING

02:33.854 --> 02:35.622
TREATED FAIRLY, AND CHILDREN,

02:35.622 --> 02:38.358
REGARDLESS OF THEIR RACE, THEIR

02:38.358 --> 02:39.526
RIGHTS WERE REALLY BEING

02:39.526 --> 02:40.360
VIOLATED.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.328
>> Sreenivasan: RIGHT, THOSE

02:41.328 --> 02:43.463
RIGHTS INCLUDING ONES NOT TO

02:43.463 --> 02:44.865
INCRIMINATE YOURSELF.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.066
IT SEEMED THE DIVERSIONARY

02:46.066 --> 02:48.068
PROGRAMS WERE CONTINGENT ON THE

02:48.068 --> 02:50.037
FACT, ADMIT GUILT AND YOU WON'T

02:50.037 --> 02:52.005
HAVE TO COME INTO THE SYSTEM.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.306
>> EXACTLY.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.842
AND EVEN THOUGH IT HAPPENED NINE

02:55.842 --> 02:57.444
MONTHS BEFORE MICHAEL BROWN WAS

02:57.444 --> 02:58.512
SHOT AND ALL THE UNREST THAT

02:58.512 --> 02:59.513
HAPPENED IN FERGUSON, THIS

02:59.513 --> 03:01.148
REALLY CALLS INTO QUESTION KIND

03:01.148 --> 03:02.549
OF HOW JUSTICE IS DEALT OUT IN

03:02.549 --> 03:04.151
THE ST. LOUIS AREA, AND REALLY,

03:04.151 --> 03:05.919
IN SOME WAYS, MAKES PEEMS REALLY

03:05.919 --> 03:07.888
THINK ABOUT HOW OUR STUDENTS AND

03:07.888 --> 03:09.356
HOW OUR KIDS, I SHOULD SAY, ARE

03:09.356 --> 03:10.123
REALLY BEING TREATED IN THIS

03:10.123 --> 03:10.924
AREA.

03:10.924 --> 03:11.958
ARE THEIR RIGHTS BEING PROTECTED

03:11.958 --> 03:13.226
BY THE PEOPLE YOU WOULD HOPE

03:13.226 --> 03:14.161
WOULD PROTECT THEM.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.395
YOU WOULD THINK A JUDGE, A

03:15.395 --> 03:16.830
PUBLIC DEFENDER, THE PEOPLE IN

03:16.830 --> 03:17.864
THESE CHILDREN'S LIVES DURING

03:17.864 --> 03:18.999
THE MOST DIFFICULT TIMES IN

03:18.999 --> 03:20.434
THEIR LIVES WOULD HAVE THEIR

03:20.434 --> 03:21.902
BEST INTEREST IN MIND BUT THE

03:21.902 --> 03:22.969
JUSTICE DEPARMENT IS SAYING THAT

03:22.969 --> 03:25.105
JUST WASN'T THE CASE.

03:25.105 --> 03:25.972
>> Sreenivasan: AND THEY ALSO

03:25.972 --> 03:27.374
FOUND A LACK OF UNIFORMITY AND

03:27.374 --> 03:29.276
ANY SORT OF STANDARD EVEN

03:29.276 --> 03:30.544
DETERMINING SOMETHING AS SIMPLE

03:30.544 --> 03:32.145
AS ARE YOU POOR ENOUGH THAT YOU

03:32.145 --> 03:33.213
SHOULD GET THIS PUBLIC DEFENDER

03:33.213 --> 03:34.915
OR NOT?

03:34.915 --> 03:36.483
>> THAT'S TRUE.

03:36.483 --> 03:37.617
AND ONE OF THE THINGS I FOUND

03:37.617 --> 03:39.352
ALSO INTERESTING WAS THE FACT

03:39.352 --> 03:40.954
THEY CRITICIZED THE STRUCTURE OF

03:40.954 --> 03:41.922
THE COURT, SAYING THERE WAS A

03:41.922 --> 03:43.056
LOT OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST,

03:43.056 --> 03:44.791
THAT PEOPLE THAT WERE SUPPOSE TO

03:44.791 --> 03:46.093
BE HAVING THESE CHILDREN'S BEST

03:46.093 --> 03:47.294
INTERESTS IN MIND WERE HAVING

03:47.294 --> 03:49.463
COMPETING INTERESTS AND PAID BY

03:49.463 --> 03:50.664
THE SAME PEOPLE WHO WERE NOW

03:50.664 --> 03:51.565
THEIR ADVERSARIES.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.166
THE IDEA THAT EVEN THE PEOPLE

03:53.166 --> 03:54.468
WHO WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

03:54.468 --> 03:55.836
PROTECTING THESE KIDS' RIGHTS

03:55.836 --> 03:57.237
HAD A CONFLICT OF INTEREST AND

03:57.237 --> 03:59.739
HAD TO ANSWER TO THE SAME PEOPLE

03:59.739 --> 04:01.775
THEY WERE ADVERSARIES AGAINST.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.577
>> Sreenivasan: 394 CASES A

04:03.577 --> 04:04.811
YEAR.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.480
AT THAT KIND OF VOLUME, YOU

04:06.480 --> 04:08.615
CAN'T MOUNT A VERY SPIRITED

04:08.615 --> 04:10.250
DEFENSE AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE

04:10.250 --> 04:12.119
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE FOUND LOTS

04:12.119 --> 04:14.054
OF CASE WHERE'S THERE WAS ALMOST

04:14.054 --> 04:16.256
NO PUSH-BACK AT ALL.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.591
>> YES, AND WHEN I WAS READING

04:17.591 --> 04:18.625
THAT REPORT, ONE OF THE THINGS

04:18.625 --> 04:20.093
THAT STRUCK ME, YOU TALKED ABOUT

04:20.093 --> 04:21.461
THE NUMBERS FOR BLACK CHILDREN,

04:21.461 --> 04:22.762
AND I TALKED TO SOME EXPERTS WHO

04:22.762 --> 04:24.131
WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT

04:24.131 --> 04:25.565
REALLY THERE WAS AN INHERENT

04:25.565 --> 04:26.833
BIAS GOING ON HERE, TOO, THE

04:26.833 --> 04:28.535
IDEA THAT YOU HAD, OBVIOUSLY,

04:28.535 --> 04:30.036
OVERWHELMED PUBLIC DEFENDERS BUT

04:30.036 --> 04:31.805
YOU ALSO HAD BLACK KIDS WHO WERE

04:31.805 --> 04:33.406
BEING DETAINED, NOT ONLY MORE

04:33.406 --> 04:36.610
BEFORE THE TRIAL BUT ALSO AFTER

04:36.610 --> 04:38.545
THEY GAVE A-- SOME OF A GUILTY

04:38.545 --> 04:40.847
PLEA IN FAMILY COURT OR IF THEY

04:40.847 --> 04:42.282
ALSO VIOLATED THEIR PROBATION

04:42.282 --> 04:43.350
THAT THEY WERE ALSO MORE LIKELY

04:43.350 --> 04:44.684
TO BE DETAINED.

04:44.684 --> 04:46.186
YOU WOULD INNING THIS CASE THE

04:46.186 --> 04:47.053
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IS REALLY

04:47.053 --> 04:48.989
SAYING THIS FAMILY COURT REALLY

04:48.989 --> 04:50.323
TREATED BLACK CHILDREN HARSHER

04:50.323 --> 04:51.658
AND REALLY TREATED THEM AND

04:51.658 --> 04:52.959
REALLY TREATED THEM IN THE WAY

04:52.959 --> 04:53.760
THAT VIOLATED THEIR

04:53.760 --> 04:54.795
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.563
SO I THINK THAT WAS REALLY

04:56.563 --> 04:57.264
IMPORTANT TO ME WHEN I WAS

04:57.264 --> 04:58.398
READING IT.

04:58.398 --> 04:59.232
>> Sreenivasan: AND SOMETHING

04:59.232 --> 05:00.267
ALSO INTERESTING IS THE FAMILY

05:00.267 --> 05:01.401
COURT DIDN'T SEEM TO COOPERATE

05:01.401 --> 05:02.936
VERY MUCH WITH THE D.O.J.

05:02.936 --> 05:04.104
THEY ONLY ALLOWED THEM TO WATCH

05:04.104 --> 05:05.906
A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TIME IN THE

05:05.906 --> 05:07.707
SESSION, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS

05:07.707 --> 05:09.075
THAT THE REPORT MENTIONED WAS

05:09.075 --> 05:10.310
THAT THE JUDGE WOULD BASICALLY

05:10.310 --> 05:11.411
RATTLE OFF A LOT OF LEGAL

05:11.411 --> 05:13.046
JARGON, AND THE KIDS WOULD JUST

05:13.046 --> 05:14.381
BE SAYING, "YES, SIR, YSIR, YES,

05:14.381 --> 05:16.383
SIR" WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING WHAT

05:16.383 --> 05:17.684
THEY WERE GIVING UP.

05:17.684 --> 05:19.786
>> WHEN I READ THAT, I THOUGHT

05:19.786 --> 05:21.121
IF YOU THINK ABOUT SOMEONE WHO

05:21.121 --> 05:22.289
IS IN FAMILY COURT, YOU THINK

05:22.289 --> 05:23.456
ABOUT A CHILD WHO IS REALLY IN

05:23.456 --> 05:25.025
NEED, WHO IS REALLY PROBABLY IN

05:25.025 --> 05:26.726
A CRIES MOMENT THEIR LIFE,

05:26.726 --> 05:28.061
SOMEONE WHO IS MAYBE 13 OR 14

05:28.061 --> 05:29.429
YEARS OLD, LISTENING TO ALL THIS

05:29.429 --> 05:30.730
LEGAL JARGON, EVEN AS A REPORTER

05:30.730 --> 05:32.566
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD TO FOLLOW

05:32.566 --> 05:33.567
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE COURTROOM

05:33.567 --> 05:35.569
SO IMAGINE BEING 14 OR 15

05:35.569 --> 05:38.004
LISTENING TO A JUDGE IN A VERY

05:38.004 --> 05:39.773
INTIMIDATING SETTING REALLY

05:39.773 --> 05:41.041
TALKING ABOUT YOUR FUTURE AND

05:41.041 --> 05:42.108
YOU JUST SAYING, "YES, SIR, YES,

05:42.108 --> 05:43.510
SIR," TO GET THROUGH THE MOMENT.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.744
IT'S REALLY HEARTBREAKING WHEN

05:44.744 --> 05:45.912
YOU THINK OF THAT BECAUSE YOU

05:45.912 --> 05:48.048
CAN IMAGINE THAT SCENE IN YOUR

05:48.048 --> 05:49.783
HEAD AND THINK THESE ARE REALLY

05:49.783 --> 05:51.051
CHILDREN WHO NEEDED THE HELP OF

05:51.051 --> 05:52.552
THIS COURT AND DIDN'T GET IT.

05:52.552 --> 05:54.020
>> Sreenivasan: THIS ISN'T THE

05:54.020 --> 05:55.222
ONLY PLACE THE DEPARTMENT OF

05:55.222 --> 05:57.123
JUSTICE HAS LOOKED AT, RIGHT?

05:57.123 --> 05:58.792
>> THIS ISN'T THE ONLY PLACE.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.228
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING, SHELBY

06:01.228 --> 06:03.296
COUNTY, WHICH INCLUDES MEMPHIS,

06:03.296 --> 06:04.598
THEY ACTUALLY HAD AN

06:04.598 --> 06:06.233
INVESTIGATION AGAINST THEM THAT

06:06.233 --> 06:07.534
WAS CLOSED AND THAT WAS ONE OF

06:07.534 --> 06:08.401
THE THINGS.

06:08.401 --> 06:09.569
THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT DALLAS

06:09.569 --> 06:11.304
COUNTY, TEXAS, AND FOR VERY

06:11.304 --> 06:12.639
SIMILAR VIOLATIONS IN LOOKING

06:12.639 --> 06:13.673
INTO HOW THEY TREAT THEIR

06:13.673 --> 06:14.474
YOUTHS.

06:14.474 --> 06:15.775
THIS IS NOT JUST FOCUSED ON THE

06:15.775 --> 06:16.943
ST. LOUIS AREA.

06:16.943 --> 06:18.245
THEY'RE ALSO LOOKING AT OTHER

06:18.245 --> 06:18.945
COUNTIES.

06:18.945 --> 06:19.646
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

06:19.646 --> 06:20.614
YAMICHE ALCINDOR, OF "USA

06:20.614 --> 06:24.050
TODAY," THANKS SO MUCH.

06:24.050 --> 06:24.784
"SUPER PACS,"

06:24.784 --> 06:25.552
THOSE POLITICAL ACTION

06:25.552 --> 06:26.620
COMMITTEES WITH NO LIMITS ON

06:26.620 --> 06:29.089

07:56.743 --> 07:58.311

07:58.311 --> 07:59.612
FOR OURSELVES.

07:59.612 --> 08:01.181
LAST WEEKEND, WE TOOK A LOOK AT

08:01.181 --> 08:02.515
HOW SERVICES LIKE UBER AND

08:02.515 --> 08:04.084
INSTACART ARE CHALLENGING THE

08:04.084 --> 08:06.086
DEFINITION OF AN EMPLOYEE AND AN

08:06.086 --> 08:07.587
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.089
TONIGHT, WE LOOK AT HOW PRIVATE

08:09.089 --> 08:10.490
HOMES AND APARTMENTS ARE

08:10.490 --> 08:12.392
BECOMING A SHARED RESOURCE.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.127
SHORT-TERM RENTAL COMPANIES LIKE

08:14.127 --> 08:16.396
AIRBNB AND PEOPLE THAT USE THEM

08:16.396 --> 08:18.264
ARE CHALLENGING THE TRADITIONAL

08:18.264 --> 08:20.066
DEFINITION OF A HOTEL.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.101
AND IN CITIES AROUND THE

08:21.101 --> 08:22.702
COUNTRY, PUBLIC OFFICIALS ARE

08:22.702 --> 08:24.237
QUESTIONING WHETHER RENTING OUT

08:24.237 --> 08:26.506
YOUR HOME SHOULD EVEN BE LEGAL.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.074
SO, IT'S A TWO-BEDROOM?

08:28.074 --> 08:29.442
>> YEAH, TWO BEDROOMS.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.377

08:40.620 --> 08:42.021
COUNTRY.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.289
AND SO, WHEN WE KNEW WE WERE

08:43.289 --> 08:44.357
GOING AWAY, I WOULD JUST MAKE

08:44.357 --> 08:45.525
THE APARTMENT AVAILABLE.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.227
WE HAVE A SPACE THAT SLEEPS SIX,

08:47.227 --> 08:49.562
SO PEOPLE ALMOST ALWAYS RENTED

08:49.562 --> 08:50.463
IT.

08:50.463 --> 08:51.531
IT JUST KEPT GOING WELL, AND WE

08:51.531 --> 08:52.432
KEPT HAVING ALL THESE GOOD

WEEKEND OR A VACATION.

COLLECTS A BOOKING FEE.

JENNIFER-- SHE DID NOT WANT US

09:08.681 --> 09:10.316
TO USE HER LAST NAME-- CHARGES

UP TO $200 A NIGHT TO RENT HER

THE CITY HAS TO OFFER, YOU KNOW.

>> Sreenivasan: WHAT SOUNDS LIKE

09:27.967 --> 09:29.569
A WIN-WIN SITUATION FOR JENNIFER

09:29.569 --> 09:31.838
AND HER GUESTS IS NOT SO SIMPLE.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.673
WHAT JENNIFER IS DOING MAY BE

09:33.673 --> 09:35.875
ILLEGAL IN NEW YORK CITY, WHERE

09:35.875 --> 09:37.510
CITY AND STATE LAWS RESTRICT

09:37.510 --> 09:39.245
SHORT-TERM RENTALS.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.847
THE SHORT-TERM HOME RENTAL

09:40.847 --> 09:42.615

09:42.615 --> 09:44.017
PLATFORMS LIKE HOMEAWAY,

09:44.017 --> 09:47.053
FLIPKEY, VRBO ARE POPULAR, AND

09:47.053 --> 09:49.355
AIRBNB HAS EMERGED AS THE GIANT

09:49.355 --> 09:52.058
IN THIS, ESPECIALLY IN CITIES.

MILLION ROOMS AVAILABLE IN 192

10:04.704 --> 10:06.105
NEW YORK IS ALSO WHERE THE

10:06.105 --> 10:07.607
DEBATE OVER HOW TO REGULATE

10:07.607 --> 10:09.275
SHORT-TERM HOME RENTALS LIKE

10:09.275 --> 10:11.144
AIRBNB IS PERHAPS MOST

10:11.144 --> 10:12.278
CONTENTIOUS.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.680
ACCORDING TO A REPORT BY NEW

10:13.680 --> 10:14.747

10:17.984 --> 10:20.253
LISTINGS BETWEEN 2010 AND 2014

10:20.253 --> 10:21.955
WERE ESSENTIALLY "ILLEGAL

10:21.955 --> 10:23.857

10:23.857 --> 10:25.959
VIOLATE STATE AND CITY LAWS

10:25.959 --> 10:27.460
AGAINST RENTING OUT AN APARTMENT

10:27.460 --> 10:29.696
FOR LESS THAN 30 DAYS UNLESS THE

10:29.696 --> 10:31.831
OCCUPANTS ARE ALSO PRESENT.

10:31.831 --> 10:34.834
SCHNEIDERMAN FOUND 94% OF AIRBNB

10:34.834 --> 10:36.236
HOSTS IN NEW YORK ARE LIKE

10:36.236 --> 10:37.637
JENNIFER AND HER HUSBAND.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.105
THEY HAVE ONLY ONE OR POSSIBLY

10:39.105 --> 10:40.373
TWO LISTINGS.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.141
>> THOSE ARE ROOMS THAT WOULD

10:42.141 --> 10:43.643
HAVE GONE TO THE HOTEL INDUSTRY

10:43.643 --> 10:44.777
AND SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE

10:44.777 --> 10:46.079
HOTEL INDUSTRY GIVEN WHAT WE'VE

10:46.079 --> 10:47.747
INVESTED IN THE CITY AND OUR

10:57.757 --> 10:59.659
HE SAYS COMPETITION FROM AIRBNB

10:59.659 --> 11:01.661
HAS DRIVEN DOWN HIS HOTELS' ROOM

11:01.661 --> 11:02.795
RATES.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.497
>> RATES HAVE NOT GONE BACK UP

11:04.497 --> 11:07.534
TO PRE-FINANCIAL CRISIS DESPITE

11:07.534 --> 11:08.735
THE FACT THAT TOURISM HAS GONE

11:08.735 --> 11:09.869
UP.

11:09.869 --> 11:11.137
THAT'S BECAUSE, YOU'VE SUDDENLY

11:11.137 --> 11:15.909
GOT 140 ROOMS, 40 OF THOSE ROOMS

11:15.909 --> 11:17.243

NOT ONLY STEAL BUSINESS, THEY

11:21.648 --> 11:23.383
ALSO DO NOT FOLLOW THE SAME

11:23.383 --> 11:26.019
RULES AND REGULATIONS AS HOTELS.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.120
>> WE HAVE A FIRE COMMAND

GIVE YOU PROTECTIONS FROM

11:32.892 --> 11:35.428
THE MOMENT YOU GET INTO

CONVERTING YOUR HOUSE INTO A

11:42.068 --> 11:43.336

11:43.336 --> 11:44.637
THE ISSUE OF TAXES.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.139
AIRBNB COLLECTS A HOTEL

11:46.139 --> 11:48.441
OCCUPANCY TAX ON BEHALF OF HOSTS

11:48.441 --> 11:50.810
IN MANY CITIES BUT NOT NEW YORK.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.645
CHIP CONLEY, AIRBNB'S HEAD OF

11:52.645 --> 11:54.280
GLOBAL HOSPITALITY, SAYS THE

11:54.280 --> 11:55.682
COMPANY IS LOOKING AT HOW TO DO

11:55.682 --> 11:56.649
THAT.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.117
>> THE ANNUAL TAXES THAT WE

11:58.117 --> 11:59.419
WOULD BE PAYING WOULD BE $65

11:59.419 --> 12:01.554
MILLION IF THE STATE AND CITY OF

12:01.554 --> 12:03.389
NEW YORK WOULD ALLOW US TO BE A

12:03.389 --> 12:05.158
COLLECTOR OF TAXES AND A

12:05.158 --> 12:06.459
REMITTER OF TAXES.

12:06.459 --> 12:07.393
CURRENTLY, THEY ARE NOT ALLOWING

12:07.393 --> 12:08.494
US TO DO THAT.

12:08.494 --> 12:09.596
>> Sreenivasan: CITY OFFICIALS

12:09.596 --> 12:10.763
COUNTER THAT ALLOWING COLLECTION

12:10.763 --> 12:12.832
OF TAXES LEGITIMIZES ACTIVITY

12:12.832 --> 12:14.934
THAT IS LARGELY UNLAWFUL.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.936
>> SO, WHAT'S ODD TO US IS THAT

12:16.936 --> 12:18.504
NEW YORK IS ACTUALLY SORT OF A

12:18.504 --> 12:20.873
LAGGARD HERE RELATIVE TO SO MANY

12:20.873 --> 12:22.108
OTHER COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE

12:25.979 --> 12:27.113
MAKE SURE WE'RE ACTUALLY

12:41.694 --> 12:43.896
ABOUT A $180 A NIGHT.

12:43.896 --> 12:45.732

12:45.732 --> 12:47.600
RIGHT WHEN IT WAS BOOKED, THEN

12:47.600 --> 12:48.434
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

12:48.434 --> 12:49.235
IT.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.206
FIGHTING AIRBNB.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.202
OFTEN BEEN DUBBED AIRBNB'S

13:23.202 --> 13:24.771
DOUBTER IN CHIEF, WAS THE

13:24.771 --> 13:26.973
PRIMARY SPONSOR OF THE 2010

13:26.973 --> 13:28.808
STATE LAW THAT EFFECTIVELY

13:28.808 --> 13:30.576
BANNED SHORT-TERM APARTMENT

13:30.576 --> 13:32.111
RENTALS IN NEW YORK CITY.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.546
>> THEY ENCOURAGE ILLEGAL

13:33.546 --> 13:34.947
ACTIVITY.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.382
THEY DON'T HAVE TO, BUT THEY

13:36.382 --> 13:37.717
CHOOSE TO DO SO AS A BUSINESS

13:37.717 --> 13:38.718
MODEL.

13:38.718 --> 13:39.452
>> Sreenivasan: AND THE SHORT-

13:39.452 --> 13:40.720
TERM RENTAL ACTIVITY THAT

13:40.720 --> 13:42.155
TROUBLES OFFICIALS LIKE KRUEGER

13:42.155 --> 13:43.022
AND ATTORNEY GENERAL

13:43.022 --> 13:44.657
SCHNEIDERMAN MOST IS WHAT THEY

13:44.657 --> 13:46.325
CALL "COMMERCIAL USERS" OF

13:46.325 --> 13:48.594
AIRBNB AND SIMILAR WEB SITES.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.596
>> PEOPLE BECOMING ENTREPRENEURS

13:50.596 --> 13:53.199
AND RENTING ONE TO 100

13:53.199 --> 13:55.368
APARTMENTS, CLAIMING THAT

13:55.368 --> 13:56.903
THEY'RE THEIR OWN HOMES, AND

13:56.903 --> 13:59.305
TURNING THEM INTO ONGOING

13:59.305 --> 14:01.040
ILLEGAL HOTEL ARRANGEMENTS.

14:01.040 --> 14:01.908
>> Sreenivasan: IN FACT, THE

14:01.908 --> 14:02.909
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S REPORT FOUND

14:02.909 --> 14:05.211
WHILE ONLY 6% OF AIRBNB HOSTS

14:05.211 --> 14:07.046
ADVERTISE THREE OR MORE

14:07.046 --> 14:08.715
LISTINGS, THEY ACCOUNT FOR MORE

14:08.715 --> 14:10.283
THAN A THIRD OF AIRBNB'S

14:10.283 --> 14:12.018
BUSINESS IN NEW YORK.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.486
THE REPORT ALSO FOUND THOUSANDS

14:13.486 --> 14:15.455
OF AIRBNB LISTINGS WERE RENTED

14:15.455 --> 14:16.856
FOR THREE MONTHS OR MORE OF THE

14:16.856 --> 14:18.324
YEAR.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.859
NEW YORK ASSEMBLYWOMAN LINDA

14:19.859 --> 14:21.360
ROSENTHAL WENT ON WHAT SHE TERMS

14:21.360 --> 14:23.196
AN UNDERCOVER STING OPERATION

14:23.196 --> 14:24.864
THIS SPRING TO FIND THESE

14:24.864 --> 14:26.132
COMMERCIAL USERS.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.500
>> DO YOU LIVE HERE?

14:27.500 --> 14:28.334
YOU DON'T LIVE HERE?

14:28.334 --> 14:29.368
OH, OKAY.

14:29.368 --> 14:30.303
>> Sreenivasan: IN ONE OF THE

14:30.303 --> 14:31.504
VIDEOS THAT SHE RELEASED TO THE

14:31.504 --> 14:32.638
PRESS, ROSENTHAL IS SEEN

14:32.638 --> 14:34.407
VISITING A HOST WHO SHE SAYS

14:34.407 --> 14:36.109
WAS RENTING SEVEN APARTMENTS IN

14:36.109 --> 14:37.376
A BUILDING, NONE OF WHICH HE

14:37.376 --> 14:38.478
LIVED IN.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.712
>> BUT, IN CASE ANYBODY ASKS

14:39.712 --> 14:40.847
SOMETHING, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

14:40.847 --> 14:42.048
AIRBNB IS.

14:42.048 --> 14:42.982
>> OH, OKAY.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.383
>> THAT'S WHY AIRBNB ALWAYS

14:44.383 --> 14:45.885
CALLS YOU GUESTS.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.888
>> Sreenivasan: AIRBNB HAS TAKEN

14:48.888 --> 14:50.690
STEPS TO REMOVE USERS WHO HAVE A

14:50.690 --> 14:52.592
LARGE NUMBER OF LISTINGS.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.460
>> WE, LIKE THE ATTORNEY

14:54.460 --> 14:56.262
GENERAL, SUPPORT THE IDEA OF

14:56.262 --> 14:57.930
CRACKING DOWN ON ILLEGAL HOTELS

14:57.930 --> 14:59.499
AND UNSCRUPULOUS LANDLORDS.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.167
IN THE SPRING, WE TOOK DOWN

15:01.167 --> 15:02.668
2,000 LISTINGS, WHAT WE WERE

15:02.668 --> 15:04.437
CALLING "BAD ACTORS" WHO WE JUST

15:04.437 --> 15:05.505
FELT SHOULDN'T BE USING THE

15:05.505 --> 15:06.539
SITE.

15:06.539 --> 15:07.340
>> Sreenivasan: BUT STATE

15:07.340 --> 15:08.975
SENATOR KRUEGER ARGUES AIRBNB IS

15:08.975 --> 15:10.910
ENTICING LANDLORDS LIKE THE ONE

15:10.910 --> 15:12.578
IN THE UNDERCOVER VIDEO TO

15:12.578 --> 15:14.313
CONVERT APARTMENTS INTO SHORT-

15:14.313 --> 15:16.048
TERM RENTALS, WHICH CAN BE MORE

15:16.048 --> 15:17.817
PROFITABLE THAN RENTING THEM TO

15:17.817 --> 15:19.085
LONG-TERM RESIDENTS.

15:19.085 --> 15:20.553
AND THAT, KRUEGER SAYS, MAKES IT

15:20.553 --> 15:22.221
HARDER FOR NEW YORKERS TO FIND

15:22.221 --> 15:24.157
AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN A CITY

15:24.157 --> 15:25.358
WHERE THE HOUSING MARKET IS

15:25.358 --> 15:26.559
ALREADY TIGHT.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.760
>> AIRBNB HAS TOLD ME, "IF YOU

15:27.760 --> 15:28.861
COULD JUST DO ONE OR TWO, IT

15:28.861 --> 15:29.896
WOULD BE OKAY."

15:29.896 --> 15:31.264
AND THE ANSWER IS NO, BECAUSE IF

15:31.264 --> 15:33.866
10,000 PEOPLE DECIDE TO RENT OUT

15:33.866 --> 15:36.068
TWO APARTMENTS FULL-TIME, THAT'S

15:36.068 --> 15:38.271
20,000 UNITS OFF THE MARKET.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.071
>> Sreenivasan: SO, WE'RE

15:39.071 --> 15:40.273
SITTING IN AN ILLEGAL HOTEL

15:40.273 --> 15:41.040
ROOM, ACCORDING TO THE STATE

15:41.040 --> 15:41.741
SENATOR.

15:41.741 --> 15:42.141
>> (LAUGHS)

15:42.141 --> 15:42.909
YES.

15:42.909 --> 15:43.743
I HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION

15:43.743 --> 15:45.011
WITH HER, FOR SURE.

15:45.011 --> 15:45.945
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO FEEL

15:45.945 --> 15:47.547
LIKE MY HOME IS A HOTEL.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.815
I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE WHO IS

15:48.815 --> 15:49.749
WELCOMING A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

15:49.749 --> 15:51.384
BECOME FRIENDS.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.518
I MEAN, I THINK THE KEY IS JUST

15:52.518 --> 15:53.719
MAKING SURE THAT IT'S PEOPLE

15:53.719 --> 15:54.620
ARE... IT'S SOMETHING THAT

15:54.620 --> 15:55.454
PEOPLE ARE DOING WITH THEIR

15:55.454 --> 15:56.589
PRIMARY HOME.

15:56.589 --> 15:57.456
FINANCIALLY, IT REALLY HELPS MY

15:57.456 --> 15:58.691
FAMILY.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.560
RENTS HERE HAVE SKYROCKETED IN

16:00.560 --> 16:01.427
THE TEN YEARS THAT WE'VE BEEN

16:01.427 --> 16:02.295
HERE.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.996
>> Sreenivasan: AIRBNB ARGUES IT

16:03.996 --> 16:05.264
HELPS RESIDENTS STAY IN THEIR

16:05.264 --> 16:06.933
HOMES BY ALLOWING THEM TO EARN

16:06.933 --> 16:08.701
SUPPLEMENTAL INCOME TO PAY THEIR

16:08.701 --> 16:10.169
RENT OR MORTGAGE.

16:10.169 --> 16:11.804
>> IT AFFORDS ME AS AN ARTIST TO

16:11.804 --> 16:13.940
BE AN ARTIST.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.142
I USE PART OF THIS INCOME TO

16:16.142 --> 16:19.145
SURVIVE ON.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.313
>> Sreenivasan: JOSHUA ALSO SAYS

16:20.313 --> 16:21.914
THAT THE AIRBNB SYSTEM ALLOWS

16:21.914 --> 16:23.683
THEM TO BE VERY CHOOSY ABOUT WHO

16:23.683 --> 16:25.184
THEY LET STAY IN THEIR HOME AND

16:25.184 --> 16:26.252
WHEN.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.420
>> IT'S UP TO US AS HOSTS WHAT

16:27.420 --> 16:29.021
WE WANT TO DO.

16:29.021 --> 16:31.424
I SAY WE DENY EIGHT OUT OF TEN

16:31.424 --> 16:33.860
PEOPLE THAT ASK US TO STAY HERE,

16:33.860 --> 16:36.229
AND WE GET A LOT OF REQUESTS.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.864
A LOT.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.433
SO, THAT'S HOW I REGULATE IT.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.468
THE QUESTION THAT PEOPLE ASK IS,

16:42.468 --> 16:43.970
DO WE FEEL SAFE HAVING PEOPLE WE

16:43.970 --> 16:46.005
DON'T KNOW IN OUR HOME?

16:46.005 --> 16:47.473
AND THE ANSWER IS YES.

16:47.473 --> 16:48.174
>> Sreenivasan: ARUN

16:48.174 --> 16:49.041
SUNDARARAJAN IS A BUSINESS

16:49.041 --> 16:49.909
PROFESSOR AT NEW YORK

16:49.909 --> 16:50.943
UNIVERSITY.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.278
HE SAYS CITIES LIKE NEW YORK

16:52.278 --> 16:53.746
SHOULD PARTNER WITH COMPANIES

16:53.746 --> 16:55.514
LIKE AIRBNB AND RESIDENTS TO

16:55.514 --> 16:57.850
FORGE NEW WAYS OF REGULATING THE

16:57.850 --> 17:00.152
ACTIVITY ON THOSE PLATFORMS.

17:00.152 --> 17:02.555
WHY IS THE AIRBNB MODEL SO

17:02.555 --> 17:05.558
DIFFERENT THAN THE MODEL FOR

17:05.558 --> 17:08.728
LODGING THAT WE'VE HAD ALL THE

17:08.728 --> 17:09.495
RULES AND REGULATIONS AROUND SO

17:09.495 --> 17:11.030
FAR?

17:11.030 --> 17:12.632
>> THE FUNDAMENTAL INNOVATION IS

17:12.632 --> 17:14.433
IN TAPPING INTO UNDERUTILIZED

17:14.433 --> 17:16.969
CAPACITY-- REPURPOSING WHAT USED

17:16.969 --> 17:18.738
TO BE RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE

17:18.738 --> 17:20.373
AND SORT OF CONVERTING IT INTO A

17:20.373 --> 17:21.874
NEW FORM OF MIXED-USE REAL

17:21.874 --> 17:23.209
ESTATE WHERE FOR SOME OF THE

17:23.209 --> 17:25.378
TIME IT IS SHORT-TERM

17:25.378 --> 17:26.979
ACCOMMODATION AND FOR THE REST

17:26.979 --> 17:28.915
OF THE TIME IT'S RESIDENTIAL.

17:28.915 --> 17:29.949
>> Sreenivasan: CITIES ACROSS

17:29.949 --> 17:31.150
THE COUNTRY ARE GRAPPLING WITH

17:31.150 --> 17:32.451
THESE QUESTIONS.

17:32.451 --> 17:34.020
LIKE NEW YORK, SANTA MONICA

17:34.020 --> 17:35.454
BANNED SHORT-TERM RENTALS OF

17:35.454 --> 17:37.089
ENTIRE HOMES WHEN THE HOST IS

17:37.089 --> 17:38.724
NOT PRESENT AND ADDITIONALLY

17:38.724 --> 17:41.360
IMPOSES A 14% TAX WHEN A HOST

17:41.360 --> 17:43.329
RENTS OUT A ROOM IN HIS HOUSE.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.830
OTHER CITIES HAVE RECENTLY

17:44.830 --> 17:46.465
FORGED A MIDDLE GROUND.

17:46.465 --> 17:47.633
SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTS ARE

17:47.633 --> 17:48.968
PERMITTED TO RENT OUT HOMES A

17:48.968 --> 17:51.103
MAXIMUM OF 90 DAYS A YEAR.

17:51.103 --> 17:52.872
IN PHILADELPHIA, THE MAXIMUM IS

17:52.872 --> 17:55.408
180 DAYS, AND HOSTS MUST PAY AN

17:55.408 --> 17:58.544
8.5% HOTEL TAX TO THE CITY.

17:58.544 --> 17:59.645
>> I THINK THAT THERE'S A

17:59.645 --> 18:01.647
GROWING RECOGNITION AMONG CITIES

18:01.647 --> 18:04.016
THAT THIS KIND OF SHARING

18:04.016 --> 18:05.484
ECONOMY ACTIVITY CAN BE GOOD FOR

18:05.484 --> 18:06.986
A CITY.

18:06.986 --> 18:07.820
>> Sreenivasan: BUT FOR NOW, NEW

18:07.820 --> 18:09.355
YORK CITY IS CRACKING DOWN.

18:09.355 --> 18:10.990
IT HAS EXPANDED THE OFFICE

18:10.990 --> 18:12.358
TASKED WITH INVESTIGATING

18:12.358 --> 18:14.593
COMPLAINTS OF ILLEGAL HOTELS AND

18:14.593 --> 18:15.962
IS PROPOSING HIGHER FINES FOR

18:15.962 --> 18:18.331
VIOLATORS.

18:27.239 --> 18:28.140
>> Sreenivasan: FACEBOOK IS

18:28.140 --> 18:29.542
OFFERING NEW TOOLS FOR POLITICAL

18:29.542 --> 18:30.843
CANDIDATES, AND YOUR PERSONAL

18:30.843 --> 18:32.445
ACCOUNT COULD BE USED IN THE

18:32.445 --> 18:33.479
PROCESS.

18:33.479 --> 18:34.814
FOR THE FIRST TIME, FACEBOOK IS

18:34.814 --> 18:36.515
ALLOWING CAMPAIGNS TO TRACK

18:36.515 --> 18:38.484
USERS' POLITICAL COMMENTS AND"

18:38.484 --> 18:40.720
LIKES" TO CREATE A MASTER LIST

18:40.720 --> 18:42.088
OF TARGET VOTERS AND POTENTIAL

18:42.088 --> 18:43.122
DONORS.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.092
FACEBOOK HAS 189 MILLION MONTHLY

18:46.092 --> 18:47.927
USERS IN THE UNITED STATES.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.161
TO DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF

18:49.161 --> 18:50.363
THIS IS "NEW YORK TIMES"

18:50.363 --> 18:51.364
REPORTER ASHLEY PARKER.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.132
SO WHAT CAN THEY DO BESIDES THAT

18:53.132 --> 18:54.567
ONE FEATURE NOW THAT THEY

18:54.567 --> 18:56.702
COULDN'T DO FOUR YEARS AGO.

18:56.702 --> 18:57.870
>> THERE'S A TON THEY CAN DO.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.805
ONE OF THE BIGGEST THINGS IS NOW

18:59.805 --> 19:01.140
FACEBOOK ALLOWS CAMPAIGNS TO

19:01.140 --> 19:03.142
UPLOAD THEIR VOTER FILE, WHICH

19:03.142 --> 19:05.211
IS THE THE BEST OF BASICALLY

19:05.211 --> 19:06.212
VOTERS THEY HOPE TO TARGET AND

19:06.212 --> 19:07.913
TURN OUT TO VOTE, TO FACEBOOK

19:07.913 --> 19:09.782
SO, THEY CAN REACH THEM THERE.

19:09.782 --> 19:10.483
>> Sreenivasan: SO LET'S WALK

19:10.483 --> 19:11.617
THROUGH THAT.

19:11.617 --> 19:13.152
I HAND IN AN E-MAIL ADDRESS IF I

19:13.152 --> 19:14.653
GO TO A POLITICAL EVENT TO A

19:14.653 --> 19:16.989
PARTICULAR SPEECH, RIGHT.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.024
AND THEN WHAT IS IT THE CAMPAIGN

19:18.024 --> 19:18.958
DO WITH THAT?

19:18.958 --> 19:20.126
>> NOT ONLY THAT YOU HAND IN AN

19:20.126 --> 19:21.527
E-MAIL ADDRESS OR THE CAMPAIGN

19:21.527 --> 19:23.029
WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF CODE

19:23.029 --> 19:24.430
ON THEIR WEB SITE WHERE THEY

19:24.430 --> 19:25.598
TRACK YOU, AND THEY CAN SEE WHEN

19:25.598 --> 19:27.299
YOU CAME TO THEIR WEB SITE YOU

19:27.299 --> 19:29.335
CLICKED THE DONATION PAGE AND

19:29.335 --> 19:31.437
MAYBE GAVE A DONATION OR MAYBE

19:31.437 --> 19:33.039
YOU SORT OF LEARNED A BIT MORE

19:33.039 --> 19:34.206
ABOUT THE CANDIDATE AND VISITED

19:34.206 --> 19:35.674
THE CANDIDATE'S ENERGY PAGE SO

19:35.674 --> 19:36.609
THEY KNOW YOU'RE INTERESTED IN

19:36.609 --> 19:37.576
ENERGY.

19:37.576 --> 19:38.511
SO THEY HAVE YOUR E-MAIL

19:38.511 --> 19:39.345
ADDRESS.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.479
THEY HAVE THIS OTHER INFORMATION

19:40.479 --> 19:42.081
ABOUT YOU AND THEN THEY CAN

19:42.081 --> 19:43.916
LITERALLY SORT OF FOLLOW YOU

19:43.916 --> 19:45.484
OVER TO FACEBOOK AND THEY CAN

19:45.484 --> 19:48.621
KNOW THAT YOU, SPECIFIC USER WHO

19:48.621 --> 19:51.023
HAS THIS E-MAIL ADDRESS AND WHO

19:51.023 --> 19:52.825
CARES ABOUT ENERGY IS ALSO ON

19:52.825 --> 19:54.560
FACEBOOK, AND THEY CAN ALSO THEN

19:54.560 --> 19:56.128
OVERLAY FACEBOOK DATA.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.763
SO MAYBE THEY KNOW IN ADDITION

19:57.763 --> 19:59.832
TO THOSE THINGS, YOU WATCH FOX

19:59.832 --> 20:02.268
NEWS A LOT AND YOU WENT TO A

20:02.268 --> 20:03.602
CERTAIN COLLEGE AND YOU LIVE IN

20:03.602 --> 20:05.271
A CERTAIN STATE LIKE IOWA OR NEW

20:05.271 --> 20:06.705
HAMPSHIRE, AND THEN THEY CAN

20:06.705 --> 20:08.140
TARGET YOU WITH A VERY SPECIFIC

20:08.140 --> 20:09.842
AD KNOWING THAT YOU'RE LIKELY AN

20:09.842 --> 20:11.377
IOWA CAUCUS-GOER WHO IS

20:11.377 --> 20:13.079
INTERESTED IN ENERGY AND WATCHES

20:13.079 --> 20:14.380
FOX NEWS AND IS FRIEND WITH

20:14.380 --> 20:16.582
THESE PEOPLE AND YOU GET THIS AD

20:16.582 --> 20:18.818
IN YOUR STREAM AND IT'S DIRECTLY

20:18.818 --> 20:21.120
TO YOU AND YOUR INTERESTS.

20:21.120 --> 20:21.987
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS A BIG

20:21.987 --> 20:22.755
SHIFT.

20:22.755 --> 20:24.356
IT USED TO BE ADVERTISING WAS

20:24.356 --> 20:25.891
ABOUT REACHING MOST AMOUNT OF

20:25.891 --> 20:26.826
PEOPLE POSSIBLE.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.461
NOW WE DON'T REALLY CARE TO

20:28.461 --> 20:29.361
REACH THE MOST.

20:29.361 --> 20:30.396
WE JUST WANT TO REACH THE ONES

20:30.396 --> 20:31.430
WHO COULD TURN INTO VOTERS FOR

20:31.430 --> 20:32.131
US.

20:32.131 --> 20:32.998
>> EXACTLY.

20:32.998 --> 20:34.400
AS FACEBOOK SAYS IT'S ABOUT

20:34.400 --> 20:36.202
REACHING THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE

20:36.202 --> 20:37.736
RIGHT PLACE WITH THE RIGHT

20:37.736 --> 20:38.804
MESSAGE.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.973
>> Sreenivasan: AND IF YOU'RE

20:40.973 --> 20:42.842
IN A HOUSEHOLD, REALLY, THERE

20:42.842 --> 20:44.176
ARE MULTIPLE FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS

20:44.176 --> 20:45.311
THAT COULD BE USING THE SAME

20:45.311 --> 20:47.580
COMPUTER, SO I'M IMAGINING THEY

20:47.580 --> 20:48.447
COULD TARGET WITH DIFFERENT

20:48.447 --> 20:49.381
KINDS OF ADS OR DIFFERENT PEOPLE

20:49.381 --> 20:50.883
COULD BE TARGETING YOU.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.017
>> YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.452
AND ANOTHER INNOVATION IN

20:53.452 --> 20:55.187
ADDITION TO THE TARGETING IS

20:55.187 --> 20:56.589
FACEBOOK HAS REALLY IMPROVED

20:56.589 --> 20:57.756
THEIR VIDEO FEATURE.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.024
THEY SORT OF LAUNCHED A NEW

20:59.024 --> 21:01.894
VIDEO FEATURE LAST YEAR, AND

21:01.894 --> 21:03.596
THEY HAD ABOUT A BILLION VIEWS

21:03.596 --> 21:05.231
OF VIDEO PER DAY, AND NOW LESS

21:05.231 --> 21:06.365
THAN A YEAR LATER, THEY HAVE 4

21:06.365 --> 21:07.666
BILLION VIEWS.

21:07.666 --> 21:10.136
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT

21:10.136 --> 21:11.537
DOES IS THEIR VIDEO NOW SORT OF

21:11.537 --> 21:13.005
STARTS AUTO PLAYING.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.306
SO WHEN YOU'RE SCROLLING THROUGH

21:14.306 --> 21:16.041
YOUR FEED, WHETHER YOU CLICK ON

21:16.041 --> 21:18.577
A VIDEO OR NOT, A FACEBOOK VIDEO

21:18.577 --> 21:19.812
WILL LITERALLY JUST START TO

21:19.812 --> 21:21.147
PLAY.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.481
AND SO FACEBOOK IS SAYING THIS

21:22.481 --> 21:23.649
IS A BIG ADVANTAGE FOR THE

21:23.649 --> 21:25.151
CAMPAIGNS BECAUSE PEOPLE WILL

21:25.151 --> 21:26.285
SEE THESE VIDEOS AND THEY MIGHT

21:26.285 --> 21:27.553
NOT HAVE CLICKED ON THEM, BUT

21:27.553 --> 21:28.687
MAYBE THE VIDEO CAPTURES THEIR

21:28.687 --> 21:29.688
ATTENTION AND THEY STOP AND

21:29.688 --> 21:30.589
WATCH.

21:30.589 --> 21:31.490
>> Sreenivasan: SHORT OF NOT

21:31.490 --> 21:33.359
USING FACEBOOK WHAT IS END

21:33.359 --> 21:35.461
USERS' PRIVACY OPTIONS IF I

21:35.461 --> 21:36.962
DON'T WANT TO BE INUNDATED WITH

21:36.962 --> 21:41.767
POLITICAL ADS ON MY PHONE?

21:41.767 --> 21:42.801
>> IT'S TOUGH.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.970
FACEBOOK HAS VARIOUS PRIVACY

21:44.970 --> 21:47.173
SETTINGS WHICH USERS CAN CONTROL

21:47.173 --> 21:48.407
BUT AT A CERTAIN POINT I THINK

21:48.407 --> 21:50.209
SOME USERS MAY NOT EVEN REALIZE

21:50.209 --> 21:52.344
HOW MUCH CAMPAIGNS AND FACEBOOK

21:52.344 --> 21:54.280
TOGETHER KNOW ABOUT THEM.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.781
IF I'M A VISITOR AND VISITING

21:55.781 --> 21:57.583
SCOTT WALKER'S WEB SITE, I DON'T

21:57.583 --> 21:58.817
NECESSARILY KNOW THAT SCOTT

21:58.817 --> 22:00.085
WALKER'S CAMPAIGN HAS EMBEDDED A

22:00.085 --> 22:01.954
LITTLE BIT OF CODE THAT WILL LET

22:01.954 --> 22:03.088
THEM TRACK ME WHEN I GO TO

22:03.088 --> 22:03.923
FACEBOOK.

22:03.923 --> 22:04.857
I MIGHT NOT KNOW TO GO INTO MY

22:04.857 --> 22:06.458
PRIVACY SETTINGS TO CHANGE

22:06.458 --> 22:08.394
SOMETHING BECAUSE I HAVE NO IDEA

22:08.394 --> 22:09.562
I'M BEING TRACKED AT THE LEVEL

22:09.562 --> 22:10.396
I'M BEING TRACKED.

22:10.396 --> 22:11.197
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT,

22:11.197 --> 22:12.298
ASHLEY PARKER FROM THE "NEW YORK

22:12.298 --> 22:13.866
TIMES," THANKS SO MUCH.

22:13.866 --> 22:15.834
>> THANK YOU.

22:17.002 --> 22:20.005
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:20.005 --> 22:22.308
SATURDAY.

22:24.743 --> 22:25.678

22:25.678 --> 22:26.779
"VIEWERS LIKE YOU," YOU'RE

22:26.779 --> 22:28.314
CHANCE TO COMMENT ON OUR WORK.

22:28.314 --> 22:29.448
HERE'S SOME OF WHAT YOU HAD TO

22:29.448 --> 22:30.849
SAY ABOUT LAST WEEK'S STORY

22:30.849 --> 22:32.251
ON COMPANIES LIKE UBER AND

22:32.251 --> 22:33.752
INSTACART, AND HOW THE

22:33.752 --> 22:35.387
DEFINITION OF "EMPLOYEE" IS

22:35.387 --> 22:37.456
CHANGING IN THE SHARING ECONOMY.

22:37.456 --> 22:38.857
THERE WAS THIS FROM UBER DRIVER

22:38.857 --> 22:40.059
STEVEN SIMPSON-BLACK:

22:40.059 --> 22:41.193
"I'VE WORKED INDEPENDENT

22:41.193 --> 22:42.928
CONTRACTOR-TYPE JOBS MY ENTIRE

22:42.928 --> 22:44.663
LIFE-- NEWSPAPER DELIVERY,

22:44.663 --> 22:46.298
JANITORIAL WORK, ETC.

22:46.298 --> 22:47.566
I PAY FULL TAXES.

22:47.566 --> 22:49.368
I CAN SAY I MAKE MORE MONEY PER

22:49.368 --> 22:51.237
HOUR WORKING FOR MYSELF THAN I

22:51.237 --> 22:52.738
WOULD MAKING MINIMUM WAGE

22:52.738 --> 22:53.939
ELSEWHERE.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.140
STAY OUT OF MY BUSINESS, AND

22:55.140 --> 22:56.442
I'LL STAY OUT OF YOURS."

22:56.442 --> 22:58.010
AND FROM ELIAS RACHID:

22:58.010 --> 23:00.145
"LEAVE THESE COMPANIES ALONE.

23:00.145 --> 23:01.513
IF PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO WORK FOR

23:01.513 --> 23:03.582
THEM, THEY DON'T HAVE TO."

23:03.582 --> 23:04.984
COLORADO NATIVE NOTED:

23:04.984 --> 23:06.352
"MY GUT TELLS ME THAT BECAUSE

23:06.352 --> 23:07.886
UBER AND OTHER COMPANIES LIKE

23:07.886 --> 23:09.488
THEM ARE DISRUPTIVE, THE

23:09.488 --> 23:10.756
TRADITIONAL COMPANIES IN THEIR

23:10.756 --> 23:12.491
INDUSTRY DON'T LIKE THEM;

23:12.491 --> 23:14.026
TRADITION THAT DIDN'T BECOME

23:14.026 --> 23:15.995
TRADITION UNTIL THE AUTOMOBILE--

23:15.995 --> 23:17.796
A DISRUPTIVE FORCE-- FORCED OUT

23:17.796 --> 23:19.365
THE HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE FROM

23:19.365 --> 23:20.666
THE LIVERY BUSINESS.

23:20.666 --> 23:22.601
SO GOES PROGRESS."

23:22.601 --> 23:24.069
MANY OF YOUR COMMENTS WERE LIKE

23:24.069 --> 23:25.771
THIS FROM JOHN MICHAEL HUTTON:

23:25.771 --> 23:27.039
"UBER DRIVERS SHOULD HAVE TO

23:27.039 --> 23:28.707
COMPLY WITH THE SAME RULES AND

23:28.707 --> 23:30.075
REGULATIONS THAT CAB DRIVERS

23:30.075 --> 23:31.043
MUST.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.378
IF IT LOOKS LIKE A DUCK AND

23:32.378 --> 23:33.579
QUACKS LIKE A DUCK, IT'S A

23:33.579 --> 23:34.813
DUCK."

23:34.813 --> 23:36.148
AND THIS, FROM WES MONTGOMERY:

23:36.148 --> 23:37.783
"UBER HANDLES THE PAYMENT AND

23:37.783 --> 23:39.451
SPECIFIES WHAT PAYMENT METHODS

23:39.451 --> 23:40.419
ARE AVAILABLE.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.154
UBER IS A CAR SERVICE.

23:42.154 --> 23:43.656
DRIVERS ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF

23:43.656 --> 23:44.957
THEIR BUSINESS MODEL.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.558
THESE FACTS POINT STRONGLY TO AN

23:46.558 --> 23:48.060
EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP

23:48.060 --> 23:49.928
REGARDLESS OF WHO OWNS THE CAR

23:49.928 --> 23:51.363
OR WHETHER THEY SET THEIR OWN

23:51.363 --> 23:52.998
HOURS AND CHOOSE WHICH FARES TO

23:52.998 --> 23:53.932
ACCEPT."

23:53.932 --> 23:55.167
KATHLEEN ANDERSON ADDED:

23:55.167 --> 23:56.568
"I DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY

23:56.568 --> 23:58.070
ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME

23:58.070 --> 23:59.238
RULES AND REGS AS TAXI DRIVERS.

23:59.238 --> 24:00.773
THEY ARE SELLING THE SAME

24:00.773 --> 24:01.740
SERVICE.

24:01.740 --> 24:03.075
CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN THAT?"

24:03.075 --> 24:04.076
AND FINALLY THERE WAS THIS FROM

24:04.076 --> 24:05.911
TRUSTKNOW1:

24:05.911 --> 24:06.912
"I MIGHT BE OLD FASHIONED, BUT

24:06.912 --> 24:08.013
I'LL DO MY OWN SHOPPING AND

24:08.013 --> 24:09.048
STICK WITH A TRADITIONAL TAXI

24:09.048 --> 24:10.382
SERVICE."
