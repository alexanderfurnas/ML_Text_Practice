®MD-BO /STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE
(D), Mayor
of Baltimore, Maryland: If we
can't figure

00:11.111 --> 00:15.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out a way to turn that anger and
frustration
into action, we're not going to
get better.

00:15.582 --> 00:20.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I sit down with the
mayor of Baltimore,
after a blistering federal
review accuses

00:20.988 --> 00:23.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Baltimore police of systemic
racial bias.

00:23.857 --> 00:28.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
Controversy follows Donald
Trump, and new

00:28.996 --> 00:34.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
questions emerge over whether
the Republican
nominee has the temperament and
the character

00:34.768 --> 00:36.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to be president of the United
States.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.673 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And a chilling
account of abuse.

00:39.706 --> 00:44.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Leaked documents reveal
disturbing conditions

your electronic

00:50.217 --> 00:55.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Companies are exploring the ways
emotional

RANA EL KALIOUBY, CEO,
Affectiva: I realized
that we were spending so much
time with our

00:58.992 --> 01:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devices and our technology, yet
it had absolutely
no idea how we felt or what our
mental state

01:06.166 --> 01:07.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was.

01:07.434 --> 01:14.007 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

(BREAK)

01:16.843 --> 01:27.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The presidential
contest found
Donald Trump trying to move on
again from

01:27.287 --> 01:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something he said a day earlier.

01:29.957 --> 01:33.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, meanwhile,
looked to capitalize
on the furor.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.829 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent Lisa Desjardins
has our report.

01:35.862 --> 01:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Amid talk of
campaign resets,
Donald Trump changed scenes
today, trading

01:41.802 --> 01:46.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his usual large rally for,
first, a small
roundtable of coal executives
and workers

01:46.840 --> 01:52.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Southwestern Virginia, and,
later, a speech
on jobs, especially mining jobs.

01:52.379 --> 01:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
The mines will be gone.

01:53.914 --> 01:59.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The mines will be gone if she
gets elected.

01:59.252 --> 02:02.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That was Trump
on offense.

02:02.055 --> 02:06.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's also on defense over
these words
from yesterday about Hillary
Clinton and gun

02:07.027 --> 02:08.862 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rights.

02:08.895 --> 02:14.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: If she gets to
pick her judges,
nothing you can do, folks,
although the Second

02:15.002 --> 02:16.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Amendment people, maybe there
is.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.938 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Trump told FOX
News he meant
political action, not violence.

02:21.041 --> 02:25.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Nobody in that
room thought
anything other than what you
just said.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There can be no other
interpretation.

02:27.414 --> 02:28.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Even reporters have told me.

02:28.548 --> 02:30.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, give me break.

02:30.450 --> 02:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the dishonest people -- what
it is, there
is a tremendous power behind the
Second Amendment.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a political power.

02:39.493 --> 02:43.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are few things so
powerful, I have
to say, in terms of politics.

02:43.463 --> 02:47.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Others charged
Trump was
indeed inciting violence.

02:47.768 --> 02:52.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even House Speaker Paul Ryan,
celebrating
his own primary victory last
night, suggested

02:52.372 --> 02:53.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the nominee explain.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.908 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:54.941 --> 02:56.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: I
heard about the Second Amendment
quote.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It sounds like just a joke gone
bad.

02:58.445 --> 03:00.680 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I hope he clears it up very
quickly.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You should never joke about
something like
that.

03:02.249 --> 03:05.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hillary
Clinton, in Des Moines,
Iowa, slammed her opponent.

03:05.652 --> 03:08.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Words matter, my friends.

03:08.188 --> 03:15.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yesterday, we witnessed the
latest in a long
line of casual comments from
Donald Trump

03:15.362 --> 03:17.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that cross the line.

03:17.597 --> 03:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every single one of these
incidents shows
us that Donald Trump simply
doesn't have the

03:25.338 --> 03:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
temperament to be president and
commander
in chief of the United States.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:32.179 --> 03:36.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This as the
Clinton campaign
unveiled new Republican
endorsements today,

03:36.149 --> 03:41.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and publicly launched a new
official push
called Together for America to
win over more

03:41.288 --> 03:46.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans and independents,
all that as
a new Reuters survey shows more
Republican

03:46.660 --> 03:49.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
voters may be up for grabs.

03:49.229 --> 03:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
About one-fifth of registered
Republicans
said they want Trump to drop his
presidential

03:54.034 --> 03:55.902 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bid entirely.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's led to a new line from the
Democratic
nominee.

03:58.338 --> 04:04.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I am
humbled and moved
by the Republicans who are
willing to stand

04:04.845 --> 04:08.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up and say that Donald Trump
doesn't represent
their values.

04:08.949 --> 04:13.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But she too
faced criticism
over newly released e-mails from
her time

04:13.553 --> 04:15.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as secretary of state.

for donors

04:21.294 --> 04:24.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with some of her staff at the
State Department.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump blasted his opponent over
the issue.

04:26.333 --> 04:29.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: It's called
pay-for-play.

04:29.536 --> 04:32.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And some of these were really,
really bad,
and illegal.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
If it's true, it's illegal.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You pay if you're getting
things.

LISA DESJARDINS: With three
months left in
the election, the candidates are
hitting hard

04:41.915 --> 04:44.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and looking especially to big
states.

04:44.417 --> 04:48.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow, Trump heads south to
Florida; Clinton
goes north to Michigan.

Islamic State headquarters in
the city of
Sirte.

05:04.871 --> 05:10.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Militias attacked ISIS positions
in June,
but the fighting had been
stalemated for weeks.

05:10.443 --> 05:15.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They finally broke through with
the help of
U.S. airstrikes that began 10
days ago.

05:15.148 --> 05:20.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Afghanistan,
the government
is sending more troops to a key
southern province,

05:20.120 --> 05:23.056 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the face of major Taliban
gains.

05:23.089 --> 05:28.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Insurgent fighters have

Province, after weeks

05:28.762 --> 05:30.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of intense fighting.

05:30.597 --> 05:36.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newly deployed security forces

GWEN IFILL: A tragedy overnight
in Baghdad.

05:42.175 --> 05:48.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials say a dozen babies
died in a fire
that engulfed a hospital
maternity ward.

05:48.682 --> 05:53.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators said initial
indications are
the blaze was sparked by faulty
electrical

05:53.086 --> 05:54.955 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wiring.

05:54.988 --> 05:58.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bereaved families gathered

and struggling

05:58.992 --> 06:00.894 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

06:00.927 --> 06:04.864 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHAYMA HUSSEIN, Mother of Victim
through translator):
I looked at the victims.

06:04.898 --> 06:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I saw them charred.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a horrible scene.

06:07.667 --> 06:09.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was very difficult for me to
give birth
to a child.

06:09.936 --> 06:13.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have had medical treatments to
have a baby.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After all these efforts, I
received a charred
body.

06:16.009 --> 06:20.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Outrage over the

to add to pressure on Iraq's
government to

07:36.222 --> 07:37.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

07:38.024 --> 07:43.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

4500 B.C.

07:46.032 --> 07:51.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was discovered in the
country's south,
at the site of one of Europe's
earliest urban

07:51.104 --> 07:52.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
settlements.

07:52.872 --> 07:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a scathing
review of Baltimore's police
force; Donald

07:58.178 --> 08:03.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump and Hillary Clinton, are
they fit to
lead as president?; creating a
place in the

08:03.850 --> 08:10.090 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
world for people with autism;
and much more.

08:10.123 --> 08:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A bruising report
released by
the Department of Justice today
spelled out

08:21.668 --> 08:26.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a long pattern of racial
discrimination by
the Baltimore Police Department.

08:26.272 --> 08:31.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The investigation was
commissioned in May
2015, after the death of a black
man, Freddie

08:31.344 --> 08:33.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gray, in the back of a police
van.

08:33.947 --> 08:39.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gray's death sparked city-wide
protests and
thrust Baltimore to the
forefront of a national

08:39.586 --> 08:42.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reckoning on race and policing.

08:42.322 --> 08:46.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The report examined police
practices from
2010 to 2015.

08:46.893 --> 08:51.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The numbers paint an
unmistakable picture
of policing disparities.

08:51.631 --> 08:56.803 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Baltimore is 63 percent
African-American,
but blacks were charged with 91
percent of

08:56.836 --> 09:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
discretionary offenses, and made
up 82 percent
of traffic stops.

09:03.343 --> 09:08.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 40 percent of all
pedestrian stops
in the city came in the two
small predominantly

09:08.815 --> 09:10.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
African-American districts.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One black man was stopped 30
times.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
None resulted in any charges.

09:15.822 --> 09:21.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The investigation also found
police frequently
used excessive force and
escalated encounters.

09:21.327 --> 09:25.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vanita Gupta, who leads the
Civil Rights Division
at the Department of Justice,
announced the

09:25.865 --> 09:29.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
findings today at a press
conference with
Baltimore's mayor and police
commissioner.

09:29.269 --> 09:33.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VANITA GUPTA, Assistant U.S.
Attorney General:
These violations have deeply
eroded the trust

09:33.173 --> 09:39.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between BPD and the community it
serves, trust
that is essential to effective
policing, as

09:39.512 --> 09:42.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
well as to officer and public
safety.

09:42.315 --> 09:46.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problems in Baltimore didn't
happen overnight
or appear in a day.

09:46.519 --> 09:52.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pattern and practice that we
found results
from longstanding systemic
deficiencies in

09:52.125 --> 09:53.993 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the BPD.

09:54.027 --> 09:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I spoke with Mayor
Stephanie Rawlings-Blake
at Baltimore City Hall this
afternoon.

09:58.198 --> 10:02.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Madam Mayor, thank you for
joining us.

10:02.469 --> 10:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The words used to describe this
report have
been astounding, shocking,
amazing.

10:06.873 --> 10:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't think I can overstate
it.

10:10.577 --> 10:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there have been other
reports done.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There have been other
examinations.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why are we just reaching this
point now?

10:15.682 --> 10:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
®MD-BO /STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE
(D), Mayor
of Baltimore, Maryland: I think
woe are reaching

10:17.584 --> 10:22.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this point because the city has
leadership
that is focused and determined
on making meaningful

10:22.789 --> 10:24.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
reforms.

10:24.724 --> 10:30.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have tried to improve the
police department,
the policing strategy, the
relationships with

10:30.997 --> 10:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the police and the community.

10:33.600 --> 10:38.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In the past under my
administration, when
I saw that we were falling
short, that's when

10:38.037 --> 10:43.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I asked the Department of
Justice to come
in for a collaborative review to
help us strengthen

10:43.943 --> 10:46.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our community policing effort.

10:46.379 --> 10:50.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I saw that that was
insufficient,
that's when I asked for the
Department of

10:50.783 --> 10:54.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice to do the patterns and
practice investigation.

10:55.021 --> 10:58.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I heard from the Department
of Justice
is that they're clear that these
are longstanding,

10:59.025 --> 11:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systemic issues that predate me
and some that
predate my life that we have had
in Baltimore.

11:06.699 --> 11:10.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the difference today is that
there is
leadership in place that's
determined to get

11:10.770 --> 11:13.706 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it right, because that's what
the citizens
of Baltimore deserve.

11:13.740 --> 11:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Most people in this
country know
of what happened in Baltimore
because of the

11:17.677 --> 11:19.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Freddie Gray case.

11:19.579 --> 11:23.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Department of Justice says
this is not
just about Freddie Gray, but
would these efforts

11:23.583 --> 11:26.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been put into place without
Freddie Gray?

11:26.619 --> 11:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE: Well,
I can only
speak to my track record.

11:29.589 --> 11:35.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before the tragic death of
Freddie Gray
and the unrest that followed,
these reforms

11:35.995 --> 11:37.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
were under way.

11:37.964 --> 11:43.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before the death of Freddie
Gray, I was in
a very lonely fight in
Annapolis, our state

11:43.670 --> 11:48.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
capital, to get reforms, to
fight for reforms
to the Law Enforcement Officers
Bill of Rights,

11:48.274 --> 11:54.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something many people in the
community felt
was a barrier to the trust
relationships that

11:55.014 --> 11:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they believed were necessary for
progress.

11:58.084 --> 12:03.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They thought it was a barrier to
holding officers
accountable for wrongdoing.

12:03.489 --> 12:04.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That happened before.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That fight happened before.

12:05.992 --> 12:10.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The collaborative review
happened before the
death of Freddie Gray.

12:10.597 --> 12:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's step back from
just your
administration, because what
this report shows

12:14.434 --> 12:19.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is something pretty pervasive
that I'm not
sure that any report could fix.

12:19.072 --> 12:24.544 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a pervasive attitude not
only on the
parts of police, but also on the
part of the

12:24.577 --> 12:26.512 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

12:26.546 --> 12:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does a report or even a
negotiated settlement
or a consent decree get to the
bottom of those

12:32.518 --> 12:34.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attitudes?

12:34.387 --> 12:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE: I
think it is going
to be up to everyone in the
community to say

12:39.659 --> 12:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we have to come to the
table in a spirit
of collaboration with mutual
respect and roll

12:47.033 --> 12:50.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up our sleeves and do the hard
work of getting
to better.

12:50.403 --> 12:56.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We cannot afford to do what I
have seen in
too many parts of the country,
where people

12:56.109 --> 13:04.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just, you know, retrench to
their corners,
right, and just shout and
they're angry and

13:04.250 --> 13:06.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're frustrated.

13:06.052 --> 13:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If we can't figure out a way to
turn that
anger and frustration into
action, we're not

13:11.557 --> 13:13.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to get better.

13:13.426 --> 13:17.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: If I am the black
man who's been
stopped 30 times for crossing
the street by

13:17.230 --> 13:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an officer in this police
department, why
should I believe any of that?

13:20.566 --> 13:24.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE: You
should believe
it because there is nothing
about my administration

13:24.570 --> 13:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is trying to hide him or
any of the problems
that we have from the public.

13:29.308 --> 13:36.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am -- I have today and have
always been
about shining a light on our
most pressing

13:36.182 --> 13:43.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenges, so that we can be
about the business
of fixing them and of getting,
you know, better

13:43.489 --> 13:45.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and safer and stronger as a
city.

13:45.591 --> 13:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The police chief,
the police commissioner
said today he's already fired
six police officers

13:50.029 --> 13:50.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2016.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Were they particularly connected
to this?

13:52.965 --> 13:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE: No,
it's an effort,
his ongoing efforts to hold
officers accountable

13:57.336 --> 13:59.372 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for their actions.

13:59.405 --> 14:04.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm grateful to have a
police commissioner
who's been through a patterns
and practice

14:04.977 --> 14:06.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of investigation and consent
decree.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He understands the importance of
holding officers
accountable.

14:09.982 --> 14:16.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is side by side with me in
these efforts
to strengthen or to reform the
Law Enforcement

14:16.522 --> 14:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officers Bill of Rights to give
him more authority
to deal with officers that have
been found

14:22.295 --> 14:23.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guilty of wrongdoing.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a frustration.

14:25.898 --> 14:29.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Were these specific
firing, did
they have to do with this
ongoing investigation,

14:29.769 --> 14:31.637 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or are they separate?

14:31.671 --> 14:35.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE: I
would say separate,
but it is a clear indication
that the work

14:35.641 --> 14:40.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of reform, the work of better
transparency
and holding officers accountable
is ongoing.

14:40.747 --> 14:45.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Would you say that
the retrofitting
of police vans that you
mentioned in your

14:45.184 --> 14:49.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news conference today, which,
obviously, that's
how Freddie Gray died, in the
back of a police

14:49.288 --> 14:52.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
van, would you say that was also
part of this,
or was that something that was
ongoing beforehand?

14:53.025 --> 14:57.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE: There
were some
changes in policy that were
being implemented.

14:57.730 --> 15:05.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as far as the retrofitting
and the cameras,
I'm not tone-deaf to what
happened with the

15:05.271 --> 15:07.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
death of Freddie Gray.

15:07.039 --> 15:12.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We knew that we needed to make
changes with
training, with equipment, with
being able

15:12.912 --> 15:16.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to hold officers accountable
when it comes
to transportation.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.518 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's why these changes
were made.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In the end, what you
agreed to
today with the Justice
Department -- and I

15:22.488 --> 15:26.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to read it to get it right
-- an agreement
in principle which leads to
framework for

15:26.325 --> 15:31.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
negotiations, which to, once
again someone
in Sandtown-Winchester, the
neighborhood where

15:31.264 --> 15:35.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many of these things have
happened, looks
at that and says, what does that
even mean

15:35.201 --> 15:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and how does that have any
effect on me?

15:37.203 --> 15:42.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE: What
it means is
that the Department of Justice
has never had

15:42.308 --> 15:49.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as detailed a blueprint moving
forward with
a city on how we can be better,
that they

15:49.348 --> 15:54.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should know that the level of
commitment that
I have, that the police
commissioner has,

15:54.353 --> 16:00.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the rank-and-file officers
have to improving
not just the relationship with
the police

16:00.193 --> 16:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the community, but also the
results for
getting a safer city, there is
no stronger

16:07.834 --> 16:12.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
example of our determination and
our intention
to be better.

16:12.071 --> 16:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is no stronger example in
the country
than what we're doing here in
Baltimore.

16:15.474 --> 16:23.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mayor Stephanie
Rawlings-Blake,
thank you very much.

16:23.916 --> 16:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STEPHANIE RAWLINGS-BLAKE: Thank
you.

16:29.322 --> 16:35.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now back to the
presidential
race, and new questions this
week surrounding

16:36.028 --> 16:38.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's temperament.

16:38.064 --> 16:43.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For two views on what exactly
makes a presidential
candidate fit to lead, we are
joined by retired

16:43.903 --> 16:45.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Air Force General Michael
Hayden.

16:45.938 --> 16:52.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's former director of the
Central Intelligence
Agency and of the National
Security Agency.

16:52.044 --> 16:57.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Kansas Secretary of State
Kris Kobach,
he served as an aide to former
Attorney General

16:57.750 --> 17:01.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Ashcroft in the George W.
Bush administration.

17:01.988 --> 17:04.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

17:04.957 --> 17:06.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
General Hayden, to you first.

17:06.792 --> 17:12.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were one of 50 Republicans
to sign an
open letter this week saying
that Donald Trump

17:12.565 --> 17:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shouldn't be elected president.

17:14.667 --> 17:18.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You said he would be the most
reckless president
in U.S. history.

17:18.137 --> 17:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you base that on?

17:19.138 --> 17:20.940 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

17:20.973 --> 17:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HAYDEN (RET.), Former
CIA Director:
Well, I mean, obviously, that's
a prediction

17:21.674 --> 17:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that is based on our analysis.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's not yet become president
and he's not
done anything in the Oval
Office.

17:26.779 --> 17:30.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we based it upon what we
have seen of
the candidate during the
campaign.

17:31.017 --> 17:35.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have based upon the kinds of
things that
he said, the kinds of responses
that he's

17:35.588 --> 17:39.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had to provocations.

17:39.058 --> 17:47.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see a lack of the proper
temperament, character,
patience, civility, knowledge,
and let me

17:47.400 --> 17:49.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
add curiosity.

17:49.201 --> 17:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we were waiting for a turn
-- and we
understand there is a political
process here.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.708 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some things happen early in a
campaign.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some things happens later.

17:57.576 --> 18:02.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We were waiting for an
adjustment, where the
candidate was more serious, more
fact-based,

18:02.982 --> 18:07.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
more concerned about the
specifics of what
he was saying, and it just
didn't happen.

18:07.153 --> 18:09.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we felt we had to point that
out.

18:09.689 --> 18:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Temperament,
character, and
so on, Kris Kobach, as someone
who supports

18:14.593 --> 18:15.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump, what do you say to
that?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH (R), Kansas
Secretary of State:
I disagree.

18:17.797 --> 18:24.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have had the advantage of
the opportunity
to meet with Mr. Trump on
several occasions.

18:24.403 --> 18:28.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And my experience is that he's
very intelligent.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's thirsty for information.

18:30.343 --> 18:31.744 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wants to hear what you have
to say.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He listens to his advisers.

18:33.746 --> 18:37.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He digests the information very
quickly, and
he's got a good memory, because
I remember

18:37.984 --> 18:40.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one time I was talking to him
about something,
and then he pulled some
information out of

18:40.653 --> 18:45.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his memory banks that was a
great connection
that I hadn't even thought to
mention to him.

18:45.891 --> 18:49.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think there is another
difference here,
too.

18:49.095 --> 18:53.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Different presidents are
different as far
as their public persona vs.
their persona

18:53.733 --> 18:55.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
meeting with advisers.

18:55.634 --> 18:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, George Bush was
pretty much the
same in person as when he was
speaking publicly.

18:59.772 --> 19:05.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Donald Trump has a stage
persona and
he also has a temperament when
meeting with

19:05.077 --> 19:06.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his advisers.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, the positions are the same,
but the attitude
is a little bit different.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you General
Hayden about that.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.652 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What about that?

19:13.686 --> 19:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What if there is a different
Donald Trump
who is more reasoned and more
rational in

19:16.989 --> 19:17.957 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
private?

19:17.990 --> 19:18.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL HAYDEN: So, why isn't he
running?

19:20.926 --> 19:23.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, that's a little bit like
pay no attention
to the man in front of the
screen, to paraphrase

19:23.329 --> 19:25.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
"The Wizard of Oz."

19:25.297 --> 19:30.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have campaigns so that the
electorate can
get to know the candidate and
make an intelligent

19:30.636 --> 19:32.371 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
choice.

19:32.405 --> 19:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if the candidate is
hiding his true
persona, seems to defeat the
whole purpose

19:35.908 --> 19:37.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of electoral campaigns.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.978 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about that,
Kris Kobach?

19:39.011 --> 19:42.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: In the course of a
-- speaking
at a public event, you are not
going to suddenly

19:42.848 --> 19:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
change course or then show a
lack of confidence,
whereas, in person, he may say,
OK, well,

19:48.687 --> 19:49.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tell me more.

19:49.688 --> 19:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I need to know more about this.

19:50.823 --> 19:52.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so that's the point I'm
making.

19:52.324 --> 19:54.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The public is getting to see who
Donald Trump
is.

19:54.927 --> 20:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My point is that the allegation
General Hayden
had made was that he doesn't
listen to people.

20:00.099 --> 20:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't know how he can make
that allegation
unless he's seen the person in a
room and

20:05.004 --> 20:07.339 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been talking with him and
providing information.

20:07.373 --> 20:12.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you do say,
General Hayden,
in the letter that your sense of
Donald Trump

20:12.211 --> 20:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is that he doesn't listen.

20:13.612 --> 20:16.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You say that he met with Henry
Kissinger,
he met with James Baker.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL HAYDEN: Jim Baker,
right.

20:18.150 --> 20:19.051 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Didn't seem to
change his views.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HAYDEN: And came out,
and asked, did
talking to those very
prestigious members

20:22.721 --> 20:26.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of the American national
security community,
above party, actually, said, did
they change

20:26.492 --> 20:27.593 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
your views on anything?

20:27.626 --> 20:29.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

20:29.462 --> 20:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kris Kobach, let
me come back
to Donald Trump's comments
yesterday in North

20:33.165 --> 20:37.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Carolina about Hillary Clinton,
about the
Second Amendment, suggesting
that -- quote

20:37.903 --> 20:42.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- "Second Amendment people"
might put a stop
to Hillary Clinton naming
certain judges.

20:43.008 --> 20:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now learned today that the
Secret Service
is having conversations with Mr.
Trump's campaign

20:48.647 --> 20:50.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about that comment.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How did you read what he said?

20:51.917 --> 20:53.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you explain it?

20:53.419 --> 20:57.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: Oh, I think it was
pretty clear,
if you look at the video.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The audience is interacting with
him while
he's giving a speech.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he says, look, it's too bad.

21:02.795 --> 21:07.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Hillary gets the ninth
nominee on the Supreme
Court, they're going to take
away your Second

21:07.066 --> 21:08.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Amendment rights.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then he says, well, the
Second Amendment
people might be able to do
something about

21:11.770 --> 21:13.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it, in so many words.

21:13.772 --> 21:17.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I read that is, even if the
Supreme Court
rules, Congress still has the
pass a law confiscating

21:17.843 --> 21:20.012 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
weapons or banning certain
firearms.

21:20.045 --> 21:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Second Amendment people are
the NRA, the
Gun Owners of America, all these
organizations

21:24.450 --> 21:27.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that have incredible influence
on Capitol
Hill.

21:27.453 --> 21:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that's exactly what he
meant.

21:29.321 --> 21:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't see a person why a
person would
read into that some sort of
threat of violence

21:32.057 --> 21:35.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or assassination, as the Hillary
Clinton campaign
hyperventilated.

21:35.361 --> 21:37.129 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just don't think that's even
plausible.

21:37.163 --> 21:40.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know,
General Hayden,
even some people in the audience
took to it

21:40.733 --> 21:43.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean -- may have been a joke,
but that he
was referring to...

21:43.102 --> 21:44.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:44.103 --> 21:45.070 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

21:45.104 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL HAYDEN: Well, let me --
I don't.

21:46.372 --> 21:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I watched it, and I believe what
he said was
what he said.

21:49.408 --> 21:53.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But let me just for the moment
accept Kris'
approach to this.

21:53.045 --> 21:57.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It shows a certain lack of
understanding of
American political history,
American political

21:57.149 --> 22:04.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
culture, that even if he
actually meant to
say this, that he chose to say
it like this,

22:05.024 --> 22:10.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given our darkest history in
terms of political
assassination, in what universe
does someone

22:10.095 --> 22:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to be president of the
United States
and think that that's an OK
formulation?

22:14.800 --> 22:17.203 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I can go further because it's
part of a pattern.

22:17.236 --> 22:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In what universe does someone
who might actually
become the president of the
United States

22:21.006 --> 22:25.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, nah, you know, we may not
-- we may not
live up to our NATO commitments,
an attack

22:25.978 --> 22:30.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against one -- or an attack is
an attack against
all, unless everyone has paid
their bills?

22:30.115 --> 22:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, in what universe does
someone who
is actually going to be the
president of the

22:34.553 --> 22:40.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States think it's OK to
say, they hate
us, they all hate us, Islam
hates us?

22:40.893 --> 22:46.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You don't have to become
president for those
statements to actually harm
American national

22:46.665 --> 22:47.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kris Kobach?

22:49.468 --> 22:52.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: I don't think those
statements
are exactly as the general has
characterized

22:52.171 --> 22:53.138 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't say all of Islam
hates us.

22:55.007 --> 22:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has said that we have to vet
people coming
in from places in the world
where Islamic

22:59.812 --> 23:06.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
radical terrorism is prevalent
and put a temporary
halt on some of those entries
from those parts

23:06.518 --> 23:08.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the world.

23:08.420 --> 23:12.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, look, he often will
express something
in a general principle or
general idea, and

23:12.057 --> 23:14.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then usually he will come back
and give some
specifics.

23:14.460 --> 23:18.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would like to turn, though, to
presidential
temperament again.

23:18.464 --> 23:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Another factor is independence.

23:20.532 --> 23:22.268 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

23:22.301 --> 23:26.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want the president to be
uninfluenced
by any factors other than his
advisers and

23:26.205 --> 23:28.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the best interests of the United
States.

23:28.173 --> 23:32.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, on that category,
Donald Trump easily
beats Hillary Clinton.

23:32.278 --> 23:34.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have the example of the
Clinton Foundation.

23:34.146 --> 23:37.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the very time that the
Algerian government
was having multiple meetings
with the Clinton

23:37.883 --> 23:43.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
State Department, she was
receive -- the foundation
was receiving half-a-million
from the Algerians.

23:43.522 --> 23:50.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the very time that a Russian
uranium executive
transferred $2.35 million to the
foundation,

23:50.529 --> 23:55.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she then OKs a deal where the
Russians gain
control of 20 percent of U.S.
uranium interests.

23:55.701 --> 23:57.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me put
that...

23:57.803 --> 23:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: That's a big issue,
too.

23:59.605 --> 24:02.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think people will wonder,
as long as
the Clinton Foundation exists,
has there been

24:02.474 --> 24:04.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a recent contribution and is she
going to
look at that before she makes a
decision?

24:04.977 --> 24:07.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me put that
question to
General Hayden.

24:07.146 --> 24:08.113 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

24:08.147 --> 24:10.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL HAYDEN: Sure.

24:10.049 --> 24:14.019 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, I agree with Kris that you
don't want
a president who is subject to
external influence,

24:14.053 --> 24:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
external being outside of the
United States,
outside the proper course of our
political

24:17.656 --> 24:18.590 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

24:18.624 --> 24:19.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I get that.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm not carrying any brief
here for Secretary
Clinton.

24:22.795 --> 24:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what -- I'm just simply
pointing out that
if you look at the series of
things that the

24:28.400 --> 24:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate has allowed himself to
say, if he
governs in any way consistent
with those statements,

24:35.107 --> 24:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have grounds to be
afraid, very
afraid.

24:37.710 --> 24:38.777 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you mean that
literally?

24:38.811 --> 24:40.679 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

24:40.713 --> 24:44.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL HAYDEN: One of the
things that prompted
the letter was the seeming tenor
of the campaign

24:44.183 --> 24:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and of the candidate, frankly,
to think that
the world's an ugly place right
now simply

24:48.387 --> 24:54.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because his predecessors were
stupid or weak
or corrupt.

24:54.493 --> 24:58.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The world is an ugly place
because the world
is very complicated place, and
there doesn't

24:58.897 --> 25:03.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seem to be any appreciation for
the complexity
of the problems that he's going
to have to

25:03.702 --> 25:05.437 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
face as president.

25:05.471 --> 25:10.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he goes in there with a
simplistic
understanding and simplistic
answers, it's

25:10.542 --> 25:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to make the world worse.

25:12.378 --> 25:18.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, again, that is no brief for
his predecessor,
whom I have criticized more
often than not.

25:18.884 --> 25:21.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Kobach, final
last word.

25:21.120 --> 25:26.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KRIS KOBACH: I certainly agree
with the general
comment that Mr. Trump has made
that the world

25:26.225 --> 25:27.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a dangerous place.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.928 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a more dangerous place
than it was
seven years ago.

25:29.962 --> 25:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you also have to think about
the president's
position with respect to our
enemies.

25:34.666 --> 25:40.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think there, too, you have
a better
person, a better chief executive
in Mr. Trump,

25:40.372 --> 25:44.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because no one doubts that he's
willing to
walk away from a deal if it's a
bad one.

25:44.209 --> 25:49.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No one doubts that he's willing
to punish
our enemies if they transgress
U.S. interests,

25:49.248 --> 25:51.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
whereas, with Hillary, she is
very predictable.

25:51.784 --> 25:56.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you don't expect anything
different than
really than we saw under the
Obama administration.

25:56.255 --> 26:01.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think that in terms of the
American interests,
I would feel more safe with a
President Trump

26:01.760 --> 26:03.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
representing those interests to
the world.

26:03.796 --> 26:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kansas Secretary
of State Kris
Kobach, retired Air Force
General Michael

26:08.300 --> 26:09.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hayden, we thank you both.

26:09.301 --> 26:10.235 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.236 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL HAYDEN: Thanks.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thanks, Kris.

26:12.271 --> 26:18.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KRIS KOBACH: Thank you.

26:18.844 --> 26:25.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Stay with us.

26:25.684 --> 26:32.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
appalling conditions
in refugee camps off Australia's
coast; computers

26:32.191 --> 26:39.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can read human emotions;
and one country's
soldiers use an unusual
technique to unwind.

26:39.298 --> 26:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, we continue our
series A Place
in the World.

26:44.403 --> 26:48.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, we reported on a
group of young
men with autism who have moved
out of their

26:48.340 --> 26:55.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
childhood homes, in a first step
toward living
independently, all except the
man on the lower

26:55.113 --> 27:01.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right, whose level of disability
makes the
prospect of a rewarding
adulthood much too

27:01.119 --> 27:02.187 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
complicated to achieve.

27:02.221 --> 27:04.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Donvan part two of our
report.

27:04.690 --> 27:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN, Co-Author, "In a
Different Key:
The Story of Autism": His name
is Matt Resnik

27:08.126 --> 27:13.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, without knowing it, he has
helped changed
the face of autism in his
hometown Phoenix,

27:13.765 --> 27:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arizona, and not just because he
produces
of a line of baked goods, SMILE
Biscotti,

27:19.137 --> 27:23.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which are for sale all over the
city, even
here at Peet's Coffee at Phoenix
International

27:23.442 --> 27:25.244 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Airport.

27:25.277 --> 27:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matt is literally the face of
SMILE Biscotti,
where the ads quite deliberately
mention that

27:30.182 --> 27:31.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he has autism.

27:31.283 --> 27:32.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Let's go, Matt.

27:32.284 --> 27:33.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's go deliver.

27:33.285 --> 27:35.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Indeed, he does.

27:35.153 --> 27:39.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Go back a few minutes earlier to
when we first
started taping his delivery of
biscotti, and

27:39.324 --> 27:41.393 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his autistic nature is more than
evident.

27:41.426 --> 27:43.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB RESNIK, Father of Matt
Resnik: All right,
Matt, stop.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're not going to look at the
camera.

27:44.429 --> 27:45.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Look straight ahead.

27:45.597 --> 27:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Matt, look where we're going.

27:46.598 --> 27:47.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Come on.

27:47.599 --> 27:48.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look at me.

27:48.600 --> 27:49.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Look at dad.

27:49.601 --> 27:50.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All right, no more pictures.

27:50.602 --> 27:51.603 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Come. on.

27:51.637 --> 27:53.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: That's his dad with
him, Rob
Resnik.

27:53.772 --> 27:59.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the reason we didn't
formally interview
Matt himself is that he cannot
do a television

27:59.378 --> 28:00.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interview.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.547 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How are you today?

28:01.580 --> 28:03.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROB RESNIK: How you are?

28:03.115 --> 28:04.082 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT RESNIK, SMILE Biscotti: I
am magnificent.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT RESNIK: Good.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.252 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Good.

28:07.286 --> 28:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: He lacks the
language skills
for that, which is a key reason
you don't

28:13.492 --> 28:16.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see many stories about people
like him in
the media.

28:16.161 --> 28:20.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moreover, without his dad
guiding him, Matt
would get lost here in hurry.

28:20.132 --> 28:25.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's why he's still lives at
home, a grown
man, with parents who are no
longer young,

28:25.304 --> 28:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a mother who represents his
closest connection
to anyone.

28:29.942 --> 28:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can see that so easily,
what's between
them.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there's another side to this
connection.

28:38.317 --> 28:43.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's knowing that it may never
be duplicated,
and that no one else may have
Matt's back

28:44.022 --> 28:45.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this.

28:45.357 --> 28:51.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK, Mother of Matt
Resnik: I do
worry about Matt.

28:51.129 --> 28:55.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I worry because he is so
trusting and so vulnerable.

28:55.701 --> 29:01.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I worry about, who is going to
be in his home
or help him and who is going to
understand

29:01.940 --> 29:03.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
him and all his idiosyncrasies?

29:03.375 --> 29:05.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And will I be there?

29:05.510 --> 29:07.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's sit over here.

29:07.479 --> 29:12.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And how Denise has
responded
to that worry, one that is
shared by all parents

29:12.050 --> 29:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of all children facing such
challenges, it's
left its mark, and not just in
her house,

29:17.656 --> 29:21.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but in a much bigger way.

29:21.927 --> 29:26.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Although changing the world was
the farthest
thing from her mind back when
Matt was first

29:26.198 --> 29:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
diagnosed with autism in the
early 1990s.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Then, the mission looked like
this.

29:31.803 --> 29:37.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: He was going to
be one of those
kids who recovered from his
autism.

29:37.476 --> 29:38.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I was sure of it.

29:38.510 --> 29:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was going to make sure that
that happened.

29:40.379 --> 29:42.247 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And here's what
that meant.

29:42.280 --> 29:46.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: Immediately after
Matt's diagnosis,
I poured my heart and soul and
every waking

29:46.852 --> 29:53.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hour into making sure that we
were going to
provide Matt 40 hours of
one-on-one therapy

29:53.225 --> 29:59.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
every week, then artfully
integrate speech
therapy and art therapy and
riding therapy.

29:59.665 --> 30:04.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Denise also
followed the path
taken by many other parents
before her, in

30:04.036 --> 30:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other times and places, helping
to launch
an organization, the Southwest
Autism Research

30:09.241 --> 30:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Resource Center, SARRC for
short.

30:11.410 --> 30:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: This is our
classroom play
area, and this is where a lot of
learning

30:15.380 --> 30:17.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
takes place.

30:17.082 --> 30:20.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Which would bring
about, she
hoped, the rescue she was
praying for.

30:20.786 --> 30:23.088 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That essentially was the mission
back then.

30:23.121 --> 30:25.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DENISE RESNIK: We do our
research right here.

30:25.590 --> 30:30.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: SARRC even launched
its own scientific
research center and studied and
developed

30:30.529 --> 30:32.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
autism-specific curricula.

30:32.464 --> 30:36.101 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was an all-out campaign that
lasted years.

30:36.134 --> 30:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only thing was, Matt did not
recover from
autism.

30:39.838 --> 30:44.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The available therapies can lead
to dramatically
different results in different
people.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.278 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in Matt's case, he did make
strides.

30:46.311 --> 30:51.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He learned to bike and to hike
and to read
some words and multiply numbers
in his head,

30:51.683 --> 30:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which came in handy when he
helped his mom
bake.

30:54.152 --> 30:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But some things got worse, like
his eating
habits, chewing on things that
were not food.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: He would eat
things that were
not edible.

31:01.793 --> 31:06.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a year, he chewed through 132
shirts.

31:06.998 --> 31:11.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Nor did Matt ever
learn to recognize
danger in the usual sense.

31:11.770 --> 31:16.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even now, he wouldn't know what
to do if,
say, something in the oven
caught fire.

31:16.942 --> 31:19.377 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And his language still has
serious limits.

31:19.411 --> 31:25.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has never in his life asked a
question
or put together a spoken
sentence of his own

31:25.283 --> 31:31.089 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
making.

31:31.123 --> 31:38.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He never could talk the way he
could sing,
even back then, when Denise was
still counting

31:38.897 --> 31:44.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on this little kid outgrowing
the challenges
to his having a place of his own
in the world

31:44.202 --> 31:50.008 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out there.

31:50.041 --> 31:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And over time, Denise came to
the realization
that it was the world out there
that would

31:55.180 --> 32:00.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to change if Matt was to be
safe and
supported when his mom and dad
were gone.

32:00.786 --> 32:05.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Accepting that reality, in time,
Denise shifted
SARRC's mission in a new
direction.

32:05.624 --> 32:10.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: For the last two
decades, I
have poured my heart and soul
into trying

32:10.996 --> 32:16.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to build a community with a lot
of other people,
in trying to achieve a vision.

32:16.601 --> 32:20.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And when you say
community, you
don't just mean a community of
the people

32:20.972 --> 32:22.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
directly affected by autism.

32:22.541 --> 32:24.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: Oh, I mean a
broader community.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Everybody.

32:25.410 --> 32:27.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DENISE RESNIK: Right.

32:27.312 --> 32:31.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And it's why
Phoenix, Arizona,
SARRC's hometown, may be the
most autism-aware,

32:31.683 --> 32:37.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
autism-friendly metropolis in
the world, one
in which everywhere Denise
pointed when we

32:37.255 --> 32:41.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rode the light rail through
downtown together,
there was a business employing
autistic people.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: And this is CVS
pharmacy.

32:43.261 --> 32:46.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Or a school with
classes designed
with autism in mind.

32:46.665 --> 32:47.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: You can see ASU.

32:48.033 --> 32:50.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Or research centers
investigating
treatments.

32:50.769 --> 32:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: St. Joseph
Hospital and Medical
Center.

32:52.838 --> 32:57.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: SARRC now has
literally dozens
and dozens of private and public
partners

32:57.609 --> 33:02.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
energized about supporting
autism in real
ways, and not just with money,
but with jobs,

33:02.747 --> 33:07.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
access and housing, some of it
captured in
the story we told last night
about that pilot

33:07.552 --> 33:12.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program preparing autistic
adults to live
on their own and hold jobs, and
also this

33:12.991 --> 33:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
preschool, which mixes classes
of autistic
with non-autistic children,
because -- and

33:21.499 --> 33:25.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's with that mission in mind
again -- consider
what happens when all these kids
grow up.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL OPENDEN, President,
Southwest Autism
Research &amp; Resource Center: They
are inclusive

33:27.372 --> 33:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of kids that are different or
that have autism
or that have disabilities out on
the playground.

33:31.009 --> 33:31.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're future employers.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're future co-workers.

33:33.144 --> 33:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, we're not having to teach
these kids directly.

33:36.081 --> 33:39.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're just consumed around
people who are
different from them.

33:39.284 --> 33:43.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: And that is the big
picture that
Denise has long had in mind, a
world where

33:43.788 --> 33:47.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support doesn't merely mean paid
staff providing
services.

33:47.759 --> 33:51.096 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It means, well, having neighbors
who care,
having friends.

33:51.129 --> 33:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: What people like
Matt and others
need, and what we need, are
communities, communities

33:57.936 --> 34:04.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that include friends, people to
support us,
health care, jobs, recreation,
places of worship,

34:04.075 --> 34:05.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
transportation.

34:05.810 --> 34:13.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to think that a family can
go at this
alone to build a life for their
loved one

34:13.351 --> 34:15.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
isn't good enough.

34:15.120 --> 34:19.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: So, even if a
family had all
the money in the world, that --
having those

34:20.025 --> 34:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
resources would not be enough to
take care
of their kid through adulthood
and through

34:24.996 --> 34:26.765 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life?

34:26.798 --> 34:30.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: It would be
enough to take
care of their kid, but what they
may be lacking

34:30.835 --> 34:33.638 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are friends, because you don't
pay your friends.

34:33.672 --> 34:39.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: The next major
step, well, it's
an empty lot right now, but it
won't always

34:39.344 --> 34:41.112 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when you come out here, do
you -- it is
an empty field now, but do --
can you see

34:43.481 --> 34:44.449 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it?

34:44.482 --> 34:45.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: I can see it.

34:45.483 --> 34:46.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN DONVAN: Yes?

34:46.484 --> 34:47.452 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: I can see it.

34:47.485 --> 34:48.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I can feel it.

34:48.486 --> 34:50.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it is going to happen.

34:50.288 --> 34:52.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's something I have been
dreaming about
almost since the first day the
school bus

34:52.490 --> 34:54.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
arrived for Matt.

34:54.259 --> 34:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: This is the future
site of an
apartment complex to be called
First Place,

34:58.029 --> 35:03.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which will look like this, and
will be supported
by a collaboration among than 75
charitable,

35:03.969 --> 35:09.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
private and public groups,
creating a neighborhood
of people of varying levels of
ability and

35:09.274 --> 35:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
disability with more or less
support as needed.

35:12.644 --> 35:13.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is where Matt will live too.

35:13.912 --> 35:16.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DENISE RESNIK: This is going to
be his home.

35:16.481 --> 35:21.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may not be his home forever,
but aptly
named, it's going to be his home
when he leaves

35:21.419 --> 35:22.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our family home.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: His first place
away from home.

35:23.488 --> 35:24.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DENISE RESNIK: It is.

35:24.723 --> 35:28.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: Ground-breaking is
set for later
this year.

35:28.693 --> 35:33.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For now, though, Matt still has
the two best
support people anyone could ask
for, his mom

35:33.064 --> 35:37.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and dad, who are helping keep
the biscotti
business on track, one that
employs several

35:37.969 --> 35:42.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
people on the autism spectrum.

35:42.540 --> 35:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when it's just the three of
them together,
that's when the question of
Matt's future

35:46.611 --> 35:52.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes back into focus, with the
hope that
10, 20, 30, 40 years from now,
he will have

35:52.384 --> 35:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a whole community by his side
and at his back,
taking in the song, and caring
what he has

35:59.224 --> 36:00.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to say.

36:00.992 --> 36:07.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT RESNIK (singing): And I'm
free, free-falling.

36:07.165 --> 36:14.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN DONVAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm John
Donvan in Phoenix.

36:14.472 --> 36:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have reported
at length
for more than a year on the
migrant crisis

36:24.516 --> 36:29.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We have reported
at length
for more than a year on the
migrant crisis

36:29.521 --> 36:31.890 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Europe, the Middle East and
North Africa.

36:31.923 --> 36:36.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, tonight, we look at the
plight of those
searching for new homes and
lives far away

36:36.961 --> 36:38.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from those shores.

36:38.663 --> 36:40.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has that.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The government
of Australia
has, for years now, made it very
clear that

36:43.968 --> 36:49.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they will no longer accept
refugees and migrants
coming to the continent by boat.

36:49.174 --> 36:54.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And those that do are sent to a
tiny island
nation called Nauru off
Australia's northeast

36:54.212 --> 36:56.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coast.

36:56.081 --> 37:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But recent reports by human
rights advocates,
and today from The Guardian
newspaper, show

37:00.285 --> 37:06.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nightmarish conditions for more
than 1,000
people who were sent for
processing by Australia's

37:06.291 --> 37:09.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government to this island
nation.

37:09.294 --> 37:14.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Allegations in the report
include physical
and sexual abuse, often aimed at
children,

37:14.165 --> 37:17.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and substandard and inhumane
living conditions.

37:17.402 --> 37:22.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on this, I'm joined
from Paris by
Anna Neistat of Amnesty
International.

37:22.607 --> 37:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thanks for being with us.

37:24.109 --> 37:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a hard place to get to.

37:26.411 --> 37:30.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You gained access where many
journalists have
not been able to.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tell us what you saw when you
got to this
island.

37:32.550 --> 37:37.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANNA NEISTAT, Amnesty
International: What
I saw there can only be
described as deliberate

37:37.355 --> 37:40.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
systematic abuse.

37:40.558 --> 37:43.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We're not talking about
individual incidents.

37:43.061 --> 37:46.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the files released today
make it crystal-clear.

37:46.531 --> 37:53.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are talking about patterns,
patterns of
really serious physical
conditions, heart

37:53.371 --> 37:58.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diseases, complications from
diabetes, kidney
diseases that are not being
treated properly,

37:58.843 --> 38:03.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and for which people are not
being transferred
elsewhere to get proper care.

38:03.848 --> 38:11.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And probably the most
nightmarish of it all
is the state of psychological
trauma and the

38:11.456 --> 38:18.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rate of self-harm and attempted
suicides amongst
adults, but even worse among
children.

38:18.730 --> 38:24.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I personally interviewed several
children,
including a boy as young as 9,
who already

38:24.402 --> 38:28.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attempted suicide and was still
talking about
ending his life.

38:28.640 --> 38:33.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What's behind
this acute
issues with the children?

38:34.012 --> 38:35.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Why are they affected in this
way?

38:35.680 --> 38:41.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNA NEISTAT: Well, I think
children are affected
along with adults.

38:41.219 --> 38:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Children, of course, are always
some of the
most vulnerable, but they're
also easy targets.

38:48.726 --> 38:52.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they see around them when
their parents
are trying to kill themselves in
front of

38:52.697 --> 38:57.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their eyes, that also has
enormous effect
on their psychological
well-being.

38:57.635 --> 39:01.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tell me a
little bit about,
what's the relationship between
Australia

39:01.506 --> 39:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and this tiny island nation?

39:03.141 --> 39:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like 3,000 kilometers away.

39:04.909 --> 39:08.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ANNA NEISTAT: Well, the
relationship is pretty,
pretty simple.

39:08.846 --> 39:13.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At some point, when Australia
decided that
they are not going to accept
refugees who

39:13.151 --> 39:18.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are arriving by boat, ostensibly
in order
to prevent people from dying at
sea and to

39:18.489 --> 39:22.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
combat smuggling, they set up
this offshore
processing.

39:22.527 --> 39:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So Australia is now paying
hundreds of millions
of dollars per year for this
operation.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Obviously, it's a significant
part of Nauru's
economy.

39:32.971 --> 39:36.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The island doesn't really have
much else.

39:36.074 --> 39:42.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in exchange, obviously,
Nauru gets some
employment opportunities, some
investment

39:42.714 --> 39:44.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in its infrastructure.

39:44.515 --> 39:48.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many people of the people --
so many of
the people employed by the
companies who work

39:48.253 --> 39:49.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on Nauru are local.

39:49.988 --> 39:56.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is part
of Australia's
policy to not allow any of these
migrants

39:56.594 --> 39:59.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or refugees to settle on
Australian soil.

39:59.230 --> 40:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're keeping them off the
continent for
a reason.

40:02.600 --> 40:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say that this is to create
a disincentive,
so more refugees don't get on
boats and you

40:08.940 --> 40:11.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't see what's been happening
between the
Middle East and Europe.

40:11.909 --> 40:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNA NEISTAT: Well, yes, and I
think that's
one of the most cynical refugee
policies I

40:16.814 --> 40:18.182 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have ever seen.

40:18.216 --> 40:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And Australia is indeed quite
open about that.

40:20.919 --> 40:25.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are essentially making an
example of
these people, so that the ones
-- the ones

40:25.323 --> 40:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are held in Nauru, so that
others do
not attempt the same route, do
not arrive

40:31.095 --> 40:34.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to arrive to Australia by boat.

40:34.232 --> 40:42.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think this is not only
unlawful, but
it also again goes against any
principles

40:42.173 --> 40:43.808 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of humanity.

40:43.841 --> 40:48.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What they have spent enormous
effort on is
keeping this whole situation
secret.

40:48.846 --> 40:50.581 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

40:50.615 --> 40:54.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why many of your viewers,
I'm sure,
have never heard about this
situation, is

40:54.085 --> 40:55.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they kept it completely
secret.

40:55.887 --> 41:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They do not allow independent
journalists
or almost any journalist in, for
that matter.

41:00.124 --> 41:04.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They do not allow any
international observers,
international organizations.

41:04.662 --> 41:10.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But what's more, they
essentially swear everybody
who works on the island into
secrecy.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But now this veil of secrecy is
off.

41:13.705 --> 41:18.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now that it's off, I really
think it's
high time for Australia to stop
denying -- denying

41:19.010 --> 41:26.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the undeniable and really start
closing down
this whole operation both in
Manus and in

41:26.084 --> 41:30.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nauru and resettling people
either in Australia
or in an appropriate third
country.

41:30.688 --> 41:34.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We reached out
to the Australian
government for response, and
they say that

41:34.258 --> 41:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they are investigating the
revelations today.

41:36.461 --> 41:44.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Anna Neistat of Amnesty
International, thank
you.

41:44.369 --> 41:54.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now: developing
technology that
can better identify your own
emotions.

41:54.679 --> 41:59.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a time when people are
concerned about
what data can track and how it
can be sold,

41:59.050 --> 42:02.220 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is an advance that clearly
raises concerns.

42:02.253 --> 42:04.689 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it may also yield some
important benefits.

42:04.722 --> 42:10.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s April Brown
takes a look,
part of our weekly series on the
Leading Edge

42:10.061 --> 42:11.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of science and technology.

42:11.829 --> 42:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAN MCDUFF, Director of
Research, Affectiva:
You can control the movements of
BB-8, the

42:15.199 --> 42:18.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little droid, based on how your
facial expressions
are changing.

42:18.703 --> 42:22.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: If this little
droid looks familiar,
you may have seen him in the
most recent Star

42:22.874 --> 42:26.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Wars film.

42:26.244 --> 42:31.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BB-8 moved on his own on the
fictional planet
Jakku, but here in Boston, Dan
McDuff is in

42:31.616 --> 42:33.351 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
charge.

42:33.384 --> 42:37.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN MCDUFF: It's going to detect
my face,
and then start to be able to
control the robot

42:37.522 --> 42:38.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by making different facial
expressions.

42:38.890 --> 42:40.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: He's taken off.

42:40.324 --> 42:42.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not pleased with you.

42:42.126 --> 42:46.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The software that allows him to
control BB-8
is called Affdex, and McDuff is
the director

42:46.798 --> 42:51.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of research for Affectiva, the
company that
created it.

42:51.068 --> 42:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Affdex can do much more than
make robots
move by making faces.

42:55.506 --> 42:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It can also detect expressions
to help determine
how people are feeling.

42:59.377 --> 43:05.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN MCDUFF: So, we're using the
camera feed
to detect where your face is,
track the feature

43:05.383 --> 43:09.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
points, and identify texture
changes on your
skin.

43:09.887 --> 43:14.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you furrow your brow or
smile, there
are these distinctive patterns
that the computer

43:14.192 --> 43:15.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can recognize.

43:16.027 --> 43:20.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's actually been trained
on hundreds
of thousands of people, so it's
seen examples

43:20.465 --> 43:24.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of smiles and brow furrows and
frowns from
many different people.

43:24.335 --> 43:27.572 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANA EL KALIOUBY, CEO,
Affectiva: So, so far,
we have collected over 50
billion emotion

43:27.605 --> 43:29.540 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
data points.

43:29.574 --> 43:33.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Rana El Kaliouby is
Affectiva's
CEO, and the brain behind the
artificial intelligence

43:33.878 --> 43:35.613 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
software.

43:35.646 --> 43:37.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANA EL KALIOUBY: I realized
that we were
spending so much time with our
devices and

43:37.715 --> 43:44.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our technology, yet it had
absolutely no idea
how we felt or what our mental
state was.

43:44.522 --> 43:46.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: How do you know
that this is
accurate?

43:46.591 --> 43:51.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANA EL KALIOUBY: Validation is
a -- we take
that very seriously at
Affectiva.

43:51.496 --> 43:56.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a team of labelers based
in Cairo,
and they are certified facial
action coders.

43:57.001 --> 44:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we compare the accuracy
of our machine-learning
algorithms to the accuracy of
these human

44:03.574 --> 44:05.409 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
experts.

44:05.443 --> 44:10.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On some of these emotional
states, we're approaching
expert human accuracy very, very
fast.

44:10.448 --> 44:12.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
APRIL BROWN: Which ones?

44:12.250 --> 44:16.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RANA EL KALIOUBY: So for
example, with the
smiles, with the eyebrow furrows
and the eyebrow

44:16.187 --> 44:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
raises, it's extremely accurate.

44:18.890 --> 44:24.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It gets a little trickier when
you look at,
you know, lip puckers or lip
purses or, you

44:24.729 --> 44:26.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
know, squints.

44:26.564 --> 44:30.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Emotional intelligence is
completely missing
from our digital world, and so
now there is

44:30.868 --> 44:36.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot more understanding of why
emotions are
important and there -- you know,
there is

44:36.274 --> 44:40.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot more understanding of how
this type
of technology can disrupt and
transform a

44:40.044 --> 44:41.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lot of industries.

44:41.546 --> 44:44.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: The media and
advertising industries
quickly saw the value.

44:44.148 --> 44:46.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANA EL KALIOUBY: We have
partnered with 1,400
brands.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.954 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We test ads in 75 countries
around the world.

44:49.987 --> 44:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You want to know if people are
resonating
with your ad before it goes live
and before

44:54.425 --> 44:56.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you spend millions and millions
of dollars.

44:56.294 --> 45:01.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With our software, you can get a
moment-by-moment
readout of a viewer's emotional
journey.

45:01.432 --> 45:03.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
The nature of our military has
changed.

45:03.868 --> 45:08.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Like Affectiva
itself did with
a test to find out how well the
candidates

45:08.406 --> 45:15.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were connecting with viewers in
one of the
debates for the 2012
presidential election.

45:15.780 --> 45:19.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many other companies have found
their own
applications for the emotional
recognition

45:19.417 --> 45:21.118 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
technology.

45:21.152 --> 45:23.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ERIN REYNOLDS, CEO, Flying
Mollusk: We call
Nevermind a biofeedback enhanced
adventure

45:23.454 --> 45:24.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thriller game.

45:24.455 --> 45:26.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Say that five times fast.

45:26.257 --> 45:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Erin Reynolds is
CEO of Flying
Mollusk, a company that created
the video

45:30.461 --> 45:31.963 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
game Nevermind.

45:31.996 --> 45:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIN REYNOLDS: Nevermind is a
very creepy
game, a very dark, surreal game.

45:36.033 --> 45:39.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Often, the player will be a
little stressed,
a little scared, a little
anxious when they

45:39.470 --> 45:40.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are playing it.

45:40.871 --> 45:42.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So you as a player have to learn
how to stay
calm under the pressure.

45:42.807 --> 45:46.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The more scared or stressed you
get, the faster
it goes, so it becomes a lot
harder to grab

45:46.344 --> 45:48.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the hand.

45:48.145 --> 45:51.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: While Nevermind's
purpose is
entertainment-only right now,
Reynolds hopes

45:51.515 --> 45:56.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the game may eventually help
people with post-traumatic
stress disorder or anxiety.

45:56.787 --> 46:01.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Affdex software is
already being used
in the medical field to try and
improve lives.

46:01.726 --> 46:04.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NED SAHIN, CEO, Brain Power:
What do you see
on screen?

46:04.362 --> 46:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW KRIEGER, 8 Years Old:
Mom.

46:05.896 --> 46:07.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Eight-year-old
Matthew Krieger
has been diagnosed with autism.

46:07.632 --> 46:10.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA KRIEGER, Mother of Matthew
Krieger:
A lot of the trouble he gets
into with other

46:10.134 --> 46:15.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kids is, he thinks he's funny
and doesn't
read at all that he is not or
that there are

46:15.039 --> 46:16.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
annoyed or angry.

46:16.874 --> 46:19.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Matthew's mother,
Laura, signed
him up for a clinical trial
being conducted

46:19.777 --> 46:21.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by Ned Sahin.

46:21.379 --> 46:27.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NED SAHIN: I want to know what's
going on
inside the brain of someone with
autism.

46:27.585 --> 46:30.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it turns out parents want to
know that,
too.

46:30.888 --> 46:35.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get points for looking for a
while, and
then even for looking away and
then looking

46:35.259 --> 46:36.994 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
back.

46:37.028 --> 46:40.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Sahin's company,
Brain Power,
uses Affectiva's software
programs Matthew

46:40.131 --> 46:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sees through Google Glass.

46:41.999 --> 46:46.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These games are trying to help
him understand
how facial expressions
correspond to emotions

46:46.904 --> 46:48.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and learn social cues.

46:48.472 --> 46:52.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NED SAHIN: One of the key life
skills is understanding
the emotions of others.

46:52.777 --> 46:57.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And another is looking in their
direction
when they are speaking.

46:57.915 --> 47:00.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Looking at your mom, and while
it's green,
you're getting points.

47:00.785 --> 47:05.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it starts to get orange and
red, you're
-- you slow down with the
points.

47:05.389 --> 47:07.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW KRIEGER: Am I looking at
you?

47:07.425 --> 47:09.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA KRIEGER: You are looking
at me.

47:09.326 --> 47:10.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you looking at me?

47:10.327 --> 47:11.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you think you are?

47:11.328 --> 47:12.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW KRIEGER: Yes.

47:12.329 --> 47:13.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LAURA KRIEGER: Yes.

47:13.330 --> 47:14.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW KRIEGER: Well, I don't
know if I am.

47:14.498 --> 47:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAURA KRIEGER: You don't know?

47:16.167 --> 47:19.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW KRIEGER: Because I found
out that,
if I look this way, it doesn't
count.

47:19.904 --> 47:28.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if I look through -- if I
look at the
screen at you, I can still see
your eyes,

47:28.179 --> 47:29.880 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and it gives me points.

47:29.914 --> 47:34.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA KRIEGER: So -- but if you
tilt your
head up and look under the
screen, you feel

47:34.485 --> 47:36.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
like you are looking at me?

47:36.353 --> 47:38.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATTHEW KRIEGER: Well, I feel
like I am both.

47:38.923 --> 47:43.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Just a few minutes
later, the
difference in Matthew's gaze
overwhelmed his

47:43.094 --> 47:44.061 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mother.

47:44.095 --> 47:47.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAURA KRIEGER: I'm going to cry.

47:47.098 --> 47:48.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATTHEW KRIEGER: Why?

47:48.899 --> 47:58.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA KRIEGER: When you look at
me, it makes
me think you haven't really
before, because

47:58.642 --> 48:00.511 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you're looking at me
differently.

48:00.544 --> 48:05.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NED SAHIN: The brain learns very
well by feedback.

48:05.483 --> 48:09.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't know for sure yet, but
we're going
to find out if the kind of
feedback we are

48:09.820 --> 48:13.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
giving can help people teach
themselves these
skills.

48:13.290 --> 48:17.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: After the testing,
Laura Krieger
reflected on what happened.

48:17.194 --> 48:19.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LAURA KRIEGER: It's such a
difference.

48:19.897 --> 48:25.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have heard him even tell
the psychologist
when she works on eye contact,
he says: "Well,

48:25.302 --> 48:26.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I have a trick.

48:26.337 --> 48:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I look at your forehead."

48:28.172 --> 48:34.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's probably what people
see in passing,
is that counts for them as eye
contact.

48:34.111 --> 48:35.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it did for me.

48:35.412 --> 48:36.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But this was really different.

48:36.647 --> 48:38.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Like, this was looking at me.

48:38.382 --> 48:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Allowing a computer
to capture
and read your emotions for
research is one

48:42.186 --> 48:47.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing, but Affectiva's Rana El
Kaliouby says
her company is concerned about
how this sensitive

48:47.658 --> 48:49.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
material is used in all
applications.

48:49.560 --> 48:54.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RANA EL KALIOUBY: We recognize
that your emotional
information is extremely
personal.

48:54.532 --> 48:58.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we have veered away from
all use cases
where that data is being
collected without

48:58.569 --> 48:59.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your consent.

48:59.570 --> 49:01.338 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Is there not a
slippery slope?

49:01.372 --> 49:05.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you are giving the computer
the ability
to recognize your emotions, is
that not one

49:05.376 --> 49:10.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
step further towards something
that could
potentially do something
dangerous?

49:10.614 --> 49:14.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANA EL KALIOUBY: I think these
conversations
are very important.

49:14.418 --> 49:17.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I personally believe we are a
long way away
from that scenario.

49:17.788 --> 49:22.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: Still, El Kaliouby
sees her artificial
intelligence work becoming
ubiquitous in the

49:23.027 --> 49:24.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
years to come.

49:24.195 --> 49:25.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RANA EL KALIOUBY: Fast-forward
three to five
years.

49:25.996 --> 49:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think our devices and our
technologies
will all have an emotion chip,
so pretty much

49:31.602 --> 49:35.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like our devices have a GPS or
location-enabled
apps today.

49:35.873 --> 49:41.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apparently, we check our phones
on an average
15 times an hour, and so you can
imagine that

49:41.812 --> 49:44.181 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being an emotion data point
check-in.

49:44.215 --> 49:47.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you can track a person's
mood.

49:47.384 --> 49:50.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
APRIL BROWN: And eventually, she
hopes, it
will help our devices convey
more emotion

49:50.788 --> 49:53.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than we can with the current
technology.

49:53.390 --> 50:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
April Brown in
Boston.

50:03.167 --> 50:12.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight,
to our "NewsHour"
shares, something that caught
our eye that

50:12.576 --> 50:14.678 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
might be of interest to you,
too.

50:14.712 --> 50:19.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maintaining a good work-life
balance is important
to many people.

50:19.083 --> 50:24.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But in South Korea, one group of
soldiers
has found an unexpected way to
unwind from

50:24.521 --> 50:25.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the daily grind.

50:25.756 --> 50:28.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia Griffin
reports.

50:28.192 --> 50:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Once a week,
these soldiers
in the South Korean army's 25th
Division trade

50:33.931 --> 50:38.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
their military boots for a pair
of ballet
slippers.

50:38.135 --> 50:44.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plies, tendus and other
exercises are
aimed at relieving stress, as
these troops

50:44.341 --> 50:48.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are among those guarding the
demilitarized
zone along the border with North
Korea.

50:48.479 --> 50:51.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KIM JOO-HYEOK, South Korean
Soldier (through
translator): There's a lot of
tension here,

50:51.282 --> 50:53.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since we live in the unit on the
front line.

50:53.484 --> 50:55.786 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it makes me feel insecure at
times.

50:55.819 --> 50:59.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
However, through ballet, I am
able to stay
calm and find balance.

50:59.356 --> 51:05.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: Each session is
taught by Lee
Hyang-Jo, a ballerina with the
Korean National

51:05.896 --> 51:07.598 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ballet.

51:07.631 --> 51:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LEE HYANG-JO, Korean National
Ballet (through
translator): Living as a soldier
is quite

51:09.767 --> 51:12.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tough, so I wasn't sure I could
actually help
them here.

51:12.503 --> 51:17.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But now I feel worthwhile
whenever I see them
smiling more and enjoying ballet
as they learn

51:17.474 --> 51:19.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it little by little.

51:19.209 --> 51:22.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: And unit leaders
have found
the classes provide health
benefits beyond

51:22.880 --> 51:24.682 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
stress relief.

51:24.715 --> 51:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEO TAE-SUN, South Korean
Commander (through
translator): Ballet requires a
great amount

51:26.717 --> 51:31.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of physical strength, is very
good for strengthening
muscle, increasing flexibility,
and correcting

51:31.488 --> 51:32.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
posture.

51:32.523 --> 51:33.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think that ballet has
helped us.

51:33.991 --> 51:36.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: All the training
appears to
be paying off.

51:36.727 --> 51:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The 15 soldiers plan to stage
their own ballet
performance at the end of the
year.

51:41.999 --> 51:44.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Julia Griffin.

51:44.635 --> 51:48.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Ballet, that's the
stress relief
I was looking for.

51:48.072 --> 51:49.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sure.

51:49.907 --> 51:52.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: High-performance athletic
gear can giving

51:52.776 --> 51:54.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Olympic athletes a winning edge.

51:55.012 --> 51:59.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year, innovative gear has
been designed
to protect their health, too.

51:59.249 --> 52:03.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Learn about four high-tech
uniforms making
a splash in Rio.

52:03.754 --> 52:06.757 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:06.790 --> 52:13.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later tonight on
"Charlie Rose":
Meryl Streep and Hugh Grant on
their new film,

52:13.263 --> 52:15.199 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"Florence Foster Jenkins."

52:15.232 --> 52:20.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And before we go, I want to take
a moment
to congratulate my friend and
colleagues Gwen

52:20.304 --> 52:26.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on receiving the 2016 John
Chancellor Award
for Excellence in Journalism
from Columbia

52:26.477 --> 52:28.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
University.

52:28.278 --> 52:31.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is a huge tribute to you, and
we look forward
to that ceremony coming up in
November.

52:31.749 --> 52:32.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you, Judy.

52:32.750 --> 52:33.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you so much.

52:33.951 --> 52:35.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that is the
"NewsHour"
for tonight.

52:35.986 --> 52:40.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Thursday, we will take a
closer look at
the economic plans of Donald
Trump and Hillary

52:40.691 --> 52:41.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

52:41.692 --> 52:43.560 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How they might affect your
pocketbook?

52:43.594 --> 52:44.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

52:44.595 --> 52:45.629 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

52:45.662 --> 52:48.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

52:48.399 --> 52:54.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"
thank you, and good night.

52:54.738 --> 52:58.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"
thank you, and good night.
