conversations with former
FBI Director James Comey.

00:09.366 --> 00:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the weekend, several
Republican senators
urged the president to
answer that question,

00:14.966 --> 00:16.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yes or no.

00:16.966 --> 00:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At the White House
today, reporters pressed
Press Secretary Sean
Spicer on the subject.

00:20.533 --> 00:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House
Press Secretary: I think the
president made it very clear on

00:23.133 --> 00:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Friday that he would get back as
soon as possible on this and his
position on that conversation.

00:29.266 --> 00:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
QUESTION: Right, but
what is he waiting for?

00:30.933 --> 00:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's the delay?

00:32.433 --> 00:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SEAN SPICER: He's waiting --
he's not waiting for anything.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
When he's ready to further
discuss it, he will.

00:35.866 --> 00:38.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Spicer also
wouldn't say if Attorney General
Jeff Sessions will invoke

00:38.566 --> 00:42.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
executive privilege when
he goes before a Senate
committee tomorrow.

agreed with a ruling by a lower

01:01.700 --> 01:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
court in Hawaii that the ban
discriminates against Muslims.

01:04.433 --> 01:09.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A federal appeals court
in Virginia already
issued a similar ruling
in a separate case.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The attorneys general of
Maryland and the District of
Columbia charged today that the

01:13.933 --> 01:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president's ongoing business
ties violate the Constitution.

01:18.933 --> 01:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They sued in federal court,
citing the Emoluments
Clause, designed to
head off conflicts of

01:24.933 --> 01:27.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interest.

01:27.366 --> 01:30.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Washington, the two

KARL A. RACINE, D.C. Attorney
General: We're concerned that
foreign governments are coming

01:37.233 --> 01:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Trump businesses for
the single purpose of currying
special favor from the president

01:42.800 --> 01:47.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States, so that
their interests can get a higher
priority than the interests

01:48.633 --> 01:50.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the American people.

01:50.633 --> 01:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A White House
spokesman said the suit is
motivated by partisan politics.

01:54.700 --> 01:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A similar lawsuit is
pending in New York state.

01:58.300 --> 02:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House also condemned
Russia's crackdown today on

02:04.700 --> 02:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than a thousand people were

02:07.833 --> 02:11.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%

Independent Television
News filed this report.

02:11.633 --> 02:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Hundreds arrested
in Moscow alone on a day of
protests nationwide against

02:19.133 --> 02:24.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
corruption generally and
Vladimir Putin particularly.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Putin is a thief," the chant,
and "Russia without Putin"
-- all of this organized by

02:34.500 --> 02:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kremlin's most
prominent critic by
far, the anti-corruption
campaigner and presidential

02:40.233 --> 02:42.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hopeful Alexei Navalny.

02:42.266 --> 02:46.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Navalny's plan was to rain
on President Putin's parade,
it's certainly succeeding

02:48.066 --> 02:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in this part of
the demonstration.

02:50.466 --> 02:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands of people gathered
here, plainly the vast majority
of them here pro-Navalny.

02:54.266 --> 02:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN (through translator):
Putin is killing our people.

02:58.233 --> 02:59.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's killing you and me.

02:59.966 --> 03:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He's sending people to
Ukraine and Syria to
die for his interests.

03:03.333 --> 03:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let's tell him
we're not having it.

03:05.033 --> 03:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
I came here for the truth.

03:08.866 --> 03:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our government is not
conducting itself properly.

03:11.366 --> 03:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Navalny was
allowed to demo in Moscow,
just not here, on the main road

03:17.533 --> 03:19.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
leading straight
up to Red Square.

03:19.200 --> 03:22.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But late last night, he
ordered his people to
this illegal location.

03:22.666 --> 03:25.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That made confrontation
inevitable.

03:25.800 --> 03:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Muscovites," he told people
in a late-night appeal,
"come to Tverskaya Street.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't go anywhere else."

03:34.900 --> 03:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alexei Navalny himself never
made it to his own protest,
arrested at his home in Moscow.

03:42.100 --> 03:47.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He could now be detained
for up to 30 days.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Across Moscow, as across
Russia, these were the official
independence day celebrations,

03:54.533 --> 03:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the kind the Kremlin wanted
people to see and, let's
face it, most Russians.

03:57.800 --> 03:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Putin remains hugely popular.

03:59.933 --> 04:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Navalny's support runs
at just 2 percent.

04:02.566 --> 04:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
I don't think protesting
today makes any sense.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People are celebrating.

04:08.033 --> 04:09.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're happy.

04:09.033 --> 04:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why spoil the mood?

04:11.533 --> 04:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: This was
Vladivostok demonstrations
and arrests well before
most of Moscow had

04:17.100 --> 04:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even got up this morning,
north to Siberia, Novosibirsk,
and another of more than 200

04:22.933 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cities where anti-corruption
protesters gathered, and
west to St. Petersburg,
the same pattern,

04:29.133 --> 04:31.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gathering chanting
and arresting.

04:31.866 --> 04:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And back in this
country, newly elected Montana
Congressman Greg Gianforte

04:38.266 --> 04:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will not go to jail after all
for assaulting a reporter.

04:42.033 --> 04:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Republican pleaded
guilty today to a misdemeanor
charge, and was sentenced

service.

04:49.500 --> 04:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will also attend 20 hours
of anger management counseling
and pay a fine of $385.

begun deliberating in Bill
Cosby's sexual assault trial.

05:01.233 --> 05:03.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The defense rested
abruptly today.

05:03.366 --> 05:07.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cosby himself, accompanied
by his wife for the first
time, declined to testify.

05:09.933 --> 05:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His defense team argued the
comedian and his accuser had
a consensual relationship.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Prosecutors argued that
Cosby drugged the woman.

In Orlando, Florida, today,

history.

killed him.

05:31.066 --> 05:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He'd pledged allegiance to
the Islamic State group.

began at 2:00 a.m., the
same hour as the rampage.

05:38.533 --> 05:42.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Names of the victims were read
aloud, and hundreds carried
candles and laid flowers.

BUDDY DYER, Mayor of Orlando,
Florida: We are not here to
relive the horror of that

05:47.066 --> 05:48.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
day.

05:48.066 --> 05:50.166 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
We're here for a
greater purpose.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

06:03.133 --> 06:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we don't just have the
opportunity to do this.

06:05.733 --> 06:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%

is recommending the Bears Ears
National Monument in Utah be

06:20.266 --> 06:21.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
downsized.

06:21.666 --> 06:24.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It now covers 1.3 million acres.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump has said
the protective designations
amount to -- quote --
"a massive federal land

06:29.300 --> 06:30.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grab."

06:30.733 --> 06:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
