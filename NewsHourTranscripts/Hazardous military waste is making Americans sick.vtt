WHAT'S DEFINED AS HAZARDOUS

01:00.960 --> 01:04.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASTE.

01:04.664 --> 01:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BURNING OF HAZARDOUS WASTE BACK

01:08.468 --> 01:09.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE 1980s.

01:09.102 --> 01:09.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, 30 YEARS OR SO YEARS AGO.

01:09.803 --> 01:10.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPLOSIVES WERE ADMITTEDLY

01:10.937 --> 01:11.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFICULT TO DEAL WITH.

01:11.971 --> 01:13.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO AT THE TIME THEY CREATED A

01:13.673 --> 01:14.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE BIT OF A LOOPHOLE THAT

01:14.707 --> 01:16.576 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID THAT THE PENTAGON AND OTHER

01:16.576 --> 01:18.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIALIZED COMPANIES THAT DEAL

01:18.244 --> 01:19.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY IN EXPLOSIVES CAN CONTINUE

01:19.979 --> 01:21.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BURN THAT STUFF IF THAT'S THE

01:21.381 --> 01:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONLY WAY THEY CAN GET RID OF IT,

01:22.549 --> 01:23.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ONLY UNTIL THEY IMPROVE

01:23.950 --> 01:25.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TECHNOLOGY, FIGURE OUT A BETTER

01:25.218 --> 01:26.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY TO DEAL WITH IT, AT WHICH

01:26.686 --> 01:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POINT THEY WOULD BE REQUIRED BY

01:28.721 --> 01:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REGULATIONS TO MOVE TO THOSE

01:29.956 --> 01:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALTERNATIVES.

01:31.691 --> 01:32.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE NOW EXIST, THEY HAVE FOR A

01:32.959 --> 01:34.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG TIME, BUT THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:34.027 --> 01:35.495 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

01:35.495 --> 01:37.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON BURNING AS THEIR STANDBY

01:37.030 --> 01:38.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

01:39.099 --> 01:39.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THIS AROUND THE COUNTRY?

01:39.899 --> 01:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, YOU HAVE A MAP IN ONE

01:40.600 --> 01:41.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF YOUR STORIES.

01:41.067 --> 01:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THERE THAT ARE DOING THIS THAT

01:43.403 --> 01:45.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD BE OF CONCERN TO THE

NEIGHBORHOOD THAT THEY'RE IN?

01:47.307 --> 01:48.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO, WE OBTAINED A LIST THAT

01:48.475 --> 01:50.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD BEEN COMPILED INTERNALLY

01:50.376 --> 01:52.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN THE E.P.A., AND IT LISTED

01:52.178 --> 01:53.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST ABOUT 200 SITES.

01:58.318 --> 01:59.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT ALL OF THOSE ARE STILL

01:59.252 --> 02:00.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPERATING NOW.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE ABOUT 60 SITES STILL

02:01.654 --> 02:03.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPERATING NOW, ABOUT 51 OF WHICH

02:03.823 --> 02:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE OPERATED DIRECTLY BY THE

COMPANIES.

02:12.899 --> 02:14.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE SITES STILL TODAY BURN

02:14.667 --> 02:16.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYWHERE FROM A COUPLE HUNDRED

02:25.345 --> 02:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ADJACENT FARMS.

02:27.547 --> 02:28.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ARE THE KIND OF HEALTH

CONSEQUENCES THEY'RE HAVING?

02:30.483 --> 02:32.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WHAT THE DIRECT CONSEQUENCES ARE

02:33.920 --> 02:34.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE BURNING.

02:34.888 --> 02:36.189 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ANOTHER TOWN; AND IN OTHER

02:40.760 --> 02:42.562 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLACES, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO

02:42.562 --> 02:44.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPEAR TO HAVE UNUSUALLY HIGH

02:44.964 --> 02:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RATES OF ILLNESSES.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT'S

02:48.034 --> 02:49.135 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSING THOSE ILLNESSES.

02:49.135 --> 02:50.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE POLLUTION.

02:51.804 --> 02:52.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE OTHER HAND, IT'S WELL

02:52.705 --> 02:55.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOCUMENTED, AND DISCLOSED, THAT

02:55.008 --> 02:56.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS SUBSTANTIAL POLLUTION,

02:56.342 --> 02:58.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
