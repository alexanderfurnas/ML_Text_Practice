Judy Woodruff.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:08.508 --> 00:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We bring you the
"NewsHour"
tonight from the Quicken Loans
Arena in Cleveland,

00:11.945 --> 00:16.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Ohio, site of the 2016
Republican presidential
convention.

00:16.250 --> 00:20.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's day two of the
convention.
The theme of the night is jobs
and the economy.

00:20.587 --> 00:24.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we will explore Donald
Trump's controversial
plans on immigration.

00:24.925 --> 00:30.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus, part two of
our biography
series on Trump digs into his
real estate

00:30.697 --> 00:34.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
years. What does Trump's
business experience
say about his brand of politics?

00:35.068 --> 00:40.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR, Author, "The
Trumps": He began
"The Apprentice," and that
turned out to be

00:40.807 --> 00:47.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrific for him. It let him be
in American
living rooms every week being
the boss.

00:47.648 --> 00:51.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan
in Washington. Our Desperate
Journey series

00:51.585 --> 00:57.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tackles the deadly plight of
Libyan refugees
risking it all to escape
brutality and slavery.

00:57.357 --> 01:00.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ERNA RIJNIERSE, Doctors
Without Borders:
It's very easy to say these
people shouldn't

01:00.661 --> 01:05.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come. But these people who say
that have never
been in a position where they
have to flee.

01:05.699 --> 01:13.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: All that and more on
tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:13.473 --> 01:15.842 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:15.943 --> 01:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is the night
that Republicans
formally nominate Donald Trump
as their 2016

01:28.855 --> 01:33.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate for president. The
official roll
call of the states begins this
hour, but it

01:33.427 --> 01:39.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was overshadowed all day today
by uproar over
Melania Trump's speech last
night.

01:39.700 --> 01:43.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Correspondent John Yang reports
from Cleveland
on the events of day two.

01:43.370 --> 01:49.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I am officially running for
president of the

01:49.943 --> 01:56.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States, and we are going
to make our
country great again.

01:56.450 --> 02:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Thirteen months ago,
Donald Trump
launched a long-shot campaign
for the Republican

02:01.989 --> 02:07.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nomination. Tonight, at Quicken
Loans Arena,
the prize is his.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Campaign manager Paul Manafort:

02:09.830 --> 02:12.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT, Trump Convention
Manager: He's
excited about the fact that his
quest will

02:12.199 --> 02:16.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finally come to an end. And all
of you who
doubted that he could be
nominated will no

02:16.503 --> 02:20.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
longer be able to say, yes, but
maybe it won't
happen. It will have happened.

02:20.207 --> 02:24.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The convention is
also nominating
Trump's running mate, Indiana
Governor Mike

02:24.711 --> 02:26.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Pence.

02:26.546 --> 02:28.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R-IN), Vice
Presidential
Candidate: This is no ordinary
time in the

02:28.582 --> 02:33.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
life of our nation. The truth of
the matter
is, the agenda of Barack Obama
and Hillary

02:34.087 --> 02:39.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton has weakened America's
place in world
and stifled our nation's
economy.

02:40.027 --> 02:44.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: After the roll call,
the convention
gets down to the theme for the
night, make

02:44.731 --> 02:50.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America work again. A list of
speakers will
take aim at President Obama's
economic record,

02:51.004 --> 02:55.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
including House Speaker Paul
Ryan and Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

02:56.009 --> 03:00.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both leaders have endorsed
Trump, even as
they continue to criticize some
of his rhetoric.

03:00.981 --> 03:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The convention will also hear
from one-time
Trump rivals Ben Carson and
Chris Christie,

03:06.319 --> 03:12.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
both now campaign surrogates.
Away from the
convention hall, protests
continue, amid heavy

03:12.526 --> 03:14.327 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
security.

03:14.428 --> 03:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here on Cleveland's Public
Square, there's
a lot of emotion, both for and
against Donald

03:18.799 --> 03:24.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump. But it's mostly been
peaceful. Cleveland
police report only a very small
number of

03:24.571 --> 03:28.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arrests for they say are minor
issues.

03:29.042 --> 03:34.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, much of the focus was on
last night's
speech by Melania Trump. Two
passages were

03:34.681 --> 03:39.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strikingly similar to the speech
Michelle
Obama gave at the Democratic
Convention in

03:39.519 --> 03:41.421 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2008.

03:41.521 --> 03:45.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELANIA TRUMP, Wife of Donald
Trump: My parents
impressed on me the values that
you work hard

03:45.358 --> 03:51.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for what you want in life, that
your word
is your bond, and you do what
you say, and

03:51.932 --> 03:55.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
keep your promise, that you
treat people with
respect.

03:55.702 --> 04:02.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE OBAMA, First Lady:
Barack and I were
raised with so many of the same
values, like

04:02.576 --> 04:08.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you work hard for what you want
in life, that
your word is your bond, that you
do what you

04:08.181 --> 04:14.888 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say you're going to do, that you
treat people
with dignity and respect.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

04:16.823 --> 04:19.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Campaign manager
Manafort argued
it's all been blown out of
proportion.

04:19.759 --> 04:24.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT: We don't believe
there's anything
in that speech that doesn't
reflect her thinking.

04:24.931 --> 04:29.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that there are things
like care and
respect and compassion, you
know, you know

04:30.036 --> 04:31.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those are not extraordinary
words.

04:32.005 --> 04:35.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He suggested the
criticism was
prompted by Hillary Clinton, and
that she

04:35.609 --> 04:42.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tries to destroy women who
threaten her. Clinton
herself was campaigning in Las
Vegas today.

04:42.349 --> 04:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Last night in Cleveland was
surreal. I kept

04:48.955 --> 04:56.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thinking, what's this like? You
know, lots
of sound and fury, even a fog
machine, but

04:56.530 --> 05:02.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when you pulled back the
curtain, it was just
Donald Trump with nothing to
offer the American

05:02.802 --> 05:03.370 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:05.405 --> 05:08.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump stayed largely
out of sight.
He will appear in the convention
hall tonight

05:08.875 --> 05:12.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by satellite from New York,
introducing Senator
McConnell.

05:12.512 --> 05:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Cleveland.

05:16.650 --> 05:21.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And let's go down
to the convention
floor now.

05:22.055 --> 05:26.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NPR "Weekend Edition Sunday"
host Rachel Martin
will be with us this week and
next for our

05:26.826 --> 05:30.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
joint "PBS NewsHour"-NPR
coverage of the conventions.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rachel, what can we expect
tonight?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.634 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RACHEL MARTIN: Good evening,
Judy.

05:34.734 --> 05:38.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it has all been building up
to this moment
actually for the Republican
Party. After so

05:38.939 --> 05:45.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many months, it all gets down to
what is about
to happen, which is the final
roll call vote.

05:45.412 --> 05:50.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump's name has
officially been placed
into nomination. Senator Jeff
Sessions of

05:50.250 --> 05:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Alabama made that happen, and we
are expecting
the final roll call vote to
happen momentarily.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is when each state gets
their moment.

05:57.891 --> 06:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They send their representative
to the microphone
to declare their state's pick
for president.

06:02.996 --> 06:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That will put Donald Trump over
the edge;
1,237, 1,237 is the magic
number. We have

06:08.969 --> 06:12.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been hearing about that number,
of course,
for months. New York state is --
his home

06:12.806 --> 06:16.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
state is expected to send him
over that threshold.

06:16.643 --> 06:20.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, you have heard how
the Trump campaign
has established a theme for
every night. Tonight,

06:20.513 --> 06:24.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as we know, is make America work
again. We're
going to hear an awful lot about
the economy

06:25.085 --> 06:29.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and trade in particular. Donald
Trump has
made that a platform in his
campaign, speaking

06:29.522 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out against America's free trade
agreements.
We will hear about that.

06:32.592 --> 06:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are also going to hear from
some very important
establishment Republicans. Chris
Christie,

06:37.163 --> 06:42.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of course, will be speaking,
also Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell, who has
been a very

06:42.602 --> 06:49.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reluctant supporter of Donald
Trump, and,
of course, Speaker of the House
Paul Ryan,

06:49.109 --> 06:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also a reluctant supporter of
Donald Trump
who has been very critical of
him even recently.

06:50.443 --> 06:51.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

06:51.978 --> 06:56.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RACHEL MARTIN: As you can tell,
the excitement
building in the hall.

06:56.216 --> 07:00.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It will be up to those
Republicans to try
to bring this party together, a
party that

07:00.820 --> 07:06.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has been divided even in the
last few days
of this convention. That's what
coming up.

07:06.893 --> 07:11.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you, Rachel. A
lot of noise
going on around you, as they get
ready to

07:11.998 --> 07:16.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
nominate their candidate
tonight. Thanks.
We will talk to you later.

07:16.469 --> 07:20.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we turn to the battle for
the young voters,
an increasingly important
demographic that

07:20.640 --> 07:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both parties are relying on to
win in November.

07:24.010 --> 07:29.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins reports from
Cleveland here
on why millennial voters have
proved so difficult

07:29.516 --> 07:32.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Republicans to capture in
recent years.

07:32.419 --> 07:38.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Their
generation is poised
to become a major political
force. This year,

07:38.458 --> 07:44.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millennials, the group between
18 and 35 years
old, make up about a third of
all eligible

07:44.631 --> 07:46.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
voters.

07:46.566 --> 07:51.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's now the same percentage
as baby boomers.
A recent Harvard Institute of
Politics poll

07:51.171 --> 07:57.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
found young voters prefer
presumptive Democratic
presidential nominee Hillary
Clinton by a

07:57.277 --> 08:01.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nearly 2-1 margin over her
opponent, Republican
Donald Trump.

08:01.114 --> 08:03.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACE LAQUERRE, Student Delegate:
We're really
excited to show you around the
RNC this week.

08:03.983 --> 08:07.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Young
Republican delegates
are thinking about how to change
that.

08:07.854 --> 08:11.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACE LAQUERRE: I think the
Republican Party
does have an image with young
people. We need

08:11.291 --> 08:13.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to work on a number of things.

08:13.727 --> 08:17.464 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
LISA DESJARDINS:
Seventeen-year-old high school
student Jace Laquerre of Vermont
is one of

08:17.564 --> 08:22.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the youngest delegates here this
week. And
he has a message to GOP leaders
about his

08:22.469 --> 08:24.337 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
generation.

08:24.437 --> 08:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACE LAQUERRE: The top three
things that are
important to us is the economy.
We're pro-life

08:28.174 --> 08:32.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we want a more tolerant
party to the LGBT
community and other groups.

08:32.479 --> 08:37.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Social issues
like LGBT rights
are a key with younger voters.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rachel Hoff is an openly guy
delegate from
Washington, D.C.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL HOFF, District of
Columbia Delegate:
A majority of young Republicans
now support

08:43.556 --> 08:47.427 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
marriage equality; 60 percent of
the country
now supports marriage quality.

08:47.527 --> 08:52.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Hoff
unsuccessfully fought
at this convention to try to
soften the party's

08:52.198 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
platform.

08:54.134 --> 08:58.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RACHEL HOFF: Support for
allowing same-sex
couples the freedom to marry has
grown substantially

08:58.204 --> 08:59.539 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in our own party.

08:59.639 --> 09:01.908 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Instead, it
became more conservative.

09:02.008 --> 09:07.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RACHEL HOFF: The folks that
would still like
to deny same-sex marriage are
over-represented

09:07.180 --> 09:10.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the party's platform
committee, and in
some ways that committee is
actually out of

09:11.051 --> 09:12.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
step with the party as a whole.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it won't be long before a
majority of
the Republican Party as a whole
supports marriage

09:15.555 --> 09:17.390 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
equality.

09:17.490 --> 09:20.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Donald Trump
has talked more
recently about respecting gay
rights, even

09:20.560 --> 09:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as he sees gay marriage as a
state issue.

09:23.797 --> 09:28.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But for Jesse Purdon, a
34-year-old alternate
delegate from Florida, the party
needs to

09:28.735 --> 09:30.470 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
rethink immigration.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JESSE PURDON, Florida Alternate
Delegate:
Being a Latino in the Republican
Party isn't

09:34.274 --> 09:36.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the easiest thing in the world
this election
cycle.

09:36.276 --> 09:42.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, it's just honest.
Continually railing
on Mexico and saying all the
horrible things

09:42.949 --> 09:48.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we say about them is not
the type of
message that resonates, well,
not only with

09:48.421 --> 09:53.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mexicans, but the Latino
population in total,
because they feel they're all
being painted

09:53.960 --> 09:55.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with one broad brush.

09:55.762 --> 09:59.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republicans are
focusing
on social and digital media,
trying to reach

09:59.299 --> 10:03.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young people on the playing
field where they
spend the most time, but many
say that's not

10:03.870 --> 10:05.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enough.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.073 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANK LUNTZ, Founder, Luntz
Global: We're
not visual enough.

10:07.173 --> 10:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Frank Luntz is
a Republican
pollster, and he believes the
party has a

10:10.844 --> 10:12.645 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
messaging problem with young
voters.

10:12.745 --> 10:18.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANK LUNTZ: They reject,
frankly, Republicans
on social issues, they reject
Democrats on

10:19.085 --> 10:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economic issues, which is what
makes them
in play.

10:21.921 --> 10:27.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And it is the
economic issues
that make 30-year-old Nick Ochs
a decided

10:27.193 --> 10:28.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump fan.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK OCHS, Trump Volunteer:
Immediately, I
saw a plan to bring back a
manufacturing base

10:31.531 --> 10:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to America. And that's what the
economy needs
now.

10:34.567 --> 10:38.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM CARTER, Georgia
Delegate: I think
Donald Trump's message is
resonating so well

10:38.638 --> 10:42.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
because it's not what a
well-versed politician
would say.

10:42.609 --> 10:47.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: William Carter,
an 18-year-old
delegate from Georgia, believes
Donald Trump

10:47.113 --> 10:49.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is precisely the right candidate
for his generation.

10:49.782 --> 10:54.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM CARTER: He doesn't jump
around the
issues. And his avoidance of
jumping around

10:54.587 --> 10:58.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the issues and telling it like
it is, I think
that allows millennials to go,
wow, he really

10:58.491 --> 11:03.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understands what's going on and
he isn't afraid
to say what he wants to say in
order to get

11:03.196 --> 11:04.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the point across.

11:05.064 --> 11:07.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: A major
challenge for the
party is how to get more young
people on board

11:07.767 --> 11:09.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
during this and future
elections.

11:10.069 --> 11:14.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins
in Cleveland.

11:14.374 --> 11:22.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now we turn
our focus now
to a major tenet of Trump's
domestic policy,

11:22.115 --> 11:23.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
immigration.

11:24.050 --> 11:28.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a subject that's split
Republicans for
years. George W. Bush failed to
pass reform,

11:28.354 --> 11:34.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and there is a divide between
what he advocated
for and what's in Trump's
platform right now.

11:34.260 --> 11:39.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get two views, Republican
congressman Tom
Marino of Pennsylvania, and
Daniel Garza.

11:39.899 --> 11:44.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's the executive director of
The LIBRE Initiative.
That is the largest conservative
Hispanic

11:44.837 --> 11:46.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
political group in the country.

11:46.839 --> 11:48.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to both of you.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DANIEL GARZA, Executive
Director, The LIBRE
Initiative: Thank you.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
REP. TOM MARINO (R),
Pennsylvania: Thank you.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me start with
you, Congressman
Marino.

11:52.512 --> 11:55.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What most people know about
Donald Trump and
immigration is, he's going to
build a huge

11:55.481 --> 11:59.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wall that's going to run the
length of the
border with Mexico, and he's
going to deport

11:59.852 --> 12:05.291 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all 11 million illegal or
undocumented immigrants.
Is that pretty much all there
is?

12:05.391 --> 12:10.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TOM MARINO: No, it's not
all there is.
You know, as far as deporting 11
million people,

12:10.263 --> 12:14.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you have got to realize that the
numbers that
we're talking about, about half
-- or even

12:14.968 --> 12:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not half of those individuals
are on visas
that have expired.

12:18.371 --> 12:26.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's one good way that we
can address
the issue. Call those people in,
let's review

12:26.412 --> 12:30.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, where are you? What are you
doing? And
that's going to have a factor on
it. But do

12:30.483 --> 12:35.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we need a wall in between the
United States
and Mexico? Absolutely, we need
a wall. We

12:35.421 --> 12:39.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see what's coming into the
country. We see
how open the borders are.

12:39.225 --> 12:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the main point of a
problem, but we
need to have more security
there. We need

12:43.429 --> 12:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be screening people. Look, I
was a U.S.
attorney for years, and I worked
with Border

12:49.402 --> 12:52.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Patrol, I worked with the ICE
people.

12:52.372 --> 12:57.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm hearing now consistently
that they
can't detain people, they can't
stop people

12:57.977 --> 13:02.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from coming in. And we need to
be checking
anyone coming in this country.
We need to

13:02.949 --> 13:08.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
do a background check on
everyone. I don't
care what race they are, what
country they

13:08.221 --> 13:14.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come from. We have to be strong
on border
security. Terrorists are coming
into this

13:14.160 --> 13:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country. Look at the criminals
that have come
in and murdered people.

13:18.731 --> 13:22.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me give Daniel
Garza a chance
to respond, because you're in a
particularly

13:22.869 --> 13:27.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unique position, because you
represent a Latino,
Hispanic group -- Latino
conservative group,

13:27.507 --> 13:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you know that 84 percent of
Hispanics
are saying they're not so
pleased with the

13:31.377 --> 13:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Republican Party right now.

13:33.212 --> 13:36.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How do you bridge the gap
between what you
hear the congressman saying and
what you're

13:36.949 --> 13:38.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
saying to your constituency?

13:38.885 --> 13:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: Well, we will
continue to do
what we have always done, which
is to advance

13:41.187 --> 13:47.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ideas, policies that are going
to eliminate
barriers to opportunity, that
are going to

13:47.193 --> 13:49.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
increase educational
opportunities to folks.

13:49.595 --> 13:54.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, there is no secret that we
have made
very public our opposition to
Donald Trump's

13:54.801 --> 13:58.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stated positions on immigration.
We feel that
they are counterproductive, that
they would

13:58.638 --> 14:01.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interrupt our economy, and would
rip families
apart.

14:01.240 --> 14:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we want to see is some
alternative
policy position that is actually
more sensible,

14:06.312 --> 14:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is market-based and that
actually addresses
market forces, but also keeps
families together.

14:11.651 --> 14:16.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's important for us, because
a lot of
the children of the undocumented
folks are

14:16.522 --> 14:20.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizens, and I think we should
be working
towards policies that induce
family cohesion.

14:20.793 --> 14:25.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman
Marino, what about
that? Can there be some moderate
modification

14:25.932 --> 14:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what Donald Trump and you
believe to accommodate
the kinds of things...

14:29.435 --> 14:31.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:31.170 --> 14:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TOM MARINO: Well, there
always has to
be discussion and
opened-mindedness.

14:33.072 --> 14:37.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald will be opened-minded
about discussion.
But what do you tell the people?
I just was

14:37.310 --> 14:44.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a swearing-in in my state,
where there
were 35 people sworn in as
American citizens.

14:44.550 --> 14:49.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What do you tell those people
that wait in
line and have waited in line for
years? They

14:49.689 --> 14:53.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did it the legitimate way. They
did it the
legal way.

14:53.459 --> 14:59.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no -- we cannot and we
shouldn't accept
the fact that, because they're
here, that

14:59.599 --> 15:05.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
justifies the fact that we
should violate
the laws that we have in place.
And it's unfair

15:05.371 --> 15:09.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to anyone else who wants to come
into this
country legally. But we need to
work together

15:09.842 --> 15:11.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do this.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You talk about
working together.
Unity has been a theme of this
convention.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Daniel Garza -- and,
Congressman, I want you
weigh in on this -- how is it
possible? How

15:17.950 --> 15:19.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do you end up in the same place?

15:19.819 --> 15:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: The consensus is
what worries
me about Hillary Clinton, for
example, on

15:22.789 --> 15:24.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the issue of immigration.

15:24.557 --> 15:28.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is promising Latinos, if you
vote for
me, I will get you immigration
reform. What

15:29.028 --> 15:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she doesn't tell Latinos is, if
you vote for
me, I will give you immigration
reform, as

15:32.431 --> 15:33.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
long as I get everything I want.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, what about
your party?

15:35.635 --> 15:39.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL GARZA: You have a
Republican House
majority and a Republican Senate
majority.

15:39.705 --> 15:42.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You both have to come to the
middle. That
means either Donald Trump, who
has taken a

15:42.542 --> 15:47.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
harsh position, or Hillary
Clinton, who is
writing a check she cannot cash,
and she knows

15:47.313 --> 15:48.548 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

15:48.648 --> 15:50.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But where is that
middle ground,
Congressman?

15:50.483 --> 15:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TOM MARINO: That middle
ground comes
-- we don't know where it's at
this point.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: I could provide
it...

15:53.152 --> 15:54.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:54.954 --> 15:57.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TOM MARINO: But individuals
like you
and Donald Trump and myself and
other people

15:57.456 --> 16:02.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are working on this issue,
we need to
sit down in a room, check the
egos at the

16:02.461 --> 16:06.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
door, lock the door, and say
we're not coming
out of here until we get this
resolved.

16:06.632 --> 16:13.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to make promises -- look,
the Democrats
and Hillary Clinton are making
-- are promising

16:13.940 --> 16:15.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things that they can't produce,
they shouldn't
produce.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: They're pandering,
flat out.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
REP. TOM MARINO: They're
pandering.

16:18.511 --> 16:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also what they're doing is,
you think
they're really concerned about
having new

16:22.515 --> 16:28.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
immigrants come into this
country and become
Americans? No, because it's the
greatest voter

16:28.721 --> 16:31.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
registration scam that you would
ever see.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.526 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what's the
holdup, then?
Is that the holdup?

16:33.626 --> 16:37.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: Well, what you
have is, on the
one side, you have a fixed
position of immediate

16:37.530 --> 16:42.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizenship. On the other side,
you have the
concern that you have to address
market forces.

16:42.101 --> 16:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what we're saying, OK, if we
cannot achieve
the optimum, ideal situation of
a path to

16:47.006 --> 16:51.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
citizenship, then what is the
next best thing
that's acceptable? And for us,
individual

16:51.611 --> 16:56.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sovereignty is important. And
that means that
a work visa bill that would
include circularity,

16:56.749 --> 17:00.586 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
job mobility, family
unification, and, if
you're not going to be
advantaged to get in

17:00.686 --> 17:03.055 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
front of the line, at least
you're not disadvantaged
by getting in back of the line.

17:03.155 --> 17:04.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:05.091 --> 17:06.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It sounds like a
priority question,
though. Is it securing borders
which is the

17:07.093 --> 17:08.861 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most important part or this idea
about work...

17:08.961 --> 17:10.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:10.496 --> 17:11.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: I don't want
securing borders
to hold up the other pieces.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what about
that?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)
REP. TOM MARINO: I have many,
many hardworking
Hispanics in my district.

17:17.036 --> 17:21.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have a very agricultural
district. They
come in on the visa program. We
should make

17:21.507 --> 17:24.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it simpler for them to come in
on a visa program.

17:24.944 --> 17:26.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL GARZA: Yes.

17:26.746 --> 17:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TOM MARINO: They pick
crops. They work
in our hotels. They send money
back. They

17:29.782 --> 17:32.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pay taxes. They send money back
home. Sometimes,
they go back home, then they
come seasonally.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.887 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: Like my parents,
who were farmworkers.

17:34.987 --> 17:36.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REP. TOM MARINO: Exactly.

17:36.856 --> 17:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my grandparents came into
the country
the legal way. But we have an
issue here,

17:41.761 --> 17:46.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where both sides just are not
listening to
each other. There are promises.
There are

17:47.066 --> 17:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pandering. The pandering is
making it extremely
difficult. Donald has changed
his position.

17:51.637 --> 17:56.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just like -- he says, yes, we
need to review
this process but we first...

17:56.676 --> 17:58.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:58.611 --> 18:02.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: The last thing
that was similar
to what Donald Trump is
proposing is Proposition

18:02.615 --> 18:04.383 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
187.

18:04.483 --> 18:06.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will remind you that, in 1990,
Republicans
lost a governor position in
California by

18:06.152 --> 18:12.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
six points. By 1994, they lost
it by 46 points,
and 61 points four years later.

18:12.525 --> 18:15.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And why isn't
that a lesson
for Donald Trump?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.596 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
REP. TOM MARINO: It's not a
lesson.

18:17.697 --> 18:22.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What it is, is an example of how
the Democrats
have been pandering, pandering
to the Hispanics

18:22.368 --> 18:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about how to get into this
country and not
follow the law.

18:25.805 --> 18:33.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let me come back here a little
bit. All three,
Obama, Bush and Clinton, should
have dealt

18:33.245 --> 18:34.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with these issues, and they
haven't.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

18:36.616 --> 18:38.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I guess my question,
though, is,
we're at the Republican National
Convention.

18:38.417 --> 18:41.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would really like to hear
how you're
going to deal with these issues,
not spend

18:41.620 --> 18:44.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of time talking about what
is going
to happen -- what the other guys
are going

18:44.357 --> 18:45.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do. They will have their
opportunity next
week.

18:46.092 --> 18:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL GARZA: That's been my
concern with
the Trump candidacy, that we get
a lot of

18:48.694 --> 18:54.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
10,000-foot-level kind of
rhetoric, but we
never get specifics on issues
like taxes and

18:54.567 --> 18:59.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulations on school choice, on
eminent domain,
on many issues that matter to
Latinos, the

18:59.939 --> 19:03.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
economy, education, health care,
the security
of the country.

19:03.409 --> 19:07.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want specifics, so I can have
the certainty
of who I'm voting for. I haven't
heard...

19:07.380 --> 19:08.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One final word,
quick.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REP. TOM MARINO: OK.

19:10.516 --> 19:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Talk about specifics. What we
need to do is
-- we can't do comprehensive.
This is too

19:14.186 --> 19:19.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complicated. We sit down and we
list the most
important issues from one to 10,
and we start

19:19.358 --> 19:20.593 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ticking them off one by one.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL GARZA: Love it.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. TOM MARINO: And by the time
we get to
10, we're going to have the
problem resolved.

19:24.463 --> 19:26.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Congressman Tom
Marino, thank
you.

19:26.232 --> 19:26.799 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Daniel Garza, we thank you both.

19:26.899 --> 19:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL GARZA: Pleasure.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you both very
much.

19:30.603 --> 19:35.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, however, we continue
our series exploring
Donald Trump's life, his
transformation from

19:35.708 --> 19:41.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a borough kid in Queens to a
presidential
contender who has taken the
party by storm.

19:41.180 --> 19:46.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this second installment, we
look at the
rise of the Trump brand, the
boom, the bankruptcies,

19:46.752 --> 19:52.324 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and his celebrity reemergence.

19:52.425 --> 19:57.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Long before his name became a
household one,
Donald Trump, fresh out of
business school,

19:57.897 --> 20:03.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was already drawn to Manhattan's
flashiest
lights, those on the Great White
Way.

20:03.102 --> 20:07.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL D'ANTONIO, Trump
Biographer: He was
always intrigued by performance,
and the very

20:07.606 --> 20:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first business activity he
really got involved
with was the production of a
Broadway play.

20:12.678 --> 20:18.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: That's author
Michael D'Antonio.
The play, which Trump backed in
1970, was

20:18.451 --> 20:23.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"Paris Is Out." But the
theatrical venture
closed almost as quickly as it
opened, so

20:23.989 --> 20:25.758 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump retreated to his roots.

20:25.858 --> 20:30.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL D'ANTONIO: When he
eventually turned
toward the family business in
real estate

20:30.996 --> 20:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the early 1970s, he was
determined to use
celebrity to help build the
business. And

20:38.137 --> 20:43.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think he understood that you
could be a
real estate developer in
Manhattan and also

20:44.043 --> 20:45.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be famous.

20:46.011 --> 20:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Enter Donald Trump,
the builder:
cushioned against risk by his
father's wealth

20:49.815 --> 20:55.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and political connections, yet
still longing
for a piece of Manhattan
glamour.

20:55.421 --> 20:57.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Writer Gwenda Blair:

20:57.323 --> 21:00.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR, Author, "The
Trumps": When Donald
came to Manhattan in the
mid-'70s, New York

21:01.060 --> 21:06.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
City was in terrible financial
straits, on
the verge of bankruptcy. The
people who dealt

21:06.765 --> 21:13.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with him in those early days
said he just
jumped through the phone. He was
so competitive,

21:13.305 --> 21:20.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so ambitious, so eager, that he
just jumped
into the spotlight. Every
possibility to get

21:20.146 --> 21:22.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
any kind of attention, he went
for it.

21:22.348 --> 21:27.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: His first major
project was the
old Commodore Hotel, a crumbling
eyesore in

21:27.586 --> 21:31.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the heart of the city that sat
abandoned next
to Grand Central Station.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Author Timothy O'Brien:

21:33.492 --> 21:37.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN, Author,
"TrumpNation": He
partnered on it with the
Pritzker family that

21:37.429 --> 21:42.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
owned the Hyatt hotel chain. The
Grand Hyatt
was really Donald Trump coming
onto the scene

21:42.368 --> 21:45.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in New York, and Donald Trump
first coming
into the public eye.

21:45.738 --> 21:53.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR: This was shiny,
glass, lots
of brass, stuck out in the
middle of Manhattan.

21:53.279 --> 21:59.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this began his whole career
of exaggeration,
truthful hyperbole, as he calls
it, in which

21:59.818 --> 22:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
everything he does is the best,
the best of
the best, the biggest of the
biggest.

22:04.023 --> 22:09.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Before the project
was even completed,
The New York Times was already
branding Trump

22:09.261 --> 22:15.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York's number one real
estate promoter,
describing him in one profile as
tall, lean

22:15.100 --> 22:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and blond, and resembling Robert
Redford.

22:18.704 --> 22:24.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He rapidly climbed New York's
social ladder,
becoming a regular in its most
exclusive clubs,

22:24.176 --> 22:31.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hobnobbing with movie stars and
models, like
Ivana Zelnickova, who he married
in 1977.

22:31.383 --> 22:37.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL D'ANTONIO: This was his
ambition,
to find just the right beautiful
young woman

22:38.057 --> 22:44.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who would fill out the picture
of the successful
man on the rise. He followed her
back to Canada,

22:44.997 --> 22:51.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where she lived, and courted her
pretty avidly.
And before you know it, Ivana is
being presented

22:51.837 --> 22:58.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a prenuptial agreement that
will set
the parameters for her marriage
to Donald

22:58.244 --> 23:00.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and her partnership with him.

23:00.346 --> 23:05.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But controversy
followed Trump
wherever he went, including
public outcry

23:05.517 --> 23:11.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over what was to become his
signature property,
Fifth Avenue's Trump Tower. The
old building

23:11.590 --> 23:17.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
facade had historic limestone
friezes that
the Metropolitan Museum of Art
wanted to preserve,

23:18.097 --> 23:19.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but that would've added time to
the project.

23:20.099 --> 23:26.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN: Donald is a
notoriously impatient
person, and so, in the dead of
night one night,

23:26.205 --> 23:34.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he brought in a team of illegal
Polish migrant
workers, who sledgehammered the
friezes into

23:34.947 --> 23:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dust and took them down. So,
embedded in this
triumph that is Trump Tower is
also this early

23:41.120 --> 23:45.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
warning sign that you have
someone who doesn't
really play well with the other
children,

23:45.524 --> 23:51.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and is willing to literally
pound something
into dust to get his own way.

23:51.764 --> 23:55.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As banks continued
to open their
coffers with loans, he went on a
shopping

23:56.035 --> 23:57.870 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
spree.

23:57.970 --> 24:02.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIMOTHY O'BRIEN: He used this
gigantic free
piggy bank, essentially, to buy
an airline,

24:02.107 --> 24:10.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump Shuttle, to buy a
hotel, the Plaza
Hotel, to buy a football team,
the USFL Generals.

24:10.182 --> 24:14.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, when he goes into
Atlantic City,
he ultimately acquires a whole
string of casinos

24:14.820 --> 24:16.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there, using borrowed money as
well.

24:16.722 --> 24:21.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Those casinos, and
many of his
other businesses, closed one by
one, often

24:21.493 --> 24:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
amid bankruptcy claims and
unpaid debt.

24:25.531 --> 24:31.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In 1989, Trump played a
controversial role
in one of the decade's most
notorious crime

24:31.770 --> 24:37.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases, when five black teenagers
were accused
of attacking a white female
jogger in Central

24:37.543 --> 24:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Park. Trump stirred what quickly
became a
boiling pot over criminal
justice and race,

24:43.349 --> 24:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weighing on in the pages of The
New York Daily
News.

24:45.751 --> 24:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR: The case of the
Central Park
jogger, he took out a full-page
ad demanding

24:50.389 --> 24:56.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that whoever did this should be
sent to the
death chamber, the kids who were
arrested,

24:56.795 --> 24:59.498 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and later exonerated, by the
way.

24:59.598 --> 25:05.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: None of this slowed
Trump's rise.
In fact, the New York tabloids
thrived on

25:05.137 --> 25:11.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his exploits, breathlessly
tracking his marriages
to Ivana and Marla Maples, his
divorces from

25:11.710 --> 25:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
both, and now, his third and
current marriage
to Melania Trump. Then, in 2004:

25:15.214 --> 25:17.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
You're fired.

25:17.149 --> 25:25.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Trump brand
found its ideal
niche, in a wildly popular
prime-time program

25:25.657 --> 25:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that celebrated everything he
had come to
represent.

25:28.494 --> 25:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm looking for
the apprentice.

25:31.096 --> 25:35.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Wealth, celebrity,
business success
and toughness.

25:35.667 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWENDA BLAIR: He began "The
Apprentice," and
that turned out to be terrific
for him.

25:42.941 --> 25:49.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It let him be in American living
rooms every
week being the boss, being the
guy in charge,

25:49.815 --> 25:55.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being the guy who hires people
and fires people.
When he first started that, was
he thinking,

25:56.054 --> 26:02.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aha, straight off to the White
House? We can't
say. But, certainly, 10 years
in, that whole

26:02.428 --> 26:09.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decade of people seeing him as
the boss, as
the CEO, has certainly made the
idea of his

26:09.802 --> 26:12.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moving into the Oval Office seem
a matter
of course.

26:12.404 --> 26:17.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From the corner
office to the
Oval Office suddenly didn't seem
that far

26:18.043 --> 26:19.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a leap.

26:20.045 --> 26:27.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And part of a
fascinating series
of looks at the life of Donald
Trump.

26:27.619 --> 26:31.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Happening right now on the
convention floor,
the delegates are taking the
roll call state

26:31.723 --> 26:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by state, casting their votes to
formally
nominate Donald Trump as the
Republican candidate

26:36.528 --> 26:37.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for president.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our Lisa Desjardins is down
there.

26:39.998 --> 26:45.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, we heard a few mild boos a
minute ago.
What was that all about?

26:45.604 --> 26:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.
What those boos are, Judy and
Gwen, are the
cracks in the Republican surface
coming to

26:48.707 --> 26:54.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bear. Some of these states have
divided delegations,
Judy and Gwen. And some of them
are voting

26:54.413 --> 26:56.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not majority for Trump.

26:56.615 --> 27:02.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other delegations say they're
not able to
cast their votes the way they
want. You might

27:02.721 --> 27:07.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have a delegation where the
primary went overwhelmingly
for Donald Trump, but a delegate
in their

27:07.793 --> 27:11.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own heart says, I don't want
support Donald
Trump, and they're trying to
vote a different

27:11.830 --> 27:13.599 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

27:13.699 --> 27:16.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that fracture is coming to
surface, as
some of these delegates are
trying to object

27:16.869 --> 27:21.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the way this roll call is
being handled.
I will also say, even though
those boos were

27:21.507 --> 27:24.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allowed, it's a minority so far
of the delegates,
but it's very significant.

27:25.077 --> 27:30.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Lisa,
I was reading
a little bit of the noise from
Ohio and a

27:30.215 --> 27:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little bit from Colorado. We can
explore that
as the night goes on.

27:34.620 --> 27:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, we want to bring
in our regulars
who are joining us every night
here at the

27:39.725 --> 27:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
convention, Mark Shields, who is
a syndicated
columnist and also with the
"NewsHour," David

27:41.527 --> 27:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brooks, columnist with The New
York Times,
Amy Walter of The Cook Political
Report.

27:49.535 --> 27:55.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To all three of you, we're
waiting for Donald
Trump to be nominated, but today
has been

27:55.440 --> 28:00.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pretty much consumed with a lot
of conversation
about what his wife said in her
speech last

28:00.345 --> 28:05.617 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night and whether there was any
similarity
with the speech given by
Michelle Obama in

28:05.717 --> 28:07.252 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2008.

28:07.352 --> 28:11.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, is this something that is
going to
put a blemish on the whole
affair?

28:11.690 --> 28:15.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think so.
It was plagiarism.
I thought it was pretty clear.

28:15.460 --> 28:20.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it says a couple things.
First, the
staff is not that good. This is
an outsider

28:20.365 --> 28:24.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign. They haven't hired the
best people,
the professionals, and so that
showed. Whoever

28:24.102 --> 28:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
did it, it was a big mess-up
that no professional
would do.

28:28.807 --> 28:33.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second, they couldn't admit it.
They couldn't
just say, OK, we messed up,
we're firing somebody,

28:33.412 --> 28:36.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we admit it, we're moving on,
because that's
not Donald Trump's persona.

28:36.982 --> 28:41.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, third, I have a feeling
that the shoe
is yet to drop, that somewhere
in this country,

28:41.853 --> 28:45.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is sitting there,
wanting to
defend his wife's honor, wanting
-- getting

28:45.257 --> 28:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mad because people are attacking
his family,
and, somehow, he is going to
riff on this.

28:49.995 --> 28:53.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it might be Thursday night
in the hall
or it might be somewhere else,
but there will

28:53.532 --> 28:56.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be another little mini-bomb,
when Donald Trump
reacts.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Late last night, we
were sitting
around here at this table and we
were talking

28:59.671 --> 29:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about missed opportunities on
the opening
day of the convention.

29:03.208 --> 29:04.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is this another one, Amy?

29:04.376 --> 29:06.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Absolutely.

29:06.311 --> 29:11.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we talked yesterday about
the unity, and
we were talking to Lisa
Desjardins right now

29:11.416 --> 29:13.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about, is this party unified?

29:13.251 --> 29:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, we're having an
instance where
the campaign isn't even unified.
Part of the

29:19.057 --> 29:25.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem with the speech and the
reaction to
the speech was that the campaign
started pointing

29:25.664 --> 29:31.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fingers at each other. And it
became a circular
firing squad. This is the thing
that David

29:31.970 --> 29:33.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is talking about.

29:33.905 --> 29:35.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In professional campaigns, this
is not supposed
to happen. So it is one more
example of a

29:35.907 --> 29:42.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign that is yet to get on
message. They're
going to get their take two on
unity tonight,

29:42.614 --> 29:44.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but they still have not nailed
that down.

29:44.416 --> 29:46.318 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark, how do you
see this?

29:46.418 --> 29:50.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, what happens
at conventions,
historically, Republican and
Democratic, nobody

29:50.922 --> 29:55.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
speaks a word that hasn't been
vetted and
hasn't been re-vetted.

29:55.494 --> 30:00.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It isn't spontaneous. You don't
get up there
and chat. This should have been,
and it wasn't.

30:00.565 --> 30:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this was the introduction of
the candidate's
wife, who is not a public
person, who made

30:06.138 --> 30:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a positive contribution, who was
quite appealing.
And it turns out that she's --
and said she

30:12.878 --> 30:14.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had written the speech herself.

30:15.080 --> 30:21.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it turns out that large
segments and large
paragraphs borrowed directly
from Michelle

30:21.820 --> 30:28.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama's 2008 speech. And you're
right. Somebody
has to go. But Donald Trump has
never admitted.

30:28.360 --> 30:33.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He refused last week to admit it
was a mistake
to say that John McCain wasn't a
hero.

30:33.598 --> 30:39.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Here we are the
night of the big
nomination, when usually it's
just our candidate

30:39.438 --> 30:42.407 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is so fabulous. There is nothing
that could
possibly go wrong.

30:42.507 --> 30:46.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, instead, we have mild boos.
We have people
who still feel like they have
been shut out

30:46.278 --> 30:50.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the process. Is that where
this party is
now, or are we just looking at
something that

30:51.083 --> 30:52.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is going to blow over?

30:52.951 --> 30:56.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: That is the
definition of this
party right now. It is not a
unified party.

30:56.421 --> 30:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, the only thing that is
unifying this
party -- and you're going to
hear it, I think,

30:59.958 --> 31:04.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
again tonight -- we heard it
yesterday -- is
deep dislike of Hillary Clinton.
Take that

31:04.730 --> 31:12.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
away, and on policy, on
strategy, on direction
for the country, this is a party
that is just

31:12.938 --> 31:14.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
literally splintered.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I guess that
raises the
question, David, is that going
to be enough?

31:16.975 --> 31:21.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We certainly heard over-the-top
language about
Hillary Clinton, she should be
in prison and

31:21.646 --> 31:24.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot other tough words about
her. Is that
going to be enough?

31:24.449 --> 31:25.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: To unify the
party?

31:25.984 --> 31:26.685 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To unify the
party.

31:26.785 --> 31:28.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: I don't think so.

31:28.787 --> 31:31.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have got to remember how
many people are
not here. It's really striking.
You hang around

31:31.223 --> 31:34.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the press areas at these
conventions, there's
usually a lot of people to
schmooze with who

31:34.226 --> 31:37.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are, like, at the Republican
Conventions every
year -- or every four years --
and you see

31:37.996 --> 31:39.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
them and you get some
information from them.

31:39.965 --> 31:43.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The hallways are sort of empty,
because those
people are not here. Second, a
lot of people

31:43.301 --> 31:47.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not in the hall. I had
coffee with a delegate
today who sort of had his
credentials sort

31:47.372 --> 31:51.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of ripped away. And so that's --
a little
of that is happening. And...

31:51.443 --> 31:53.278 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why were his
credentials taken
away?

31:53.378 --> 31:58.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he said some
unfortunate
things in the press, I guess.
And so that

31:58.383 --> 32:00.252 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sort of thing is happening.

32:00.352 --> 32:04.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then so there is still a lot
of people
-- you know, President Bush
apparently, reportedly,

32:04.523 --> 32:07.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wondering whether he will be the
last Republican
president. So, that stuff is
happening in

32:07.826 --> 32:09.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the party.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You know what? If
they start taking
away credentials, David, from
people who have

32:12.964 --> 32:16.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said unfortunate things in the
press, we will
be keeping an eye on you.

32:16.401 --> 32:16.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

32:16.968 --> 32:17.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

32:18.069 --> 32:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will watching you
very carefully.

32:20.005 --> 32:23.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Mark Shields, is there
where we are now?
And is there a way for the GOP
to reposition

32:23.441 --> 32:28.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
itself? We saw the governor of
Ohio is off
worrying about down-ballot
races, as are so

32:28.480 --> 32:30.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many other Republicans. Is that
the salvation?

32:30.982 --> 32:32.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

32:32.751 --> 32:37.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
No, obviously, and Mitch
McConnell is here
tonight, who has spoken openly,
and not a

32:38.023 --> 32:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man known for speaking openly,
about his serious
problems with Donald Trump, and
Donald Trump's

32:43.862 --> 32:50.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slurring of large groups of
people, and his
insulting of his opponents, his
defeated opponents.

32:50.602 --> 32:55.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what Mitch McConnell
is all about,
is preserving the Senate
majority and hoping

32:55.340 --> 33:01.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desperately for ticket-splitting
to reemerge.
I think that -- I think the
delegate thing

33:01.513 --> 33:05.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is quite overstated. I will be
honest with
you. I have great respect for
Lisa, but the

33:06.084 --> 33:13.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reality is delegates lost their
standing and
conventions lost their standing
in 1972.

33:13.258 --> 33:19.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's when we went to direct
primary election
-- nomination of presidential
candidates.

33:20.065 --> 33:27.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump won 3,700. He is
the nominee.
He is the commanding figure in
this party.

33:27.472 --> 33:32.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, someone can stand up and
say, I object.
Fine. God bless them. But the
reality is,

33:32.611 --> 33:34.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he really did win a compelling
victory.

33:34.713 --> 33:40.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You could get in a car in
Concord, New Hampshire,
and drive all the way to
Shreveport, Louisiana,

33:40.185 --> 33:42.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and never go through a state
that Donald Trump
didn't carry.

33:42.921 --> 33:46.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, he may be
the commanding
figure, but there clearly are
clearly elements

33:46.758 --> 33:50.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the party, which is what
we're talking
about here, who are not happy
that he's the

33:50.428 --> 33:53.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
commanding figure. They don't
want him being
the face of the Republican
party.

33:53.832 --> 33:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: This is what is
going to be interesting
to watch for tonight.

33:56.234 --> 33:59.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have not only the Senate
majority leader,
but you have the speaker of the
House, Paul

33:59.871 --> 34:01.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ryan, coming up and speaking,
and Kevin McCarthy.

34:01.940 --> 34:03.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Who is the chairman
of the convention.

34:03.108 --> 34:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Who is the chairman
of the convention.

34:05.010 --> 34:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Kevin McCarthy, who is
second in command
in the House. They are all very
concerned

34:09.114 --> 34:14.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about what happens to
down-ballot races. Listening
to how they are going to thread
the needle,

34:14.886 --> 34:18.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as they have had to do
throughout this campaign,
between supporting the ticket,
wanting to

34:19.057 --> 34:23.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support their nominee, making
sure that turnout
doesn't go down, but also, as
Paul Ryan has

34:23.795 --> 34:28.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
talked about, allowing his
members to -- quote,
unquote -- "vote their
conscience."

34:28.199 --> 34:31.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they don't want to support
the person on
the top of the ticket, they
don't have to,

34:31.670 --> 34:33.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if they think it will help them.

34:33.538 --> 34:35.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I think every single
conversation
we have had with a Republican in
this booth,

34:35.907 --> 34:39.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when we ask them about the
issues, they have
always turned it back to talking
about Hillary

34:39.477 --> 34:39.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

34:40.045 --> 34:41.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

34:41.947 --> 34:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And that does seem
to be the most
persuasive argument, David, that
Republicans

34:45.951 --> 34:50.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this room have, which is, he
may not be
everything we want him to be, I
may not have

34:50.588 --> 34:55.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voted for him, I may not have
endorsed him
until last month, but we really,
really, really

34:55.327 --> 34:56.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can't have Hillary Clinton.

34:56.528 --> 34:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes. No, I think
that's part
of it.

34:58.363 --> 35:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's funny. In talking to --
when you run
into a senator or something in
the hallway

35:01.800 --> 35:06.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here and you ask them about
Trump, it's like
they want you to know they
really don't like

35:06.237 --> 35:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, so -- but they can't
really say it,
so they got this little dance
they do, this

35:09.207 --> 35:10.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
body language.

35:10.342 --> 35:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And these are the
ones who
are here.

35:11.609 --> 35:13.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

35:13.211 --> 35:15.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, exactly,
right, but sort
of a squirming little thing.

35:15.146 --> 35:15.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
But...

35:16.081 --> 35:17.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to see that
again.

35:17.882 --> 35:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And then the other
thing, the
Republicans here, and a lot of
people who

35:20.719 --> 35:22.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are Trump delegates, they're
party institutionalists.

35:22.620 --> 35:26.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They believe in this party. And
it would be
hard for them not to be
themselves and not

35:26.191 --> 35:27.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be loyal to it.

35:28.026 --> 35:29.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, we're going to
pick up where
we left off here, because
there's going to

35:29.194 --> 35:31.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be a lot to talk about tonight.

35:31.196 --> 35:36.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Stay with us, beginning at 8:00
p.m. Eastern
time, for our special NPR/"PBS
NewsHour" coverage

35:36.234 --> 35:39.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the Republican presidential
convention
here in Cleveland.

35:39.237 --> 35:43.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now we go back to hari in
Washington, D.C.,
at our headquarters for the
day's other news.

35:43.575 --> 35:47.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Obama spoke by
phone today with Turkish
President Recep Tayyip

35:47.946 --> 35:52.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan. The U.S. Justice and
State Departments
are reviewing Turkey's
extradition request

35:52.550 --> 35:57.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Fethullah Gulen, the man the
country says
is responsible for the attempted
coup last

35:57.188 --> 35:58.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
week.

35:59.090 --> 36:03.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And in its aftermath, the
crackdown has only
intensified, with thousands more
civil servants

36:03.428 --> 36:08.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suspended from their jobs today,
in addition
to the thousands already under
detention.

36:08.800 --> 36:12.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more, we're joined now from
Istanbul by
special correspondent Marcia
Biggs.

36:12.637 --> 36:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia, you're standing in front
what looks
like, what -- is this a
pro-Erdogan rally?

36:17.442 --> 36:19.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Indeed, Hari.

36:19.411 --> 36:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the largest protest of
the last five
days. The first night, as you
will remember,

36:25.417 --> 36:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Friday night, when the coup
was attempted,
President Erdogan called on his
people to

36:28.486 --> 36:32.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come down to the streets to save
democracy,
as he said, to protect him, to
protect the

36:32.991 --> 36:35.493 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
government, and this is the
fifth day.

36:35.593 --> 36:39.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People have come down in droves
every single
day. And this is by far the
largest. I would

36:40.031 --> 36:45.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say maybe 3,000 people are here
tonight. The
mood is one of nationalism, the
Turkish flags,

36:45.170 --> 36:47.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a lot of saving the fatherland.

36:47.305 --> 36:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What is very interesting is that
Erdogan sent
messages, text messages to his
people, to

36:51.142 --> 36:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the citizens of Turkey today,
saying, please
come down to the streets, as he
has every

36:58.183 --> 37:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
day, to save the fatherland, to
save democracy.
And out they have come.

37:02.220 --> 37:08.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Public transportation has been
free every
day. Indeed, I took the ferry
and I took a

37:08.193 --> 37:11.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tram today, paid no money, and
that is to
encourage people to come down
into the streets.

37:12.063 --> 37:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tell me about
the impact.
Is there an impact that you can
feel, though,

37:15.533 --> 37:19.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the people that you talk to can
feel about
all these detentions and
firings?

37:19.270 --> 37:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The crackdown over
the last
couple of days has been brutal,
as you mentioned,

37:24.242 --> 37:28.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
30,000 suspensions of various
ministries,
police and education.

37:28.746 --> 37:32.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the people who work in
the prime minister's
office, judges, prosecutors,
15,000, as you

37:32.684 --> 37:40.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
mentioned, members of the
Education Ministry;
1,500 deans were asked to
resign, and that's

37:40.291 --> 37:44.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in addition to the 1,000
civilians that were
arrested and the 6,000 soldiers
that were

37:44.229 --> 37:45.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
arrested.

37:46.097 --> 37:49.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's 50,000 people in this
country that
have been affected by this
crackdown, whether

37:49.701 --> 37:54.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's being fired, whether it's
being asked
to resign, whether it's being
detained. It's

37:54.205 --> 37:56.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
incredible.

37:56.174 --> 38:00.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, basically, the feeling that
I have gotten
from people is just get a
wait-and-see attitude.

38:00.945 --> 38:05.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a lot of fear for
those, anyone who
is opposed to Erdogan, of
course. It was also

38:06.017 --> 38:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
announced today that any media
organization
with any ties to Fethullah Gulen
could lose

38:12.790 --> 38:15.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their broadcasting rights if
they say anything
that's critical of the
government.

38:15.894 --> 38:20.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were a couple of arrests
for people
who put on social media
criticisms of President

38:20.665 --> 38:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Erdogan. So, there is a lot of
fear, not among
this crowd, of course, because
they are here

38:26.471 --> 38:29.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in support of their president,
but on the
other side, there's a lot of
fear and not

38:30.008 --> 38:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of talk, from what I have
heard, just
a lot of wait and see.

38:33.711 --> 38:35.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yes.

38:35.680 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All right, so tell us about a
little bit about
Fethullah Gulen. What do his
followers believe?

38:38.116 --> 38:43.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Well, Fethullah
Gulen is known
mostly for his network of
schools here in

38:43.121 --> 38:44.889 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Turkey.

38:44.989 --> 38:47.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and Erdogan were closely
allied, until
a couple of years ago, when
there was a very

38:47.725 --> 38:53.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bitter split over another case
against rogue
elements in the military, as
well as corruption

38:53.431 --> 38:56.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
charges. He's in self-imposed
exile, as you
know, in the United States.

38:56.734 --> 39:04.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But members of the police, of
education systems
here in Turkey are a product of
his schools.

39:04.409 --> 39:09.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Erdogan supporters believe
that it is
his followers that could create
this network

39:09.581 --> 39:11.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of conspiracy.

39:11.516 --> 39:14.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, are the
people behind
you concerned about some of the
nationalist

39:14.819 --> 39:18.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rhetoric that's coming up right
now? Erdogan
has said on TV in the past
couple of days

39:19.090 --> 39:23.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that he wants to reinstitute the
death penalty.
That has got consequences if
Turkey wants

39:23.261 --> 39:24.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be a part of the E.U.

39:24.562 --> 39:26.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: I would not say
that they're
concerned.

39:26.764 --> 39:32.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I would say that they are
repeating anything
and everything that he says.
Indeed, yesterday,

39:32.303 --> 39:39.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in this square, not with these
kinds of crowds,
but the same mood, you had
people hanging

39:39.744 --> 39:46.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and burning in effigy of Gulen
and shouting
very inflamed rhetoric about
bringing back

39:46.251 --> 39:48.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the death penalty.

39:48.186 --> 39:51.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, no, I do not believe, from
what I have
seen, that the people behind me
are concerned

39:51.122 --> 39:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about this. I would say that

HARI SREENIVASAN: Marcia Biggs
joining us
from Istanbul, thanks so much.

39:57.762 --> 39:59.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA BIGGS: Thank you.

HARI SREENIVASAN: And in other
news: The White
House released an open letter
from President

40:03.401 --> 40:08.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Obama to law enforcement
officers. In it,
he again condemned attacks on
police, and

40:08.172 --> 40:10.208 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said -- quote -- "We have your
backs."

40:10.308 --> 40:13.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He echoed that message today
after a briefing
with FBI Director James Comey
and Attorney

40:13.911 --> 40:15.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
General Loretta Lynch, among
others.

40:15.847 --> 40:18.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I strong believe that there's no
contradiction

40:18.816 --> 40:26.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
between us protecting our
officers, honoring
our officers, making sure that
they have all

40:26.491 --> 40:34.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tools that they need to do
their jobs
safely, and building trust
between police

40:34.432 --> 40:37.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officers and departments and the
communities
that they serve.

40:37.568 --> 40:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Administration
officials
are also under pressure to
illuminate the

40:41.272 --> 40:44.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House in blue light to
honor police
officers.

40:44.142 --> 40:47.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a policeman was
killed in Kansas
City, Kansas, today. Officials
say he was

40:47.712 --> 40:51.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gunned down as he approached
possible suspects
in an earlier shooting.

40:51.716 --> 40:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's word that American-led
airstrikes
in Northern Syria killed scores
of civilians

40:56.721 --> 41:01.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. Opposition activists say
at least 56
died in air raids aimed at
Islamic State forces.

41:02.060 --> 41:06.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They pounded villages near the
ISIS stronghold
of Manbij. In addition to the
dead, dozens

41:06.964 --> 41:11.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were wounded. A news agency
linked to the
militants said the death toll
was closer to

41:11.436 --> 41:13.204 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
160.

41:13.304 --> 41:17.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS claimed responsibility
today for last
night's rampage on a train in
Germany. The

41:17.442 --> 41:22.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
group posted video of the
attacker, an Afghan
refugee vowing to take revenge
on infidels.

41:22.113 --> 41:26.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was killed by police near
Wurzburg after
slashing passengers.

41:26.250 --> 41:28.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rohit Kachroo of Independent
Television News
reports.

41:28.720 --> 41:34.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROHIT KACHROO: He calls himself
a soldier
of the caliphate and promises
attacks in every

41:34.525 --> 41:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
village and city, and with a
knife in his
hand, he says he's preparing for
a suicide

41:39.831 --> 41:46.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mission. It was a knife and an
axe that he
used to slash passengers on an
intercity train

41:46.504 --> 41:48.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
last night, shouting "God is
great."

41:48.806 --> 41:52.810 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GERHARD KALLERT, Regional Police
President
(through translator): We have
some very badly

41:52.910 --> 41:55.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
injured people, five in total.

41:55.480 --> 42:01.386 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROHIT KACHROO: And yet
intelligence services
have concluded there was no
evidence of direct

42:01.486 --> 42:04.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
contact between him and I.S.

42:04.956 --> 42:10.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The interior minister said a
text in Pashto
was found that was partly
written in Arabic

42:10.294 --> 42:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
characters, partly in Latin
characters, which
indicates that this could be
someone who was

42:15.700 --> 42:18.002 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
self-radicalized recently.

42:18.102 --> 42:25.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A jihadist made in his bedroom,
home alone,
they thought, he traveled to
Germany on his

42:25.410 --> 42:29.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own. This morning, an I.S. flag
was found
in his room.

42:29.680 --> 42:35.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This was his home until a
fortnight ago, at
an accomadation center where he
lived alongide

42:35.319 --> 42:42.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dozens of other refugees. What
counterterrorism
officers are here trying to
understand is,

42:42.427 --> 42:47.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what happened inside this place
and what happened
afterwards?

42:47.665 --> 42:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This attack has reignited old
debates here
about terrorism and about
migration. Hundreds

42:54.405 --> 42:59.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of thousands of people have made
a similar
journey as this attacker, only
one has chosen

42:59.911 --> 43:02.013 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his same path.

43:02.113 --> 43:06.684 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: German
officials say two
of the five wounded victims have
life-threatening

43:06.784 --> 43:08.619 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
injuries.

43:08.719 --> 43:13.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, longtime
FOX News chair
and CEO Roger Ailes is
reportedly on his way

43:13.758 --> 43:18.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out, in the face of sexual
harassment claims.
NPR reports he's being ousted,
and The New

43:18.729 --> 43:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York Times says buyout talks are
in the advanced
stages. The Daily Beast says he
will get at

43:23.768 --> 43:30.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
least a $40 million paycheck.
Former FOX anchor
Gretchen Carlson has sued Ailes,
alleging

43:30.241 --> 43:35.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he made advances and then fired
her when she
complained. Ailes denies it.

43:35.580 --> 43:39.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In economic news, the
International Monetary
Fund warned that Britain's
departure from

43:39.650 --> 43:45.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the European Union will cut into
global growth
this year and next. At the same
time, it said

43:45.456 --> 43:48.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S. and Chinese economies
won't sustain
much damage.

43:49.093 --> 43:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today, the
Dow Jones industrial
average gained 26 points to
close at 18559.

43:53.965 --> 43:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the Nasdaq fell 19 points,
and the S&amp;P
500 slipped three.

43:59.170 --> 44:04.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The International Organization
for Migration
reported today that almost 3,000
migrants

44:04.308 --> 44:09.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and refugees have drowned
attempting to cross
the Mediterranean Sea this year.
Most of these

44:09.580 --> 44:14.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
deaths have taken place on the
route linking
North Africa with Italy. And
among those who've

44:14.452 --> 44:20.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
survived the sea voyage, an
astonishing 92
percent of all migrants say they
have experienced

44:20.391 --> 44:26.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
violence; 50 percent say they
have been held
against their will by militia or
gangsters.

44:27.098 --> 44:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those figures come from surveys
done by Doctors
Without Borders, the
international medical

44:31.135 --> 44:38.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charity known by its French
acronym, MSF.
Just today, 2,500 more people
have been rescued.

44:38.209 --> 44:42.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Malcolm
Brabant is now
aboard an MSF rescue ship,
Aquarius, and he

44:42.280 --> 44:45.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
filed this report from off the
coast of Libya.

44:45.483 --> 44:51.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Nearly four
days after leaving
Sicily, the Aquarius is on
station in international

44:51.455 --> 44:57.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
waters, northeast of the Libyan
capital, Tripoli,
just outside that volatile
country's territorial

44:57.528 --> 44:59.263 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
limits.

44:59.363 --> 45:03.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After a recent surge of
migrants, it's all
quiet. But then, from the
bridge, they spot

45:03.901 --> 45:11.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an overcrowded, flimsy rubber
dinghy limping
towards Italy. The Aquarius
launches its rigid

45:11.876 --> 45:18.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inflatables, or ribs, as men on
board a Libyan
fishing boat observe
proceedings. One of the

45:18.783 --> 45:22.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ribs is carrying life jackets to
prevent drownings
during the rescue.

45:22.954 --> 45:24.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
First mate Andreas Tsigkanas:

45:24.855 --> 45:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREAS TSIGKANAS, First Mate:
They started
by distributing the life jackets
to the people

45:31.162 --> 45:38.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the boat. And as soon as all
the people
wear life jackets, they will
start embarkation

45:38.135 --> 45:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in one boat, around 18 people at
a time. The
other boat will stand by there
for safety

45:44.008 --> 45:45.309 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and to calm them down.

45:45.409 --> 45:50.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Aquarius, boat number one,
coming back
with 1-8 persons.

45:50.514 --> 45:53.584 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Copy, 1-9. Green light.
Over.

45:53.684 --> 45:59.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Every one of
the 107 West
African men is given a welcoming
health check

45:59.290 --> 46:03.594 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by MSF veteran Erna Rijnierse.

46:03.694 --> 46:12.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ERNA RIJNIERSE, Doctors
Without Borders:
We want to see everybody in
their eyes to

46:12.169 --> 46:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see how they are feeling, if
they are not
dehydrated, if they're not
having a fever.

46:17.742 --> 46:21.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I smell, if they don't smell
of fuel,
because the combination of fuel
and salty

46:21.879 --> 46:23.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
water makes very nasty burns.

46:23.881 --> 46:29.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if we smell fuel, we put
them under a
shower straight away and WE give
them clean

46:29.820 --> 46:30.921 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clothes.

46:31.022 --> 46:33.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark, this gentleman smells of
fuel. Jacob,
fuel.

46:33.591 --> 46:38.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: There is a vast
difference
between these migrants and those
who crossed

46:38.195 --> 46:43.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from Turkey to Greece. The Greek
arrivals
usually had a mobile phone, some
money, and

46:43.601 --> 46:48.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a bag. The Africans have
nothing, apart from
the clothes they're wearing.

46:48.172 --> 46:51.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Without exception, they have
been stripped
of possessions in Libya.

46:51.242 --> 46:53.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nurse Jacob Goldberg.

46:53.110 --> 46:57.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACOB GOLDBERG, Nurse: They are
often held
against their will in places
where they are

46:57.515 --> 47:01.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very cramped. They have things
taken away
from them. There are armed
guards. And any

47:02.053 --> 47:05.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possessions they do have get
taken away just
because they're not allowed to
have anything

47:05.256 --> 47:09.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on them. They don't have enough
food to eat,
or enough water to drink, enough
clean water

47:09.593 --> 47:14.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to drink, let alone have the
possibility to
have personal effects or
personal items.

47:14.699 --> 47:19.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, by the time they get to us
on the rubber
boats, they have got nothing,
and they're

47:19.470 --> 47:21.639 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
hungry and they're thirsty and
they're desperate.

47:21.739 --> 47:26.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Europe would
categorize most
of the Africans taking this
journey as economic

47:26.577 --> 47:31.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
migrants, because they
originally left home
with the intention of seeking
greater prosperity.

47:31.348 --> 47:36.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, once in Libya, they became
desperate
to flee the country's
lawlessness, false imprisonment,

47:37.054 --> 47:42.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what in some cases amounts
to slavery,
according to Ruby Pratka, of SOS
Mediterranee,

47:42.960 --> 47:47.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an NGO whose personnel operates
the rescue
ribs.

47:47.665 --> 47:50.768 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She says there is intense
suffering for tens
of thousands of these people.

47:50.868 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUBY PRATKA, SOS Mediterranee:
You have forced
extralegal confinement. You have
sexual assault.

47:58.209 --> 48:06.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have whippings. Many, many,
many of the
people I have spoken to Here
have said That

48:06.250 --> 48:08.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there's modern slavery in Libya.

48:08.285 --> 48:15.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They were systematically
kidnapped and subjected
to forced labor on farms, in
houses, on building

48:16.060 --> 48:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sites. They would work for long
periods, and
then get a gun held to their
head when they

48:22.066 --> 48:25.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
demanded their salary.

48:25.669 --> 48:34.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Below-decks, an
advocacy
specialist takes testimony from
three young

48:34.411 --> 48:39.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
French-speaking Africans. MSF
has interviewed
hundreds of people who have said
that Libyan

48:39.350 --> 48:44.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gangs use kidnapping and torture
as a way
to extort money from the
migrants' families,

48:44.588 --> 48:48.025 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
before forcing them into
unseaworthy vessels.

48:48.125 --> 48:52.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mohammed Kamara, from Ivory
Coast, says he
was falsely imprisoned four
times.

48:52.396 --> 48:56.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMMED KAMARA, Refugee
(through translator):
The first prison, I was banged
up for at least

48:56.901 --> 49:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three months. The second prison,
I have done
at least six months. In the
third, I also

49:01.205 --> 49:05.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
did a bit of time, and then
there was a fourth,
but I can't go into it in much
detail.

49:05.643 --> 49:09.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Libya is not a good country.
It's because
I wanted to come out of Libya
that I'm here

49:09.980 --> 49:14.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. I had the opportunity,
and that's why
I risked my life to be here
today.

49:14.351 --> 49:19.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Relieved that
they have been
saved from the deep, his friend
Mustafa Diaby

49:19.657 --> 49:23.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has a message for those people
back home who're
contemplating following in their
footsteps.

49:24.094 --> 49:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUSTAFA DIABY, Refugee (through
translator):
I have a big message. My message
is to stay

49:28.866 --> 49:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at home. And if you really want
to come to
Europe, save the money and fly.
Otherwise,

49:34.338 --> 49:38.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going through the desert and
ending up in
Libya is bad advice, my friends.

49:38.142 --> 49:43.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I even put it in my prayers. I
don't want
my own friends to take this
road. It's extremely

49:43.881 --> 49:48.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dangerous. When we crossed the
desert, there
were 24 passengers who didn't
make it.

49:49.053 --> 49:55.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: At the stern in
the middle
of the day, some of the vessel's
Muslim guests

49:55.526 --> 50:00.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
give thanks for their
deliverance. Their rescue
by the Aquarius guarantees them
passage to

50:00.531 --> 50:05.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Italy, although they will be
starting their
new lives with nothing, except
possibly a

50:05.169 --> 50:07.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
crippling debt to the smuggling
gangs.

50:07.705 --> 50:12.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're heading to a Europe that
is reluctant
to accept them, especially
politicians who

50:12.710 --> 50:17.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
believe that humanitarian
missions like this
are helping the traffickers to
profit.

50:17.848 --> 50:23.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. ERNA RIJNIERSE: People don't
make this
journey for fun. People make
this journey

50:23.320 --> 50:29.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is because they don't see any
other way out.
And as long as that situation
continues, people

50:29.460 --> 50:31.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will continue to come.

50:31.428 --> 50:37.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we are here at sea is
because people die
at sea. And it's very easy to
say, these people

50:37.401 --> 50:42.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shouldn't come. But these people
who say that
have never been in a position
where they have

50:42.673 --> 50:44.475 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to flee.

50:44.575 --> 50:53.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUBY PRATKA: I don't think any
rational person
would decide to cross the
Mediterranean Sea

50:53.951 --> 51:00.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in a boat that I wouldn't even
put on a nice
calm lake back in Canada, if
they felt they

51:00.658 --> 51:03.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
had any other safe alternative.

51:03.193 --> 51:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If, by calling us a taxi
service, they're
acknowledging that we pulled
people out of

51:09.333 --> 51:14.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the water who otherwise would
have drowned,
then we're happy to be a taxi
service.

51:14.138 --> 51:18.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: After about
three hours on
board the Aquarius, the Italian
authorities,

51:18.142 --> 51:22.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who are controlling the
operation in this
part of the Med, decide that the
migrants

51:22.479 --> 51:26.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
should be transferred to a coast
guard vessel
heading back to base.

51:26.250 --> 51:30.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What these people didn't know
was that the
weather had been about to change
for the worse

51:30.287 --> 51:33.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they were rescued by James
Mahoney and
his colleagues.

51:33.223 --> 51:37.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MAHONEY, SOS Mediterranee:
These guys
were very lucky, in the sense
that rescue

51:37.294 --> 51:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vessels were in the area. And if
they'd left
a little later, they may have
been caught

51:43.233 --> 51:48.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up in this weather, and the
outcome of the
operation would be a bit more
uncertain.

51:48.138 --> 51:51.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Despite the
risk of drowning,
the number of people prepared to
take a chance

51:51.141 --> 51:53.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
upon the waves is increasing.

51:53.344 --> 51:57.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So far this year, the number of
people who
have managed to get into Europe
is around

51:58.048 --> 52:03.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about a quarter-of-a-million,
many of taking
this extremely perilous route.
But one in

52:03.988 --> 52:08.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
100 of every one of those people
who have
attempted that crossing has
died. To date

52:08.926 --> 52:14.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2016, the numbers of deaths
at sea is up
by 50 percent on the same period
last year.

52:14.965 --> 52:19.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
According to the International
Organization
for Migration, that's 3,000
deaths too many,

52:19.803 --> 52:28.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and, it says, Europe has to do
more to save
lives.

52:28.245 --> 52:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As this rather undramatic, but
successful
operation reached its
conclusion, there remained

52:32.683 --> 52:37.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one last task, to mark and
puncture the thin
rubber dinghy to show that its
passengers

52:37.955 --> 52:42.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were safe and to deny smugglers
the chance
of recycling the craft.

52:42.126 --> 52:48.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fate had decreed that this
marble-colored
shape wouldn't mark yet another
watery mass

52:48.499 --> 52:49.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grave.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant
off the Libyan coast.

52:53.203 --> 52:58.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Malcolm is
still at sea
with MSF, and will have more
reporting for

52:58.108 --> 53:02.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us in the coming days on rescues
and recoveries
in the Mediterranean.

53:02.613 --> 53:05.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's it from Washington for
now. I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

53:05.783 --> 53:10.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And from here in
Cleveland, I'm
Gwen Ifill.

53:10.287 --> 53:12.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:12.222 --> 53:16.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But stay with us. We will be
right back here
at 8:00 p.m. Eastern for live
special coverage

53:16.827 --> 53:19.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Republican National
Convention.

53:19.296 --> 53:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy --
she's Gwen
Ifill. I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:23.767 --> 53:43.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for all of us at the "PBS
NewsHour," thank
you. And we will see you right
back here soon.
