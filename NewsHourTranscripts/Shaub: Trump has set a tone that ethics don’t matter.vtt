JUDY WOODRUFF: Earlier this
month, Walter Shaub resigned
as director of the federal

00:04.266 --> 00:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Office of Government
Ethics, a position he's
held since January 2013.

00:11.200 --> 00:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the final months of his
tenure, Shaub clashed with the
Trump administration on a number

00:14.566 --> 00:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of ethics issues.

00:16.466 --> 00:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Currently, he is senior
director of ethics for the
nonprofit Campaign Legal Center.

00:21.533 --> 00:22.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And Mr. Shaub joins me now.

00:22.733 --> 00:24.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thank you for being
here at the "NewsHour."

00:24.866 --> 00:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you had been -- you were
just telling me you had been
at the Office of Government

00:27.800 --> 00:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Ethics for, what, 15, 16 years?

00:29.833 --> 00:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALTER SHAUB, Campaign
Legal Center: Right.

00:31.666 --> 00:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Leading up
to your decision to resign.

00:34.233 --> 00:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You had another six months to
go as director of the office.

00:37.766 --> 00:39.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why leave?

00:39.000 --> 00:40.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why not stay until
the end, next January?

00:40.533 --> 00:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WALTER SHAUB: Well, first of
all, thanks for having me.

00:43.366 --> 00:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started at OGE in 2001 and
have served there continuously,
except for two years, when I

00:49.933 --> 00:52.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
left.

00:52.400 --> 00:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have seen OGE operate
under three different
presidential administrations
right now, including

00:57.900 --> 01:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the administrations of President
Bush and President Obama, who
were incredibly supportive

01:01.400 --> 01:04.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the ethics program.

01:04.066 --> 01:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both of those administrations
really supported OGE
in absolutely every
way they could, and

01:10.166 --> 01:12.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our work functioned
very smoothly.

01:12.800 --> 01:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In the past eight
months, we have departed
from ethical norms.

01:20.233 --> 01:22.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the program is under
significant pressure
from the White House
that has set a tone there

01:24.033 --> 01:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the top that ethics
doesn't matter.

01:26.133 --> 01:30.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I did all I could,
and I reached a point where
I thought there wasn't more I

01:30.566 --> 01:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
could achieve from inside.

01:32.533 --> 01:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, by leaving, I would
actually have more freedom to
continue to try to push for the

01:38.333 --> 01:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
restoration of our
ethics program.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you have
been speaking out since then.

01:42.366 --> 01:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Give us an example of the way or
ways that this administration,
as you say, was putting

01:46.733 --> 01:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stress on the ethics procedures.

01:49.400 --> 01:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER SHAUB: Well, in one
way, it really began with the
president declaring that he's

01:55.566 --> 01:58.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not going to divest his
financial interests.

01:58.233 --> 02:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that means there is a
cloud over all government
decision-making that
stems from the president,

02:04.833 --> 02:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because you can't know whether
his decisions are being made
on the basis of policy aims

02:09.666 --> 02:11.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or on the basis of
financial interests.

02:11.700 --> 02:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when he travels to all of
his properties on a frequent
basis, he's giving each of them

02:16.400 --> 02:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
free advertisements, and he
speaks freely about those.

02:20.033 --> 02:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He could have, instead,
divested his interests and
told his administration
to stay away there

02:24.866 --> 02:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his properties, which would
have kept some of the foreign
governments or charities or

02:31.866 --> 02:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
businesses that have booked his
business -- his properties to
be closer to the president not

02:36.533 --> 02:38.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do that.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think a lot of things happen
on a day-to-day basis as well.

02:42.933 --> 02:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I fought a battle that took
over a month to get them to
release some waivers that they

02:49.366 --> 02:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
had been issuing, and OGE's
collection of waivers...

02:51.600 --> 02:52.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To individuals.

02:52.866 --> 02:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALTER SHAUB: To
individual appointees.

02:54.866 --> 02:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And OGE's collection of waivers
and other ethics documents
has been a routine function

02:58.766 --> 03:01.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of OGE's program dating all
the way back to its beginning.

03:01.933 --> 03:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
OGE is by statute the
supervising Ethics Office.

03:06.200 --> 03:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I finally got the waivers,
I was shocked to see that a
number of them, most of them,

03:13.666 --> 03:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
actually, were unsigned,
undated, either explicitly
or implicitly retroactive,
and two of them

03:18.566 --> 03:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were issued by the counselor
of the president to a group of
people that included himself.

03:21.666 --> 03:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, that's about as bad an
ethics program as you can run.

03:24.700 --> 03:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, now you
know that -- what the White
House has been saying since you

03:28.066 --> 03:29.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
left your position.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They were criticizing
you before.

03:30.533 --> 03:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have been
criticizing since.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say you have been
talking to the news media.

03:34.400 --> 03:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I saw one quote where they
said you were "grandstanding,"
that you're trying to
give additional powers

03:42.700 --> 03:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the Ethics Office
that it never had before.

03:45.133 --> 03:49.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WALTER SHAUB: Well, I
do think that, based
on recent experiences,
the Ethics Office needs

03:49.733 --> 03:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more power than it's had before,
because its functions depended
on a White House that wanted

03:55.633 --> 03:57.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to support the ethics program.

03:57.700 --> 04:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when they threw roadblocks
in the way of the supervising
Ethics Office's ability

04:04.500 --> 04:08.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to again access to
routine ethics documents,
that was a clear signal
that OGE didn't have

04:09.366 --> 04:11.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough ability to
carry out its mission.

04:11.366 --> 04:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then very
recently, Walter Shaub, you
have spoken out about the person

04:15.100 --> 04:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who has been named the
acting director of the
Ethics Office since you left.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why the concern there?

04:21.733 --> 04:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER SHAUB: So, you know, I
want to make clear that I think
that individual, Dave Apol,

04:27.600 --> 04:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is a good person and
an excellent attorney.

04:30.966 --> 04:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I hired him because he has got
a particular viewpoint, which
is at odds with the traditional

04:37.933 --> 04:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interpretation of the ethics
role that OGE has always had,
because I wanted diversity

04:41.800 --> 04:43.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of opinion.

04:43.866 --> 04:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it worked well while I was
in charge because I had two see
senior officials who had very

04:47.733 --> 04:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
differing opinions, and we
could have robust debate.

04:51.233 --> 04:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Dave was always
very respectful when a
decision was finally made.

04:55.066 --> 05:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I am concerned that he has
a particular outlook, that he
would wind up loosening the

05:01.233 --> 05:03.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ethics rules and
OGE's interpretations.

05:03.233 --> 05:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, to be clear, I would have
no problem if they nominated
him, so the Senate could

05:07.400 --> 05:09.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vet these viewpoints.

05:09.833 --> 05:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that the
administration did
an end-run around the
natural succession of the

05:14.033 --> 05:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief of staff to appoint
one of her subordinates
as acting director in
order to avoid the Senate

05:21.433 --> 05:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
confirmation process and have
someone in the office who is
sympathetic to their views.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just
very quickly, in the
time that we have left,
you are trying now, as

05:30.733 --> 05:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we said, to beef up the
Office of Government Ethics.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're working with members
of Congress from both
political parties to do this.

05:38.033 --> 05:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just in a quick nutshell,
what do you think needs to
be done, needs to be added?

05:41.400 --> 05:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WALTER SHAUB: So, there's a
number of measures I'm proposing
to try to get OGE a little bit

05:45.500 --> 05:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more independence, including
the ability to gather records
and information, if necessary,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by issuing subpoenas.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also think that there's
a number of tweaks that can
be done to the ethics rules.

05:56.900 --> 06:01.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, ultimately, I would like
to see some accountability
for resolving presidential

06:01.500 --> 06:03.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conflicts of interest.

06:03.533 --> 06:07.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That last one might be a
tougher sell, but some of the
proposals are technical enough

06:07.066 --> 06:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they shouldn't
be controversial.

06:09.100 --> 06:12.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I hope
we can stay in touch with
you as you work on this.

06:12.800 --> 06:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Walter Shaub, the former
director of the office
of Government Ethics,
thank you very much.

06:16.433 --> 06:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WALTER SHAUB: Thanks
for having me.
