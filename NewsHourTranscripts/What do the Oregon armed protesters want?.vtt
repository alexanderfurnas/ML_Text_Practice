I feel that this is every bit it
may be

01:18.612 --> 01:23.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in many many ways more important
than
the bunny ranch I feel and know
that the

01:23.550 --> 01:28.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abuse is that of that this

endured is much greater than

action at
the refuge but the FBI is
monitoring the

02:23.610 --> 02:28.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
situation and more on this story
i'm now
joined on the phone by Amanda
pitcher of

02:28.448 --> 02:32.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oregon Public Broadcasting so
I'm and I
understand you were in the
compound

02:32.452 --> 02:36.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yesterday and you've been
outside this
compound all day today can you
tell us a

02:36.590 --> 02:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
little bit about what is the
scene like
they're absolutely so it's a
cold winter

02:40.694 --> 02:45.832 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
day and this compound is
situated in
Scopus these page fresh and and
range

02:45.866 --> 02:51.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
land really a very isolated
there are 15
that are estimated building
within the

02:51.738 --> 02:56.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complex and it's very quiet here
you see
a few of the protesters walking
between

02:56.443 --> 03:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
building there are some women in
the
kitchen making grilled cheese
sandwiches

03:02.349 --> 03:07.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the perfect but it's very
common
it's very quiet there was a
press

03:07.154 --> 03:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conference earlier today in
which the
protesters felt a little bit
more about

03:11.992 --> 03:17.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
why they're here at the scene it
is my
comp I mean obviously we can't
call this

03:17.197 --> 03:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a standoff because there's no
one
standing in opposition to these
guys is

03:21.268 --> 03:25.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it really true that there is no
sign of
law enforcement there I have
seen here

03:25.705 --> 03:30.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law enforcement vehicles and
that are
marked at least and I've heard
nothing

03:30.744 --> 03:36.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from law enforcement about their
you
come near the area I I won't say
that

03:36.249 --> 03:41.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the protesters here are very
peaceful
and law enforcement has
indicated that

03:41.188 --> 03:45.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they would like it to remain
peaceful
here in a min bundy and his
supporters

03:45.258 --> 03:48.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
say that they're they're
supporting the
Hammonds who reported to prison
in

03:48.795 --> 03:52.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
southern california today
although the
humans have distanced themselves
a bit

03:52.099 --> 03:53.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from that

03:53.600 --> 03:57.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what is it that the bundy's and
his
supporters what do they want

03:57.938 --> 04:02.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
well what they say is that they
would
like to see the federal lands
like this

04:02.476 --> 04:06.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refuge turned over to local
control they
said that they would like to
start

04:06.813 --> 04:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
working the land here and
although it's
not exactly clear what that meet
at this

04:12.052 --> 04:17.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point I think many of them feel
that the
way that federal and are managed
is is

04:17.958 --> 04:22.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not appropriate and in some
cases
unconstitutional what sense of
you

04:22.162 --> 04:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gotten of what the locals
reaction to
all of this has been its been
next I

04:26.533 --> 04:30.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think there has been a lot of
fear about
what this could look like from
the local

04:30.570 --> 04:35.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
community in part because he had
a word
occupation and protesting people
assume

04:35.742 --> 04:39.446 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that there could be some
violence here
but I did see some local
resident come

04:39.479 --> 04:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by and ticket your they were
welcomed
into the complex and they
thought that

04:43.717 --> 04:49.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were very welcomed by the
the
protesters and not present at
all they

04:49.656 --> 04:53.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were initiated thing I was
actually
happening on the ground that
said I know

04:53.894 --> 04:58.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that many in Hardy County are
uncomfortable with having
protests here

04:58.131 --> 05:03.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in in this area and are are wary
of what
it could become alright

thank you
very much your welcome and
moments ago

05:08.675 --> 05:13.146 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Hammonds officially turned
themselves in to serve that
additional

05:13.180 --> 05:13.547 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
jail time
