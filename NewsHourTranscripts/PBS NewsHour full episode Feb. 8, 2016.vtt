GWEN IFILL: Good
evening. I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.675 --> 00:13.013 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: countdown to the New
Hampshire primary. We hear the

00:13.013 --> 00:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
candidates' final pitches
one day before voting.

00:17.150 --> 00:20.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead: why
NATO and the U.S. plan on
beefing up military forces
against

00:20.888 --> 00:22.990 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Russia.

00:22.990 --> 00:29.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And Miles O'Brien on
the ground in Brazil, the center
of the Zika virus outbreak.

00:29.263 --> 00:34.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DR. ADRIANA SCAVUZZI,
Obstetrician: Try to solve the
medical problem won't be enough.

00:34.701 --> 00:41.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to change the quality
of people's life. Otherwise, you
will not solve this problem.

00:41.575 --> 00:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:48.615 --> 00:52.953 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.953 --> 01:01.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It is primary eve in
what is, for now, the center of
the political universe,

01:01.995 --> 01:04.831 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
New Hampshire.

01:04.831 --> 01:08.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins is in the Granite
State, as she kicks off our
coverage

01:08.869 --> 01:11.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the high-stakes
sprint to the finish.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: Good to
see you guys.

01:13.774 --> 01:16.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: They were in
Manchester, chatting with
diners.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate: Let me
tell you, sir.

01:18.612 --> 01:22.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And in
Plaistow, taking questions from
veterans.

01:22.549 --> 01:26.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republicans and Democrats,
favorites and long shots, nearly
all the candidates were going

01:26.620 --> 01:31.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all out, seeking out undecideds
and trying to turn their rivals'
supporters into their

01:31.358 --> 01:36.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
own. For Republican Marco Rubio,
that meant shaking off criticism
that he came off as

01:36.229 --> 01:40.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
canned in Saturday night's
debate and pressing his message
at a town hall in Nashua.

01:40.901 --> 01:43.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate: People
keep -- there's -- in the press,
anyway,

01:43.337 --> 01:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oh, why do you keep saying the
same thing about Obama trying to
change America? I'm

01:47.240 --> 01:50.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to keep saying that a
million times, because I believe
it's true.

01:50.510 --> 01:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For Chris
Christie, Rubio's dogged debate
night foe, it meant keeping

01:55.882 --> 02:00.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the heat on the Florida senator
at a town hall of his own in
nearby Hudson.

02:00.087 --> 02:03.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE (R-NJ),
Presidential Candidate: When the
lights get that bright, you
either

02:03.123 --> 02:07.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shine or you melt. We cannot
afford to have a president who
melts.

02:07.828 --> 02:11.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: And for Jeb
Bush, Rubio's
one-time-mentor-turned-rival, it
meant taking

02:11.531 --> 02:14.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up his own line of attack
this morning on MSNBC.

02:14.735 --> 02:18.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: He doesn't have a
record. That's not to say he's
not

02:18.338 --> 02:22.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gifted, because he is. He's a
gifted person. And he will be a
leader going forward. But

02:22.342 --> 02:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he doesn't have a proven record.

02:25.178 --> 02:28.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Bush's campaign
also put up an ad today hitting
at another of his rivals,

02:28.248 --> 02:30.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
John Kasich.

02:30.250 --> 02:35.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: The CATO Institute gave you
a D on its government's report
card this last year.

02:35.555 --> 02:39.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Kasich, at
a town hall in Plaistow, stood
by his record on budget

02:39.059 --> 02:41.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
issues as Ohio governor.

02:41.828 --> 02:42.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate: We were
way in the hole. Now we're way
in

02:42.295 --> 02:45.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the black.

02:45.399 --> 02:51.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: In the
meantime, the Republican
front-runner here, Donald Trump,
has switched

02:51.505 --> 02:56.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tactics after his runner-up
finish in Iowa. He tried his
hand at retail politics in
Salem,

02:56.476 --> 02:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
instead of holding one of
his signature rallies.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: I love these things,
even more than making

03:01.581 --> 03:03.950 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a speech, because I love to hear
the feedback. I get some good
questions.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And on
the Democratic side:

03:06.987 --> 03:09.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate: Join
with us in making that political
revolution.

03:09.022 --> 03:09.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:09.956 --> 03:12.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS:
Thank you all very much.

03:12.626 --> 03:16.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Next-door
neighbor and Vermont Senator
Bernie Sanders pressed his
apparent

03:16.329 --> 03:21.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advantage in the polls in New
Hampshire. He also drew ever
sharper attacks from Hillary

03:21.068 --> 03:25.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton's camp. Last night, in
Milford, it was former President
Bill Clinton.

03:25.672 --> 03:28.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BILL CLINTON, Former President
of the United States: For her,
this is not about grand theories

03:28.375 --> 03:31.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of revolution. This is about
whether we can improve people's
lives.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The former
chief executive went further,
accusing Sanders supporters

03:35.615 --> 03:41.154 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of profane and sexist attacks on
his wife. And on Saturday,
former Secretary of State

03:41.154 --> 03:45.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Madeleine Albright chastised
women voters who back Sanders
instead of Clinton.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, Former U.S.
Secretary of State: Just
remember, there's a special

03:46.827 --> 03:49.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
place in hell for women who
don't help each other.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:51.698 --> 03:57.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Feminist icon
Gloria Steinem went ever further
on HBO's "Real Time With

03:57.337 --> 04:02.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bill Maher." She explained
Clinton's lagging support among
young women by saying -- quote

04:02.542 --> 04:07.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "When you're young, you're
thinking where are the boys? The
boys are with Bernie."

04:07.514 --> 04:11.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Steinem later apologized in a
Facebook post. The candidate
herself steered clear of all

04:11.885 --> 04:15.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that fracas and stuck to a more
traditional appeal in
Manchester.

04:15.755 --> 04:21.094 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: Imagine
that, finally, women not only
get equal pay, but our rights

04:21.094 --> 04:25.298 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to make our own decisions
are finally respected.

04:25.298 --> 04:31.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Of course, with
24 hours yet to go, some voters
here already have gotten

04:31.471 --> 04:34.274 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
all the politics
they can handle.

04:34.274 --> 04:42.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I will just be really
glad when the primary is over. I
am up to here with the

04:42.149 --> 04:45.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ads on TV, and you just --
you can't get away from it.

04:45.585 --> 04:49.656 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But some
candidates may get away from it
for good after tomorrow, forced

04:49.656 --> 04:54.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out of the race if they
finish out of the money.

04:54.361 --> 04:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And late tonight, some
candidates have sent out
somewhat typical last-minute
requests

04:59.566 --> 05:04.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for funding. But that includes
some like Carly Fiorina, who are
needing a change in momentum.

05:04.871 --> 05:09.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seems certain that both
Democrats running for president
will survive New Hampshire,

05:09.242 --> 05:14.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it looks like, of the nine
Republicans running for
president, no one expects all

05:14.047 --> 05:17.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nine will still be running on
Friday -- from a snowy New
Hampshire, Judy, back to you.

05:17.617 --> 05:22.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa
Desjardins, we thank you.

05:22.622 --> 05:27.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in the day's other news,
President Obama says he will ask
Congress for more than $1.8

05:27.561 --> 05:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
billion to fight the Zika virus.
It's to be part of the budget he
rolls out tomorrow.

05:33.500 --> 05:37.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But top health officials today
played down the chances of a
major Zika outbreak inside

05:37.571 --> 05:40.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

05:40.540 --> 05:44.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a White House briefing, Dr.
Anne Schuchat of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention

05:44.144 --> 05:46.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
counseled calm.

05:46.379 --> 05:48.748 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REAR ADM. DR. ANNE SCHUCHAT,
Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention: We do expect to see

05:48.748 --> 05:54.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
infection in people who have
traveled and are returning home,
but we aren't expecting

05:54.221 --> 06:01.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
large-scale amounts of serious
Zika infection. The
recommendations for pregnant
women were

06:01.228 --> 06:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that we could reduce the
chances that pregnant women
would unknowingly step into
harm's way.

06:06.900 --> 06:12.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The virus is
suspected of causing birth
defects in Brazil and is
spreading across

06:12.606 --> 06:17.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Latin America. And there was
word today that the U.S. Olympic
Committee is now advising

06:17.711 --> 06:21.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
athletes that they should bypass
the Summer Games in Rio de
Janeiro if they're worried

06:21.648 --> 06:23.516 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about Zika.

06:23.516 --> 06:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The political
shockwaves from North Korea's
latest missile launch are still

06:23.683 --> 06:23.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reverberating. This Japanese TV
footage shows the missile in
flight shortly after Sunday's

06:23.817 --> 06:23.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
launch. But in comments aired
today, President Obama told CBS
that it came as no surprise.

06:23.984 --> 06:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: I think that we
have been concerned about

06:24.084 --> 06:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
North Korea's behavior for a
while. This is an authoritarian
regime. It's provocative.

06:23.650 --> 06:24.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It has repeatedly violated
U.N. resolutions.

06:24.784 --> 06:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: North Korea says it
placed a satellite in orbit.
U.S. officials say it's really
cover

06:24.084 --> 06:25.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for efforts to develop missiles
that can carry nuclear warheads.

06:25.085 --> 06:29.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rescuers in
Taiwan have pulled four more
survivors from the wreckage of
Saturday's

06:29.556 --> 06:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
earthquake. At least 38 people
died in the quake that was
centered in Southern Taiwan.

06:34.861 --> 06:41.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 100 others are still
missing. Two of those carried to
safety today were
8-year-old-girl

06:41.468 --> 06:46.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and her aunt who spent more than
60 hours trapped in a toppled
apartment building.

06:46.606 --> 06:52.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's been more
tragedy in the Aegean Sea.
Turkish officials say 27 people

06:52.712 --> 06:58.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
died in a shipwreck off
Northwestern Turkey. The
country's coast guard recovered
many of

06:58.118 --> 07:03.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the bodies, with coffins waiting
ashore for the victims. More
than 370 people have died

07:03.523 --> 07:07.927 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
since January 1 trying to
make the crossing to Greece.

07:07.927 --> 07:13.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A new Syrian
government offensive is driving
thousands more refugees toward

07:13.767 --> 07:18.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkey. The Syrians advanced
again today, north of the city
of Aleppo, with the help

07:18.004 --> 07:22.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of Russian warplanes
and Iranian fighters.

07:22.509 --> 07:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jonathan Rugman of Independent
Television News filed this
report from inside Turkey.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some of the images
may be disturbing.

07:29.482 --> 07:34.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: It was just
after this Syrian child had been
carried in an ambulance in

07:34.187 --> 07:44.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Aleppo yesterday that
another bomb fell.

07:44.264 --> 07:51.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bombs don't discriminate,
and the fighting for Aleppo is
now so intense that the Turks

07:51.071 --> 07:59.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say up to 30,000 Syrian refugees
are now camped out along their
border. From the Turkish side,

07:59.879 --> 08:04.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we can't see any of them. What
we can see are tents and aid
going across and ambulances

08:04.684 --> 08:07.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming out.

08:07.821 --> 08:12.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Turkish hospitality appears to
have reached its limit, though
the cross-border trade in

08:12.859 --> 08:18.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coffins could become even
busier. Well, the Turks are
certainly letting these aid
trucks

08:18.631 --> 08:23.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into Syria. They're just not
letting the Syrian refugees come
out.

08:23.670 --> 08:28.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Turks say they are full to
capacity, that they're trying to
prevent an even bigger refugee

08:28.575 --> 08:35.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
exodus. But there may be another
motive at work here, because, by
keeping Syrian civilians

08:35.315 --> 08:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside the Syrian border, the
Turks are effectively creating a
buffer zone between the Turks
and

08:40.687 --> 08:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian government forces and
Kurdish forces and so-called
Islamic State.

08:45.792 --> 08:51.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, millions of Syrians
were given sanctuary here before
the border shut. They

08:51.931 --> 08:57.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had assumed their relatives
could join them, and now they
can't. Syrian rebels are sending

08:57.871 --> 09:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reinforcement also, but they now
claim that government forces are
just 16 miles from the

09:01.808 --> 09:04.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Turkish border.

09:04.644 --> 09:09.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And though the rebels are
themselves using heavy weapons,
Turkey and its Western allies

09:09.649 --> 09:15.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are laying blame for the latest
exodus firmly at the door of
Russian airstrikes.

09:15.822 --> 09:20.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
leaders of Germany and Turkey
agreed today to make new
diplomatic

09:20.894 --> 09:25.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efforts to end the fighting at
Aleppo. German Chancellor Angela
Merkel said she is -- quote

09:25.999 --> 09:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- "not just appalled, but
horrified" at the toll taken by
Russian bombing.

09:31.037 --> 09:35.975 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, Wall Street started the
week with a new sell-off, as
bank

09:35.975 --> 09:42.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and tech stocks led the way
down. The Dow Jones industrial
average lost 178 points to

09:42.215 --> 09:49.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close at 16027. It had been down
as much as 400 earlier in the
day. The Nasdaq fell 79

09:49.823 --> 09:54.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
points, and is now off 20
percent from its peak last year.
And the S&amp;P dropped 26.

09:54.027 --> 09:54.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Peyton
Manning and the Denver Broncos
returned to the Mile High City

09:54.027 --> 09:54.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, this time as Super Bowl
champions. The Broncos used a
punishing defense to beat

09:54.761 --> 09:56.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Carolina Panthers 24-10 on
Sunday. TV ratings show almost
112 million Americans

09:56.129 --> 09:57.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tuned in for what was the third
Super Bowl victory in the
Broncos' history.

09:57.197 --> 10:02.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Hillary Clinton and Bernie
Sanders court the middle class;

10:02.802 --> 10:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign representatives and our
Politics Monday duo break down
what's at stake in New

10:08.074 --> 10:14.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hampshire; Brazil battles Zika
amid Carnival; plus, what could
be the biggest military buildup

10:14.214 --> 10:21.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in Eastern Europe
since the Cold War.

10:21.354 --> 10:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Over the years, it's
become the mantra of nearly
every presidential campaign,

10:34.000 --> 10:37.770 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
improving the lives of the
American middle class.

10:37.770 --> 10:41.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Political director Lisa
Desjardins is back with a report
on how Democrats Bernie Sanders

10:41.875 --> 10:45.612 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and Hillary Clinton
differ in their approach.

10:45.612 --> 10:50.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: For centuries,
New Hampshire's rivers and towns
have watched the rise, and

10:50.884 --> 10:54.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes fall, of the American
middle class. Now Democrats here
are focused on the economy

10:54.554 --> 10:56.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

10:56.556 --> 10:58.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate: We do
have to take on income
inequality. We

10:58.892 --> 11:01.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do have to create
more good jobs.

11:01.895 --> 11:05.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
Together, we are going to create
an economy

11:05.565 --> 11:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that works for working families
and not just the 1 percent.

11:10.503 --> 11:15.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Joanne Wood
doesn't have time for a campaign
event right now.

11:15.275 --> 11:18.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNE CYNTHIA WOOD, Uber
Driver: And now we're
discoverable to anyone nearby
who needs

11:18.611 --> 11:20.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a ride.

11:20.880 --> 11:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The 25-year-old
is looking for her first fare of
the day as an Uber driver,

11:26.486 --> 11:32.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a new economy job for a
relatively new worker. Joanne is
a decided Bernie Sanders voter
because

11:32.759 --> 11:36.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she wants the sea change for the
middle and lower classes that
Sanders is calling for.

11:36.829 --> 11:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNE CYNTHIA WOOD: I think the
economy is really up in the air.
It's concerning, because

11:42.468 --> 11:46.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there are so many people that
are just in so much debt, you
know, myself and my family

11:46.873 --> 11:48.474 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
included.

11:48.474 --> 11:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: One ride at a
time, she brings in up to $1,000
a week.

11:51.578 --> 11:55.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOANNE CYNTHIA WOOD: I
just got a request.

11:55.181 --> 12:01.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Joanne is
still far from breaking even.
With $30,000 in student debt

12:01.187 --> 12:05.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and bills left over from her
mom's heart attack two years
ago, she believes in Sanders'
aggressive

12:05.391 --> 12:08.027 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
economic rewrite.

12:08.027 --> 12:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOANNE CYNTHIA WOOD: I don't
have any specific sort of
animosity toward Clinton, but I
love

12:14.500 --> 12:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bernie for his authenticity,
and, honestly, his policies.

12:19.439 --> 12:26.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: New Hampshire
has an enviably low unemployment
rate, just 3.1 percent, but

12:26.145 --> 12:31.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wages here, like in many parts
of the country, have risen just
slightly in the past decade.

12:31.084 --> 12:35.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And add to that the fact that
Granite State residents have
mountains of debt, the second

12:35.254 --> 12:37.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
highest student loan debt in the
country. And per-person health
care costs are in the

12:37.890 --> 12:40.193 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
top 10.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW SMITH, University of New
Hampshire Survey Center: How
many of you would say that

12:41.628 --> 12:45.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
your friends are really
knowledgeable about politics?

12:45.732 --> 12:49.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Andy Smith
directs the University of New
Hampshire's survey center.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW SMITH: We are seeing the
most important issue that is
mentioned by Democrats for why

12:52.905 --> 12:56.142 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're going to choose who to
support are economic issues.

12:56.142 --> 12:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: He's been
talking with his classes about
the candidates.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW SMITH: The problem that
Clinton has this year is that
she is much, much further

13:03.616 --> 13:08.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
behind Sanders than she
was behind Obama in 2008.

13:08.688 --> 13:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sanders and
Clinton's middle-class policies
differ in scope. Both would
spend

13:13.459 --> 13:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on infrastructure, a stimulus
plan to create jobs, Clinton's
plan $275 billion, Sanders

13:21.234 --> 13:27.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$1 trillion. Clinton aims to
make public universities cost a
lot less. Sanders would make
them tuition-free.

13:27.240 --> 13:32.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton, she'd cut out-of-pocket
health care costs. Sanders, he
proposes government-provided

13:32.512 --> 13:34.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
single-payer health
care for all.

13:34.981 --> 13:37.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: It's a
beautiful day in Manchester.

13:37.950 --> 13:42.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: On the trail, a
big rift has opened over the
definition of the middle

13:42.121 --> 13:46.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
class. Both candidates would
raise some taxes on the wealthy.
But Sanders' would start at

13:46.826 --> 13:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lower income levels, which
Clinton implies would hit the
middle class.

13:50.530 --> 13:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And I'm
the only candidate standing here
tonight who has said I will

13:54.434 --> 13:57.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not raise taxes on
the middle class.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sanders has
said his health care plan will
be a net gain for many. But

14:01.708 --> 14:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not clear which income
levels benefit and lose. He
focuses more on income
inequality

14:05.945 --> 14:07.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in general.

14:07.980 --> 14:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: The concept
of the rigged economy, what does
that mean? You all know

14:11.551 --> 14:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what it means. What it means is
that most people are working
longer hours for low wages,

14:16.322 --> 14:21.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
while at the same time almost
all new income and wealth goes
to the top 1 percent.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Smith at the
University of New Hampshire
thinks the issue of economic

14:24.163 --> 14:27.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
struggle gives more
leverage to one candidate.

14:27.633 --> 14:32.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW SMITH: In my view, they
are playing on Bernie Sanders'
turf here, and Bernie Sanders

14:32.071 --> 14:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is controlling the debate. I
think Clinton has moved much
more closely toward Sanders'

14:35.575 --> 14:37.443 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
position.

14:37.443 --> 14:42.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But even if
Sanders set the terms, Clinton
hopes to win on execution and

14:42.615 --> 14:49.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with voters like this one. Tracy
Hahn-Burkett is many things, a
former civil rights advocate,

14:49.222 --> 14:53.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a full-time mother and a
freelance writer with a
well-known New Hampshire blog
called

14:53.226 --> 14:58.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Uncharted Parent. From her den,
she writes about teen angst,
guns and sometimes politics.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY HAHN-BURKETT, Uncharted
Parent: I try not to make it too
political. But, sometimes,

15:01.033 --> 15:03.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
if it's relevant...

15:03.469 --> 15:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Her family
isn't worried about making the
mortgage -- husband Paul

15:09.408 --> 15:14.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is an attorney -- and they're
grateful. But Tracy has multiple
chronic health conditions

15:14.580 --> 15:19.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and doctors' bills. And while
they are firmly middle class
now, she doesn't feel secure.

15:19.619 --> 15:28.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY HAHN-BURKETT: I think the
middle class is in trouble. I
think it's incontrovertible

15:28.027 --> 15:32.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that the middle class is
shrinking. And the middle class
has always really been -- it

15:32.865 --> 15:35.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sounds like a cliche to say it,
but the middle class has really
been the backbone of the

15:35.768 --> 15:37.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

15:37.470 --> 15:42.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The family has
a very particular concern
creeping up in just four years.

15:42.475 --> 15:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TRACY HAHN-BURKETT: I don't know
how we're going to pay for my
kids' college. There's

15:46.546 --> 15:50.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a part of me that says, well, we
will just work it out, like
everybody else does. But

15:50.383 --> 15:53.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then I sit there and look at the
numbers, and I see the way that
the costs are going

15:53.753 --> 15:56.522 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up all the time.

15:56.522 --> 15:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: When she looks
at the Democratic candidates,
Tracy sees two that she likes,

15:59.725 --> 16:02.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but one that gets her vote.

16:02.528 --> 16:07.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TRACY HAHN-BURKETT: I think
Hillary Clinton is best equipped
to actually get things
accomplished.

16:07.767 --> 16:14.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That doesn't mean that I dislike
Bernie Sanders or his policies.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: As Tracy looks
for middle-class results,
Sanders supporter Joanne is
looking

16:17.743 --> 16:19.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for big vision.

16:19.679 --> 16:23.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOANNE CYNTHIA WOOD: I don't
think that there's anything
wrong with being an idealist.

16:23.282 --> 16:26.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: In New
Hampshire, Democrats know there
is a middle-class question. But

16:26.819 --> 16:29.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're divided on which
candidate has the answer.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" in
Manchester, I'm Lisa Desjardins.

16:33.860 --> 16:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In recent weeks,
we have been hearing directly
from the campaigns.

16:39.131 --> 16:43.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we check in with two of
them, both with a lot on the
line in New Hampshire.

16:43.970 --> 16:48.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First up, Tad Devine. He's a
senior adviser to Bernie
Sanders. And he joins us from
Manchester.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tad Devine, welcome.

16:51.410 --> 16:55.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Senator Sanders has been
leading in practically all the
polls since last summer. A loss
for

16:55.648 --> 16:58.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him would be lethal,
wouldn't it?

16:58.251 --> 17:02.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAD DEVINE, Senior Bernie
Sanders Campaign Strategist:
Well, see, though, we are hoping

17:02.421 --> 17:05.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win tomorrow, Judy. We have
been working very hard in New
Hampshire for many months.

17:05.625 --> 17:09.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Bernie has a very
powerful message that voters
here in New Hampshire are
responding

17:09.996 --> 17:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to. He's talking about a rigged
economy that sends too much
wealth to the top, that is

17:14.333 --> 17:18.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being held in place by a corrupt
system of campaign finance. That
message, from the very

17:18.604 --> 17:22.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first day we arrived here in New
Hampshire, has resonated
powerfully with people. And

17:22.508 --> 17:25.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we think, tomorrow, we will
see the results of that.

17:25.111 --> 17:29.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We all noticed
that former President Bill
Clinton unleashed his strongest

17:29.949 --> 17:35.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
criticism yet of Senator Sanders
yesterday. He accused him of
being dishonest. He said

17:35.655 --> 17:42.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's misrepresented newspaper
endorsements. He said his
supporters have made sexist
attacks

17:42.395 --> 17:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on Secretary Clinton, and on and
on. He even brought up data that
was taken from the Clinton

17:48.434 --> 17:50.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
camp last summer.

17:50.036 --> 17:52.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of all
this? How do you respond?

17:52.905 --> 17:56.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAD DEVINE: Well, I think
it's very unfortunate.

17:56.709 --> 18:01.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, obviously, Bernie
Sanders is doing well here in
New Hampshire. And I think we

18:01.647 --> 18:06.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have begun to see, after Iowa
and the closeness of that race,
that he's doing well in other

18:06.552 --> 18:11.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states also. And I think the
Clinton campaign hasn't quite
figured out how they're going

18:11.924 --> 18:16.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to deal with Bernie. Are they
going to try to put her message
up against his?

18:16.729 --> 18:20.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think they have come to the
conclusion that that's not a
winning exercise. So I think

18:20.499 --> 18:25.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are going to try for a
while to get him off balance.
And I think, right now, what

18:25.571 --> 18:30.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie is doing and what the
campaign is trying to do is
really ignore those attacks and
to

18:30.376 --> 18:35.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make sure that we keep talking
about the issues, like the
economy, like health care, like
how

18:35.281 --> 18:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we're going to deal with climate
change, the big issues that
people are concerned with.

18:39.085 --> 18:42.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as long as we can keep
talking about those issues, we
think we are going to stay on
course

18:42.321 --> 18:44.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and we're going to
do well with voters.

18:44.623 --> 18:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, in talking
about Senator Sanders'
positions, Bill Clinton,
President

18:50.730 --> 18:55.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton, said at one point that
the senator is -- quote --
"hermetically sealed from
reality."

18:55.368 --> 19:02.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAD DEVINE: Well, listen, I
mean, this is the fourth Clinton
campaign in New Hampshire

19:02.041 --> 19:06.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for president, OK, so they have
a lot of experience running for
president here.

19:06.212 --> 19:13.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they're getting
ready to probably launch attacks
elsewhere as well. But I think

19:13.519 --> 19:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the reality that Bernie Sanders
sees is the reality of the
United States, where its
leadership

19:20.026 --> 19:24.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is no longer beholden to special
interests to fund their
campaigns. And if we want to

19:24.530 --> 19:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a new reality in this
country, if we want to have an
economy that works for people,

19:28.100 --> 19:31.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that doesn't send practically
all the new wealth to the top,
we're going to have the

19:31.237 --> 19:33.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change the thing that is holding
that rigged economy in place,
and that's the campaign

19:33.272 --> 19:35.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
finance system.

19:35.574 --> 19:39.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bernie is campaigning against
it. If we are able to change
that system, we believe we

19:39.078 --> 19:41.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can change that reality.

19:41.647 --> 19:46.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Looking ahead,
Tad Devine, where does Senator
Sanders compete well after

19:46.685 --> 19:49.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Hampshire? We know there are
a number of contests coming up
in states that are far

19:49.922 --> 19:54.260 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
more diverse than Iowa
and New Hampshire.

19:54.260 --> 19:58.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How -- what appeal does he make
in places like South Carolina,
Nevada and the long string

19:58.197 --> 19:59.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of states to come?

19:59.098 --> 20:01.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TAD DEVINE: Yes.

20:01.700 --> 20:06.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, we're really excited about
moving on to other states. In
Nevada, which will be

20:06.272 --> 20:10.476 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the next event after New
Hampshire, we have built a very
strong campaign on the ground.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We think Bernie's message
resonates very powerfully there.
That was a state that was hit
very

20:12.445 --> 20:15.681 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bad by the recession.

20:15.681 --> 20:20.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Carolina will be another
important test of strength with
African-American voters and

20:20.753 --> 20:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strength in the South as well.
And we think Bernie's story
resonates powerful there. Bernie

20:26.559 --> 20:30.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sanders, as a young man at the
University of Chicago, really
got very active in the

20:30.296 --> 20:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civil rights movement, and he
came to Washington to hear
Martin Luther King speak.

20:34.233 --> 20:37.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was arrested while he was a
student there protesting housing
policies. And, really,

20:37.436 --> 20:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if you look at the whole arc of
his life, I think you can trace
it back to those days

20:42.208 --> 20:46.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in college, where he made equal
rights and civil rights the
cause of his life.

20:46.345 --> 20:49.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We think we will have a lot of
targets. We think we can win in
small states. We can win

20:49.949 --> 20:54.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in big states and do well in
places like Texas, win delegates
under our system of proportional

20:54.553 --> 20:57.223 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
representation in the
Democratic Party.

20:57.223 --> 21:01.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we're hoping early on to
demonstrate that Bernie Sanders
is the strongest candidate

21:01.861 --> 21:05.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the Democratic Party. We can
bring new people into the
process, young people
particularly,

21:05.664 --> 21:10.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who responded so well in Iowa,
where he won by net 70 points
with 17-to-29-year-olds.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Independents, which will be a
big test of strength here in New
Hampshire, we think we

21:14.740 --> 21:18.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can bring those people into the
Democratic Party as well. So,
we're looking forward to

21:18.344 --> 21:20.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all these states. We think we
can do well in a lot of them.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we know New
Hampshire is the first of all
the rest, so we will be

21:22.314 --> 21:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
watching closely tomorrow.

21:23.649 --> 21:25.151 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tad Devine, we thank you.

21:25.151 --> 21:27.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAD DEVINE: Thank you, Judy.

21:27.186 --> 21:30.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to
the Republican side.

21:30.523 --> 21:35.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Rath is senior national
adviser to Governor John Kasich.
He's also in Manchester.

21:35.761 --> 21:38.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tom Rath, thanks very much.

21:38.397 --> 21:44.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we know Governor Kasich has
spent a lot of time, invested a
lot of his effort in the

21:44.003 --> 21:49.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state of New Hampshire. You hear
prognosticators say that he's
either got to come in second

21:49.275 --> 21:51.410 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
or a very strong
third, given that.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.879 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Will he?

21:53.879 --> 21:58.584 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS RATH, John Kasich
Campaign Senior Adviser: Well,
look it, Judy, I think this is
such

21:58.584 --> 22:02.821 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an incredibly different election
than any one I have ever seen
that I'm not willing

22:02.821 --> 22:06.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to put a do-or-die on any
particular position.

22:06.792 --> 22:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what candidates have to
do here is establish that they
are credible and that

22:11.664 --> 22:16.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they can attract a significant
portion of the electorate.
Frankly, I believe the polling

22:16.835 --> 22:23.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has Donald Trump up around 30,
and then from about numbers two
through numbers six, you

22:23.809 --> 22:26.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can cover them with a
blanket. It's that close.

22:26.745 --> 22:32.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I don't know what that will
say if you miss your mark by a
point or if you overperform

22:32.551 --> 22:37.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by a point. I just think this is
a very close race that's going
to come down to the end.

22:37.156 --> 22:41.694 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I do not see the middle
coalescing behind anybody at
this point.

22:41.694 --> 22:45.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about that, because one of
your competitors, Senator

22:45.497 --> 22:50.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio, was seen as having
a tough time in that Republican
debate Saturday night.

22:50.736 --> 22:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you look at that as a -- just
his being knocked off his game
for a few days, or did

22:55.507 --> 22:58.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that do more lasting
damage to him?

22:58.811 --> 23:05.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS RATH: Well, the problem
with that is, in the world we
live in, it's YouTube and

23:05.251 --> 23:08.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
videotape loops.

23:08.020 --> 23:15.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Marco Rubio's problem goes
beyond that. He has tried to be
in two lanes at once. And

23:15.494 --> 23:20.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's why, when you get into a
question that throws him off the
talking points, he's got

23:20.799 --> 23:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to remember who he's going to
orient himself to, whether it's
the hard right, the ideologic

23:24.937 --> 23:28.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
right, as he did at the end with
his abortion questions, or does
he come across more as

23:28.474 --> 23:30.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
somebody who can bring
people together?

23:30.943 --> 23:37.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is really what threw him
off. That will stay with him
long after the back-and-forth

23:37.916 --> 23:42.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
goes on, although, as I said
before, those kind of things,
like "Oops" for Governor Perry,

23:42.454 --> 23:44.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tend to stay with
you a long time.

23:44.957 --> 23:48.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to also
ask you about Jeb Bush. Governor
Kasich has been lumped

23:48.961 --> 23:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in with this group of governors
seen as moderate who are
competing with each other to
achieve

23:54.333 --> 23:57.436 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
liftoff.

23:57.436 --> 24:01.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who's going to come in ahead,
Governor Kasich or Governor
Bush?

24:01.507 --> 24:05.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS RATH: I think we have a
really good chance to prevail.
We have worked very, very

24:05.344 --> 24:10.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hard here and we have got a good
ground game. I, for months, have
said I do not believe

24:10.249 --> 24:14.153 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the reports of the demise
of Jeb Bush's campaign.

24:14.153 --> 24:18.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a good candidate. He's
well-thought-of here. His
campaign has done well. I think

24:18.891 --> 24:23.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's a real battle for us with
them. I think, in the end, we're
going to finish ahead of

24:23.696 --> 24:27.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them. But I'm not going to take
that to the bank there. We have
got a lot of work to do

24:27.132 --> 24:30.669 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
between now and 8:00
tomorrow night.

24:30.669 --> 24:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, Tom
Rath, let me ask you about that
group of voters, the
undeclareds,

24:35.007 --> 24:38.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the independents in New
Hampshire. They can vote in
either party. What do you expect
them

24:38.944 --> 24:41.547 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do?

24:41.547 --> 24:47.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS RATH: Well, I think
they're going to do what they
usually do, which is, at some

24:47.519 --> 24:51.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
point, mystically, they make a
decision and they all go en
masse to one or the other.

24:51.523 --> 24:54.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's like they send a secret
message out or something.

24:54.693 --> 25:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It happened with McCain twice.
And I think it sort of happened
with Hillary Clinton the

25:01.633 --> 25:07.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last time. They are hard to
predict. They are terribly
engaged. We did one of the last

25:07.840 --> 25:11.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
town halls with Governor Kasich
this morning, and one woman who
was undeclared said this

25:11.243 --> 25:14.513 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was the fifth time
she had seen him.

25:14.513 --> 25:16.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they're paying attention.
And we hope to get a good share
of them.

25:16.949 --> 25:20.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: No prediction?

25:20.052 --> 25:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS RATH: I think we are
going to do all right. I would
say two, three would be a very

25:24.590 --> 25:29.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acceptable result. And I think
we could even do -- we could
probably even be stronger in

25:29.061 --> 25:32.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
terms of separation, if
things broke right for us.

25:32.731 --> 25:36.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tom Rath, who is
working hard for Governor John
Kasich, we thank you so

25:36.068 --> 25:36.835 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

25:36.835 --> 25:40.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOMAS RATH: Thank you, Judy.

25:40.139 --> 25:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The eve of the New
Hampshire primary is the perfect
time for Politics Monday.

25:45.778 --> 25:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined by Tamara Keith of
NPR in Manchester, New
Hampshire, and Amy Walter of The
Cook

25:48.914 --> 25:51.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Political Report.

25:51.917 --> 25:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amy -- Tamara, I'm going to
start with you, because you are
sitting in the cold in
Manchester,

25:56.655 --> 26:01.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Hampshire. And you're
covering up close what looks to
me like a collision between

26:01.260 --> 26:06.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gender politics and generational
politics involving Bernie
Sanders and Hillary Clinton,

26:06.365 --> 26:10.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but mostly self-inflicted wounds
from Hillary Clinton's people.

26:10.536 --> 26:15.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Absolutely. Her
surrogates and supporters said
some things

26:15.507 --> 26:21.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that are not going to make young
feminists happy, that have upset
young feminists, in

26:21.046 --> 26:25.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact, and it sort of counter to
the message that Hillary Clinton
herself has been trying

26:25.884 --> 26:30.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get out there, which is, I
know that young women support
Bernie Sanders, but, she hopes,

26:30.622 --> 26:34.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
she says, to win them over.

26:34.393 --> 26:40.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is not a new collision
among young feminists and older
feminists. It played out in
2008,

26:40.499 --> 26:42.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it's happening again.

26:42.935 --> 26:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Amy, did Gloria
Steinem and Madeleine Albright
step in it?

26:48.040 --> 26:51.977 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: By -- trying to shame
women into supporting a

26:51.977 --> 26:56.682 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
woman is not usually the
best way to entice someone.

26:56.682 --> 26:58.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what I find, personally,
especially when you're a
candidate. That's not the best

26:58.884 --> 26:59.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way to get somebody
to vote for you.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

27:00.686 --> 27:03.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: But I do want to
make a really important
distinction, which is we're
talking

27:03.956 --> 27:08.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about women in New Hampshire and
Iowa right now who are
overwhelmingly white.

27:08.627 --> 27:13.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you look at how Bernie
Sanders does in New Hampshire
and Iowa among young people,

27:13.198 --> 27:18.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
huge gap. But when I went and
looked at the polls that were
taken in South Carolina, which

27:18.036 --> 27:22.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is a much more diverse
electorate, Hillary Clinton
holds her own among younger
voters.

27:22.608 --> 27:28.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what I'm very curious to see
is if this generational gender
collision continues once

27:28.180 --> 27:31.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we get into states that
are a lot more diverse.

27:31.917 --> 27:37.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, it's the challenge
that Hillary Clinton has had
really since 2008, which,

27:37.956 --> 27:44.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is you know, they say you like
to campaign in poetry and govern
in prose. She campaigns

27:44.329 --> 27:48.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in prose and governs in prose.
And there is very little poetry
there and. We saw that

27:48.901 --> 27:51.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
poetry problem again this week.

27:51.937 --> 27:55.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tam, let's stick
with the Clintons for a moment,
because Bill Clinton, who is

27:55.641 --> 28:01.613 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no stranger of the highways and
byways of the Manchester
pre-primary, came out last

28:01.613 --> 28:05.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
night and said some pretty hard
thing. He kind of piled on and
seemed kind of irritated

28:05.217 --> 28:09.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the idea that Bernie Sanders
would criticize his wife.

28:09.688 --> 28:14.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes, I think that
Bill Clinton feels like Bernie
Sanders has had sort of

28:14.960 --> 28:21.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a garden path here, that Bernie
Sanders hasn't been put to the
same scrutiny as Hillary
Clinton.

28:21.099 --> 28:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it seems like Bill Clinton
is saying, all right, well, if
nobody else is going to

28:24.303 --> 28:29.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do it, I'm going to do it. And,
again, it's not clear how well
this is going to play.

28:29.241 --> 28:35.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Sanders camp and Sanders
supporters are pretty upset with
Bill Clinton. Of course,

28:35.714 --> 28:38.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is Bill Clinton's right to
do that, and he did something --
some similar things in

28:38.884 --> 28:41.053 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2008.

28:41.053 --> 28:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that, as it's clear that
Hillary Clinton is going to have
a -- I mean, she's, in all

28:47.426 --> 28:52.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likelihood, not going to win
here, and not even close, as
it's clear that she has a
tougher

28:52.097 --> 28:56.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
path. I think Bill Clinton is --
as they say, the big dog might
be getting off leash a little

28:56.568 --> 28:58.470 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
bit.

28:58.470 --> 29:02.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Boy, it feels like
we have had that very
conversation, 2008 especially.
And

29:02.708 --> 29:06.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that was when he was critical of
Barack Obama for the same
reason, saying that he felt like

29:06.645 --> 29:06.979 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
he hadn't gotten
enough scrutiny.

29:06.979 --> 29:07.112 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:07.112 --> 29:08.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

29:08.947 --> 29:13.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But let's move to
the Republicans. Saturday night,
big debate in the old town,

29:13.118 --> 29:18.223 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Marco Rubio was generally
seen initially as not having
done terribly well because he

29:18.223 --> 29:23.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
came off as somewhat robotic.
Was that real or was that kind
of overblown, Amy?

29:23.195 --> 29:25.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, we're going to
know a lot more tomorrow night.

29:25.797 --> 29:27.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Yes. Yes.

29:27.766 --> 29:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, look, I think that where
Marco Rubio was headed before
that debate was on a big

29:32.371 --> 29:37.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wave of momentum after Iowa.
When you talked to people
privately, they said they could

29:37.075 --> 29:43.148 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see his numbers move up in New
Hampshire. It was all about
closing strongly, right,

29:43.148 --> 29:46.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is what he wanted to do,
is build that momentum and then
close strong, and then maybe

29:46.585 --> 29:50.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even win New Hampshire, or at
least come very close to Donald
Trump.

29:50.122 --> 29:57.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That momentum at best has been
stalled. Maybe he's even gone
backwards. But I do agree that

29:57.229 --> 30:01.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we sometimes make too much of
these debates, right? It's not
just the people that are
watching

30:01.199 --> 30:06.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
them. It's a small subset. But
many people in New Hampshire are
doing other things, are

30:06.271 --> 30:07.472 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thinking about other things.

30:07.472 --> 30:08.407 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

30:08.407 --> 30:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Including the
Super Bowl, perhaps.

30:09.741 --> 30:11.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Perhaps.

30:11.877 --> 30:16.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we think is really
important, this -- or the media
thinks is very important,

30:16.281 --> 30:20.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this idea that he's robotic,
that he never changes his
message, is actually not a
problem

30:20.352 --> 30:24.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a candidate. We talk about
candidates needing to be
message-disciplined. Most voters

30:24.523 --> 30:29.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are spending .000005 percent of
their time hearing politics,
listening to politics. If

30:29.895 --> 30:31.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you say the same message over
and over again, it gets through.

30:31.229 --> 30:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's what sticks.

30:31.596 --> 30:33.298 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

30:33.298 --> 30:36.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's talk
about the larger question,
because you had a good story on

30:36.201 --> 30:42.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NPR today, Tam, about Trump,
Donald Trump and his similarity
to Bernie Sanders, talking

30:42.574 --> 30:45.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about message and the things
they actually say and their
appeal, not just how they do

30:45.444 --> 30:46.712 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a debate.

30:46.712 --> 30:50.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Absolutely.

30:50.382 --> 30:55.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are many things where
they are nowhere near each
other. Let's just establish
that.

30:55.120 --> 30:59.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are surprising areas
where they overlap, things like
preserving Social Security

30:59.624 --> 31:05.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or even expanding Social
Security, not cutting Social
Security benefits,
infrastructure,

31:05.564 --> 31:10.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and simply the way they talk
about this feeling that the
American dream is maybe not
within

31:10.068 --> 31:13.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reach in a way it
was in the past.

31:13.605 --> 31:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are tapping into many of
the same things and using many
of the same phrases to talk

31:17.809 --> 31:20.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about those things, also trade.

31:20.679 --> 31:24.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's be
completely clear about
something, and that's that we
don't

31:24.583 --> 31:27.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know what's going to happen
tomorrow night. As a matter of
fact, Dixville Notch starts

31:27.819 --> 31:32.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voting at midnight. I love
this part of the year.

31:32.524 --> 31:37.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is a big expectations
game under way. And 24 hours
out, Amy, what is the
expectations

31:37.095 --> 31:40.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
game? How would you sum it up?

31:40.198 --> 31:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: On the Democratic
side, it's that Bernie Sanders
wins, but by what margin? And

31:44.536 --> 31:48.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the Republican side, Trump
wins, again, what margin, and,
more important, what happens

31:48.907 --> 31:55.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the non-Trump, non-Cruz
candidates, the Kasich, Rubio,
Bush, Christie?

31:55.914 --> 32:00.685 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Will one or more of those
candidates drop out after New
Hampshire, and then the rest

32:00.685 --> 32:03.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of those folks coalesce
around the one who's left?

32:03.989 --> 32:07.225 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: How does the
expectations game feel on the
ground, Tam?

32:07.225 --> 32:14.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, Ted Cruz
today was actually trying to
lower expectations, which is not

32:14.432 --> 32:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something that he did before
Iowa. Of course, this is a very
different state and less
friendly

32:16.935 --> 32:19.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
territory for him.

32:19.905 --> 32:26.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton has been for
months saying, well, you know,
Bernie Sanders is from a
neighboring

32:26.044 --> 32:30.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state. I think that the Clinton
camp is prepared to lose in Iowa
-- is prepared to lose here

32:30.849 --> 32:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in New Hampshire. It's not clear
how much that will be by. And
also Bernie Sanders is

32:36.421 --> 32:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also tempering expectations,
saying, you know, New Hampshire
has been very friendly to the

32:40.559 --> 32:44.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clintons. I think nobody wants
to lose the expectations game.

32:44.095 --> 32:47.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And they're
perfectly aware of how volatile
last-minute voting is in New

32:47.833 --> 32:49.668 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hampshire.

32:49.668 --> 32:53.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tamara Keith, get out with those
voters. Amy Walter, start
reading those exit polls. And

32:53.605 --> 32:57.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
we will talk to you
both tomorrow night.

32:57.442 --> 33:03.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tune in on Thursday night at

MILES O'BRIEN: It's Carnival
week in Brazil, the raucous
run-up to Lent, when people take

33:56.067 --> 34:02.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the streets to party their
worries away. But this year,
it's harder to mask reality,

34:02.540 --> 34:06.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as a frightening epidemic also
marches through the nation.

34:06.578 --> 34:10.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. ADRIANA SCAVUZZI,
Obstetrician: They come to us
asking many questions, and we
cannot

34:10.615 --> 34:16.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say almost nothing with 100
percent sure. What we have to do
is to support them. That's

34:16.288 --> 34:19.157 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
all we have to do.

34:19.157 --> 34:23.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Adriana
Scavuzzi is an obstetrician at
one of the largest hospitals

34:23.528 --> 34:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Recife, the epicenter of a
fast-moving outbreak of the Zika
virus, a flavivirus virus

34:29.434 --> 34:34.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the same family as yellow
fever, West Nile and dengue.

34:34.773 --> 34:40.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In each case, the virus
hitchhikes on a tenacious
day-biting mosquito called Aedes
aegypti that

34:40.679 --> 34:48.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has origins in Africa and is now
spreading throughout the globe.
Two-month-old Nicollas

34:48.586 --> 34:53.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
(ph) Pereira has an abnormally
small head, microcephaly.

34:53.558 --> 34:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Doctors at this hospital would
normally see 10 cases like this
a year. But starting in

34:57.696 --> 35:03.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
August, there were
suddenly 10 to 20 a month.

35:03.802 --> 35:08.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Ana Van Der Linden is a
pediatric neurologist. She says
Nicollas must contend with an
array

35:08.673 --> 35:12.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of permanent mental and
physical problems.

35:12.410 --> 35:16.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. ANA VAN DER LINDEN,
Pediatric Neurologist (through
translator): With this
impairment,

35:16.147 --> 35:21.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we see that reflex reactions are
good, but voluntary actions that
depend on better brain

35:21.186 --> 35:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
development will be impaired. He
will have bad motor skills and
mental development. He

35:26.624 --> 35:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can also have abnormal vision,
hearing disorders and bone
malformation.

35:31.596 --> 35:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: His mother,
Elizangela, says she developed a
rash while she was pregnant.

35:38.236 --> 35:43.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As it turns out, she had the
Zika virus, apparently after a
mosquito bite.

35:43.274 --> 35:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZANGELA PEREIRA, Mother
(through translator): Sometimes,
I worry. Sometimes, I wonder if

35:47.345 --> 35:53.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will survive, but I always
believe that God will help. My
only fear is losing him.

35:53.151 --> 35:55.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But I'm at peace.

35:55.954 --> 36:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Elizangela's
personal tragedy is part of an
unprecedented global mystery.

36:01.359 --> 36:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. LAURA RODRIGUES, London
School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine: I think this is one

36:02.927 --> 36:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the most unexpected
epidemiological situations,
maybe in decades.

36:09.100 --> 36:14.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Laura Rodrigues
is an epidemiologist with the
London School of Hygiene and
Tropical

36:14.806 --> 36:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicine who raced to her home
country to help answer some
questions in a hurry.

36:22.113 --> 36:26.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Even the numbers are a
challenge. Brazilian government
health workers are investigating

36:26.151 --> 36:31.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
more than four thousand
suspected microcephaly cases
that might be linked to Zika.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. LAURA RODRIGUES: There is so
much we don't know, and one of
the things we don't know

36:34.692 --> 36:39.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is exactly how many babies are
affected. Right now, there are
pregnant women being exposed

36:39.697 --> 36:42.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and possibly infected. It's
very difficult to predict.

36:42.901 --> 36:49.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Zika's enigmatic
history offers us few clues. It
was first isolated in Uganda

36:49.274 --> 36:56.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in 1947. It circulated in Africa
and a broad stretch of Asia,
then popped up in the Pacific

36:56.581 --> 37:05.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2007. The biggest outbreak,
in 2013, was in French
Polynesia, an estimated 19,000
cases.

37:05.957 --> 37:10.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But over the years, no one paid
a lot of attention to Zika
because the symptoms are
generally

37:10.628 --> 37:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mild. In fact, four out of five
never know they have it. No one
is sure why it took such

37:14.833 --> 37:17.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a vicious turn.

37:17.368 --> 37:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. LAURA RODRIGUES: It could be
biogenetic mutation of the
virus, and it could be that

37:21.573 --> 37:27.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just once they escaped Africa
and got into urban, very densely
populated areas, it was

37:27.812 --> 37:31.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
easier to transmit, or it could
be something else, the mosquito
maybe. It's all happening

37:31.416 --> 37:33.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very, very fast.

37:33.952 --> 37:39.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Making a smoking
gun connection between Zika in
mothers and microcephaly in

37:39.224 --> 37:43.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their unborn children is a
challenge for scientists.

37:43.128 --> 37:49.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
By the time infants are
diagnosed, the virus is usually
long gone. But here in Recife,

37:49.634 --> 37:55.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the case grew stronger last
week. At this government lab,
researchers used a new test

37:55.473 --> 38:01.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and found Zika antibodies in the
spinal fluid of 12 babies with
microcephaly, meaning the

38:01.713 --> 38:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
virus can reach the baby's
nervous system and brain in
utero. Researchers believe the

38:06.217 --> 38:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
virus targets nerve cells
as a fetus develops.

38:10.054 --> 38:13.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAFAEL FRANCA, Immunologist: So
this is where we keep the virus.

38:13.558 --> 38:19.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Rafael Franca
(ph) is an immunologist here. He
showed me the deep freeze where
they

38:19.130 --> 38:23.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
keep the Zika samples for
research that will lay the
groundwork for a better
diagnostic

38:23.668 --> 38:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
test, therapies and maybe
one day a vaccine.

38:27.739 --> 38:32.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAFAEL FRANCA: I cannot say that
we have the situation under
control. I believe now the

38:32.477 --> 38:37.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
only way to control virus'
spreading is to eliminate the
vector.

38:37.515 --> 38:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: That vector is
the mosquito. In nearly every
case, Zika is transmitted

38:43.388 --> 38:47.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
by a mosquito bite. The
Brazilian government has
deployed nearly 250,000 troops
to wage

38:47.192 --> 38:51.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
war with the insects.

38:51.095 --> 38:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have been spraying
insecticides and adding
larvicides to standing water
where mosquitoes

38:55.333 --> 38:57.735 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lay their eggs.

38:57.735 --> 39:01.706 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Gaspar Canuto is a Recife
government health worker.

39:01.706 --> 39:05.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much of this is to show the
public you are doing something?

39:05.677 --> 39:08.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GASPAR CANUTO, Public Health
Worker (through translator): One
hundred percent of this action

39:08.680 --> 39:13.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is aiming to reduce the
incidence of mosquitoes and also
of the disease.

39:13.751 --> 39:18.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Efforts like
this, while well-intentioned,
seem unlikely to stop the
outbreak anytime

39:18.957 --> 39:25.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soon in Brazil or in other
countries hit by Zika,
especially in Latin America.

39:25.129 --> 39:30.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The scale of this is pretty
mind-boggling. A single female
mosquito in her short lifetime

39:30.768 --> 39:35.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will lay hundreds of eggs. And
she's looking for a place like
this, standing water, not

39:35.673 --> 39:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much more than a puddle. But
what is really interesting is,
that's about al the water

39:39.911 --> 39:42.313 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
she needs.

39:42.313 --> 39:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With all this in mind, the
Brazilian government is warning
citizens that standing water can

39:47.252 --> 39:52.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be dangerous. But in this slum
in Recife, there is no running
water.

39:52.490 --> 39:57.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. ADRIANA SCAVUZZI: Can you
imagine a family that they don't
have even tap water? They

39:57.061 --> 40:02.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to keep water in the
containers. So it makes the
perfect environment for the
mosquito.

40:02.867 --> 40:09.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To try to solve the medical
problem won't be enough. You
have to change the quality

40:09.540 --> 40:15.113 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people's life. Otherwise, you
will not solve this problem.

40:15.113 --> 40:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Doctors here say
the biggest frustration is they
can't fix what ails these

40:21.252 --> 40:27.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
babies, all because of a single
mosquito bite. It has
dramatically changed
Elizangela's life.

40:27.458 --> 40:31.229 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had to quit her job as a
farmworker to care for little
Nicollas.

40:31.229 --> 40:34.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZANGELA PEREIRA (through
translator): I think I will be
here at the hospital forever.

40:34.465 --> 40:38.870 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do not know if he will be able
to walk. I don't know, but I
believe that God will

40:38.870 --> 40:41.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
help me.

40:41.472 --> 40:48.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: One woman's sad,
but hopeful prayer this Carnival
season. It's still a

40:48.012 --> 40:52.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time to try and forget your
troubles, but in Brazil this
year, a steady drumbeat of

40:52.517 --> 40:56.921 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
worry seems
impossible to ignore.

40:56.921 --> 41:10.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Recife, Brazil.

41:10.101 --> 41:19.377 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: It's been a
generation since the Cold War
ended, a standoff that dominated

41:19.377 --> 41:22.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much of the 20th century.

41:22.647 --> 41:27.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now echoes of that conflict
are sounding again, as the U.S.
and its allies encounter

41:27.185 --> 41:29.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a resurgent Russia.

41:29.687 --> 41:33.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret Warner
reports.

41:33.758 --> 41:38.796 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: NATO is
planning its biggest buildup in
Eastern Europe since the Cold
War,

41:38.796 --> 41:41.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all to deter a newly
assertive Russia.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: We haven't had to
worry about this for 25 years.

41:44.669 --> 41:48.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And while I wish it were
otherwise, now we do.

41:48.906 --> 41:53.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Last week,
Defense Secretary Ash Carter
proposed to quadruple U.S.
spending

41:53.311 --> 41:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on its -- quote -- "European
reassurance initiative" to $3.4
billion.

41:57.815 --> 42:03.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER: That will fund a
lot of things: more rotational
U.S. forces in Europe, more

42:03.955 --> 42:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
training and exercising with our
allies, more prepositioned
war-fighting gear and
infrastructure

42:08.659 --> 42:11.596 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
improvements to
support all this.

42:11.596 --> 42:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: This week in
Brussels, NATO's defense
ministers will discuss setting
up

42:15.366 --> 42:21.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outposts along its eastern front
to do just that. But is this
wise or necessary?

42:21.973 --> 42:25.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Evelyn Farkas just left her post
as assistant secretary of
defense for Russia, Ukraine and

42:25.376 --> 42:27.311 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Eurasia.

42:27.311 --> 42:30.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS, Former Defense
Department Official: This is
something that we absolutely
need

42:30.715 --> 42:34.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do. It is a sign of our
resolve. It's a sign that the
United States is there with

42:34.986 --> 42:39.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our NATO allies, that we're
there also to send a signal to
Russia. I mean, it's clearly

42:39.490 --> 42:41.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a deterrent effort.

42:41.993 --> 42:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But Jack
Matlock, ambassador to the
Soviet Union from 1987 to 1991,
warns

42:47.932 --> 42:53.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it will simply provoke Russian
leader Vladimir Putin into
further aggressive moves.

42:53.638 --> 42:57.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK MATLOCK, Former U.S.
Ambassador to the Soviet Union:
I think it's a bad idea. I think

42:57.175 --> 43:05.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's not necessary. I think it's
going to lead to even more
confrontation with Russia.

43:05.149 --> 43:13.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, probably, simply they will
move more of their military
equipment to the border.

43:13.090 --> 43:17.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Estonia's
ambassador to the U.S., Eerik
Marmei, echoes all three Baltic

43:17.261 --> 43:20.331 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
nations in insisting they
need the protection.

43:20.331 --> 43:25.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EERIK MARMEI, Estonian
Ambassador to the United States:
It a very clear sign of the U.S.
commitment

43:25.069 --> 43:31.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to enhance the deterrence in
Europe, and especially in the
eastern part of Europe in the
coming

43:31.075 --> 43:31.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

43:31.909 --> 43:33.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Why
do you need more?

43:33.978 --> 43:40.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EERIK MARMEI: What we have seen
in recent years is the change of
security environment

43:40.852 --> 43:47.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Europe. We have seen that
Russia has violated main
principles of international
agreements,

43:47.358 --> 43:50.194 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

43:50.194 --> 43:58.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: He's referring
to Russia's 2008 invasion of the
former Republic of Georgia,

43:58.035 --> 44:02.340 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
capturing two pro-Russian
territories. It triggered the
deepest rift between Russia

44:02.340 --> 44:06.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the West since the
fall of the Soviet Union.

44:06.611 --> 44:11.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tensions exploded anew in 2014,
when Russia invaded and annexed
the Crimean Peninsula

44:11.382 --> 44:15.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the former Soviet
Republic of Ukraine.

44:15.253 --> 44:19.323 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
This strategic territory should

44:19.323 --> 44:24.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be under strong and stable
sovereignty, which, in fact,
could be today only Russian.

44:24.595 --> 44:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The Kremlin
then provoked war in mainland
Ukraine's East between
pro-Russian

44:29.233 --> 44:36.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
separatists and government
forces. With more than 9,000
dead, the conflict continues.

44:36.107 --> 44:41.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also sounding alarms in the
West, Russia's recent
multibillion-dollar military
buildup,

44:41.846 --> 44:48.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with large-scale ground
exercises, overflights of
neighbors and a spike in
submarine activity.

44:48.753 --> 44:53.090 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATO's commander in Europe, U.S.
General Philip Breedlove, has
issued repeated warnings.

44:53.090 --> 44:55.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEN. PHILIP BREEDLOVE, NATO
Supreme Allied Commander: Russia
is blatantly attempting

44:55.259 --> 44:59.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to change the rules and
principles that have been the
foundation of European security
for

44:59.830 --> 45:01.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decades.

45:01.933 --> 45:07.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But how far do
Putin's ambitions extend? It's
one thing to reassert influence

45:07.572 --> 45:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in former Soviet republics, like
Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova.
But would he really move

45:13.311 --> 45:17.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
against once independent
countries the Soviets took over
during World War II who are now

45:17.815 --> 45:21.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
free members of the
NATO alliance?

45:21.218 --> 45:25.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: This union of 12
nations became known as the
North Atlantic Treaty
Organization,

45:25.623 --> 45:28.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or, more simply, NATO.

45:28.960 --> 45:35.099 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: NATO was formed
in April 1949 with 12 members to
defend themselves

45:35.099 --> 45:41.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the Soviet Union based on
the principle of an attack on
one is an attack on all.

45:41.439 --> 45:48.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But after the Berlin Wall fell
in 1989 and the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, many former

45:48.012 --> 45:53.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Soviet satellite states and
Republicans sought and won the
protection of NATO's security

45:53.985 --> 46:01.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
umbrella. Most galling to the
Russians was NATO's 2004
incorporation of three tiny
Baltic

46:01.058 --> 46:03.928 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
states, former Soviet
Republicans where many ethnic
Russians still live, Lithuania,
Latvia,

46:03.928 --> 46:06.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Estonia.

46:06.063 --> 46:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: We will defend
our NATO allies, and that means

46:09.033 --> 46:11.369 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
every ally.

46:11.369 --> 46:16.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: In September
2014, after the Ukraine crisis
erupted, President Obama

46:16.040 --> 46:21.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
went to Estonia to reassure the
Baltics and to warn the
Russians.

46:21.145 --> 46:24.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: So, if, in such a
moment, you ever ask again, who
will come to help, you

46:24.915 --> 46:27.852 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
will know the answer,
the NATO alliance.

46:27.852 --> 46:31.956 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: But is Russia
actually a threat to its Baltic
neighbors?

46:31.956 --> 46:37.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: Absolutely.
Absolutely. You know, all of the
countries on Russia's periphery

46:37.361 --> 46:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been either invaded by
Russia and occupied. The Russian
government, this Kremlin has a

46:42.933 --> 46:47.471 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign policy that essentially
asserts their right to have
political and economic control

46:47.471 --> 46:49.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over their periphery.

46:49.340 --> 46:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: What do you
assess is Putin's intention
vis-a-vis these countries?

46:53.277 --> 46:57.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: Regionally, he
wants to maintain this political
and economic control. It doesn't

46:57.081 --> 47:00.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mean he has to invade every
country. He can also try to
undermine the countries through

47:00.084 --> 47:02.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other means.

47:02.520 --> 47:06.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK MATLOCK: I don't think
there's any possibility of
Russia making an incursion in
the Baltic

47:06.857 --> 47:08.859 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

47:08.859 --> 47:12.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Former
Ambassador Matlock says the
Russians are simply responding
to

47:12.263 --> 47:17.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what they see as NATO squeezing
them by expanding right up to
the Russian border.

47:17.535 --> 47:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JACK MATLOCK: In their eyes,
they have not committed
aggression, that they are
responding

47:22.440 --> 47:27.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to aggression from the West, and
particularly from the United
States, which they accuse,

47:27.778 --> 47:34.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think unfairly, but sincerely,
of trying to encircle them with
military bases.

47:34.752 --> 47:39.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Western leaders
concede they have little insight
into what drives Putin

47:39.123 --> 47:45.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or what he intends. But mutual
hostility is growing and,
Matlock warns, dangerous.

47:45.029 --> 47:51.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK MATLOCK: There has been
created a almost Cold War
atmosphere of hostility. In that

47:51.502 --> 48:01.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
atmosphere, you are going to
make it very difficult to
cooperate on bigger issues.

48:01.545 --> 48:05.282 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: For example, he
says, battling Islamic State
terrorism. And then there's

48:05.282 --> 48:08.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the nuclear threat
between two superpowers.

48:08.385 --> 48:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK MATLOCK: It would be a
catastrophe to get into a war
with Russia. And it seems to

48:12.757 --> 48:17.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
me that you need to deal
with a certain prudence.

48:17.394 --> 48:22.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Do you think
that we are sliding into some
kind of new Cold War in

48:22.299 --> 48:26.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our relationship with Russia?
Should it make us tread more
carefully?

48:26.203 --> 48:32.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVELYN FARKAS: Not necessarily.
I mean, we should always tread
carefully, but if by that

48:32.877 --> 48:36.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you mean that we shouldn't
signal resolve to Russia, I
would say no. We have to signal

48:36.881 --> 48:39.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
resolve to Russia.

48:39.216 --> 48:43.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The next signal
of that resolve should come in
Brussels later this week.

48:43.020 --> 48:55.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Washington, I'm Margaret
Warner for the "PBS NewsHour."

48:55.065 --> 49:08.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later tonight on
PBS, a new documentary from
"Independent Lens" showcases

49:08.179 --> 49:15.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Misty Copeland the first
African-American woman to be
named principal dancer at New

49:15.319 --> 49:19.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York City's American Ballet
Theater, one of the country's
most prestigious dance
companies.

49:19.056 --> 49:22.159 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's a preview.

49:22.159 --> 49:30.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MISTY COPELAND, Ballerina: It
all kind of hit me at once,
moving to New York, realizing

49:30.067 --> 49:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was the only African-American
woman in a company of 80
dancers.

49:35.940 --> 50:00.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I felt like I was sinking for a
while. I felt alone in a world
that had become my home.

50:00.064 --> 50:06.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's just generations of
white girls who can see
themselves as ballerinas. It's,
like,

50:06.904 --> 50:13.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not even a question, because
everyone looks like them on
stage. And it's like this
psychological

50:13.177 --> 50:15.679 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing where, you know, we don't
see ourselves up there, so it's
not something we think we

50:15.679 --> 50:30.461 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can even dream.

50:30.461 --> 50:37.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people think that,
sometimes, I focus too much on
the fact that I'm a black
dancer.

50:37.268 --> 50:41.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have heard it from, you know,
former principal dancers in
major ballet companies, who
complain

50:41.538 --> 50:47.778 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about my presence and my voice.

50:47.778 --> 50:58.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think that people
realize what a feat it is being
a black woman. But that's so
much

50:58.222 --> 51:28.285 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of who I am, and I think it's
so much a part of my story.

51:28.285 --> 51:29.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.
That's something.
