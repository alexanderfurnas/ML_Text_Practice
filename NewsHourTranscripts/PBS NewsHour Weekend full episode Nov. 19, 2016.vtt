WILLINGNESS TO TALK ABOUT NAFTA.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.749 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY DO THIS BEFORE MR. TRUMP

EVEN TAKES OFFICE?

03:37.751 --> 03:39.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I SUSPECT PART OF THE--

03:39.119 --> 03:40.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART OF THE RATIONALE WAS TO

03:40.821 --> 03:42.756 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMOVE SOME OF THE DRAMA FROM

03:42.756 --> 03:44.558 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONVERSATION.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAVE BEEN ADJUSTMENTS MADE

03:45.792 --> 03:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO NAFTA OVER THE YEARS,

03:47.360 --> 03:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDING WHEN BILL CLINTON TOOK

2004.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RULES OF ORIGIN FOR A FEW

03:54.267 --> 03:56.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRODUCTS WERE CHANGED, INCLUDING

03:56.303 --> 03:58.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR FEATHERS, FOR ORE, FOR

03:58.972 --> 04:00.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COCOA, CRANBERRY JUICE.

04:00.807 --> 04:03.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE QUESTION NOW IS HOW MUCH

04:03.243 --> 04:04.177 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WANTS TO CHANGE IT.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'LL NOTE THAT HE WASN'T

04:09.683 --> 04:12.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO DOES PRESIDENT-ELECT TRUMP

INTEND TO DO A DRASTIC OVERHAUL,

04:14.287 --> 04:15.222 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF

04:15.222 --> 04:16.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S ALREADY OCCURRED SEVERAL

04:16.857 --> 04:17.424 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:50.090 --> 04:51.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN TEMPERED THE ELEPHANT IS,

04:51.858 --> 04:53.126 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY TWITCH IS FELT BY THE

04:53.126 --> 04:53.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTNER.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND LATELY THE ELEPHANT'S BEEN

04:55.128 --> 04:56.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWITCHING A LOT.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
76% OF OUR EXPORTS COME TO THE

04:57.864 --> 04:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES.

04:59.466 --> 05:01.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT A QUARTER OF OUR JOBS ARE

05:01.334 --> 05:02.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPENDENT IN SOME WAY ON TRADE

05:02.469 --> 05:03.303 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE UNITED STATES.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.404 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WOULD BE DEVASTATING TO OUR

05:04.404 --> 05:05.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY.

05:05.038 --> 05:05.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: GLOBALIZATION HAS

05:05.839 --> 05:07.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGED THE CONVERSATION IN SO

05:07.541 --> 05:09.209 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES, AND

05:09.209 --> 05:10.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S CHANGED THE POLITICAL TENOR

05:10.377 --> 05:11.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SO MANY DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT ABOUT IN CANADA?

05:13.180 --> 05:14.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK A LOT OF CANADIANS

05:14.181 --> 05:15.015 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD LIKE TO PAT THEMSELVES ON

05:15.015 --> 05:16.383 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BACK AND SAY WE ARE SO OPEN

05:16.383 --> 05:17.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GLOBALIZATION, WE'RE

05:17.250 --> 05:18.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELCOMING REFUGEES AND TRADE AND

05:18.985 --> 05:20.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOREIGNERS AND EVERYTHING IS

05:20.453 --> 05:21.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING SWIMMINGLY.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THERE ARE

05:22.722 --> 05:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT FACTORS AT PLAY, ONE

05:24.524 --> 05:26.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING BASICALLY THAT WE SHARE A

05:26.760 --> 05:28.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BORDER WITH YOU, WITH A VERY

05:28.295 --> 05:30.030 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVELOPED COUNTRY; THAT THE

05:30.030 --> 05:32.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRATION HASN'T CHANGED

05:32.566 --> 05:35.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY THE TENOR OF OUR

05:35.302 --> 05:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LABOR MARKET, AS OPPOSED TO THE

05:37.971 --> 05:39.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES, WHERE A LOT OF

05:39.005 --> 05:40.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRATION HAS BASICALLY DRIVEN

05:40.307 --> 05:42.909 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN SOME LOW-COST WAGES.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, SO THAT, YOU KNOW, CREATES

05:44.144 --> 05:45.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME SOCIAL TENSION.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT DOESN'T EXIST IN CANADA

05:46.279 --> 05:47.047 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY MUCH.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM ALSO

05:48.014 --> 05:49.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPERATES ON A POINT SYSTEM.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY, WE CAN PICK AND

05:51.017 --> 05:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHOOSE ENGINEERS, DOCTORS,

05:53.820 --> 05:54.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY IMMIGRANTS WHO COME

05:54.921 --> 05:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND FILL CERTAIN SLOTS IN THE

05:57.390 --> 05:57.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMY.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ALSO CHANGES THE FEELINGS

05:59.392 --> 06:01.428 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT TRADE AND GLOBALIZATION.

06:01.428 --> 06:03.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, ESSENTIALLY, YOU HAVE THE

06:03.063 --> 06:04.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONDITIONS THERE FOR A COUNTRY

06:04.231 --> 06:06.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S VERY HAPPY WITH THE

06:06.132 --> 06:07.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLOBALIZED WORLD AND ECONOMY.

06:07.634 --> 06:08.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO YOU DON'T HEAR THIS KIND OF

06:08.802 --> 06:10.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLAINING ABOUT TRADE IN A

06:10.203 --> 06:11.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

MR. SECRETARY, BUT THE SOLUTION

06:55.248 --> 06:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS NUANCED, AND WE DON'T DO

06:56.650 --> 06:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WHY IRAQI KURDS STOOD UP TO ISIS

13:23.536 --> 13:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE BEGINNING.
