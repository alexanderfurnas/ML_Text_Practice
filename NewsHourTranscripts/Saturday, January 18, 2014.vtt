05:32.767 --> 05:33.900
I GUESS THE INITIAL REACTION

05:33.900 --> 05:34.800
FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA'S SPEECH,

05:34.800 --> 05:35.633
WHAT ARE YOU HEARING

05:35.633 --> 05:36.833
>> IT SEEMS TO BE A CAUTIOUS

05:36.833 --> 05:37.300
WELCOME.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.600
IT'S A WELCOME BECAUSE THIS IS

05:38.600 --> 05:40.900
THE FIRST TIME THAT TH

05:40.900 --> 05:42.233
PRESIDENT HAS REALLY ADDRESSED

05:42.233 --> 05:43.767
SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT A LO

05:43.767 --> 05:45.433
OF PEOPLE IN EUROPE AND LATI

05:45.433 --> 05:48.800
AMERICA HAD BY THE WAY THAT TH

05:48.800 --> 05:49.867
NSA WAS COLLECTING DATA ON

05:49.867 --> 05:50.667
ORDINARY CITIZENS.

05:50.667 --> 05:53.033
THIS SLIGHTLY BIZARRE PARALLEL

05:53.033 --> 05:54.067
CONVERSATION GOING ON IN THE

05:54.067 --> 05:55.233
U.S., THE POLITICIANS HAVE BEE

05:55.233 --> 05:57.200
FOCUSED ON WHETHER OR NO

05:57.200 --> 05:59.400
AMERICAN'S RIGHTS HAVE BEE

05:59.400 --> 06:00.900
VIOLATED OR NOT.

06:00.900 --> 06:04.433
THAT'S THEIR CONSTITUTIONA

06:04.433 --> 06:04.567
RESPONSIBILITY

06:04.567 --> 06:06.867
BUT I GAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT

06:06.867 --> 06:08.133
IT WAS ALMOST A FREE-FOR-ALL

06:08.133 --> 06:10.900
THEIR E-MAILS AND THEIR TEXT

06:10.900 --> 06:13.667
MESSAGES WERE JUST FAIR GAME

06:13.667 --> 06:14.233
BY ADDRESSING SOME THE CONCERN

06:14.233 --> 06:15.633
IN THE SPEECH THAT WAS THE FIRST

06:15.633 --> 06:16.367
TIME THE PRESIDENT HAD DON

06:16.367 --> 06:16.533
THAT

06:16.533 --> 06:18.700
BUT IT'S A CAUTIOUS WELCOM

06:18.700 --> 06:19.833
BECAUSE THERE WAS LITTLE DETAI

06:19.833 --> 06:22.000
OR SUBSTANCE IN THERE.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.433
A LOT WILL BE FLESHED OUT IN THE

06:23.433 --> 06:24.967
WEEKS OR MONTHS AHEAD.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.400
AND PEOPLE WILL FOCUS ON THE

06:27.400 --> 06:28.333
ISSUE WILL BE WATCH FORK THE

06:28.333 --> 06:29.733
ACTUAL SPECIFICS OF WHAT THE

06:29.733 --> 06:30.800
WHITE HOUSE OUTLINES FOR THEM.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.267
>> NOW, WHAT ARE THE FEELINGS IN

06:32.267 --> 06:32.800
GERMANY?

06:32.800 --> 06:34.100
I MEAN, THEY SORT OF SEEM TO

06:34.100 --> 06:35.567
TAKE IT MUCH WORSE BECAUSE THEIR

06:35.567 --> 06:38.433
PRIME MINISTER WAS -- OR THEIR

06:38.433 --> 06:39.733
CHANCELLOR WAS BUGGED OR TAPPED.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.767
I MEAN, DID THEY SEE THE

06:40.767 --> 06:43.167
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNITE

06:43.167 --> 06:46.600
STATES AND GERMANY AFFECTE

06:46.600 --> 06:47.967
ADVERSELY BECAUSE OF THIS?

06:47.967 --> 06:48.033
>> SOME OF THAT WAS A COUNTRY IN

06:48.033 --> 06:52.367
EUROPE, THAT IT GOT THE MOST

06:52.367 --> 06:53.333
ATTENTION WHERE THE TEMPERS AR

06:53.333 --> 06:53.900
RAISED THE MOST.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.800
THERE'S THE POLITICAL LEVEL,

06:55.800 --> 06:58.967
THIS IS NOT A BASIS FOR THE U.S.

06:58.967 --> 07:00.800
TO HAVE A MUCH DEEPE

07:00.800 --> 07:01.600
CONVERSATION WITH CHANCELLOR

07:01.600 --> 07:03.800
MERKEL TO DISCUSS WHAT THE NSA

07:03.800 --> 07:04.833
DOES AND HOW IT WILL CHANG

07:04.833 --> 07:05.600
GOING FORWARD.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.067
THIS WILL GIVE THE U.S. A CHANCE

07:07.067 --> 07:08.467
TO START TO TRY AND CALM THING

07:08.467 --> 07:09.733
DOWN AND REPAIR SOME OF TH

07:09.733 --> 07:11.000
DAMAGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP

07:11.000 --> 07:12.800
THEN THAT'S A POPULAR LEVEL AS

07:12.800 --> 07:12.933
WELL

07:12.933 --> 07:15.700
A LOT OF PEOPLE, A LOT OF PUBLIC

07:15.700 --> 07:16.833
OPINION THAT HAVE BEEN OUTRAGE

07:16.833 --> 07:18.967
BY THIS.

07:18.967 --> 07:21.933
I THINK SOME PEOPLE LISTENED T

07:21.933 --> 07:23.133
THE SPEECH WILL BE PLEASED B

07:23.133 --> 07:23.367
IT

07:23.367 --> 07:25.033
BUT THERE'S A WHOLE SECTION OF

07:25.033 --> 07:26.767
THE POPULATION WHO IS BASICALL

07:26.767 --> 07:29.633
OFFENDED BY THE IDEA OF THIS

07:29.633 --> 07:31.200
MASS COLLECTION AND WILL NOT B

07:31.200 --> 07:32.267
PERSUADED BECAUSE THE PRESIDEN

07:32.267 --> 07:34.100
IS PUTTING A FEW MORE SAFEGUARDS

07:34.100 --> 07:34.833
HERE AND THERE

07:34.833 --> 07:36.133
THEY'LL THINK IT'S THE COR

07:36.133 --> 07:38.867
UNDERLYING COLLECTION OF THE

07:38.867 --> 07:42.500
DATA THAT IS THE ISSUE AND THOSE

07:42.500 --> 07:42.967
PEOPLE ARE NOT PERSUADED BY TH

07:42.967 --> 07:43.133
SPEECH

07:43.133 --> 07:44.067
>> WHAT ABOUT PRESIDENT OBAMA'

07:44.067 --> 07:46.367
STANDING, WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIS

07:46.367 --> 07:47.233
POPULARITY OR FAVORABILITY

07:47.233 --> 07:47.867
RATINGS IN EUROPE?

07:47.867 --> 07:50.167
>> MORE BROADLY, HIS POPULARIT

07:50.167 --> 07:51.933
HAS FALLEN QUITE A BIT

07:51.933 --> 07:56.533
HE GOT A HERO'S WELCOME BEFORE

07:56.533 --> 07:58.033
HE BECAME PRESIDENT IN PLACES OF

07:58.033 --> 08:00.200
EUROPE, BUT BEFORE THE NSA

08:00.200 --> 08:01.333
SCANDAL I WOULD SEEMED THAT TH

08:01.333 --> 08:02.900
THINGS LIKE DRONES ARE VER

08:02.900 --> 08:03.667
CONTROVERSIAL IN PARTS O

08:03.667 --> 08:03.800
EUROPE

08:03.800 --> 08:06.767
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE UNDERLYIN

08:06.767 --> 08:07.267
DIFFICULTIES HE HAS.

08:07.267 --> 08:08.900
BECAUSE ONE OF THE CORE BITS O

08:08.900 --> 08:10.933
THE SPEECH IS ESSENTIALLY

08:10.933 --> 08:11.667
CLAIM BY PRESIDENT OBAMA TO SA

08:11.667 --> 08:12.967
TRUST ME AND I UNDERSTAND THIS

08:12.967 --> 08:13.600
IS AN ISSUE.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.733
I'M GOING TO GET IT UNDE

08:14.733 --> 08:16.533
CONTROL.

08:16.533 --> 08:17.800
THAT SORT OF PITCH ABOUT TRUST

08:17.800 --> 08:19.400
ME MIGHT HAVE WORKED IN EUROPE

08:19.400 --> 08:20.733
THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO.

08:20.733 --> 08:23.600
BUT HAS MUCH LESS RESONANCE NO

08:23.600 --> 08:27.467
GIVEN HE HAS MUCH LESS

08:27.467 --> 08:28.367
POPULARITY AND INFLUENCE THAN HE

08:28.367 --> 08:28.567
DID.

08:28.567 --> 08:30.300
>> FINALLY ONE OF THE THINGS H

08:30.300 --> 08:33.367
STRESSED YESTERDAY, SO MUCH FO

08:33.367 --> 08:33.500
THE CRITICISM, A LOT OF TH

08:33.500 --> 08:36.333
COUNTRIES USE OUR INTEL TO KEE

08:36.333 --> 08:37.167
THEIR PEOPLE SAFE.

08:37.167 --> 08:37.900
>> ABSOLUTELY.

08:37.900 --> 08:38.967
THERE'S VERY MUCH A DOUBLE GAM

08:38.967 --> 08:40.533
GOING ON HERE.

08:40.533 --> 08:41.800
THERE'S GENUINE OUTRAGE, BUT

08:41.800 --> 08:44.967
SOME OF THEM ARE PLAYING A

08:44.967 --> 08:45.233
ANGLE TOO.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.700
THEY WANT THE U.S. TO SP

08:46.700 --> 08:48.267
PERSONALLY ON THEM LESS, BUT

08:48.267 --> 08:51.767
GIVE THEM MORE INFORMATION, MORE

08:51.767 --> 08:54.033
HEADS UP ABOUT WHAT THE NSA IS

08:54.033 --> 08:54.833
FINDING OUT.

08:54.833 --> 08:55.933
SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY -- THEY'RE

08:55.933 --> 08:58.600
PLAYING AN ANGLE HERE, BUT YOU

08:58.600 --> 09:00.667
KNOW IT'S NOT COMPLETE

09:00.667 --> 09:01.000
HYPOCRISY.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.767
THERE'S ANGER ON THESE ISSUES AS

09:01.767 --> 09:02.000
WELL

09:02.000 --> 09:02.367
>> ALL RIGHT

09:02.367 --> 09:03.233
THANKS SO MUCH

09:03.233 --> 09:24.067
>> MY PLEASURE

09:24.067 --> 09:25.633
>>> AND NOW TO OUR SIGNATURE

09:25.633 --> 09:26.067
SEGMENT.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.300
THIS EVENING, SPACE EXPLORATIO

09:27.300 --> 09:29.500
FROM AN UNEXPECTED PLACE

09:29.500 --> 09:31.967
WHILE SENDING ROCKETS TO OUTER

09:31.967 --> 09:33.933
SPACE MIGHT BRING TO MIND NASA

09:33.933 --> 09:36.000
OR RUSSIA OR CHINA, THE INDIAN

09:36.000 --> 09:37.000
SPACE PROGRAM HAS BEEN BUILDIN

09:37.000 --> 09:39.700
AND LAUNCHING SATELLITES SINCE

09:39.700 --> 09:39.833
THE 1970s.

09:39.833 --> 09:43.067
BUT INDIA'S MOST CURRENT

09:43.067 --> 09:45.867
ENDEAVOR IS MUCH MORE AMBITIOUS.

09:45.867 --> 09:48.700
I REPORTED ON THE INDIAN MISSION

09:48.700 --> 09:50.900
TO MARS.

09:50.900 --> 09:51.667
>> LIFTOFF

09:51.667 --> 09:54.333
>> IN EARLY NOVEMBER, INDI

09:54.333 --> 09:54.667
LAUNCHED A 320 TON ROCKET ON A

09:54.667 --> 09:58.433
MISSION TO MARS.

09:58.433 --> 09:59.767
IF ALL GOES ACCORDING TO PLAN,

09:59.767 --> 10:02.967
THE INDIAN SPACECRAFT WILL

10:02.967 --> 10:05.500
TRAVEL 485 MILLION MILES OVE

10:05.500 --> 10:06.100
MORE THAN TEN MONTHS AND GO INTO

10:06.100 --> 10:08.100
THE ORBIT AROUND MARS IN

10:08.100 --> 10:08.400
SEVENTH.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.000
THE U.S., FORMER SOVIET UNIO

10:10.000 --> 10:11.167
AND THE EUROPEAN SPACE AGENC

10:11.167 --> 10:12.200
ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO HAVE

10:12.200 --> 10:14.300
ACCOMPLISHED THIS FEAT

10:14.300 --> 10:18.867
>> IT IS A CHALLENGE AT BEST

10:18.867 --> 10:20.300
>> DR. RADHAKRISHNAN IS TH

10:20.300 --> 10:21.733
DIRECTOR AT THE INDIAN SPACE

10:21.733 --> 10:22.900
RESEARCH ORGANIZATION.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.700
HE WAS LOOKING ON WHEN THE MAR

10:25.700 --> 10:26.900
CRAFT IN HINDI LAUNCHED.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.600
THE PROBE WILL BE STUDYING THE

10:28.600 --> 10:30.333
ATMOSPHERE OF MARS AND LOOKING

10:30.333 --> 10:33.467
FOR TRACES OF METHANE WHIC

10:33.467 --> 10:34.167
COULD BE A SIGN OF PREVIOU

10:34.167 --> 10:34.400
LIFE

10:34.400 --> 10:35.567
>> NOT A LOT IS KNOWN ABOU

10:35.567 --> 10:36.767
MARS, BUT THERE ARE SEVERA

10:36.767 --> 10:37.867
ISSUES THAT ARE YET TO B

10:37.867 --> 10:39.567
UNDERSTOOD

10:39.567 --> 10:41.000
AND UNDERSTOOD PRECISELY

10:41.000 --> 10:42.733
>> THE MISSION TO MARS IS

10:42.733 --> 10:45.367
SOURCE OF IMMENSE NATIONAL PRIDE

10:45.367 --> 10:47.500
IN INDIA, BUT IT MIGHT SIGNAL

10:47.500 --> 10:51.500
NEW ASIAN SPACE RACE AND IT'

10:51.500 --> 10:52.500
TRIGGERED A DEBATE ABOUT

10:52.500 --> 10:53.767
EXPLORING ANOTHER PLANET WHEN SO

10:53.767 --> 10:56.300
MANY INDIANS STRUGGLE FOR BASI

10:56.300 --> 10:56.467
NECESSITIES.

10:56.467 --> 10:57.400
THOUGH IT HAS BEEN IN EXISTENC

10:57.400 --> 10:58.133
FOR NEARLY 50 YEARS THE VERY

10:58.133 --> 10:58.833
FACT THAT INDIA HAS A SPAC

10:58.833 --> 10:59.933
PROGRAM IS UNKNOWN TO MUCH O

10:59.933 --> 11:04.300
THE WORLD.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.600
BUT SINCE ITS INCEPTION, INDIA

11:06.600 --> 11:10.100
HAS NOT ONLY LAUNCH A MISSION TO

11:10.100 --> 11:10.367
MARS, BUT SENT A PROBE TO TH

11:10.367 --> 11:12.333
MOON AND HAS BUILT AND LAUNCHE

11:12.333 --> 11:13.333
70 SATELLITES TO DO EVERYTHING

11:13.333 --> 11:15.300
FROM MEASURING WATER RESOURCES

11:15.300 --> 11:16.600
TO ENABLING MOBILE

11:16.600 --> 11:19.000
COMMUNICATIONS IN RURAL INDIA.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.467
RADHAKRISHNAN SAYS AT ITS HEAR

11:21.467 --> 11:25.767
THE SPACE PROGRAM IS MEANT T

11:25.767 --> 11:28.067
IMPROVE LIFE FOR INDIA'S

11:28.067 --> 11:28.700
1.2 BILLION PEOPLE

11:28.700 --> 11:30.267
ONE IS TO PREDICT WHERE AND WHEN

11:30.267 --> 11:31.800
STORMS WILL HIT LAND, SO PEOPL

11:31.800 --> 11:33.367
IN THE STORM'S PATH CAN BE TAKEN

11:33.367 --> 11:35.467
TO SAFETY.

11:35.467 --> 11:37.367
IN 1999, WHEN A MASSIVE STOR

11:37.367 --> 11:39.133
HIT INDIA'S EAST COAST, MORE

11:39.133 --> 11:40.600
THAN 10,000 PEOPLE DIED.

11:40.600 --> 11:42.167
BUT A FEW MONTHS AGO WHE

11:42.167 --> 11:44.000
ANOTHER POWERFUL STORM HIT THE

11:44.000 --> 11:47.833
SAME AREA, ONLY 21 PEOPLE DIED

11:47.833 --> 11:49.767
NEARLY A MILLION PEOPLE HAD BEEN

11:49.767 --> 11:51.967
EVACUATED AFTER EARLY WARNIN

11:51.967 --> 11:53.567
DATA FROM INDIAN SATELLITES.

11:53.567 --> 11:59.100
>> THE PROPER USE OF THE

11:59.100 --> 12:01.833
OBSERVATIONS IS TO THE FARMER,

12:01.833 --> 12:02.767
AND AT THE OTHER LEVELS.

12:02.767 --> 12:04.233
>> HOW DOES UNDERSTANDING TH

12:04.233 --> 12:06.533
ATMOSPHERE OF MARS OR WHETHE

12:06.533 --> 12:08.600
THERE WAS METHANE HELP THE

12:08.600 --> 12:10.100
FARMER OR THE FISHERMEN IN

12:10.100 --> 12:10.600
INDIA?

12:10.600 --> 12:13.633
>> IT'S THE -- IT'S NOT GOING TO

12:13.633 --> 12:14.467
HELP HIM IMMEDIATELY

12:14.467 --> 12:16.467
>> BUT HE SAYS TECHNOLOGY FROM

12:16.467 --> 12:18.033
THE MARS MISSION WILL HELP

12:18.033 --> 12:19.800
IMPROVE THE SATELLITES INDIA HAS

12:19.800 --> 12:21.600
YET TO LAUNCH WHICH WILL

12:21.600 --> 12:24.300
DIRECTLY BENEFIT ORDINARY INDIAN

12:24.300 --> 12:24.700
CITIZENS

12:24.700 --> 12:25.967
BUT BEYOND THE TANGIBL

12:25.967 --> 12:26.500
SCIENTIFIC BENEFITS THE FEAT O

12:26.500 --> 12:26.967
SENDING A ROCKET TO MARS HAS

12:26.967 --> 12:27.633
BEEN A HUGE POINT OF PRIDE FOR

12:27.633 --> 12:31.600
INDIA.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.333
AS THE MARS SPACECRAFT LEF

12:33.333 --> 12:34.967
EARTH'S ORBIT, INDIANS TOOK TO

12:34.967 --> 12:36.600
TWITTER TO EXPRESS THEIR

12:36.600 --> 12:37.033
EXCITEMENT

12:37.033 --> 12:37.733
A POINT ECHOED BY DR

12:37.733 --> 12:39.533
RADHAKRISHNAN WHO SAYS THE

12:39.533 --> 12:42.400
MISSION HAS INSPIRED THE NATION.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.900
>> PEOPLE HAVE AWAKENED TO SEE

12:45.900 --> 12:47.700
HOW THE MARS OPERATIONS AR

12:47.700 --> 12:48.933
PROGRESSING.

12:48.933 --> 12:51.433
SO IF YOU CAN PLAN IT SO MAN

12:51.433 --> 12:54.333
YOUNG MINDS, WE NEED TO TAKE U

12:54.333 --> 12:55.500
THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE IT'S

12:55.500 --> 12:56.567
BIG TRANSFORMATION FOR THE

12:56.567 --> 12:57.033
COUNTRY.

12:57.033 --> 12:58.867
FOR THE FUTURE

12:58.867 --> 13:01.100
>> AND WORKING FOR THE SPACE

13:01.100 --> 13:02.200
AGENCY IS PRESTIGIOUS.

13:02.200 --> 13:03.467
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

13:03.467 --> 13:05.600
ENGINEERS HAVE APPLIED FOR JUS

13:05.600 --> 13:06.833
A FEW HUNDRED SLOTS.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.600
THE PRIDE IS ALSO IN PART FO

13:08.600 --> 13:10.133
HOW LITTLE INDIA SPENDS TO

13:10.133 --> 13:11.067
EXPLORE SPACE.

13:11.067 --> 13:14.167
THE MARS MISSION COSTS

13:14.167 --> 13:17.567
4.5 BILLION RUPEES OR JUST OVE

13:17.567 --> 13:18.233
$70 MILLION.

13:18.233 --> 13:19.667
COMPARE THAT TO THE MAVE

13:19.667 --> 13:21.100
MISSION, A SIMILAR NASA PROB

13:21.100 --> 13:22.333
THAT'S EN ROUTE TO MARS.

13:22.333 --> 13:23.733
THAT COST NEARLY 10 TIMES AS

13:23.733 --> 13:25.533
MUCH

13:25.533 --> 13:27.067
THE SAVINGS WERE ACHIEVED IN

13:27.067 --> 13:28.500
PART BECAUSE ENGINEERING LABOR

13:28.500 --> 13:29.833
IS CHEAPER

13:29.833 --> 13:31.533
THE INDIAN PROGRAM RECYCLES AN

13:31.533 --> 13:33.533
ADAPTS COMPONENTS LIKE LAUNC

13:33.533 --> 13:35.900
VEHICLES AND BUILDS FAR FEWE

13:35.900 --> 13:38.033
MODELS, RELYING HEAVILY ON

13:38.033 --> 13:42.067
COMPUTER TESTING

13:42.067 --> 13:42.200
BUT SPENDING ANY MONEY ON SPAC

13:42.200 --> 13:43.800
EXPLORATION HERE I

13:43.800 --> 13:44.233
CONTROVERSIAL.

13:44.233 --> 13:45.567
INDIA IS STILL A DEVELOPIN

13:45.567 --> 13:47.400
COUNTRY WHERE NEARLY A THIRD O

13:47.400 --> 13:50.567
THE POPULATION, ABOUT 40

13:50.567 --> 13:50.733
MILLION PEOPLE, LIVE ON LESS

13:50.733 --> 13:55.467
THAN A $1.25 A DAY

13:55.467 --> 13:58.167
BRINDA ADIGE RUNS GLOBAL

13:58.167 --> 14:01.400
AND CHILDREN HERE IN THE SLUM IN

14:01.400 --> 14:06.067
THE CITY OF BANGALORE.

14:06.067 --> 14:08.167
SHE SAID SHE WAS SAD WHEN SH

14:08.167 --> 14:08.733
FIRST HEARD ABOUT THE MARS

14:08.733 --> 14:08.967
MISSION.

14:08.967 --> 14:10.933
>> AT ONE END OF THE SPECTRUM,

14:10.933 --> 14:12.933
SO MUCH OF MONEY THAT IS BEING

14:12.933 --> 14:14.967
SPENT TO SEND A ROCKET OUT INT

14:14.967 --> 14:16.933
OUTER SPACE, WHEN WE KNOW THAT

14:16.933 --> 14:19.067
HERE ON EARTH IN MY COUNTR

14:19.067 --> 14:21.433
THERE ARE CHILDREN DYING EVERY

14:21.433 --> 14:23.900
DAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE NO FOOD TO

14:23.900 --> 14:27.000
EAT.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.433
SO MANY MORE SPENDING THEIR DAYS

14:28.433 --> 14:29.300
AND NIGHTS WITHOUT ELECTRICITY

14:29.300 --> 14:31.000
NO ROADS, NO EDUCATION

14:31.000 --> 14:33.167
NO PROTECTION FOR WOMEN AND TH

14:33.167 --> 14:35.100
GIRL CHILD ANYWHERE IN THI

14:35.100 --> 14:37.867
COUNTRY.

14:37.867 --> 14:39.133
>> DO YOU THINK THAT IF THEY

14:39.133 --> 14:41.500
DIDN'T SPEND THE MONEY ON TH

14:41.500 --> 14:42.333
SATELLITE THAT THEY WOULD SPEN

14:42.333 --> 14:43.500
THE MONEY ON WOMEN AND GIRL'

14:43.500 --> 14:43.900
ISSUES

14:43.900 --> 14:46.067
>> NO, THEY WOULD NOT.

14:46.067 --> 14:47.300
THE PRIORITIES ARE CERTAINLY NOT

14:47.300 --> 14:54.333
LOOKING AT CHILDREN, WOMEN

14:54.333 --> 14:56.200
HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE A NEED --

14:56.200 --> 14:57.433
WHO ARE IN NEED OF BASIC

14:57.433 --> 14:58.133
NECESSITIES JUST TO LIVE

14:58.133 --> 15:00.533
>> SO YOU'RE NOT AGAINST THE

15:00.533 --> 15:01.433
SCIENCE.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.200
JUST THE PRIORITIES?

15:03.200 --> 15:06.367
>> YES

15:06.367 --> 15:07.700
>> ADIGE GATHERED A GROUP OF

15:07.700 --> 15:09.167
WOMEN FROM THE SLUMS WHO ECHOE

15:09.167 --> 15:11.600
THE SAME CONCERNS.

15:11.600 --> 15:13.700
I ASKED THE GROUP THAT GIVEN THE

15:13.700 --> 15:15.067
MILLIONS BEING SPENT ON TH

15:15.067 --> 15:16.667
MISSION TO MARS WHAT KIND OF

15:16.667 --> 15:18.333
IMPACT ADDITIONAL MONEY COUL

15:18.333 --> 15:21.333
HAVE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.000
THEY DESCRIBED A LITANY OF

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
ISSUES INCLUDING BAD ROADS, LACK

15:25.000 --> 15:27.100
OF ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE, THE

15:27.100 --> 15:28.933
HIGH COST OF EDUCATION AND

15:28.933 --> 15:30.667
COMPLAINTS ABOUT SANITATIO

15:30.667 --> 15:32.167
ISSUES LIKE SEWAGE RUNOFF AFTE

15:32.167 --> 15:32.800
THE RAINS.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.133
AND A LACK OF SAFE DRINKIN

IT'S A GOOD PIECE OF MALWARE T

20:03.000 --> 20:03.667

20:06.067 --> 20:07.467
THEY MADE IT HARDER TO FIND.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.967
THEN THEY FIGURED OUT THE SCHEME
