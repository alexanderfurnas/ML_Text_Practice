JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is now under scrutiny for
possible obstruction of justice,

00:04.733 --> 00:06.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and he's fighting back.

00:06.800 --> 00:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This follows news reports that
special counsel Bob Mueller has
broadened his probe originally

00:12.700 --> 00:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
focused on Russia
meddling in the election.

00:14.800 --> 00:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Twitter today, the president
complained - - quote -- "They
made up a phony collusion

00:19.266 --> 00:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Russians story, found
zero proof, so now they go
for obstruction of justice.

00:24.833 --> 00:26.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nice."

00:26.933 --> 00:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Later, Mr. Trump charged that
Hillary Clinton committed a list
of infractions, and was cleared

00:31.300 --> 00:33.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anyway.

00:33.433 --> 00:37.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's also word that Vice
President Mike Pence has hired
outside legal counsel to deal

00:38.366 --> 00:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
with the Russia investigations.

00:40.400 --> 00:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His office tells The Washington
Post that former U.S. attorney
Richard Cullen will handle

00:44.666 --> 00:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
inquiries from
congressional committees
and the special counsel.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president hired his own
private lawyer last month.

00:51.500 --> 00:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will examine all of this, and
talk to the vice chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee,

00:56.033 --> 00:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Mark Warner, right
after the news summary.

00:59.100 --> 01:04.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.S. Senate today
overwhelmingly approved
new sanctions against
both Iran and Russia.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The overall bill is aimed
at Iran's missile program.

01:08.466 --> 01:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
An amendment expands sanctions
on Russia for meddling
in last year's election.

01:15.466 --> 01:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer said today it sends a
message to Russian President

01:17.966 --> 01:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vladimir Putin and
to President Trump.

01:20.366 --> 01:22.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:22.466 --> 01:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: Not only did we pass
a new round of tough sanctions

01:23.933 --> 01:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for Russia's meddling
in our election.

01:26.333 --> 01:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We codified existing
sanctions into law, making
them harder to lift.

01:33.300 --> 01:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any idea of the president's
that he can lift sanctions on
his own for whatever reason are

01:36.333 --> 01:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dashed by this legislation.

01:38.900 --> 01:43.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Putin fired
back during a national
call-in show in Moscow,
and said the sanctions

01:45.200 --> 01:47.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
say more about the
U.S. than about Russia.

01:47.733 --> 01:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
Why have they started to talk

01:51.266 --> 01:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about introducing these
sanctions with no grounds?

01:54.000 --> 01:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course it is evidence of
continuing internal political
struggle in the United States.

01:58.566 --> 02:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there weren't other problems,
they would have thought up
something else to hold Russia

02:02.633 --> 02:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
back, as it has always been, a
policy of holding Russia back.

02:06.433 --> 02:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We will take
a closer look at the Senate's
sanctions bill a little later

02:10.266 --> 02:12.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the program.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A leading Republican in the
House of Representatives,
Majority Whip Steve
Scalise, remains in critical

02:18.500 --> 02:22.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
condition tonight after a
gunman shot him during a
congressional baseball practice.

02:22.366 --> 02:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lobbyist who was wounded is
also in critical condition.

02:26.966 --> 02:30.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Trump visited
Scalise in a Washington
hospital last night.

02:30.666 --> 02:35.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, at the White House, he
said Scalise's recovery will
be more difficult than people

02:36.133 --> 02:37.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
thought.

02:37.800 --> 02:39.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
He's in some trouble.

02:39.233 --> 02:42.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's a great fighter and
he's going to be OK, we hope.

02:42.200 --> 02:47.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Steve in his own way may
have brought some unity to
our long divided country.

02:49.200 --> 02:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have a feeling that Steve
has made a great sacrifice,
but there could be some unity

02:56.366 --> 02:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
being brought to our country.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Let's hope so.

03:00.866 --> 03:04.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The gunman, James
Hodgkinson of Illinois, died
after being shot by police.

03:06.900 --> 03:10.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, the annual
congressional baseball
game is being played
tonight, raising money

03:10.000 --> 03:12.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for charity.

03:12.066 --> 03:16.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The American college student
released from North Korea, and
now in a coma, has a massive

03:17.300 --> 03:19.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
loss of brain tissue.

03:19.833 --> 03:23.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

of Cincinnati Medical
Center said today that
Otto Warmbier suffered

03:24.700 --> 03:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a severe neurological injury.

03:26.766 --> 03:29.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They could not say
if he was beaten.

03:29.633 --> 03:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Warmbier's father condemned
the North Koreans, but said
the family wants to move on.

03:33.966 --> 03:36.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED WARMBIER, Father of Otto
Warmbier: What I would say
to the North Korean regime, I

03:36.966 --> 03:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would say I'm so proud of
Otto, my son, who has been in
a pariah regime for the last 18

03:47.566 --> 03:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
months, brutalized
and terrorized.

03:50.100 --> 03:52.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And he's now home
with his family.

03:52.966 --> 03:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm just tremendously
proud of Otto.

03:55.966 --> 03:58.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
His spirit is with us.

03:58.000 --> 04:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The State
Department now says that a U.S.
diplomat who went to North Korea

04:02.633 --> 04:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to secure Warmbier's release
also contacted three other
Americans being held.

04:09.033 --> 04:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The department wouldn't
comment on their conditions.

04:11.133 --> 04:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In London, rescue crews have
pulled more bodies from a
burned-out apartment tower.

04:17.600 --> 04:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The death toll in Wednesday's
fire reached at least 17

04:22.600 --> 04:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Paul Davies of Independent
Television News has this report.

04:25.466 --> 04:29.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: A second dawn
brought no end to the agony.

04:29.766 --> 04:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are no flames now, but
this smoldering shell that was
once home to so many families

04:35.933 --> 04:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
still holds an unknown
number of their bodies.

04:39.900 --> 04:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fire crews believe, in flats
not yet safe to enter, there are
a whole families who couldn't

04:46.066 --> 04:48.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get out or obeyed the
instruction to stay put.

04:48.733 --> 04:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many, many remain missing.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it could take weeks
to confirm their fate.

04:53.533 --> 04:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANY COTTON, London Fire
Brigade: It's the upper floors
that will be more challenging

04:56.233 --> 05:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and will need some
additional shoring for us
to be able to get in there.

05:00.166 --> 05:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The size of this building,
it could take weeks.

05:02.133 --> 05:03.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I want to be realistic.

05:03.266 --> 05:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is a very long process.

05:05.233 --> 05:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: These images
show the destruction on the
ground floor of Grenfell Tower.

05:13.633 --> 05:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the area least affected
by that all-consuming fire.

05:20.066 --> 05:23.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As this photograph shows,
it gets worse as you go up.

05:23.933 --> 05:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Very few escaped
the higher floors.

05:26.200 --> 05:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the initial response to
this tragedy was horror, as the
hours have passed, there have

05:32.333 --> 05:34.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
been mounting questions
and mounting anger.

05:34.033 --> 05:38.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: There is a
system in place.

05:38.366 --> 05:39.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is the product.

05:39.833 --> 05:40.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That is it.

05:40.833 --> 05:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: There's nothing at all.

05:41.833 --> 05:43.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yes, but they're lying.

05:43.933 --> 05:46.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL DAVIES: Labor's
leader visiting the area
heard the concerns of
residents who say fears

05:46.433 --> 05:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they'd expressed about the
tower's safety were ignored.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Someone has to
be held accountable.

05:52.133 --> 05:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Someone has to be
held responsible.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't want it kicked
to the long grass.

05:55.866 --> 05:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't want the government to
sort of hide with some hollow
platitude about lessons being

05:59.800 --> 06:01.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
learned.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: The prime minister
paid her own private visit to
Grenfell Tower this morning

06:04.733 --> 06:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and was criticized for meeting
only the emergency teams,
and not the local community.

06:09.233 --> 06:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AFAF BADR, London:
People are very angry.

06:12.333 --> 06:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People are crying.

06:13.333 --> 06:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People are lost, missing.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's the prime minister.

06:17.266 --> 06:19.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Where is she?

06:19.300 --> 06:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: London's mayor
visiting the scene said
anger was understandable.

06:23.166 --> 06:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SADIQ KHAN, Mayor of
London: We can see the
anger in the community,
justifiably so, because

06:27.900 --> 06:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
many members of the
community have been saying...

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Not just the community.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's everyone outside as well.

06:32.233 --> 06:34.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: Fed up with
these politicians.

06:34.666 --> 06:35.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No handshakes.

06:35.666 --> 06:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want action, not handshakes.

06:37.700 --> 06:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: Sadiq Khan said
the inquiry should be immediate
and that no one should have to

06:43.800 --> 06:46.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wait two years to find
out why this happened.

national government and

into the fire.

people.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
