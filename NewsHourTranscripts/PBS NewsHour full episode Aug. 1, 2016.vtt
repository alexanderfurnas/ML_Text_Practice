08:14.594 --> 08:19.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His Democratic counterpart,
Hillary Clinton,
is in Nebraska today, but spoke
about all

08:19.466 --> 08:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
this yesterday during her own
Rust Belt tour.

08:22.102 --> 08:29.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
To launch an attack, as he did,
on Captain

08:29.776 --> 08:34.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Khan's mother, a Gold Star
mother, I don't
know where the bounds are.

08:34.247 --> 08:36.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know where the bottom
is.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Team Trump,
though, has a
different take.

08:39.352 --> 08:44.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's V.P. nominee, Indiana
Governor Mike
Pence, said in his own statement
that the

08:44.124 --> 08:47.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Khan family should be cherished
by every American.

08:47.494 --> 08:52.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Pence went on to attack
President Obama
and Hillary Clinton, whom he
blames for the

08:52.265 --> 08:55.802 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rise of ISIS and threat to the
American military.

08:55.835 --> 09:00.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump campaign chairman Paul
Manafort also
hit that theme on Sunday's "Face
the Nation."

09:00.507 --> 09:03.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL MANAFORT, Trump Campaign
Manager: The
issue is not Mr. Khan and Donald
Trump.

09:03.810 --> 09:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The issue really is radical
jihad -- radical
Islamic Jihad and the risk to
the American

09:10.817 --> 09:11.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
homeland.

09:11.818 --> 09:13.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the issue.

09:13.787 --> 09:16.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Even as the
controversy continues,
Trump is scheduled to press on
with his swing

09:17.023 --> 09:21.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state tour, with stops in
Virginia and Florida
in coming days.

09:21.528 --> 09:24.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

09:24.464 --> 09:29.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And with me now
are Khizr and
Ghazala Khan.

09:29.769 --> 09:32.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you very much, both of
you, for being
here.

09:32.639 --> 09:36.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And condolences to both of you
on the loss
of your son.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GHAZALA KHAN, Mother of Killed
U.S. Soldier:
Thank you very much.

09:38.478 --> 09:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Your lives have
changed since
Thursday night, haven't they?

09:39.913 --> 09:43.917 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KHIZR KHAN: Yes, certainly, for
the better.

09:43.950 --> 09:52.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The love and support has just
lessened our
burdens so very much from all
directions,

09:52.525 --> 09:54.093 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from all levels.

09:54.127 --> 10:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has been just pouring of
affection,
pouring of condolences and
support.

10:00.233 --> 10:06.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has just been amazing to all
over again
see the goodness of this
society, goodness

10:06.206 --> 10:08.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this country.

10:08.074 --> 10:13.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Donald Trump
tweeted this morning
-- quote -- "Mr. Khan, who
doesn't know me,

10:13.379 --> 10:20.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
viciously attacked me from the
stage of the
DNC, and is now all over TV
doing the same.

10:20.887 --> 10:22.088 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Nice."

10:22.121 --> 10:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He does seem irritated by your
talking to
the news media.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.727 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you say to him about
that?

10:27.760 --> 10:34.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHIZR KHAN: We are in the
political process
of the greatest democracy on the
planet Earth.

10:34.567 --> 10:40.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is candidate for the highest
office of
this nation.

10:40.840 --> 10:45.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has to have the patience and
tolerance
for criticism.

10:45.912 --> 10:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Him and I have same equal
rights.

10:48.381 --> 10:55.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his eyes, he thinks that he
can criticize
people, but no one else can
criticize.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.123 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is not the value of this
country.

10:57.156 --> 11:02.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mrs. Khan, Donald
Trump and
his advisers are saying that
what this is

11:02.695 --> 11:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really is about is about radical
Islamic terrorism,
and he says that's what
everybody should be

11:08.234 --> 11:09.502 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talking about.

11:09.536 --> 11:14.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GHAZALA KHAN: I think he doesn't
know the
Islam.

11:14.607 --> 11:22.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I actually don't want to talk
about him or
if -- in my eyes, the people who
know Islam,

11:22.582 --> 11:24.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they won't say these things.

11:24.617 --> 11:29.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Islam is a peaceful religion,
and I'm really
proud of my religion.

11:29.155 --> 11:36.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I still don't understand why
he's so upset
about this that I didn't say
anything at that

11:36.996 --> 11:38.731 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

11:38.765 --> 11:41.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're
referring to his
comment about the fact that you
didn't speak

11:41.401 --> 11:43.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the convention, but you have
been speaking
since.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GHAZALA KHAN: Yes.

11:45.171 --> 11:49.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what do you
make of his
really constant connection
between Islam the

11:49.642 --> 11:54.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
faith and what he calls radical
Islamic terrorism?

11:54.647 --> 11:56.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He connects the two directly.

11:56.716 --> 12:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GHAZALA KHAN: I don't think he
should do that,
but it is his beliefs.

12:02.155 --> 12:05.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He can do -- I can take
criticism from him.

12:05.558 --> 12:10.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can take it, but I believe
that he shouldn't
do that.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Khan, what
about that?

12:12.565 --> 12:18.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because Donald Trump has quoted
a poll last
year that he said showed that
more than 50

12:18.104 --> 12:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of American Muslims
believe that there
should be Sharia law, which
advocates violent

12:27.013 --> 12:32.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
acts against women and acts --
violent, in
effect, terrorism?

12:32.452 --> 12:40.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHIZR KHAN: Sharia law cannot be
implemented
in this United States, because
this distorted

12:40.526 --> 12:47.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sharia law is against the basic
principle
of equal dignity, equal
protection of law

12:47.667 --> 12:48.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the United States.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are we talking about?

12:51.004 --> 12:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are political statements
to gather votes
and create hatred and dislike.

12:56.476 --> 13:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would love to sit down and
talk on, what
Sharia law are we talking about?

13:02.248 --> 13:04.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is no such thing.

13:04.517 --> 13:06.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These are laws of these
countries.

13:06.886 --> 13:14.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These are hodgepodge of various
traditions,
various British laws, various
colonized times,

13:14.560 --> 13:16.496 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
laws, legal system.

13:16.529 --> 13:18.231 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There is no such thing.

13:18.264 --> 13:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States has the
Islamic law, which
is equal protection of law under
the 14th

13:26.305 --> 13:27.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Amendment.

13:27.674 --> 13:32.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Therefore, there is no fear,
except fear-mongers
make it fear.

13:32.111 --> 13:38.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unless we amend our Constitution
and we take
out the Equal Protection Clause
of the 14th

13:38.451 --> 13:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amendment, sure, we can talk
about Sharia
law coming in and sneaking in
here and all

13:43.389 --> 13:44.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

13:44.390 --> 13:46.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, there is no place for
that.

13:46.159 --> 13:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mrs. Khan, Donald
Trump on
his Web site refers to what he
said in the

13:53.399 --> 13:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
past, that all Muslims should be
banned for
a time from coming to this
country.

13:57.303 --> 14:04.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He now says all Muslims coming
from countries
where there is violent, as he
puts it, Islamic

14:04.143 --> 14:10.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism should be subject to
additional
scrutiny, additional background
checks.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.318 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you think that's fair?

14:12.351 --> 14:14.120 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Does that make sense?

14:14.153 --> 14:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GHAZALA KHAN: I believe that we
should be
-- really, our security should
be really tight

14:19.325 --> 14:21.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to let them in.

14:21.194 --> 14:26.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I shouldn't -- I do not
believe that they
should be banned, because there
are lots of

14:26.432 --> 14:29.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
innocent people in these
countries.

14:29.068 --> 14:35.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to come out for their
children's
life, for their life, so we
shouldn't ban

14:35.341 --> 14:41.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anything without looking into
it, because
there are lots of people who
want to come

14:41.881 --> 14:45.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
out of those countries, and they
are innocent.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have to do anything
with terrorism.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Khan, what
about that?

14:48.921 --> 14:55.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KHIZR KHAN: Of course we agree
that there
should be the strictest
standards to scrutinize,

14:55.228 --> 14:59.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
make sure we only allow good
people, we don't
allow bad people.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But then what?

15:01.267 --> 15:07.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Last few incidences have
indicated that these
are homegrown, bad people.

15:07.273 --> 15:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you deal with that?

15:09.442 --> 15:12.245 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How would you scrutinize through
immigration?

15:12.278 --> 15:13.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're here.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.148 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're born here.

15:15.181 --> 15:22.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Therefore, to deal with it is
join hand with
the community, make it known
that the community

15:22.221 --> 15:23.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is part of the society.

15:24.023 --> 15:30.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The community has an obligation
to monitor
themselves while they are in
this community.

15:30.863 --> 15:38.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Terrorism, manners of terrorism
cannot be
defeated by army, by military
action.

15:38.371 --> 15:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If it was possible, this would
have already
taken place.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.009 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Two other quick
things.

15:43.042 --> 15:48.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mrs. Khan, many Americans say
more American
Muslims need to speak out
against terrorism.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GHAZALA KHAN: True.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.451 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I believe that.

15:52.485 --> 15:59.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We should all get together and
speak that
terrorism is not the answer.

15:59.692 --> 16:03.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You always get respect and love
when you love
someone.

16:03.396 --> 16:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, Mr.
Khan, some
of Donald Trump's supporters are
saying you

16:08.201 --> 16:12.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Mrs. Khan were tricked into
doing this
by the Clinton campaign.

16:12.738 --> 16:13.873 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GHAZALA KHAN: Not at all.

16:13.906 --> 16:14.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We were not tricked.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We were given an option.

16:17.343 --> 16:21.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She is my editor of the speech
that was about
six pages' long.

16:21.380 --> 16:23.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She kept editing and editing.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.083 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't say this.

16:24.116 --> 16:25.084 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't say this.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't say this.

16:27.119 --> 16:32.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I rely on her strength and on
her support
and guidance, so that speech
became three-minutes-long

16:32.592 --> 16:34.093 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
speech.

16:34.126 --> 16:37.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Constitution came into
play.

16:37.630 --> 16:42.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I carry this in my pocket out of
affection
for this document.

16:42.468 --> 16:44.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At home, we have a stack of it
sitting.

16:44.537 --> 16:47.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any time a guest comes, we give
them a copy
of it.

16:47.807 --> 16:52.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amazon says that they have not
sold that many
Constitutions ever.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are good civic lessons.

16:53.913 --> 16:58.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anybody that picks up the
Constitution, reads
it begins to realize the
wonderful values

16:58.985 --> 17:02.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that exist and begins to see the
goodness
of this country.

17:02.855 --> 17:07.827 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the same thing is on
registration of vote.

17:07.860 --> 17:12.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We -- it's a sacred right that
true democracy
gives us.

17:12.765 --> 17:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lots of us don't use it, but if
somehow we
were able to encourage, I think
it was worth.

17:20.106 --> 17:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mr. Khizr Khan,
Mrs. Ghazala
Khan, thank you very much for
being here.

17:25.177 --> 17:27.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our deepest condolences on the
loss of your
son.

17:27.346 --> 17:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KHIZR KHAN: Thank you for
inviting us.

17:28.948 --> 17:29.916 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GHAZALA KHAN: Thank you.

17:29.949 --> 17:30.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KHIZR KHAN: Thank you.

17:30.950 --> 17:31.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

17:31.951 --> 17:33.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KHIZR KHAN: And we are glad to
be here.

17:33.719 --> 17:37.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the Trump
campaign didn't
respond to repeated requests to
provide a

17:37.156 --> 17:42.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
spokesperson for an interview
today.

17:42.528 --> 17:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For more on the
fight between
Donald Trump and the Khan
family, his recent

17:56.475 --> 18:01.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
comments on Russia's
intervention in Ukraine,
and Hillary Clinton's weekend
outreach to

18:01.380 --> 18:07.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rust Belt voters, it's time for
Politics Monday
with Tamara Keith of NPR and Amy
Walter of

18:07.386 --> 18:09.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Cook Political Report.

18:09.188 --> 18:13.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You just heard Ghazala Khan say
to Judy in
response to the questions about
Donald Trump's

18:13.492 --> 18:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feud, whatever it is, that, "I
can take it."

18:17.096 --> 18:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard in the last few
moments Warren
Buffett on behalf of Hillary
Clinton say,

18:21.033 --> 18:22.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have you no decency, sir?

18:22.335 --> 18:24.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have made no sacrifice.

18:24.070 --> 18:30.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard John McCain also scold,
but not withdraw
his endorsement today of Donald
Trump.

18:30.276 --> 18:34.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wonder, starting with you,
Amy, whether
it's ever a good thing to have
to defend yourself

18:34.480 --> 18:36.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by tweet?

18:36.415 --> 18:40.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: No,
but at the same time, nothing
about this campaign

18:40.219 --> 18:41.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has seemed normal.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

18:43.522 --> 18:48.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The traditional candidate
response to a speech
like Mr. Khan gave would be to
say, my condolences

18:48.627 --> 18:50.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for your loss.

18:50.062 --> 18:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here is my differences of
opinion on the policy
of it, right?

18:54.400 --> 18:57.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I differed with Hillary Clinton
and the Obama
administration on the war on
terror.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I differed with President Bush
on going to
Iraq in the very first place,
even though

19:01.173 --> 19:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he did say he supported it early
on, when
he invaded Iraq.

19:04.343 --> 19:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that is the answer that a
traditional
politician would give.

19:07.813 --> 19:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Gwen, I just feel I should
just come
out here with a tape recorder
and just every

19:11.550 --> 19:16.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
week say, nothing that he does
is like a traditional
politician would ever do.

19:16.522 --> 19:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we are seeing is, his
supporters, I think,
will continue to rally around
him, but every

19:21.027 --> 19:28.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day that this campaign is about
Donald Trump
and his messaging, which is not
-- which is

19:28.768 --> 19:32.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about him and not about the
bigger, broader
issues, I don't think that's a
good day for

19:32.371 --> 19:33.406 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's flip the
script a little
bit.

19:35.241 --> 19:40.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton, it seems to me,
was asked
about Pat Smith, the Benghazi
mom, who spoke

19:40.679 --> 19:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the Republican Convention,
and what was
her reaction?

19:42.548 --> 19:46.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Her reaction
was more the typical politician
answer.

19:46.485 --> 19:49.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was, thank you for your
family's service.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I can't begin to understand your
loss, that
kind of thing.

19:52.458 --> 19:57.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then she did get to the
question of whether
she remembered it the same way.

19:57.997 --> 20:04.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she remained respectful
throughout, and
you wouldn't call it a feud.

20:04.870 --> 20:09.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the difference is, in the
way Hillary
Clinton answered, it ended
there.

20:09.241 --> 20:12.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And look at George W. Bush.

20:12.411 --> 20:19.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cindy Sheehan was parked outside
his ranch
for a very long time protesting
him, and George

20:19.051 --> 20:20.019 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
W. Bush...

20:20.052 --> 20:21.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: In 2008.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Was it -- it was
earlier.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it was even maybe 2004.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.023 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.024 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.792 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

20:26.826 --> 20:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And George W. Bush
said, that
is her right, that is her right
to protest,

20:29.728 --> 20:36.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that is her right to say
anything she wants
about me, because this is
America, actually.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: That's what America
actually allows
for.

20:38.137 --> 20:41.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's move on to something else
Donald Trump
had to say this weekend.

20:41.073 --> 20:47.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was asked on "This Week" by
George Stephanopoulos
about his views about Ukraine
and Russia and

20:47.313 --> 20:51.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his relationship with Vladimir
Putin, and
this was his response.

20:51.350 --> 20:54.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
He is not going to go into
Ukraine, all right?

20:54.954 --> 20:57.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can mark it down, you can
put it down,
you can take it any way you
want.

20:57.656 --> 20:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC News:
He is already
there, isn't he?

20:59.058 --> 21:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Well, he is there
in a certain
way, but I'm not there.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.228 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have Obama there.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, frankly, that whole part of
the world
is a mess under Obama.

21:06.031 --> 21:09.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With all the strength that
you're talking
about and all of the power of
NATO and all

21:09.702 --> 21:13.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this, in the meantime, he's
going away
-- he takes Crimea.

21:13.672 --> 21:14.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's sort of...

21:14.974 --> 21:16.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS: But you
said you might
recognize that.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I'm going to take
a look at
it.

21:18.210 --> 21:22.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, the people of
Crimea, from
what I have heard, would rather
be with Russia

21:22.882 --> 21:24.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than where they were.

21:24.416 --> 21:27.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: He said two things
there that
horrified foreign policy
experts.

21:27.553 --> 21:33.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One was that, in fact, Russia
wasn't already
in Ukraine, which Ukrainians
would -- the

21:33.959 --> 21:39.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government we back in Ukraine
disagrees with,
and also that somehow Crimeans
think it would

21:39.632 --> 21:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be OK for Russia to stay there
after having
been annexed.

21:44.170 --> 21:45.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he came out today and
said, that's
not what I meant.

21:45.771 --> 21:46.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's not what I
meant at all,
right.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he tweeted back out, that's
not what I
meant at al.

21:48.707 --> 21:53.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What I meant is, when I'm
president, they
won't do anymore in Ukraine.

21:53.245 --> 21:57.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But it's the Obama
administration that failed
in this.

21:58.017 --> 22:02.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, this is where he makes
Hillary Clinton's
job that much easier.

22:02.688 --> 22:06.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her entire focus -- you saw it
at the DNC
-- you are going to see every
day for the

22:06.692 --> 22:12.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next 99 days -- is to say that
he's temperamentally
unfit to be president of the
United States,

22:12.264 --> 22:13.499 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
he's dangerous.

22:13.532 --> 22:16.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not just going to be
one thing or
another thing.

22:16.101 --> 22:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's that this -- if this
happens day in and
day out, this idea about his
sympathies, whether

22:22.208 --> 22:26.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's his sympathies to Putin,
whether it's
his fight that he's getting in
with the Khan

22:26.245 --> 22:32.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family, in the minds of people
who are not
already in a camp, polarized one
way or the

22:32.151 --> 22:34.853 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
other, it sows enough doubt.

22:34.887 --> 22:40.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, on the other
hand -- always
throws the on the other hand,
Tam, which is,

22:40.392 --> 22:43.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people are not going to decide
who to vote
for based on whether they think
that, or are

22:43.696 --> 22:46.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they, that Donald Trump is great
friends with
Vladimir Putin?

22:46.432 --> 22:51.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think that the
economy is
far more of a factor for
American voters than

22:51.570 --> 22:54.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what happens in Crimea.

22:54.206 --> 22:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The sector of voters that are
Crimea voters
is probably not very large.

22:59.812 --> 23:05.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, going back to the Khan
family and the
feud with the Khan family, the
question is

23:05.718 --> 23:10.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether this is the thing that
pushes Donald
Trump over the edge, whether
this is the time.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We have said that
before.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And we have asked
that many
times, like with John McCain and
various other

23:14.526 --> 23:16.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

23:16.328 --> 23:20.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This seems more like the time
that he mocked
a disabled reporter than other
-- because

23:20.399 --> 23:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
these are regular people.

23:21.667 --> 23:22.701 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
These are civilians.

23:22.735 --> 23:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These aren't politicians that
he's going after.

23:25.904 --> 23:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we won't know for a while,
but focus groups
showed that mocking a disabled
reporter was

23:31.010 --> 23:32.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the most resonant thing.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's the thing that...

23:33.479 --> 23:34.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:34.480 --> 23:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: ... and why it's
in an ads.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just think that you're
going to see
this in an ad.

23:39.018 --> 23:44.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We saw both of them
in the Rust
Belt, Ohio, Pennsylvania, in the
last few

23:44.156 --> 23:45.291 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

23:45.324 --> 23:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were on the big bus tour,
which must have
been...

23:47.593 --> 23:48.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

23:48.594 --> 23:49.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Exhausting.

23:49.595 --> 23:51.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Exhausting, yes.

23:51.397 --> 23:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I wonder what the candidates
are doing
now right out of their
conventions, starting

23:54.967 --> 23:59.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off on the general election,
what this tells
us about how they were received
at the conventions

24:00.005 --> 24:01.740 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and what they are trying to do
next, Amy.

24:01.774 --> 24:05.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, to build on
Tam's point
about the economy, this is
another missed

24:05.477 --> 24:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
opportunity here for the Trump
campaign.

24:07.379 --> 24:13.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Friday, the news came out,
GDP numbers
terrible, were at like the
second worst recovery

24:13.719 --> 24:16.422 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since 1949.

24:16.455 --> 24:18.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're supposed to go to the
Rust Belt and
make that case.

24:18.390 --> 24:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
See, the economy is not doing
well under Obama,
why would you let Hillary
Clinton do it?

24:21.627 --> 24:23.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, that's not what we
were talking
about this weekend.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.431 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We were talking all of these
things.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What Hillary Clinton was doing
this weekend
-- Tam was on the bus and
actually saw this,

24:28.867 --> 24:33.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but if you look at the cities
that she went,
she went right into Trump
country.

24:33.105 --> 24:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's not because she
thinks she's going
to win there, but campaigns are
as much as

24:37.076 --> 24:40.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about winning over voters as it
is not losing
by a lot.

24:40.546 --> 24:43.315 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she's trying to narrow the
margins.

24:43.349 --> 24:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In those areas that Obama lost,
she can't
lose by as worst percentage.

24:47.886 --> 24:51.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I know it's too
soon to talk
about convention bumps, even
though there

24:51.056 --> 24:56.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are a handful of polls out today
showing that
she has some kind of a bump.

24:56.128 --> 25:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But how is this campaign then
positioning
itself to take advantage of
whatever positivity

25:01.100 --> 25:04.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they can get out of this
negativity for their
opponent?

25:04.603 --> 25:08.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: They're trying to
hold their
ground.

25:08.340 --> 25:13.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No matter what the bump says, I
get the feeling
that Hillary Clinton and the
Clinton campaign

25:13.612 --> 25:16.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is just going to keep plugging
away.

25:16.548 --> 25:19.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is not a flashy campaign.

25:19.151 --> 25:21.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is the nitty-gritty work.

25:21.320 --> 25:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, they're in Omaha, where
there is one
electoral vote that she could
possibly maybe

25:25.924 --> 25:26.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
win.

25:26.925 --> 25:27.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And that's Warren
Buffett's.

25:27.926 --> 25:29.828 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:29.862 --> 25:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And that's where
Warren Buffett
happens to be, and that is where
he is introducing

25:30.763 --> 25:31.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
her.

25:31.997 --> 25:37.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they are doing the small
ball, trying
to win that way.

25:37.436 --> 25:40.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, Donald Trump is going
for the big
splash, and this is a real test.

25:40.873 --> 25:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Of which will work.

25:41.874 --> 25:42.841 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Of which will
work.

25:42.875 --> 25:43.842 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tamara Keith of NPR,
Amy Walter
of The Cook Political Report,
thank you both.

25:48.380 --> 25:57.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

25:57.489 --> 26:02.928 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

26:02.961 --> 26:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
China facing
the biggest aging crisis the
world has ever

26:07.866 --> 26:12.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seen; plus, what and who to
watch for in this
year's Olympics.

26:12.671 --> 26:18.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, first: Texas
marks a somber
anniversary today, 50 years
after a shooting

26:19.011 --> 26:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
massacre, then unprecedented,
shook the campus
of the state's flagship public
university.

26:23.916 --> 26:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But along with that anniversary,
the University
of Texas at Austin and the
state's other schools

26:28.821 --> 26:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
marked another milestone today,
the enactment
of a new law that allows people
to carry concealed

26:34.059 --> 26:36.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guns on Texas campuses.

26:36.462 --> 26:38.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

26:38.430 --> 26:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This is the
clock tower
where horror rained down 50
years ago today.

26:44.069 --> 26:48.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bells rang to remember the lives
lost, and
to honor the survivors of the
shooting at

26:48.373 --> 26:52.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the University of Texas in
Austin.

26:52.110 --> 26:56.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The flags on the campus mall
were lowered
to half-staff.

26:56.114 --> 26:59.218 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The clock tower was stopped for
24 hours.

26:59.251 --> 27:03.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bagpipes led mourners to the
tower's garden,
where a new memorial was
dedicated to victims

27:03.188 --> 27:05.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the horrific event.

27:05.524 --> 27:11.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was on a hot August day in
1966 that former
Marine and engineering student
Charles Whitman

27:11.563 --> 27:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
climbed to the top of the clock
tower and
opened fire.

27:14.833 --> 27:19.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whitman killed 14 people on
campus that day,
and had also murdered his wife
and mother

27:19.271 --> 27:21.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before his shooting spree began.

27:21.573 --> 27:26.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
More than 30 people were
wounded, and a 17th
victim died decades later of
wounds sustained

27:26.411 --> 27:28.480 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that day.

27:28.514 --> 27:33.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whitman's rampage 50 years ago
lasted an hour-and-a-half,
and only ended after police
stormed the tower

27:33.285 --> 27:34.853 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and killed him.

27:34.887 --> 27:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other students had also fired at
Whitman with
their own rifles.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Texas Congressman Lloyd Doggett
was a student
on campus that day.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

27:43.328 --> 27:46.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LLOYD DOGGETT (D), Texas: This
massacre, we
need to remember, occurred
before terms like

27:46.732 --> 27:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun violence, and mass shooting
or SWAT team
were even a part of our regular
vocabulary.

27:54.172 --> 27:56.275 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This campus attack was
unprecedented.

27:56.308 --> 28:02.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was as unexpected for
us in the
university community and for our
police department

28:02.981 --> 28:07.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as if some flying saucer had
landed up there
on top of the tower.

28:07.219 --> 28:10.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As the
community gathered
to mark the anniversary of one
of the nation's

28:10.856 --> 28:16.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
first campus mass shootings,
today also marked
the very first day that
concealed firearms

28:16.361 --> 28:20.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
will be permitted inside
University of Texas
buildings.

28:20.065 --> 28:24.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, state legislators
passed the so-called
campus carry law, arguing that
armed students

28:24.870 --> 28:29.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
might be able to stop the next
mass shooting
from occurring.

28:29.474 --> 28:33.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To talk about the university's
commemoration,
as well as how it's grappling
with this new

28:33.145 --> 28:36.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concealed carry law, I'm joined
by Gregory
Fenves.

28:36.081 --> 28:38.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is the president of the
University of Texas
at Austin.

28:38.884 --> 28:43.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He originally spoke out against
the concealed
weapon bill, but now that it's
law, he's implementing

28:43.221 --> 28:44.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it on campus.

28:44.856 --> 28:46.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Fenves, welcome.

28:46.224 --> 28:50.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First off, let's talk about
today's memorial
and commemoration.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why now?

28:51.630 --> 28:53.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is it you're hoping to
accomplish with
this memorial?

28:53.632 --> 28:56.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY FENVES, President,
University of Texas
at Austin: Well, it's been 50
years since

28:56.735 --> 28:59.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the tragedy of the tower
shooting.

28:59.905 --> 29:03.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many of the survivors are
getting on in age.

29:03.175 --> 29:09.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as we were preparing for
this anniversary,
sad anniversary, of this tragic
event, we

29:09.247 --> 29:16.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
realized we had not adequately
memorialized
those 17 individuals that were
killed on August

29:16.822 --> 29:18.924 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
1, 1966.

29:18.957 --> 29:20.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we wanted to do two things.

29:20.759 --> 29:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We first wanted to bring some
measure of healing
and closure to the survivors and
the many

29:26.398 --> 29:30.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law enforcement heroes that came
to the rescue
that day.

29:30.869 --> 29:32.671 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we also wanted to heal the
campus.

29:32.704 --> 29:37.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the campus had not given
enough recognition
to this tragedy.

29:37.943 --> 29:38.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is part of our history.

29:39.011 --> 29:41.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is a sad part of our history.

29:41.513 --> 29:46.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we wanted an appropriate
memorial that
would live on forever at the
University of

29:46.151 --> 29:50.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Texas to remember the events of
1966.

29:50.355 --> 29:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Why do you
think it has
taken 50 years to do this?

29:54.993 --> 30:02.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY FENVES: Well, in the
mid-1960s, this
was the first mass shooting,
sadly, the first

30:02.601 --> 30:05.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mass shooting at an American
campus.

30:05.671 --> 30:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have, unfortunately, had more
of those
in the past 50 years.

30:10.308 --> 30:17.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the country and society
and individuals
felt the best way to cope with a
tragedy is

30:17.516 --> 30:21.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to move on, to not talk about
it.

30:21.420 --> 30:27.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We now know that that's not the
best way for
a community and for individuals
to deal with

30:27.526 --> 30:31.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tragedy and to try to learn from
it and try
to move on.

30:31.797 --> 30:39.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we wanted a public
commemoration that
would recognize the fallen and
thank the survivors

30:39.504 --> 30:41.339 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and thank the heroes.

30:41.373 --> 30:45.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today's
commemoration, as
you well know, also marks the
implementation

30:45.377 --> 30:51.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this concealed carry law,
which supporters
say is a response to these types
of shootings,

30:51.450 --> 30:57.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that their belief is that, if we
have more
armed citizens in the population
and on college

30:57.589 --> 31:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campuses, that they will be
better able to
respond to these types of
massacres before

31:01.927 --> 31:03.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
police can get there.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of that
argument?

31:05.731 --> 31:10.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY FENVES: Well, I don't
think there
is much evidence that that
actually does help.

31:10.869 --> 31:14.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, nevertheless, it is the law
in the state
of Texas.

31:14.906 --> 31:21.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's great opposition to it
on our campus
among faculty, students, among
parents of

31:21.413 --> 31:23.148 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
students.

31:23.181 --> 31:26.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we went through nearly a
year-long, very
thoughtful, very engaging
process with all

31:27.018 --> 31:33.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
members of our community, to
develop policies
that promote campus safety, but
also follow

31:33.458 --> 31:38.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the law, which I, as president
of the university,
are obligated to implement.

31:38.363 --> 31:44.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Supporters of
this law point
to what happened 50 years ago,
which was,

31:44.236 --> 31:49.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when Whitman starts shooting
from that tower,
that some students got rifles,
were able to

31:49.407 --> 31:52.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pin him down somewhat until
police can get
there.

31:52.310 --> 31:57.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't believe that that is a
good argument
in support of this kind of a
law?

31:57.482 --> 32:04.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY FENVES: Well, I think
police tactics
and police training have
improved dramatically

32:04.790 --> 32:06.892 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
since 1966.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There were no SWAT teams.

32:09.795 --> 32:15.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police didn't have the weapons
they needed
to deal with the shooting.

32:15.934 --> 32:22.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, unfortunately, we have a
need for
very highly trained law
enforcement agencies

32:22.474 --> 32:30.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who train regularly, are very
rigorous in
dealing with these situations,
as is our University

32:30.182 --> 32:33.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Texas Police Department and
local law enforcement
agencies.

32:33.218 --> 32:37.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, starting
this fall,
some slice of your population of
students

32:37.722 --> 32:40.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could be carrying concealed
weapons on campus.

32:40.325 --> 32:44.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you worry, as president of
the university,
that something could go wrong?

32:44.796 --> 32:46.665 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, college kids drink.

32:46.698 --> 32:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They -- tempers can flare.

32:48.366 --> 32:51.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you worry about something
happening, some
kind of a mishap?

32:51.770 --> 32:56.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREGORY FENVES: Well, I worry
every night
about what could happen.

32:56.775 --> 32:57.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's my nature.

32:57.943 --> 32:59.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have 50,000 students.

32:59.778 --> 33:07.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're a campus community of
almost 70,000
individuals in a very dynamic,
urban area.

33:07.185 --> 33:12.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, as you have said, these
situations
can always develop, whether
there is a concealed

33:12.724 --> 33:14.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
carry law or not.

33:14.426 --> 33:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Texas, an individual licensed
to carry
has to be over age 21 -- many of
our students

33:21.700 --> 33:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are under age 21 -- has to
undergo a criminal
background check, has to go
through training.

33:27.606 --> 33:33.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And less than 5 percent of the
Texas population
has concealed permits to carry.

33:33.511 --> 33:37.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You mentioned
today that
this event happened back before
we even had

33:37.515 --> 33:42.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a language to talk about mass
shootings and
gun violence in this country.

33:42.187 --> 33:45.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you feel like the university
is prepared
for these types of events going
forward?

33:45.824 --> 33:52.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GREGORY FENVES: Well, you can
never truly
be prepared for a tragedy of
that magnitude.

33:52.731 --> 33:58.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But our police force, UTPD, in
collaboration
with the Austin Police
Department and the

33:58.870 --> 34:04.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state Department of Public
Safety, regularly
train for active -- what they
call active

34:04.175 --> 34:05.977 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
shooter events.

34:06.011 --> 34:12.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Unfortunately, we had one a
couple of years
ago, and most people report the
police responded

34:12.450 --> 34:14.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
almost instantaneously.

34:14.085 --> 34:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I have great confidence in
our law enforcement
agencies.

34:19.557 --> 34:26.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But one of the outgrowths of the
tower shooting
in 1966 was the understanding of
mental health

34:26.798 --> 34:28.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
counseling.

34:28.667 --> 34:33.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the university was very
proactive in that
period to add mental health
counselors to

34:33.939 --> 34:37.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assist with students coping with
tragedy.

34:37.609 --> 34:42.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have used that for a
number of different
incidents that have occurred
over the years.

34:42.847 --> 34:46.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
President Gregory
Fenves of the University of
Texas at Austin,

34:46.818 --> 34:47.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thank you very much.

34:47.819 --> 34:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GREGORY FENVES: Thank you very
much.

34:53.758 --> 35:08.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Southeast
Asia, tensions
continue to simmer as China
claims sovereignty

35:08.807 --> 35:12.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the South China Sea, a busy
international
trade route.

35:12.944 --> 35:17.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The United States and China have
both beefed
up their naval presence there,
leading to

35:17.782 --> 35:20.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fears of a military
confrontation.

35:20.151 --> 35:25.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is just one example of
China flexing
its military muscle in recent
months, and

35:25.457 --> 35:28.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it coincides with a slowdown in
the nation's
economy.

35:28.960 --> 35:33.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Writing in "The Atlantic"
magazine, journalist
Howard French sees a connection
between the

35:33.631 --> 35:39.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two, pointing out that, as
China's population
ages, the country faces a huge
demographic

35:39.371 --> 35:45.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problem that will affect all
aspects of its
economic and military
aspirations.

35:45.343 --> 35:52.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH, "The Atlantic":
China has its
own Baby Boom generation.

35:52.951 --> 35:57.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And China's baby boom
generation, because
of the size of China itself, is
the world's

35:57.355 --> 35:59.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
largest baby boom generation.

35:59.290 --> 36:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Howard French, a
former Shanghai
bureau chief for The New York
Times, has written

36:04.529 --> 36:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
extensively about China, and
he's photographed
its people.

36:08.500 --> 36:13.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: This baby boom
generation in
China will start to hit
retirement age in

36:13.705 --> 36:17.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the very next few years, let's
say by the
end of this decade.

36:17.776 --> 36:24.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, at that moment,
extraordinary numbers
of Chinese people will exit the
work force,

36:24.649 --> 36:30.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Chinese work force,
which has already
begun to shrink, will shrink in
a vastly accelerated

36:30.488 --> 36:32.257 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

36:32.290 --> 36:36.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so China's going to face
huge retirement
costs and Social Security costs,
health care

36:36.094 --> 36:39.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
costs, related to this immense
aging of the
population.

36:39.531 --> 36:44.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are the
implications for
China as a country and for the
Chinese economy?

36:44.903 --> 36:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: China will have
the biggest
aging crisis that the world has
ever seen

36:51.509 --> 36:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the next generation, and
this happens
at a time when Chinese
ambitions, geopolitically

36:57.382 --> 36:59.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
speaking, are expanding.

36:59.584 --> 37:05.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at some point, these two
phenomena will
collide, and very tough
decisions will have

37:05.824 --> 37:10.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be made about guns vs. canes.

37:10.562 --> 37:15.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In other words, how much can we
afford to
invest in our geopolitical
ambitions, vs.

37:15.600 --> 37:19.504 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how much must we invest in terms
of supporting
our population?

37:19.537 --> 37:24.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The massive
number of baby
boomers wouldn't be such a
problem if China's

37:24.909 --> 37:27.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
younger generations were just as
large.

37:27.979 --> 37:34.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they are not, mainly because
of the one-child
policy China imposed on all
families beginning

37:34.819 --> 37:36.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 1978.

37:36.654 --> 37:43.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: The one-child
policy was based
on some faulty science and had,
as an ambition,

37:43.228 --> 37:51.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reining in Chinese population
growth, so as
to enhance the per capita wealth
of the country.

37:51.903 --> 37:56.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because the Chinese made a
straight-line prediction
based on what the present
fertility rate was

37:56.341 --> 38:00.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the late 1970s, they made
some big errors
in their projections.

38:00.912 --> 38:07.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Imposing the one-child policy
meant that the
fertility rate took additional
hits.

38:07.952 --> 38:12.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the penalties of this
decision are just
now being borne.

38:12.724 --> 38:17.162 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is a mistake of
extraordinary significance
for China's place in the world,
for Chinese

38:17.195 --> 38:19.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
power, for Chinese prosperity.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for the Chinese Communist
Party to turn
around all of a sudden and say,
hey, wait

38:22.901 --> 38:28.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a minute, that big one-child
policy thing
was a huge mistake is very
difficult for them

38:28.206 --> 38:29.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do.

38:30.008 --> 38:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you believe,
today, the
Chinese leadership understands
what's happened

38:35.079 --> 38:39.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and are trying to do something
about it; they
just don't want to be so public
with their

38:39.951 --> 38:41.719 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
acknowledgement?

38:41.753 --> 38:45.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: They have been
very grudgingly,
very gradually coming --
publicly coming to

38:45.590 --> 38:50.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terms with what people have
known for quite
some time was a big issue.

38:50.295 --> 38:56.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this came to a head in the
last year,
when Beijing decided to relax
the one-child

38:56.467 --> 38:58.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
policy officially.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You, of course,
were a New
York Times bureau chief in
Shanghai.

39:00.672 --> 39:01.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have lived in China.

39:01.773 --> 39:04.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know the country very well.

39:04.876 --> 39:09.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is that going to mean, in
terms of the
old China, the evolving China?

39:09.280 --> 39:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: Well, when you
arrive in China
nowadays, one of the first
things you note

39:13.818 --> 39:21.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the emphasis placed on you, a
non-Chinese
person, being an outsider.

39:21.059 --> 39:23.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sometimes, this is done
aggressively.

39:23.695 --> 39:27.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, this is done rudely,
but most of
the time it's just done
routinely.

39:27.832 --> 39:32.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's just a normal thing in the
course of
your encounters with Chinese
people in every

39:32.337 --> 39:34.105 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
walk of life.

39:34.138 --> 39:36.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Were you able to
capture that
in your photographs, do you
think, the in

39:36.774 --> 39:37.742 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
and out?

39:37.775 --> 39:39.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HOWARD FRENCH: Sure.

39:39.644 --> 39:43.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As I set out to begin
photographing Shanghai,
I encountered this
insider/outsider phenomena

39:43.381 --> 39:45.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in the most personal of ways.

39:45.149 --> 39:49.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would walk into an old
neighborhood in
the center of city, and people
would begin

39:49.587 --> 39:51.389 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to point at you.

39:51.422 --> 39:54.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People would begin to talk about
you, spreading
the word about the outsider who
has wandered

39:54.259 --> 39:58.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into their midst, look at him,
he's got a
camera, what's he doing, is this
allowed,

39:58.263 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is this OK, how should be
respond to him,
et cetera, et cetera.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what were you
trying to
capture?

40:04.102 --> 40:10.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: Well, I was
trying to capture
a way of living in the city that
was under

40:10.375 --> 40:16.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
immense pressure, that was being
radically
transformed right before my
eyes.

40:16.381 --> 40:24.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These neighborhoods were filled
in a hugely
disproportionate way with
relatively old people,

40:24.155 --> 40:29.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who the Chinese back then
already were
speaking of as a lost
generation, people who,

40:29.127 --> 40:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
during the cultural revolution,
had not gone
to college because Chinese
schools were closed,

40:35.600 --> 40:40.104 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and who had often been sent to
the countryside
as a way of political training.

40:40.138 --> 40:45.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, so when China opens up
at the end
of the 1970s and begins to
reform its economy

40:45.143 --> 40:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and to become quasi-capitalist,
these people,
just by virtue of their own
timing in the

40:51.883 --> 40:57.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last century of their coming of
age, they
were not, most of them, eligible
for these

40:57.889 --> 41:01.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new competitive jobs that
capitalism was providing
to China.

41:01.392 --> 41:04.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so those were the
left-behind people in
those neighborhoods.

41:04.562 --> 41:08.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what does
that mean the
options are for the Chinese
government and

41:08.232 --> 41:10.001 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for the Chinese people?

41:10.034 --> 41:15.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do they reach some sort of
equilibrium
in terms of having enough people
to fill the

41:15.206 --> 41:17.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
jobs to keep the engine of their
economy going?

41:17.842 --> 41:23.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: China, the
world's most populous
country, 1.3, 1.4 billion
people, will in

41:23.881 --> 41:28.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the next decade or so have to
begin looking
for people outside of China.

41:28.553 --> 41:29.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does this mean?

41:29.721 --> 41:32.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China will have to become a much
more welcoming
society.

41:32.757 --> 41:38.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It means that China will have to
attract immigrants
from other countries in order to
slow the

41:38.763 --> 41:40.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aging of the population.

41:40.698 --> 41:45.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, if you're 1.3
billion, 1.4
billion people, where do you
find enough immigrants

41:45.636 --> 41:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in order to have a significant
impact on a
population of that size?

41:49.340 --> 41:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's no obvious candidate.

41:51.075 --> 41:55.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: China's need for
immigrants
stands in stark contrast to the
situation

41:55.179 --> 42:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the United States, which
French finds ironic,
in light of the current
political debate in

42:01.285 --> 42:03.121 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the U.S.

42:03.154 --> 42:06.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: The reason the
United States
is not aging rapidly in terms of
its demographics

42:06.924 --> 42:14.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is because we accept people as
newcomers to
this society in numbers that far
surpass any

42:14.766 --> 42:17.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of our major peers or rivals.

42:17.902 --> 42:20.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this is what replenishes the
work force.

42:20.471 --> 42:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It reinvigorates the society.

42:23.174 --> 42:25.710 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It underpins our tax base.

42:25.743 --> 42:32.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it is this immigration
that, in a way,
that has been largely
unappreciated in our

42:32.316 --> 42:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political debate, which really
is a kind of
churn of our economy.

42:36.454 --> 42:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Until China finds
a similar
churn for its economy,
immigration, increased

42:42.960 --> 42:49.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fertility or something else,
French says its
leaders are faced with some
bleak decisions,

42:49.667 --> 42:51.836 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
starting with scaling back the
military.

42:51.869 --> 42:55.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: Since the first
Gulf War in
1991, the Chinese have been
increasing their

42:55.940 --> 43:00.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military budget roughly by 11
percent a year
on average.

43:00.144 --> 43:05.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's no way that China will
be able to
sustain that sort of military
expenditure.

43:05.383 --> 43:09.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the most important
reason is because
of its population changes.

43:09.353 --> 43:14.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that, says
French, may
well mean Chinese leaders are
eager to make

43:14.091 --> 43:18.095 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aggressive military moves now,
while they
still can.

43:18.129 --> 43:24.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HOWARD FRENCH: This is the
moment to go for
the ring, if you will, to try to
secure every

43:24.302 --> 43:30.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gain that you can, before the
huge costs come
home.

43:30.208 --> 43:35.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, therefore, we're seeing
China push very
hard in its immediate
neighborhood, particularly

43:35.980 --> 43:42.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the maritime zone surrounding
China, to
kind of create a security zone
for itself,

43:42.720 --> 43:51.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trying to lock in the
territorial and maritime
gains that it can now, before a
period of

43:51.462 --> 43:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much more difficult choices
arises some time
in the 2020s.

43:55.666 --> 44:01.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you can read
Howard French's
full article online at our
partner, "The Atlantic"'s

44:01.873 --> 44:05.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Web site.

That's TheAtlantic.com.

44:11.849 --> 44:22.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Four days out from
the Olympic
Opening Ceremonies in Rio de
Janeiro, it's

44:22.627 --> 44:24.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not a pretty picture.

44:24.562 --> 44:29.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are warnings about the
risk of contaminated
waterways, and the dispute
continues between

44:29.767 --> 44:34.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anti-doping officials and the
chief of the
International Olympic Committee
over Russia's

44:34.639 --> 44:36.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
participation.

44:36.140 --> 44:39.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, there's excitement
around the actual
competition.

44:39.744 --> 44:43.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown got a preview of
U.S. medal
hopes with Christine Brennan,
sportswriter

44:43.881 --> 44:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and columnist for USA Today and
ABC News.

44:46.918 --> 44:49.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Christine
Brennan, welcome
back.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN, USA Today:
Thanks, Jeff.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Great to be here.

44:52.023 --> 44:52.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, there's a
certain point
we talk about all the problems,
but a certain

44:52.857 --> 44:53.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
point, let the games begin,
right?

44:53.691 --> 44:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Exactly.

44:54.692 --> 44:55.826 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's time.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, let's talk
about athletics
here.

44:57.595 --> 45:01.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Often, Summer Olympics,
Americans, and we
have talk over the years about
especially

45:01.899 --> 45:03.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gymnastics, swimming and other
things.

45:03.901 --> 45:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Start with gymnastics, another
big year coming.

45:05.603 --> 45:07.438 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Oh,
absolutely.

45:07.471 --> 45:10.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, it may be the biggest
year ever for
USA gymnastics, especially the
women's side,

45:10.741 --> 45:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff, which is saying something,
because U.S.
women have become the dominant
gymnasts in

45:14.345 --> 45:18.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the world, going back to the
days of Mary
Lou Retton, Shannon Miller,
obviously Gabby

45:18.749 --> 45:19.717 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Douglas.

45:19.750 --> 45:20.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just last time.

45:20.952 --> 45:21.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Right.

45:21.953 --> 45:22.920 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Exactly.

45:22.954 --> 45:24.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And she's back.

45:24.855 --> 45:27.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She did make it and will be a
steadying influence,
I think, and helpful to the next
big names.

45:27.325 --> 45:31.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, in this list of names I just
mentioned,
there is another one coming,
maybe the best

45:31.629 --> 45:33.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of all, Simone Biles.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She has won everything.

45:35.566 --> 45:39.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Maybe the best --
she is coming
in already talked about as one
of the best

45:39.604 --> 45:40.571 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ever.

45:40.605 --> 45:41.572 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

45:41.606 --> 45:43.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Exactly.

45:43.341 --> 45:45.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, she's so good that
everyone
just is basically handing her
the gold medal

45:45.109 --> 45:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for the individual all-around.

45:46.811 --> 45:49.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Team gold medal should be the
United States',
no problem.

45:49.213 --> 45:50.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And then...

45:50.214 --> 45:51.382 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, no pressure
at all, right?

45:51.415 --> 45:52.650 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, and
that's the point,
though.

45:52.683 --> 45:53.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a great point.

45:53.684 --> 45:54.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

45:54.919 --> 45:57.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: She did
stumble at the
Olympic trials.

45:57.254 --> 45:58.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything was set.

45:58.255 --> 45:59.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She was going to make the team.

45:59.490 --> 46:02.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And she had a couple
uncharacteristic bobbles
and a fall.

46:02.426 --> 46:07.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you know, from watching
sports, as
everyone at home knows, just
when you think

46:07.465 --> 46:12.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know it's solid and it's
guaranteed, is
there going to be a crack here?

46:12.436 --> 46:16.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think she is so good and so
strong, and
because she's won world title
after world

46:16.440 --> 46:20.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
title, the top gymnast in the
world the last
three or four years, I would be
stunned if

46:20.144 --> 46:22.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Simone Biles has a misstep.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.448 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But that's a tall order.

46:24.482 --> 46:28.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it's also over a
week-and-a-half basically
of events, and we will see how
she handles

46:28.285 --> 46:29.253 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that pressure.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

46:30.287 --> 46:31.822 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Swimming, return of two big
stars, right?

46:31.856 --> 46:36.527 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael Phelps, to my amazement,
I read it's
his fifth Olympics coming back.

46:36.560 --> 46:38.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Right.

46:38.062 --> 46:40.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, he was a 15-year-old in
2000 -- most
people forget that -- in Sydney.

46:40.831 --> 46:42.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's now 31 years old.

46:42.700 --> 46:45.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's a dad, and he says he has
cleaned up
his act.

46:45.970 --> 46:49.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's had issues of course with
drunk driving
and other things.

46:49.073 --> 46:50.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is it.

46:50.074 --> 46:51.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's his last gasp.

46:51.075 --> 46:52.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: He says this is
really it.

46:52.977 --> 46:54.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: This is
really it, as opposed
to the other time when he was
retiring the

46:54.412 --> 46:56.213 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
last time.

46:56.247 --> 46:59.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Phelps is still at one --
certainly the
best in the United States at
what he does,

46:59.417 --> 47:01.585 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the 100 butterfly, 200
butterfly.

47:01.619 --> 47:04.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether -- the key question,
Jeff, is whether
he's the best in the world.

47:04.488 --> 47:09.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his times in Omaha at the
Olympic swimming
trials a month or so ago were
not the best

47:09.226 --> 47:10.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the world.

47:10.227 --> 47:11.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were not his best.

47:11.862 --> 47:14.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the question is, for Michael
Phelps, can
he get better, can he get
faster?

47:14.298 --> 47:18.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Otherwise, while we just expect
him to win
everything, it might be a little
bit of a

47:18.135 --> 47:19.637 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
surprise.

47:19.670 --> 47:22.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe he will win the 100 fly,
which is an
incredible achievement, 200 fly.

47:22.673 --> 47:26.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the reality is, there is a
lot of competition
from around the world, and these
guys would

47:26.644 --> 47:27.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
love to beat Michael Phelps.

47:27.845 --> 47:29.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And on the
women's side, Katie
Ledecky.

47:29.714 --> 47:31.716 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Oh, Katie
Ledecky is gold.

47:31.749 --> 47:35.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, that's -- I think if you
said to me,
what would be the most
surprising to happen

47:35.553 --> 47:39.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the Olympics in terms of a
U.S. athlete,
it would be Katie Ledecky not
winning.

47:39.323 --> 47:41.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Really?

47:41.192 --> 47:44.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: She should be
five seconds,
six seconds ahead in the 400, 11
seconds ahead

47:44.595 --> 47:45.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the 800 freestyle.

47:45.596 --> 47:47.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She has also got the 200 free.

47:47.431 --> 47:49.734 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then she would have the
4x200 relay.

47:49.767 --> 47:54.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if everything goes well for
Katie Ledecky,
it would be four gold medals,
the most for

47:54.605 --> 47:58.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any American, I'm sure, at these
Games in
terms of swimming, and she will
really come

47:58.609 --> 48:02.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of the Olympics -- if all
that happens,
she will come out of the
Olympics as the swimming

48:02.546 --> 48:03.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
star of the Games for the U.S.

48:04.014 --> 48:05.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

48:05.249 --> 48:06.751 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if we look -- now I want to
switch to
track and field.

48:06.784 --> 48:09.620 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there the doping scandal has
an impact.

48:09.653 --> 48:11.789 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But start first with Usain Bolt.

48:11.822 --> 48:12.790 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Yes.

48:12.823 --> 48:13.791 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is back, right.

48:13.824 --> 48:14.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is trying to do a triple
double.

48:14.825 --> 48:16.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A triple double,
yes.

48:16.093 --> 48:17.528 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: We hear that
all the time
in basketball.

48:17.561 --> 48:19.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's the triple double in
track and field,
Jeff.

48:19.463 --> 48:24.135 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's winning the men's 100 and
the men's 200
in three consecutive Olympics.

48:24.168 --> 48:25.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Beijing, he did it.

48:25.903 --> 48:28.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People remember how he finishes
the race,
by turning around and jumping up
and down,

48:28.973 --> 48:33.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and looking at his competitors,
and dancing
while he's still running, and
has these incredible

48:33.611 --> 48:35.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
times, and then he did it again
in London.

48:35.579 --> 48:36.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, here he is.

48:36.714 --> 48:39.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will be 30 years old on the
day the Games
end.

48:39.917 --> 48:41.452 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's not exactly a spring
chicken.

48:41.485 --> 48:42.453 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:42.486 --> 48:43.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Has had some
injuries.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: And he had a
hamstring
pull just a few weeks ago.

48:45.489 --> 48:46.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He says he's healthy.

48:46.524 --> 48:48.292 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We will see.

48:48.325 --> 48:51.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, the Russian
doping scandal,
we know has an impact already in
the track

48:51.162 --> 48:52.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and field, right?

48:52.163 --> 48:53.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: We do.

48:53.164 --> 48:54.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

48:54.165 --> 48:55.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what impact
would it have?

48:55.232 --> 48:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Well, I think
it's a big
one.

48:56.834 --> 48:58.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the reality.

48:58.335 --> 49:02.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russian track and field team
is banned,
except for one lone long jumper.

49:02.239 --> 49:07.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the fact that they were
second in the
medal count in London, Jeff, in
track and

49:07.711 --> 49:13.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
field, they had won seven gold
and they won
16 medals overall.

49:13.250 --> 49:14.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And those medals now are gone.

49:14.385 --> 49:16.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are just not going to be
able to win
them.

49:16.220 --> 49:20.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while I personally believe
Russia should
have been banned completely, the
entire team,

49:20.558 --> 49:24.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for state-sponsored,
government-sponsored
systemic doping, the likes of
which we have

49:24.128 --> 49:30.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not seen since East Germany 40,
50 years ago,
the reality is Russia is in the
Games.

49:30.234 --> 49:35.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But track and field is where the
federation
said, no, we're not going to
allow this cheating

49:35.472 --> 49:39.109 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
system, this incredible,
diabolical system
to get into our sports.

49:39.143 --> 49:41.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, the track and field
federation kicked
out the Russians.

49:41.712 --> 49:45.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's where you will see, I
think, a
significant impact in terms of
the lack of

49:45.149 --> 49:46.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Russian medals, obviously.

49:46.917 --> 49:49.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the U.S. and other countries
will benefit
from that.

49:49.353 --> 49:53.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Speaking of
medals, right,
let's look at just some big
picture here in

49:53.724 --> 49:55.492 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our last minute.

49:55.526 --> 50:01.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More women competing and medal
count, give
me a look at the big picture
when you watch

50:01.232 --> 50:02.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
these Games.

50:02.233 --> 50:03.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Right.

50:03.367 --> 50:06.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeff, we called the 2012 U.S.
team Team Title
IX.

50:06.070 --> 50:11.809 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, we can call this team, the
2016 team,
Team Title IX as well, the most
women ever

50:11.842 --> 50:15.045 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by any country being sent to the
Olympics.

50:15.079 --> 50:18.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. is sending 292 women
out of a team
of 555.

50:18.482 --> 50:23.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That is all about watching that
law, Title
IX, signed in 1972 by Richard
Nixon, work

50:23.687 --> 50:25.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its way through our culture.

50:25.556 --> 50:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the power of U.S. women will
be extraordinary,
team sports, dominating
basketball, maybe

50:31.028 --> 50:34.398 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
soccer, water polo, others, the
rowing.

50:34.431 --> 50:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And then as far as medal
count...

50:36.267 --> 50:38.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The basketball
team hasn't
-- you were telling me before,
right, hasn't

50:38.235 --> 50:39.670 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
lost since...

50:39.703 --> 50:40.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: The women's
basketball
team hasn't lost since 1992.

50:41.005 --> 50:41.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

50:42.006 --> 50:43.774 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Yes.

50:43.807 --> 50:45.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one of the reasons people
don't know is
this is because they're so
dominant, that

50:45.476 --> 50:49.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the media tends to go, oh, give
them the gold
medal and move on to other
sports.

50:49.079 --> 50:50.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

50:50.080 --> 50:51.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They won again.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And women's soccer, of course,
will be a big
deal as well.

50:53.183 --> 50:55.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, as far as the medal
count, the U.S.
should do as it usually does at
the Summer

50:55.119 --> 51:00.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Games and dominate, especially
with Russia
being down, understandably so,
correctly.

51:00.624 --> 51:02.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think the U.S. will do very
well.

51:02.559 --> 51:04.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
China will be there.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It will be interesting to see if
Great Britain,
which had a great Games, home
Games, four

51:07.197 --> 51:11.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years ago, if they can keep that
up and continue
to win medals in sports where no
one expected

51:11.302 --> 51:12.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
them to do that in 2012.

51:12.937 --> 51:15.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can they keep it up now when
they go to Rio
in 2016?

51:15.606 --> 51:18.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Christine
Brennan, enjoy yourself
down there.

51:18.876 --> 51:19.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

51:19.877 --> 51:24.782 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINE BRENNAN: Thank you,
Jeff.

51:24.815 --> 51:26.750 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I will.

51:26.784 --> 51:28.619 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thanks.

51:28.652 --> 51:33.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"

abroad was inspired

51:33.857 --> 51:36.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to help when the revolution
began.
