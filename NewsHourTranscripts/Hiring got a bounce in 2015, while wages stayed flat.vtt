JUDY WOODRUFF: The final jobs
U.S. report
for 2015 helped finish the year
off with solid

00:07.040 --> 00:14.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growth. Overall, the economy
added 2.6 million
jobs last year. Combined with
2014, that led

00:14.314 --> 00:18.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a two-year gain in jobs that
was the best
since the late '90s.

00:18.118 --> 00:24.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, yet, wage growth remained
slow or modest
at best for the year, around 2.5
percent.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tom Perez is the secretary of
labor, and he
joins me now.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to the program.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ, U.S. Secretary of
Labor: Pleasure
to be with you and all your
viewers.

00:31.465 --> 00:35.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, this is a
strong year of
growth. I saw one report that
said it's -- called

00:35.869 --> 00:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it a red-hot hiring spree.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.173 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's behind this? What was
driving this?

00:40.207 --> 00:43.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, your
introduction is really
spot on.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you look at the last two
years, not simply
the last month -- and, by the
way, the best

00:47.014 --> 00:52.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
month of -- the best quarter of
2015 was the
last quarter of 2015 -- when you
look at the

00:52.219 --> 00:57.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
last two years, this is the best
two-year
stretch we have had since the
late '90s.

00:57.858 --> 01:04.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at auto sales. Last
year was the
hottest year for auto sales in
history. You

01:04.965 --> 01:10.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at the -- you look at the
fact that this
six-year stretch of auto sales
is the best

01:10.604 --> 01:14.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stretch we have had since the
end of World
War II. And you look at not only
the quantity

01:14.775 --> 01:19.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of jobs, Judy, but the quality
of jobs, because
what we're seeing over the last
two years

01:19.813 --> 01:23.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not only good numbers, but
very good quality.

01:23.517 --> 01:26.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you look at, for instance,
professional
and business services. That's
been the biggest

01:26.987 --> 01:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
growth area over the last two
years. These
are good jobs. Construction had
a good year

01:30.624 --> 01:37.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
last year. And with the
infrastructure bill
that passed at the end of last
year, I expect

01:37.130 --> 01:38.999 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
construction will continue to do
well.

01:39.032 --> 01:46.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Health care, notwithstanding the
truth deniers
who say the ACA is a job killer,
the health

01:46.106 --> 01:48.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care has been a recession...

01:48.575 --> 01:49.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The health care
law.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: That's been a
recession-proof
industry.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, quantity and quality has
been moving forward,
and that's a good thing.

01:54.414 --> 01:58.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, much of the
underlying
data is strong, Mr. Secretary,
but there still

01:58.452 --> 02:00.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are some signs of concern.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Sure.

02:01.989 --> 02:05.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I want to ask
you if it's
concern. It looks as if jobs
that pay at the

02:05.325 --> 02:10.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
higher end, people earning more,
are doing
better than those in the middle-
and lower-income

02:10.931 --> 02:14.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
levels. Wage -- as we just
mentioned, wage
growth is stagnant.

02:14.234 --> 02:20.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How do you explain that
persistent stubbornness
in terms of getting wages
higher?

02:20.741 --> 02:26.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, what
invariably happens
in a recovery is the jobs that
come back first

02:26.179 --> 02:29.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are the lower-paying jobs, and
that's what
happened in this recovery.

02:29.416 --> 02:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now what you're seeing in recent
years, which
is a good thing, is that more
jobs that pay

02:33.220 --> 02:38.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
better are coming back. And
that's what I
was mentioning about the last
two years. The

02:38.792 --> 02:45.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenge of wage stagnation is
an undeniable
challenge and it predates the
great recession.

02:45.565 --> 02:50.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year's real wage growth of
2.1 percent
was the best we have had since
the recovery

02:50.937 --> 02:56.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
began. And so that's solid, but
that's not
enough. And, again, this issue
dates back

02:56.510 --> 03:03.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to really the late '70s. And for
decades after
World War II, productivity and
real wage growth

03:03.917 --> 03:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
went hand in hand. Americans
helped bake the
pie of prosperity and they
shared in those

03:09.256 --> 03:10.991 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
benefits.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then it became delinked
starting in the
late '70s, with the exception of
the end of

03:14.628 --> 03:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Clinton administration. And
so we still
have real work to do on real
wage growth.

03:19.099 --> 03:20.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's the unfinished business.

03:20.934 --> 03:24.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it sounds
like something,
though, that you expect to
continue, the slow

03:24.638 --> 03:26.406 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wage...

03:26.440 --> 03:28.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, last year,
again, was
the best year we have seen in
the recovery.

03:29.009 --> 03:33.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the end of the Clinton
administration,
the unemployment rate was 4
percent. And so

03:33.780 --> 03:38.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the things we can do to
put upward
pressure on wages is to continue
to have tight

03:38.118 --> 03:42.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
labor markets. Another thing we
can do is
to raise the minimum wage.
Another thing we

03:42.489 --> 03:46.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can do is the regulations the
president has
directed us to do to make sure
that people

03:46.626 --> 03:48.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who work overtime get paid
overtime.

03:48.962 --> 03:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then investing in skills is
a tried-and-true
method of helping people get
access to those

03:54.468 --> 03:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
middle-class jobs that are out
there in I.T.
and other sectors.

03:57.404 --> 04:01.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Broaden this out
for us. We
know that, globally, China is
slowing down.

04:01.741 --> 04:05.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done a lot of reporting
on that, what's
happening to China's market.
That's having

04:05.345 --> 04:06.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
global repercussions.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Sure.

04:07.514 --> 04:11.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then you have
oil, the
price of oil, at record lows.

04:11.118 --> 04:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much do you worry about the
effect of
things like that on the U.S.
economy and U.S.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.357 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs?

04:17.390 --> 04:21.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, the price of
oil as it
is now for consumers is an
unmitigated boon.

04:21.728 --> 04:27.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You go to a gas pump, and you're
paying less
than $2 a gallon. The average
family last

04:27.968 --> 04:33.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year had about $500 to $800 of
additional
money in their pockets. That's
good for consumers.

04:33.673 --> 04:38.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what do they do with that
money? They
spend it. And so you see very
good numbers

04:39.012 --> 04:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on consumer spending in the
United States.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Unless you're
working in the
oil industry.

04:42.415 --> 04:46.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: And, of course,
the challenge
for those working in the sector
-- and we

04:46.286 --> 04:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have seen that impact in the
mining sector,
which is where the oil jobs are
found.

04:51.958 --> 04:58.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, certainly, the headwinds
from China,
and others in the strong dollar,
it's more

04:58.398 --> 05:03.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
difficult to manufacture, and so
the manufacturing
numbers in 2015 weren't as good.

05:03.670 --> 05:08.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, again, we had these
headwinds in 2015
as well. I did a lot of numbers
days interviews

05:08.742 --> 05:13.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when people said the market was
volatile over
the last two weeks. Isn't --
isn't -- the

05:13.313 --> 05:16.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
job numbers, aren't they going
to go down?

05:16.183 --> 05:23.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you look, and you see we
have had two
years in a row of north of
200,000 jobs a

05:23.156 --> 05:24.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
month on average. That's solid.

05:24.958 --> 05:28.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One other thing I
want to ask
you about, Mr. Secretary, is the
labor force

05:28.562 --> 05:35.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
participation rate. It continues
at what I
understand to be a four-decade
low. What is

05:35.368 --> 05:42.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it, 62 percent of Americans who
want to be
or would like to be in the labor
force actually

05:42.242 --> 05:44.010 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have a job.

05:44.044 --> 05:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So how do you -- what's the
prospect for the
future for people who want to
work, either

05:48.148 --> 05:51.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
don't have the job they want or
don't have
any job?

05:51.384 --> 05:56.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Well, the labor
force participation
rate over the last year has been
basically

05:56.523 --> 05:59.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the same. It's about 62.6
percent.

05:59.993 --> 06:05.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's been a very narrow
band. And the
reason it has gone down from,
say, 10 years

06:05.432 --> 06:10.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ago, 15 years ago, even five
years ago, the
primary reason it's gone down is
because of

06:10.737 --> 06:16.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the aging of the population.
Economists say
that roughly 50 percent of the
reduction in

06:16.176 --> 06:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
labor force participation is
attributable
to demographics.

06:21.548 --> 06:26.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The main thing that we could do
to increase
labor force participation at a
policy level

06:26.419 --> 06:32.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is to enact federal paid leave.
The countries
that have enacted paid leave
laws -- and Canada

06:32.926 --> 06:37.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a great example. In 2000, the
female labor
force participation in the U.S.
and Canada

06:37.097 --> 06:38.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was identical.

06:38.865 --> 06:42.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because of their investment in
paid leave,
they are now 8 percent ahead of
the United

06:42.235 --> 06:47.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States. If we had kept pace, we
would have
5.5 million more women in the
workplace, making

06:47.207 --> 06:51.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Silicon Valley and Wall
Street look more
like America, making our
Medicare trust fund

06:51.845 --> 06:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Social Security trust fund
more secure.

06:53.913 --> 06:56.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a big debate
about that
right now out on the campaign
trail.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.151 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
THOMAS PEREZ: Amen.

06:58.184 --> 06:59.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Labor Secretary
Tom Perez,
thank you very much.

06:59.552 --> 06:59.586 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOMAS PEREZ: Always a pleasure.
