JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.
Gwen Ifill is away.

00:07.741 --> 00:12.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: What
the death
of Justice Antonin Scalia means
for the future

00:12.846 --> 00:18.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Supreme Court, and the
race for the
White House. Also ahead, we look
at Justice

00:18.752 --> 00:22.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Scalia's three-decade legacy on
the court.

00:22.823 --> 00:28.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And why the residents of Freddie
Gray's Baltimore
neighborhood don't trust the
city's big hospitals.

00:28.829 --> 00:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JAY PERMAN, President,
University of Maryland,
Baltimore: It takes a long time,
I think,

00:32.966 --> 00:38.238 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for people to understand that
the days of
hidden experimentation are over.

00:38.338 --> 00:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:42.276 --> 00:46.380 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:46.480 --> 01:00.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Deadly attacks
blasted hospitals
and schools across Northern
Syria today, killing

01:00.294 --> 01:05.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nearly 50 civilians, many of
them children.
It signaled again there's no end
in sight

01:05.866 --> 01:09.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the war, despite plans for a
temporary
cease-fire.

01:10.070 --> 01:14.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Activists blamed Russian
airstrikes, and the
White House condemned the
attacks. We will

01:14.608 --> 01:18.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
get a detailed account later in
the program.

01:18.278 --> 01:23.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amid tensions across the Middle
East, Saudi
Arabia today launched its
largest war games

01:23.483 --> 01:28.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ever. The drills involve 20
mostly Arab and
African countries. The Saudis
are already

01:29.089 --> 01:33.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fighting Shiite rebels in Yemen,
and they
have offered to help fight the
Islamic State

01:33.727 --> 01:35.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
group in Syria.

01:35.929 --> 01:42.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Mexico, Pope Francis praised
the country's
indigenous people and denounced
their exploitation

01:42.135 --> 01:48.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today. The first Latin American
pontiff traveled
to San Cristobal de las Casas in
Chiapas state

01:49.076 --> 01:54.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
midway through his five-day
visit. Francis
celebrated mass in three
languages native

01:54.548 --> 02:00.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the region before a crowd of
thousands.
And he condemned centuries of
ill treatment

02:00.287 --> 02:02.289 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of Mexico's Indians.

02:02.389 --> 02:06.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): On many occasions,
in a systematic

02:07.027 --> 02:12.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and organized way, your people
have been misunderstood
and excluded from society. Some
have considered

02:12.299 --> 02:17.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
your values, culture and
traditions to be
inferior. Others, intoxicated by
power, money

02:17.671 --> 02:20.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and market trends, have stolen
your lands
or contaminated them.

02:20.807 --> 02:26.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The pope's foray
into Southern
Mexico is aimed in part at
boosting the Catholic

02:26.179 --> 02:30.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
faith in a region where
Protestant denominations
have made inroads.

02:31.051 --> 02:36.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Four American journalists are in
custody in
Bahrain after being detained on
Sunday. Police

02:36.890 --> 02:42.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say they were rounded up in the
Shiite community
of Sitra, having entered the
country illegally.

02:42.195 --> 02:48.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happened during protests that
marked a
Shiite uprising in the Arab
spring of 2011.

02:48.635 --> 02:54.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The family of one of the
Americans denies
that they did anything illegal.

02:54.141 --> 02:59.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Steelworkers from across Europe
converged
on Brussels today to protest
imports of cheap

02:59.513 --> 03:05.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
steel from China. Thousands
carried flags
and banners warning the European
Union not

03:05.752 --> 03:11.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to grant China market economy
status. They
said that would let Beijing
flood the market

03:11.224 --> 03:13.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with even more steel.

03:13.126 --> 03:19.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: We are protesting because
we want fair
competition for the steel
industry in Europe.

03:19.232 --> 03:27.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nowadays, huge amounts of steel
are being
brought in, imported in Europe
from China,

03:27.541 --> 03:34.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we cannot compete with this,
because the
prices that are now paid in
Europe are very

03:34.748 --> 03:36.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
low.

03:36.650 --> 03:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The European
steel industry
accuses China of using illegal
export subsidies

03:41.088 --> 03:44.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to sell products at below
production cost.

03:44.925 --> 03:49.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here in the U.S., Wall
Street was closed
for the President's Day holiday,
but world

03:49.629 --> 03:55.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
markets shot higher. The rally
was led by
stocks in Japan and hopes for
more stimulus

03:55.635 --> 04:01.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in Europe. Investors also
welcomed news that
China's Central Bank has fixed
the value of

04:01.108 --> 04:04.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Chinese currency at a
stronger rate.

04:04.711 --> 04:09.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the grueling
battle over the next Supreme
Court nominee

04:09.449 --> 04:15.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
takes shape in Congress and on
the campaign
trail; a hospital targeted in
Syria, just

04:16.089 --> 04:21.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
days after a cease-fire; plus,
efforts to
reverse grim health outcomes in
one of the

04:22.095 --> 04:37.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nation's poorest cities.

04:37.577 --> 04:43.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The death of Justice Antonin
Scalia not only
complicates the upcoming Supreme
Court term,

04:43.250 --> 04:47.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but also has enormous
ramifications on the
political landscape. The Senate
is ramping

04:47.821 --> 04:53.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
up for a battle of epic
proportions, as President
Obama plans to fulfill his
constitutional

04:53.727 --> 04:56.796 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
obligation and nominate someone
to the court.

04:56.897 --> 05:01.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To help us understand what is
next, we are
joined by our regular
court-watcher, Marcia

05:01.601 --> 05:06.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Coyle, chief Washington
correspondent for
"The National Law Journal," and
John Stanton.

05:06.673 --> 05:10.143 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's Washington bureau chief for
BuzzFeed.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome you both to the
program.

05:12.913 --> 05:17.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marcia, let me start with,
before we got to
what we just -- what I was just
saying. You

05:17.517 --> 05:22.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
covered Justice Scalia, you were
just telling
me, for more than 20 years. What
is your most

05:22.589 --> 05:24.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
enduring impression of him?

05:24.457 --> 05:27.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
Well, Judy, I think the public
will remember

05:27.994 --> 05:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him most for some of his angry,
bombastic,
funny comments in his opinions.

05:36.069 --> 05:41.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I that really sort of
diminishes the man.
When I think of Justice Scalia,
I remember

05:42.008 --> 05:49.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his quick wit, how in private he
was charming,
almost humble, passionate, as
passionate about

05:50.083 --> 05:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
his love of his country as he
was in his opinions.

05:53.653 --> 05:59.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let's talk
about what
the Constitution says, first of
all, about

05:59.226 --> 06:04.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
what the president's
responsibility is after
there is a vacancy on the court.
Is there

06:04.431 --> 06:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any doubt, Marcia, that the
president is supposed
to nominate someone?

06:07.500 --> 06:11.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: No, there's no
doubt at all.
The Constitution says, the
Appointments Clause,

06:11.805 --> 06:18.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says that the president shall
appoint, by
and with the advice and consent
of the Senate,

06:18.445 --> 06:20.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
judges to the courts, the
Supreme Court.

06:20.947 --> 06:27.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is there any
leeway, any
exceptions through precedent,
through history?

06:27.854 --> 06:30.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: For the president
not to do
that?

06:30.957 --> 06:31.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

06:31.625 --> 06:32.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Exactly.

06:32.592 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Not to my
knowledge, no.

06:34.561 --> 06:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, you
know, from once
the president names someone,
it's the Senate's

06:38.965 --> 06:45.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility to consider that
nomination.
Any leeway that the Senate has
in terms of

06:45.705 --> 06:47.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what it's supposed to do?

06:47.641 --> 06:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN STANTON, Washington Bureau
Chief, BuzzFeed:
Well, by precedent, they are
kind of a little

06:49.542 --> 06:52.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bit -- they are required to do
something at
some point.

06:52.479 --> 06:57.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, there is no rule that
says that
they have to take up the
nomination, they

06:57.484 --> 07:01.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to hold hearings. It's
never been done
before. But they could very
easily essentially

07:01.588 --> 07:04.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wait out the president until
they get the
past the election to the next
year to see

07:04.624 --> 07:06.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who becomes the new president.

07:06.559 --> 07:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's kind of what Mitch
McConnell, the
Senate majority leader, said he
wants to do.

07:08.628 --> 07:12.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, I was going
to add, who
are the -- we know there are
some key players

07:12.799 --> 07:14.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the Senate on this. Who are
they and what
are they saying?

07:15.001 --> 07:21.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN STANTON: Well, I think the
ones to look
at are McConnell and Grassley
and Ted Cruz

07:21.441 --> 07:23.276 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
right now, frankly.

07:23.376 --> 07:25.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the three of them. And
they have all
said that they do not want to
have a nominee

07:26.079 --> 07:30.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
come forward. They have asked
the president
not to do it. I think that if
Cruz were to

07:30.884 --> 07:34.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
become a nominee, you could see
a situation
in which he might want to have
hearings. He's

07:34.554 --> 07:38.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the Judiciary Committee. This
could prove
to give him some free press and
a platform

07:38.858 --> 07:43.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in which to attack the
president, attack Democrats
and their policies, and show
he's really tough

07:43.863 --> 07:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on this stuff for his people.

07:45.732 --> 07:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that could actually work in
his favor.
So, you could in theory see that
kind of sort

07:49.302 --> 07:51.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of a Machiavellian move, but...

07:51.204 --> 07:54.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Marcia, so what
is the precedent
for a president in this
situation? What we

07:54.607 --> 07:59.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have seen in history? Has
presidents made
nominations that were just set
aside by the

08:00.013 --> 08:01.715 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Senate?

08:01.815 --> 08:05.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, first of
all, there is
really no tradition of leaving a
seat open

08:05.218 --> 08:07.821 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the Supreme Court during an
election year.

08:07.921 --> 08:13.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been nominations and
confirmations
during presidential election
years. There

08:13.760 --> 08:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been confirmations during
presidential
election years, with the
nomination coming,

08:19.566 --> 08:26.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, the year before. In fact,
Justice Anthony
Kennedy was confirmed during a
presidential

08:26.373 --> 08:32.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
election year -- he was a
Republican nominee
confirmed by a
Democratic-controlled Senate.

08:32.746 --> 08:38.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's important to know that
this process
can go forward if both sides are
willing to

08:38.918 --> 08:40.820 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do it.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A lot of
discussion about whether
the president could make a
recess appointment.

08:43.156 --> 08:44.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are the options there?

08:45.091 --> 08:47.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN STANTON: Well, I think the
White House
so far has said they're not
going to do that.

08:48.061 --> 08:52.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that could potentially
change. He
can legally do it. There's no
way to stop

08:52.665 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
him from doing that.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meaning, when
Congress is in
recess, name somebody.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN STANTON: Right.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The way the Congress could sort
of circumvent
that is if they just don't go
into recess

09:00.473 --> 09:07.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until after basically the --
until next January
right before the inauguration of
the new president.

09:07.213 --> 09:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they could just have these
pro forma sessions
where they come in every couple
of days.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Supreme Court said I believe
they have
-- that president can't do it in
a recess

09:15.021 --> 09:17.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that is longer or shorter than
10 days, I
believe.

09:17.590 --> 09:22.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Judy, the court
actually very
recently gave both the president
and Congress

09:22.295 --> 09:24.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something on this issue.

09:24.197 --> 09:29.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It said that the president can
nominate during
a recess, but the Senate
determines when it

09:29.436 --> 09:34.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is in recess. And even though
the Senate may
leave, it can continue to thwart
a recess

09:35.008 --> 09:43.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appointment by just doing some
nominal business.
So that really leaves it in the
Senate's hands

09:43.550 --> 09:45.385 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to decide whether they go
forward.

09:45.485 --> 09:50.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is precedent, as you
asked, Judy,
for a recess appointment to the
Supreme Court.

09:50.924 --> 09:56.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Eisenhower nominated
one of the
most influential justices of the
20th century

09:56.496 --> 10:01.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a recent appointment, William
Brennan.
He also nominated as a recess
appointment

10:01.434 --> 10:05.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Potter Stewart. So there is
precedent for
that.

10:06.072 --> 10:11.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Assuming, though,
Marcia, we're
headed for a showdown, a
collision with no

10:11.611 --> 10:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
solution in the coming year,
what are the
cases that are at stake this
year? What is

10:16.182 --> 10:23.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it that the court is going to be
deciding
that may not be decided because
of a lack

10:23.122 --> 10:24.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of that ninth justice?

10:24.991 --> 10:28.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, I look at
the cases in
two groups, first, cases that
have already

10:28.461 --> 10:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been argued, and the justices
have sat down
and voted on the outcomes of
those cases.

10:34.501 --> 10:39.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Justice Scalia had voted and
was actually
writing an opinion that could
have been announced,

10:39.472 --> 10:45.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say, even next week, when the
court comes
back to the bench, that is --
his vote, his

10:45.945 --> 10:51.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opinion is void. The court does
consider those
opinions that have not been
announced by the

10:51.618 --> 10:53.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
court draft opinions.

10:53.520 --> 10:58.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So those opinions, if he was
doing them, would
be possibly assigned to another
justice to

10:58.258 --> 11:04.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do. It would be a brand-new
opinion. Those
case right now that we are
looking at include,

11:05.064 --> 11:09.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, the affirmative
action challenge,
the big union challenge. The
second group

11:09.669 --> 11:15.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cases that are going to be
argued between
now and April very big cases
involving abortion

11:15.475 --> 11:22.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
clinics, President Obama's
immigration action,
as well as religious nonprofit
challenges

11:22.181 --> 11:24.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to contraceptive health
insurance.

11:24.117 --> 11:32.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court there may have 4-4
splits. It could
reorder re-arguments. Clearly,
an eight-justice

11:32.158 --> 11:36.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bench is not what this court
would really
like to see go on for any length
of time.

11:36.663 --> 11:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, John, what
about those
Republicans in the Senate who
are saying there

11:40.800 --> 11:46.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
should not, will not be a
confirmation take
place this year? Are they
prepared for that,

11:46.940 --> 11:50.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the outcome of these cases
to be in limbo
or to...

11:50.209 --> 11:54.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN STANTON: I think so. I
think that, as
far as they're concerned, this
is a thing

11:54.547 --> 11:57.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they very much care about,
their base
very much cares about it.

11:57.383 --> 12:01.955 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And if you look at how,
unfortunately, politics
has gone in this country the
last 10 years,

12:02.055 --> 12:05.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the members on both sides, but
particularly
in the Republican Party, are
being elected

12:05.358 --> 12:09.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they are willing to sort
of stand
up to something, right, stand up
to the president,

12:09.862 --> 12:11.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
stand up to the status quo.

12:11.764 --> 12:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by saying we are not going
to give this
guy another nomination to the
Supreme Court,

12:15.034 --> 12:20.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we want to wait until we maybe
hopefully get
our guy in, into the presidency,
that's a

12:20.573 --> 12:24.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
strong signal to their voters.
And I think
a lot of them see that as a
political win

12:24.177 --> 12:26.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for them and also as an
ideological win.

12:26.179 --> 12:30.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They don't want to see Obama
nominating anybody,
because they -- and I would
agree with them

12:30.883 --> 12:35.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
-- that he's not going to
nominate a conservative
to the bench to replace Scalia.
And I think

12:35.121 --> 12:37.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they feel like that has to
be replaced
by a conservative.

12:37.390 --> 12:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Marcia, is
there a sense that these cases
that would

12:41.327 --> 12:48.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be -- if there were to be 4-4
without -- essentially
without a decision, is there a
sense that

12:48.601 --> 12:52.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one side or another is going to
be predominantly
favored by that, advantaged?

12:53.072 --> 12:56.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Well, it depends
on whether
you won or lost in the lower
court.

12:57.010 --> 13:01.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the president's immigration
action, if
it was a 4-4 split, that would
be a major

13:01.614 --> 13:06.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
defeat for the president,
because he's challenging
the lower court decision. It
would be a major

13:06.853 --> 13:10.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defeat for abortion clinics who
are challenging
the Texas restriction.

13:10.723 --> 13:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It would be a major victory for
unions who
won in the lower court on fair
share fees.

13:16.663 --> 13:23.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it really depends. Also, we
need to take
something of a longer look here.
This is -- this

13:23.236 --> 13:27.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
appointment, if it is by a
Democratic president,
is a major -- could be a major
shift.

13:28.041 --> 13:32.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many areas of the law
that could
be affected, not just Citizens
United and

13:32.612 --> 13:38.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Second Amendment, but voting
rights, discrimination
cases, many areas.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Enormous
implications.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

13:41.120 --> 13:42.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're just
beginning to
look at them.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Marcia Coyle, John Stanton, we
thank you both.

13:44.590 --> 13:45.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN STANTON: Thank you.

13:45.558 --> 13:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: It's my pleasure,
Judy.

13:47.460 --> 13:52.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now let's
look in depth
at Justice Scalia's legacy, not
what's next,

13:52.165 --> 13:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
but what was left behind.

13:54.067 --> 13:58.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What effect did he have on the
court, how
the Constitution is interpreted
and how cases

13:58.738 --> 14:00.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are decided?

14:00.673 --> 14:04.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Jeffrey Brown gets an
assessment, and he starts
with some of Justice Scalia's
own thoughts

14:04.944 --> 14:06.946 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and comments in prior
interviews.

14:07.046 --> 14:12.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Over the years,
Antonin Scalia
found occasions to speak
publicly of his judicial

14:12.385 --> 14:14.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
philosophy.

14:14.153 --> 14:19.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late in 2012, with the release
of his book
"Reading Law: The Interpretation
of Legal

14:19.358 --> 14:21.227 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Text," he said this to Charlie
Rose:

14:21.327 --> 14:24.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANTONIN SCALIA, Associate
Justice, U.S. Supreme
Court: The key question is
simply this. Would

14:24.197 --> 14:31.304 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the American people have
ratified the document
if it said, the application of
this document

14:31.404 --> 14:37.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what it means shall be
whatever the Supreme
Court says it means from age to
age? Nobody

14:37.977 --> 14:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- nobody would have ratified
that document.

14:40.680 --> 14:44.450 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLIE ROSE, Host, "The Charlie
Rose Show":
It's a dead document to you?

14:44.550 --> 14:47.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIN SCALIA: I like to say an
enduring
document.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.288 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

14:49.388 --> 14:51.624 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLIE ROSE: But you don't say
it's a living
document.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANTONIN SCALIA: It's not living.
It's not
living.

14:53.893 --> 14:58.364 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: In that
conversation and others,
the justice also explained his
thinking on

14:58.464 --> 15:04.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some pivotal decisions and
dissents, including
the bitterly debated ruling that
decided the

15:04.370 --> 15:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
2000 presidential election, Bush
v. Gore.

15:06.506 --> 15:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLIE ROSE: They think it was
a political
decision because the politics of
the country

15:10.543 --> 15:15.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made you say we got to do this
the way we
did it in order to get this over
with. The

15:15.748 --> 15:19.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
court decided that, in the
interest of the
national -- in the national
interests, they

15:19.819 --> 15:20.953 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
got to get this over with.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

15:22.989 --> 15:27.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIN SCALIA: The remedy for a
case is always
subject to the court's
discretion, and always

15:27.393 --> 15:34.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
depends upon realities on the
ground, not
the law, but what the remedy
will be, whether

15:34.734 --> 15:39.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you tell them do it immediately,
give them
another two weeks. That's not an
issue of

15:39.272 --> 15:41.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
law. It's an issue of
practicality.

15:41.340 --> 15:46.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Earlier that
year, Justice
Scalia spoke to the "NewsHour"'s
Margaret

15:46.512 --> 15:51.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Warner, discussing his dissent
in the court's
ruling in favor of President
Obama's health

15:51.217 --> 15:55.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
care law, which cited the
government's power
to tax and impose penalties.

15:55.254 --> 16:00.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIN SCALIA: The issue is not
whether Congress
has the power to tax. The issue
is whether,

16:00.660 --> 16:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this particular law, Congress
was exercising
the power to tax.

16:06.199 --> 16:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in all of our prior cases,
we said that,
even if you call it a tax, if
it's being imposed

16:15.808 --> 16:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the violation of a law, it's
a penalty.
And this one wasn't even called
a tax. It

16:22.515 --> 16:24.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was called a penalty.

16:24.383 --> 16:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Justice Scalia,
the child of
Italian immigrants and first
Italian-American

16:27.987 --> 16:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the court, also spoke of his
heritage,
as here in a 2015 PBS
documentary.

16:33.526 --> 16:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTONIN SCALIA: I think for
Italian-Americans,
given what they most abhor,
which is their

16:40.666 --> 16:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
identification with crime and
the mafia, I
wouldn't be surprised if they
would be more

16:48.374 --> 16:54.413 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
proud to have an
Italian-American justice
than to have an Italian-American
president.

16:54.513 --> 16:59.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And now
reflections from three
legal scholars who head research
groups.

16:59.852 --> 17:04.156 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Edward Whelan of the
conservative Ethics and
Public Policy Center, he worked
as a law clerk

17:04.257 --> 17:09.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Justice Scalia in 1991 and
'92. Elizabeth
Wydra heads the progressive
Constitutional

17:09.896 --> 17:15.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Accountability Center, and
Jeffrey Rosen of
George Washington University and
the nonpartisan

17:15.234 --> 17:18.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Constitution Center in
Philadelphia.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to all three of you.

17:20.172 --> 17:25.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to start first with his,
Justice Scalia's
influence on jurisprudence, how
cases are

17:25.444 --> 17:27.213 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
talked about, how they're
decided.

17:27.313 --> 17:32.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Edward Whelan, you worked with
him. You saw
him in action. This idea of
originalism, how

17:32.585 --> 17:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
did he push it? What impact did
it have?

17:34.420 --> 17:38.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD WHELAN, Ethics and Public
Policy Center:
Well, he pushed it both as a
judge and as

17:39.091 --> 17:40.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an academic.

17:40.960 --> 17:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he pushed it through his
opinions. The
basic principle of textualism is
that a text

17:45.197 --> 17:51.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has a meaning to be discerned.
That's true
of the Constitution, where
originalism provides,

17:51.470 --> 17:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one seeks to figure out what the
meaning of
a constitutional provision was
at the time

17:56.842 --> 17:58.644 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it was adopted, likewise with
statutes.

17:58.744 --> 18:03.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One looks to decide -- to figure
out what
a meaning of the text is there.
He had tremendous

18:03.616 --> 18:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
influence on the Supreme Court
in moving it
away from reliance on
legislative history,

18:08.054 --> 18:13.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
especially the look to
legislative history
first to determine what a
statute means.

18:13.926 --> 18:17.763 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he also, I think, had
considerable influence
on constitutional
interpretation, including

18:17.863 --> 18:22.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perhaps most markedly in the
Heller Second
Amendment case in 2008.

18:22.168 --> 18:26.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Elizabeth Wydra,
you're on
the other side of Justice Scalia
on most legal

18:26.272 --> 18:31.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues, but did he change the
way you think
about the law, the way you argue
it?

18:31.410 --> 18:33.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA, Constitutional
Accountability
Center: Yes, absolutely.

18:33.312 --> 18:37.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I -- as a progressive, I
disagreed with Justice
Scalia on many, if not most of
the outcomes

18:37.883 --> 18:43.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of cases. But I absolutely agree
with his
embrace of the Constitution's
text and history.

18:43.990 --> 18:50.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And my organization, the
Constitutional Accountability
Center, was very much informed
by, or I guess

18:50.296 --> 18:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
formed almost in a reaction to
Justice Scalia's
strong embrace of text and
history.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.835 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Formed in
reaction, right?

18:55.935 --> 18:57.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: I mean, in
part, certainly.

18:57.770 --> 19:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as he strongly advocated for
conservative
outcomes based on the text and
history in

19:03.642 --> 19:10.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Supreme Court, progressives
like me and
like CAC, my organization, were
inspired to

19:10.149 --> 19:14.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say no from our perspective.
Let's disagree
on this, but let's talk about
that text and

19:14.420 --> 19:16.188 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

19:16.288 --> 19:17.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when we look at it, we think
it supports
progressive outcomes. But we
were having a

19:17.990 --> 19:20.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debate with each other. We were
not arguing
past each other.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In other words,
you're saying
he may be right about the way of
thinking

19:22.928 --> 19:24.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the law, but he's still
wrong on the
outcome.

19:24.897 --> 19:25.965 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: Right.

19:26.065 --> 19:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you are
arguing on his
terms?

19:27.533 --> 19:29.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: Well, I think
we're arguing
on the same terms...

19:29.201 --> 19:30.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

19:30.636 --> 19:32.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: ... the
Constitution, which
belongs to everyone.

19:32.605 --> 19:36.442 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think it was a good
example of how Americans
can argue about the meaning of
the Constitution

19:36.542 --> 19:41.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and really go toe to toe on
whether this is
a progressive document, as I
think, or a conservative

19:41.113 --> 19:43.049 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Jeffrey Rosen,
what would you
add to this? This is also a
justice who famously,

19:45.284 --> 19:49.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
"I'm an originalist and a
textualist, not
a nut." Right?

19:49.555 --> 19:51.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Explain what he meant by that?

19:51.490 --> 19:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY ROSEN, Law Professor,
George Washington
University: He meant that in a
good sense.

19:53.526 --> 19:58.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was talking about his friend
Justice Thomas,
and he said, "Unlike Justice
Thomas, I wouldn't

19:58.297 --> 20:02.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overturn every case that I think
is inconsistent
with original understanding,
because I'm not

20:02.301 --> 20:04.203 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a nut."

20:04.303 --> 20:07.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And he meant that very
affectionately. But
despite that pragmatism, the
fact that progressive

20:07.940 --> 20:12.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organizations like the wonderful
Constitutional
Accountability Center were
founded that text

20:12.878 --> 20:17.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in history could lead to
progressive, as well
as conservative results is a
sign of Scalia's

20:17.450 --> 20:19.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
incredible influence.

20:19.418 --> 20:23.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He must be counted one of the
most influential
and significant justices of the
20th century,

20:23.322 --> 20:27.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because he changed the terms of
constitutional
debate. He forced progressives
to make those

20:27.660 --> 20:29.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arguments and to try to beat him
at his own
game.

20:29.895 --> 20:34.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, sometimes, progressives
argue Justice
Scalia was an inconsistent
originalist, ignoring

20:34.567 --> 20:38.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the text and history in case
like Brown vs.
Board of Education, which is
hard to justify

20:38.704 --> 20:43.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on originalist grounds. Scalia's
response
was essentially, no theory is
perfect. I may

20:43.576 --> 20:47.246 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
not be able to justify
everything, but basically
I'm pretty good.

20:47.346 --> 20:52.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's really important to
note, too, the
series of cases where Scalia's
preferences

20:52.418 --> 20:57.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
diverged from his constitutional
preferences,
flag burning, the rights of
criminal defendants,

20:57.423 --> 21:01.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the right to confront your
accusers, the independent
counsel law. These are all cases
that favored

21:01.994 --> 21:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
liberal results because Scalia
felt the Constitution
compelled it.

21:05.698 --> 21:09.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for distinguishing policy
arguments and
constitutional arguments, I
think he deserves

21:09.635 --> 21:11.370 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great respect.

21:11.470 --> 21:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so we
asked all
three of you to come up, to
think about a

21:13.272 --> 21:16.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
key case and a few lines that
help illustrate
his thinking.

21:16.208 --> 21:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let me start with you, Ed, Ed
Whelan.

21:18.244 --> 21:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You chose something from the
famous Casey
case, the Planned Parenthood vs.
Casey. So,

21:24.450 --> 21:29.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lines are, "By foreclosing
all democratic
outlet for the deep passions
this issue arouses,

21:29.889 --> 21:33.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by banishing the issue from the
political
forum that gives all
participants, even the

21:33.692 --> 21:38.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
losers, the satisfaction of a
fair hearing
and an honest fight, by
continuing the imposition

21:38.464 --> 21:42.668 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of a rigid national rule,
instead of allowing
for regional differences, the
court merely

21:42.768 --> 21:45.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prolongs and intensifies the
anguish."

21:46.038 --> 21:47.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why did you pick those lines?

21:47.873 --> 21:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD WHELAN: Well, I think
that passage
captures Justice Scalia's belief
that so many

21:54.013 --> 22:00.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
issues that other people want to
constitutionalize
are really left to the political
processes

22:00.986 --> 22:03.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to decide one way or the other.

22:03.923 --> 22:09.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People often caricature Justice
Scalia as
a conservative, when in fact on
a whole host

22:09.995 --> 22:15.634 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of issues, whether it's
abortion, the death
penalty, same-sex marriage, his
position is

22:15.734 --> 22:20.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
not that the Constitution
entrenches his own
views, but rather that it leaves
the matter

22:20.706 --> 22:22.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to democratic processes.

22:22.575 --> 22:27.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's his ultimate humility about
the judicial
role and the sharp line drawn
between the

22:28.047 --> 22:32.318 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
role of the courts and the role
of the elected
branches.

22:32.418 --> 22:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you say that
running through
all his decisions and dissents?

22:35.821 --> 22:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD WHELAN: That's certainly
a basic theme.
Obviously, there are plenty of
times when

22:39.725 --> 22:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he saw that there were popular
enactments
that violated the Constitution.

22:43.963 --> 22:50.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The key challenge, I think, of
any justice
is to discern the line between
what the Constitution

22:51.070 --> 22:55.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allows and what it forbids and
to avoid imposing
one's own policy preferences.

22:55.774 --> 23:00.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
Elizabeth Wydra,
now, you picked one, a quote
from a case,

23:00.246 --> 23:02.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Crawford v. Washington.

23:02.181 --> 23:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's -- this is writing the
opinion for
the court -- "Dispensing with
confrontation

23:07.820 --> 23:13.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because testimony is obviously
reliable is
akin to dispensing with a jury
trial because

23:13.859 --> 23:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the defendant is obviously
guilty. This is
not what the Sixth Amendment
prescribes. "

23:19.331 --> 23:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why that? What does that tell
you about his
thinking?

23:21.267 --> 23:25.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: Well, Justice
Scalia, as
I mentioned earlier, was a
conservative justice,

23:25.971 --> 23:31.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but there were areas in which
progressives
and conservatives could agree
with his jurisprudence.

23:31.844 --> 23:36.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And criminal procedure and
criminal law were
some of those areas. And that
case shows that,

23:36.615 --> 23:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in some cases, he was quite the
friend to
criminal defendants and was very
strong on

23:42.121 --> 23:46.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ensuring that jury protections
to criminal
defendants were afforded.

23:46.358 --> 23:49.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there were other cases,
for example,
on the Fourth Amendment search
and seizure

23:49.561 --> 23:56.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
context, where he struck down
law enforcement
techniques that violated the
privacy and the

23:56.568 --> 24:02.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
founders' original idea that
your person,
papers and effects should be
kept private.

24:02.207 --> 24:07.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he isn't generally thought
of as a friend
to the less powerful -- and I
think in most

24:07.146 --> 24:11.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases he wasn't -- but certainly
in the criminal
defense area, he was from time
to time in

24:11.417 --> 24:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very important ways. And I think
that's a
big part of his legacy.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

24:15.187 --> 24:17.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Jeffrey Rosen, you're from
a dissent
in the Dickerson case.

24:17.890 --> 24:24.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Scalia's words were:
"Today's judgment
converts Miranda from a
milestone of judicial

24:24.263 --> 24:30.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
overreaching into the very
Cheops Pyramid
or perhaps the Sphinx would be a
better analogue

24:30.803 --> 24:32.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of judicial arrogance."

24:32.771 --> 24:36.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, you can parse the legal
part, but I suspect
you picked it because of the --
it shows a

24:36.875 --> 24:38.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
little bit of his colorful
language and thinking,
right?

24:38.744 --> 24:41.280 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY ROSEN: Well, it's
spectacular, and
also because it taught me to
pronounce it.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also thought it was Cheops
Pyramid. But
it's Cheops' Pyramid.

24:44.049 --> 24:44.416 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Cheops.

24:44.516 --> 24:45.617 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:45.718 --> 24:47.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY ROSEN: I learned that
from looking
it up.

24:47.553 --> 24:48.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, I will tell
you, I was
sure that that was a reference
to the Great

24:49.021 --> 24:49.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Pyramid. And I was right.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.690 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:51.790 --> 24:52.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY ROSEN: Well, absolutely.
No, this
was a smaller one that he was
really talking

24:52.524 --> 24:52.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

24:53.092 --> 24:54.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK.

24:54.993 --> 24:56.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY ROSEN: No, but the fact
that he made
you rush happily to the
dictionary to find

24:56.995 --> 25:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out these words was a sign of
how much he
taught us and made
constitutional law exciting.

25:01.066 --> 25:06.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I also loved his great line,
"The court has
mistaken a Kulturkampf for a fit
of spite."

25:06.538 --> 25:10.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I didn't know what Kulturkampf
was either.
And I found out after looking at
Google that

25:10.376 --> 25:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the culture war between
Bismarck and the
Catholic Church in the 19th
century. That

25:13.712 --> 25:15.514 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a gay rights case.

25:15.614 --> 25:19.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was just he was a deeply
literate man who
had such a joy in writing, was
such a beautiful

25:19.852 --> 25:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writer, the greatest since
Holmes and Robert
Jackson. And I think the fact
that his aphorisms

25:24.089 --> 25:27.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are so memorable made him the
influential
justice that he was.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Very briefly, did
he have an
impact on the law?

25:31.096 --> 25:32.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EDWARD WHELAN: OH, absolutely.

25:33.031 --> 25:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Jeff has mentioned, he really
transformed
the approach that the court has
taken and

25:38.170 --> 25:43.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has forced his opponents to
define themselves
against him. To be sure, some of
his greatest

25:43.208 --> 25:48.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opinions are dissents. I would
emphasize in
his second term on the court his
solo dissent

25:48.213 --> 25:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the independent counsel case,
Morrison
v. Olson, which also has some
beautiful passages.

25:53.285 --> 25:58.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the years, I think everyone
has recognized
the wisdom of that solo dissent.
And I think,

25:58.624 --> 26:04.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
likewise, when they get past the
heated controversies
of the moment, when people read
so many of

26:04.329 --> 26:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his other dissents, they will
recognize the
deep wisdom there. And law
students will read

26:08.233 --> 26:12.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his opinions as long as anyone
reads Supreme
Court cases.

26:12.371 --> 26:14.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And I will ask
you for a brief
last word on that, too.

26:14.706 --> 26:21.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was also, though, on the
losing side more
recently of many key issues of
the day.

26:21.213 --> 26:22.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: Absolutely.

26:23.048 --> 26:26.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, his legacy will be his focus
on the text
and history of Constitution, but
there were

26:26.418 --> 26:30.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many cases in which progressives
showed that
the text and history of the
Constitution supported

26:30.689 --> 26:34.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
progressive outcomes, like in
the marriage
equality cases, where he simply
is on the

26:34.560 --> 26:36.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
wrong side of history there, in
my opinion.

26:36.462 --> 26:40.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Elizabeth Wydra,
Ed Whelan
and Jeffrey Rosen, thank you,
all three, very

26:40.332 --> 26:40.899 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

26:40.999 --> 26:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
EDWARD WHELAN: Thank you.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.535 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WYDRA: Thank you.

26:43.635 --> 26:46.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, less than 48
hours after
the death of Supreme Court
Justice Antonin

26:46.638 --> 26:51.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scalia, his vacant seat was
already an issue
on the campaign trail.

26:51.310 --> 26:56.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Republican candidates
said President
Obama shouldn't be the person to
chose the

26:56.114 --> 27:00.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next Supreme Court justice,
while former Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton
insisted Scalia's

27:00.919 --> 27:02.788 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
seat must be filled immediately.

27:02.888 --> 27:08.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
If the Republicans in the Senate
act as if

27:08.126 --> 27:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though have no responsibility to
work with
the president to fill that
vacant position

27:14.733 --> 27:19.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they want to wait to see
how the election
comes out, the people of this
country should

27:19.104 --> 27:25.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
send a very clear message. That
is not the
way our Constitution works. You
have a duty.

27:25.110 --> 27:26.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We expect you to fulfill it.

27:27.045 --> 27:29.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R-FL),
Presidential Candidate:
I can tell you, if Hillary
Clinton or Bernie

27:29.348 --> 27:34.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sanders wins, they are not going
to nominate
people that look or act or
behave or believe

27:34.486 --> 27:39.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any way like Justice Scalia.
That's not what
they're going to nominate. They
are going

27:39.191 --> 27:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to nominate people that want to
expand the
Constitution in a way that goes
well beyond

27:45.097 --> 27:49.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its original meaning. And so we
can't afford
that as a country.

27:49.134 --> 27:53.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to dissect
all that, we
turn to Politics Monday with
Tamara Keith

27:53.305 --> 27:57.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of NPR and Amy Walter of The
Cook Political
Report.

27:57.175 --> 27:59.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tamara, how does this change the
presidential
race?

27:59.144 --> 28:02.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: The stakes
were already very high for this
presidential

28:02.247 --> 28:04.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
race. And everyone agreed on
that.

28:04.616 --> 28:09.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And candidates were already
talking about
the Supreme Court. But it was in
the abstract.

28:09.488 --> 28:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was the next president could
name some
Supreme Court justices. Well,
now it's not

28:13.959 --> 28:19.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abstract anymore, it's very
real. And once
President Obama nominates
someone, there will

28:19.264 --> 28:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
even be a face for this fight.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.268 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
it, Amy?

28:23.368 --> 28:25.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: I absolutely
agree with that, and I also
recognize that

28:26.071 --> 28:30.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it is just one piece of what we
know is going
to be a very big, complicated
election coming

28:30.943 --> 28:32.678 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

28:32.778 --> 28:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I still think issues like the
economy and
what's happening in Syria, those
are events

28:36.114 --> 28:40.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that are really going to drive
this election,
the role of America in the
world. But this

28:40.953 --> 28:46.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be an important sort
of milestone
for these candidates, again, as
a way, especially

28:46.858 --> 28:49.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the primaries, to rev up
their base.

28:49.261 --> 28:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is right now about taking
advantage of
the very polarized partisan
environment for

28:53.966 --> 28:58.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democrats to get their side
excited about
this, Republicans to get their
side excited,

28:58.103 --> 29:01.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
especially because the
controversial issues
in front of the Supreme Court
today include

29:01.773 --> 29:03.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
abortion, labor rights,
immigration.

29:03.642 --> 29:06.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All those issues
that are right
-- that are before this very
court.

29:06.111 --> 29:07.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara, is one
side advantaged
more than the other, or is it
just about the

29:09.581 --> 29:11.416 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
same?

29:11.516 --> 29:15.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, typically,
the Supreme
Court has motivated
conservatives more, people

29:15.220 --> 29:19.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are worried about gun rights
and concerned
about abortion.

29:19.424 --> 29:23.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, right now, as Amy said,
there are all
of these things that are part of
President

29:23.495 --> 29:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama's agenda, that -- part of
his legacy
that are before the Supreme
Court, now a 4-4

29:29.968 --> 29:35.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Supreme Court. And so it is
possible that
this could motivate Democrats in
a way that

29:35.340 --> 29:37.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they haven't always been
motivated before.

29:37.309 --> 29:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another thing, President Obama
could nominate
an African-American, or an
Asian-American,

29:42.481 --> 29:49.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and that could add to the
identity politics
and motivate Democratic voters
who see themselves

29:49.221 --> 29:51.056 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that nominee.

29:51.156 --> 29:56.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would you
add? Amy, one
side or another get potentially
-- get more

29:56.728 --> 29:57.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of a boost from this?

29:57.763 --> 29:59.531 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Get more of a bump
out of this?

29:59.631 --> 30:04.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, we have only seen in the
Republican
debate the other night that a
Supreme Court

30:04.136 --> 30:08.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
justice who was named by a
Republican was
controversial in John Roberts,
right, where

30:09.041 --> 30:11.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is debate over whether he
was conservative
enough.

30:11.710 --> 30:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This issue certainly resonating
with Republicans.
And, again, I think it just
still speaks to

30:16.715 --> 30:20.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the audience that all of these
candidates
are speaking to, which is very
narrow, very

30:21.019 --> 30:22.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
polarized, very partisan.

30:22.921 --> 30:25.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quickly,
there's already
some talk about the Republican
senators who

30:25.991 --> 30:31.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are saying they won't -- they
don't want to
see anybody confirmed. Any risk
for them,

30:31.563 --> 30:33.231 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Amy?

30:33.331 --> 30:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Democrats are hoping
the risk
is that these -- most of these
senators are

30:35.400 --> 30:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in swing states that are up in
2016, New Hampshire,
Ohio, Pennsylvania.

30:39.071 --> 30:44.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have all come out, agreed
with Senator
Mitch McConnell that the
president shouldn't

30:44.609 --> 30:50.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominate somebody, this should
go to the next
president. The Democrats are
thinking this

30:50.248 --> 30:52.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to turn off swing
voters in these
states.

30:52.718 --> 30:56.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, quite frankly, they have a
balancing
act here. One is, they're
worried about a

30:56.455 --> 31:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary, so they can't upset
their conservative
base. And, number two, I don't
know that this

31:00.926 --> 31:07.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be an issue that is
going to be
front and center burning in the
fall of 2016

31:07.366 --> 31:09.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as it is at this moment.

31:09.134 --> 31:11.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meantime, Tamara,
you have
of course the South Carolina
primary coming

31:12.037 --> 31:17.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up this Saturday. The Republican
race has
gotten even more caustic, if
that was possible

31:17.743 --> 31:18.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
since...

31:18.310 --> 31:20.112 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

31:20.212 --> 31:24.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to show
everybody right
now Donald Trump, how he has
reacted to a

31:24.216 --> 31:27.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TV spot that Ted Cruz has
started to run.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, first, let's see the TV
spot itself.

31:29.421 --> 31:36.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NARRATOR: Life, marriage,
religious liberty,
the Second Amendment, we're just
one Supreme

31:37.095 --> 31:39.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Court justice away from losing
them all.

31:39.698 --> 31:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: Would President Trump
ban partial-birth
abortions?

31:42.400 --> 31:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Well, look, I'm very pro-
choice.

31:45.203 --> 31:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: But you wouldn't ban
it?

31:46.705 --> 31:47.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DONALD TRUMP: No.

31:47.672 --> 31:48.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Or ban partial-birth
abortion?

31:49.074 --> 31:51.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: No, I would -- I
am pro-choice
in every respect.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.980 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NARRATOR: We cannot trust Donald
Trump with
these serious decisions.

31:55.080 --> 31:57.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: I think he's a
very unstable
guy.

31:57.816 --> 32:02.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I must tell you one thing
about Ted Cruz
that I can say, only to a minor
extent by

32:02.654 --> 32:07.726 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
comparison for the other
politicians. I haven't
been doing this long. I have
been in it since

32:07.826 --> 32:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
June 16. But I will tell you, I
have never,
ever met a person that lies more
than Ted

32:14.633 --> 32:16.368 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Cruz.

32:16.468 --> 32:20.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Tamara, is
this squabble,
this heightened squabble between
Trump and

32:20.572 --> 32:23.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cruz now the main act in the
Republican side,
or just one of several?

32:23.708 --> 32:25.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, it's one of
several.

32:25.677 --> 32:30.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is not going anywhere.
Ted Cruz responded
to Donald Trump, saying, you
can't just say

32:30.182 --> 32:36.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
liar, liar, pants on fire, and
not respond
to the direct charges. And it
goes on and

32:36.188 --> 32:43.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on and on. Trump is also going
after Jeb Bush.
He's still hitting George W.
Bush on the Iraq

32:43.795 --> 32:45.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
War.

32:45.931 --> 32:49.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's kind of remarkable.
This is a Republican
primary. And there is a
candidate in the Republican

32:49.835 --> 32:55.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primary who is very openly
criticizing the
last Republican president. And
it is unclear

32:55.473 --> 32:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whether that is even a problem.

32:57.409 --> 33:01.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Amy, George
W. Bush, for
the first time, is hitting the
trail tonight

33:01.646 --> 33:03.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
right now in South Carolina for
his brother.

33:03.448 --> 33:04.015 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

33:04.115 --> 33:06.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

33:06.151 --> 33:10.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Bush name obviously is as
much of an albatross
for Jeb Bush than it is benefit.
And you could

33:10.455 --> 33:15.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see in his polling the challenge
for Jeb Bush
in figuring out what to do with
that name,

33:15.427 --> 33:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right, because so many people
saying, even
Republicans, we don't want a
dynasty candidate.

33:19.130 --> 33:23.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that doesn't mean they don't
like George
W. Bush. And, in fact, with
South Carolina,

33:23.168 --> 33:28.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what Jeb Bush is hoping is to
focus on the
fact this is a very
military-heavy state.

33:28.573 --> 33:32.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a very conservative
state. This is
a state that gave his brother a
very important

33:32.677 --> 33:34.546 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
victory in 2000.

33:34.646 --> 33:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, to the point about
the Iraq War,
it's not also clear that this
division isn't

33:41.519 --> 33:45.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
important within the Republican
primary. Remember,
this is the lane that Rand Paul
was in for

33:45.891 --> 33:51.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a while, a libertarian sort of
point of view
that said the Republican Party
and neoconservatives

33:51.296 --> 33:55.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got ahead of themselves on this
war and on
our foreign policy in general.

33:55.734 --> 34:01.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is a segment of the
Republican electorate
that does think that the Iraq
War was actually

34:01.339 --> 34:03.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a mistake and don't want to see
that replicated.

34:03.241 --> 34:07.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just a little
more than a minute.
We don't want to neglect the
Democrats.

34:07.479 --> 34:11.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The focus for them, Tamara, is
Nevada. They
have got the causes coming up,
Democratic

34:11.683 --> 34:16.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
caucuses, this weekend. It seems
to be tightening
there, Hillary Clinton, Bernie
Sanders both

34:16.721 --> 34:18.490 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
focusing on Nevada. What does it
look like?

34:18.590 --> 34:21.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes. This was
supposed to be
the beginning of Hillary
Clinton's firewall.

34:21.259 --> 34:25.330 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not so clear that it is the
beginning
of the firewall anymore.

34:25.430 --> 34:31.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's hard to poll in Nevada, but
the sense
is, the way she's running that
campaign now,

34:31.336 --> 34:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she stayed an extra day. There
is a sense
that this is close. And her
campaign has been

34:36.308 --> 34:40.545 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
downplaying expectations.
Meanwhile, Sanders'
campaign shipped in a bunch of
people from

34:40.645 --> 34:43.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Iowa and New Hampshire, and
they're playing
up expectations.

34:43.448 --> 34:45.250 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Looks like more
pressure on
her.

34:45.350 --> 34:47.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: More pressure on
her, which is
why we're going to hear a lot
more from her

34:47.619 --> 34:52.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about South Carolina, which will
be in another
week from now, than we are on
Nevada.

34:52.857 --> 34:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And then she goes
to Texas the
night of the Nevada caucuses.

34:56.227 --> 34:57.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because then we
get into the
bigger states.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

34:59.998 --> 35:01.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Correct, and the
African-American
votes, which is what she is
really counting

35:01.466 --> 35:04.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on to be that firewall. And
that's in South
Carolina.

35:04.135 --> 35:05.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But she would
like to have
a win.

35:05.303 --> 35:06.738 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Oh, yes, she would.

35:06.838 --> 35:09.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, yes, like a
resounding one,
instead of a near tie.

35:09.841 --> 35:15.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara Keith, Amy
Walter, watching
it all, thank you both.

35:15.613 --> 35:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

35:23.755 --> 35:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now to
Syria, and
the series of attacks that
killed dozens in

35:31.796 --> 35:33.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the country's north.

35:33.765 --> 35:37.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, the Turkish foreign
minister called
the strike against a hospital,
allegedly by

35:37.902 --> 35:43.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian forces, -- quote -- "an
obvious war
crime," and he threatened
serious consequences

35:43.575 --> 35:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if the Russian air campaign
doesn't stop.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham takes the story
from there.

35:48.680 --> 35:52.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Joining me now
to discuss
today's attacks in Northern
Syria, and the

35:53.084 --> 35:57.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state of the larger war there,
is New York
Times Beirut bureau chief Anne
Barnard.

35:57.122 --> 35:59.124 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Anne, thanks for being here.

35:59.224 --> 36:05.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we have seen these recent
attacks against
medical facilities and
hospitals. Allegedly,

36:05.497 --> 36:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these are by the Russians. What
can you tell
us? What's going on there?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD, Beirut Bureau
Chief, The New
York Times: Well, this has
actually been something

36:10.735 --> 36:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of a pattern, even by the Syrian
government.

36:12.904 --> 36:20.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been a pattern of
attacks against
hospitals and schools. And since
the Russian

36:20.445 --> 36:27.218 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
airstrikes began, it has
continued with the
Russian airstrikes as well. It
seems that

36:27.318 --> 36:31.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
there may be a strategy of
trying to depopulate
areas, just areas that are not
likely to come

36:31.890 --> 36:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
back into the government fold.
It seems to
be preferable from their point
of view to

36:38.196 --> 36:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
either drive those people away
or make the
areas difficult to live in.

36:44.736 --> 36:49.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw this in the city of Homs,
when the
center of the city was occupied
for a long

36:50.075 --> 36:56.081 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
time by insurgents. And,
finally, the solution
was to evacuate them, and still
much of the

36:56.181 --> 36:57.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
city is not really inhabited.

36:58.049 --> 37:02.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now, amidst
all of this
bombing, we have been seeing
Kurdish forces

37:03.054 --> 37:08.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coming in and sort of coming in
behind the
bombing and retaking some of the
space created

37:08.426 --> 37:10.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
there. Why is that important?

37:10.495 --> 37:16.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD: First of all, it
shows the complicated
battlefield in Northern Aleppo,
where we're

37:16.134 --> 37:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seeing that the enemy of my
enemy is often
also my enemy.

37:22.107 --> 37:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This means there are groups
which are backed
by the Americans who are
actually fighting

37:25.376 --> 37:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other, and Turkey, who is
an American
ally and a NATO member, is
getting increasingly,

37:33.084 --> 37:41.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
vociferously angry at the
Kurdish advances.
The Turks consider the Kurds to
be the biggest

37:41.226 --> 37:45.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
threat to them because of their
history of
struggles with their own Kurdish
population.

37:45.663 --> 37:54.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so to see Kurdish militias
taking over
land from Turkish-backed
insurgents is a new

37:54.906 --> 37:57.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and very fast-moving development
in this battle.

37:57.442 --> 38:01.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So the Kurds
are sort of
using this opportunistically, to
try to take

38:01.479 --> 38:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back what they think of as some
of their ancestral
homeland?

38:04.649 --> 38:10.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE BARNARD: Well, the main
Kurdish areas
are separated by this area which
is being

38:10.922 --> 38:12.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fought over right now.

38:12.724 --> 38:17.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is not really a Kurdish
area. The
Kurds are to the west and to the
east of it.

38:17.829 --> 38:22.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the Kurdish aim seems to be
to try to
connect the two areas, although
they would

38:22.367 --> 38:28.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also have to take an even larger
area which
is now controlled by Islamic
State.

38:29.073 --> 38:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they have been able to move
surprisingly
quickly, taking advantage of the
Russian strikes,

38:33.444 --> 38:38.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which has prompted the Syrian,
Arab and Turkmen
rebels to say that they must be
working with

38:39.083 --> 38:40.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Russians.

38:41.019 --> 38:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians have backed the
Kurds politically,
trying to get them a bigger seat
at the table

38:45.857 --> 38:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in peace negotiations. And,
right now, you
have a scenario where both the
Russians and

38:51.796 --> 38:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Americans, nominally on
opposite sides
of this fight, are both backing
Kurdish militias

38:56.434 --> 38:59.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
against ISIS to one degree and
another.

39:00.038 --> 39:03.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I understand
we are supposed
to be having a cease-fire
beginning very soon,

39:04.008 --> 39:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and yet things seem to just be
getting more
and more violent as we get close
to that deadline.

39:08.313 --> 39:10.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANNE BARNARD: Yes.

39:10.348 --> 39:15.687 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To some extent, that is
something to be expected.
Ahead of any peace negotiations
or cease-fire,

39:15.787 --> 39:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parties on the ground try to
maximize their
advantage and their position.
But, in the

39:19.891 --> 39:24.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case, it seems like something
more, the case
where the balance of power is
pretty lopsided.

39:25.096 --> 39:30.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's as if the Russians and
the Syrian
government are trying to sprint
to victory,

39:30.268 --> 39:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at least in this particular
theater of the
battle. And why wouldn't they if
they see

39:35.573 --> 39:37.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an opportunity to do that?

39:37.308 --> 39:41.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Anne Barnard
of The New York Times, thank you
so much.

39:41.646 --> 39:50.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ANNE BARNARD: Thank you.

39:50.521 --> 39:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The neighborhoods
where people
live and work often reflect how
healthy they

39:58.763 --> 40:00.665 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

40:00.765 --> 40:05.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nowhere is that more true than
in West Baltimore,
where violence, food deserts,
and homes filled

40:05.937 --> 40:11.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with mold, lead paint and toxic
levels of
stress translate to drastically
lower life

40:11.709 --> 40:15.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
expectancies than almost
anywhere else in
the state of Maryland.

40:15.813 --> 40:20.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That history has also led to a
frayed trust
with the medical establishment
there, one

40:20.718 --> 40:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that hospitals are working to
restore.

40:23.488 --> 40:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Sarah
Varney has our
report from Baltimore. It was
produced in

40:27.759 --> 40:32.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
collaboration with our partner
Kaiser Health
News.

40:32.463 --> 40:40.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: The street
protests that erupted
in West Baltimore after
25-year-old Freddie

40:40.338 --> 40:45.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Gray died while in police
custody brought
attention to the staggering
poverty and violence

40:45.476 --> 40:48.379 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the city's impoverished
neighborhoods.

40:48.479 --> 40:53.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Sandtown-Winchester, where
Gray lived,
the dismal health and low life
expectancy

40:53.151 --> 40:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rivals some of the world's
poorest countries.
That's especially striking in a
city world-renowned

40:58.389 --> 41:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for its prestigious medical
schools and public
health research.

41:01.326 --> 41:07.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Men and women in Sandtown live,
on average,
just 69 years, a decade below
the rest of

41:07.398 --> 41:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the country. Health officials
say infants
here die at almost twice the
national average.

41:18.743 --> 41:24.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And adults are felled by heart
disease, prostate
cancer and AIDS with shocking
frequency.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to his neighborhood's ill
health, but preaches
self-reliance.

41:32.757 --> 41:35.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DERRICK DEWITT, First Mount
Calvary Baptist
Church: You have to make sure
that you are

41:35.126 --> 41:40.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
getting the health care that you
need. Things
are not equal, and they probably
will never

41:40.531 --> 41:42.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be equal.

41:42.500 --> 41:46.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Pastor DeWitt,
like many residents
here, is deeply distrustful of
Baltimore's

41:46.637 --> 41:51.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hospitals. He learned to be wary
of nearby
Bon Secours Hospital early on
from his grandmother,

41:51.743 --> 41:54.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who was a member of the church
he now leads.

41:54.178 --> 41:59.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REV. DERRICK DEWITT: All of our
family who
went to Bon Secours never came
out of Bon

41:59.250 --> 42:06.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Secours. So, she kind of
instilled in us,
"Never take me there. If I ever
have to go

42:06.391 --> 42:10.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the hospital, never take me
there." And
that attitude still exists
today.

42:10.695 --> 42:15.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: But in an
emergency, Bon Secours
is one of the closest hospitals
to Sandtown-Winchester.

42:15.233 --> 42:20.138 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REV. DERRICK DEWITT: My
directive is, if you
have to put me in the car, take
me to a hospital

42:20.238 --> 42:24.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other than Bon Secours, because
the nickname
for Bon Secours, do you know
what that is?

42:25.042 --> 42:25.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: Tell me.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
REV. DERRICK DEWITT: "Bon
se-killer."

42:27.845 --> 42:31.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Bon Secours is
working mightily
to change that reputation, but
the distrust

42:31.549 --> 42:37.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
goes beyond just one hospital.
Stories dating
back to the 1800s that so-called
night doctors

42:37.488 --> 42:42.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kidnapped black children for
medical experiments
are vividly remembered.

42:43.027 --> 42:48.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Experimentation was, in fact,
happening to
black Americans nationwide. At
Johns Hopkins,

42:48.199 --> 42:52.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
researchers famously took tissue
cells from
Henrietta Lacks, a black cancer
patient, without

42:53.070 --> 42:54.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
permission in 1951.

42:55.006 --> 42:58.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EDDIE REAVES, Baltimore
Resident: To me, they
have always been like that.
Never did like

42:58.543 --> 43:00.411 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Johns Hopkins.

43:00.511 --> 43:04.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Eddie Reaves, age
64, is a member
of Pastor DeWitt's church. His
partner died

43:04.182 --> 43:08.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
two years ago after doctors at
Johns Hopkins
operated on her heart.

43:08.252 --> 43:12.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE REAVES: From day one,
before she even
went in, I never liked them,
because that's

43:12.557 --> 43:15.159 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
all they do is experiment, to
me, on people.

43:15.259 --> 43:19.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Reaves is equally
skeptical
of other Baltimore hospitals. He
spent much

43:19.430 --> 43:24.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of his life addicted to drugs,
and when his
diabetes and asthma spiraled out
of control,

43:24.469 --> 43:26.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he would end up in the E.R.

43:26.270 --> 43:30.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even after he got off drugs
and signed
up for health insurance, Reaves
found the

43:30.708 --> 43:34.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medical system was a maze of
doctors who charged
too much and didn't listen to
him.

43:35.046 --> 43:38.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE REAVES: When the doctor
give me something
that give me side effect, I
don't take my

43:38.916 --> 43:43.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medication. He said, why are you
not taking
it? I said, because it give me
side effects.

43:43.821 --> 43:49.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, sometimes, they think it's
a big joke,
but I don't take nothing that
give me side

43:49.660 --> 43:51.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
effects.

43:51.529 --> 43:54.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Dr. Samuel Ross,
the CEO of
Bon Secours, is well aware of
his hospital's

43:54.131 --> 43:57.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reputation in the neighborhood,
and what it's
going to take to earn people's
trust.

43:58.069 --> 44:00.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. SAMUEL ROSS, CEO, Bon
Secours Hospital:
You often find out that a lot is
urban myth.

44:01.005 --> 44:06.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we also have to sit down and
say, well,
tell me why you feel that way?
And then, let

44:06.711 --> 44:09.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me show you some things that may
cause you
to feel a different way.

44:09.847 --> 44:14.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Nearby, at the
University of
Maryland, Baltimore, president
Dr. Jay Perman

44:14.619 --> 44:18.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says repairing the relationship
with black
Baltimoreans will take a long
time.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JAY PERMAN, President,
University of Maryland,
Baltimore: I think there's still
too much

44:20.725 --> 44:31.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of a perception that we
experiment. Now, that
is not the case. Care is
rigorously delivered

44:31.302 --> 44:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with consent from the patient
always. But
it takes a long time, I think,
for people

44:38.309 --> 44:43.314 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to understand that the days of
hidden experimentation
are over.

44:43.414 --> 44:49.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Making that case
is not only
a moral imperative, but now a
financial one.

44:49.420 --> 44:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While Freddie Gray's death and
the street
protests have called attention
to the health

44:52.657 --> 44:56.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
problems in Baltimore's poorest
neighborhoods,
sweeping changes to the health
care system

44:56.827 --> 45:01.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have forced hospitals to go
after their root
cause. Because of the Affordable
Care Act

45:01.132 --> 45:04.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a change to the way Maryland
pays for
medical care, health
professionals are being

45:05.002 --> 45:09.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pushed to look more closely at
the details
of their patients' lives.

45:09.707 --> 45:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Public health researchers say
it's when patients
are in their neighborhoods, in
crowded homes

45:13.411 --> 45:18.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or decaying public schools, with
no grocery
stores or reliable buses that
health problems

45:18.583 --> 45:20.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fester.

45:20.484 --> 45:24.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JAY PERMAN: In the past, we
have always
thought about making correct
diagnoses, and

45:24.355 --> 45:30.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
preparing the right prescription
or therapeutic
plan, and then sending the
patient out.

45:30.127 --> 45:36.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think it's the fact that
we didn't focus
-- we in general in the American
health care

45:36.767 --> 45:43.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system didn't focus on what
happens to the
patient when they're not
directly in our care

45:43.674 --> 45:45.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and in front of us.

45:45.476 --> 45:50.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: So, hospitals are
aiming to
fix the everyday problems that
are making

45:51.048 --> 45:56.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their patients sick. And there's
renewed urgency.
Hospitals can now face financial
consequences

45:56.687 --> 46:01.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from the federal government and
the state
of Maryland for failing to
prevent their patients

46:01.158 --> 46:04.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from returning to the E.R. for
avoidable problems.

46:04.829 --> 46:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Maryland legislature has
pressed for changes
too. A 2012 law established five
health enterprise

46:11.035 --> 46:19.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
zones which offer tax credits
and grants to
bring health care resources to
poor communities.

46:19.210 --> 46:23.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Driving that effort are groups
like the Coordinating
Center, which are paid by the
health enterprise

46:23.648 --> 46:28.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
zones to visit high-risk
patients, like Toni
Settles, just after they leave
Bon Secours,

46:28.753 --> 46:33.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the University of Maryland and
other Baltimore
hospitals. Advocates go into
patients' homes

46:33.424 --> 46:35.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to figure out how to keep their
recovery on
track.

46:35.893 --> 46:40.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENN SULIN-STAIR, Coordinating
Center: Will
you need help with planning
finances to afford

46:40.297 --> 46:42.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those things?

46:42.199 --> 46:46.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: Jenn Sulin-Stair
is part coach,
part confidant, part fixer who
first had to

46:46.370 --> 46:48.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
earn Settles' trust.

46:48.272 --> 46:50.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TONI SETTLES, Baltimore
Resident: It wasn't
a whole lot of talk. She put
action to it,

46:50.474 --> 46:54.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
you know, and set up
appointments for me and
then set up dates. And that's
the difference.

46:55.012 --> 46:59.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I never had nobody one on one,
no indeed.
They will say one thing, do
another.

46:59.617 --> 47:05.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SARAH VARNEY: The health
enterprise zones
pay for this kind of help for
two months.

47:05.189 --> 47:09.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senior vice president Carol
Marsiglia says,
without an intervention, half of
high-risk

47:09.760 --> 47:14.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
patients return to the hospital
within 12
days. Although mental illness
and substance

47:14.899 --> 47:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abuse can play a big role,
Marsiglia says
the grinding realities of
poverty often derail

47:19.904 --> 47:24.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recovery, a broken wheelchair or
no money
to fill a prescription or get a
needed oxygen

47:24.775 --> 47:26.677 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tank.

47:26.777 --> 47:29.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL MARSIGLIA, Coordinating
Center: So,
we do work to try to find some
financial resources,

47:29.213 --> 47:33.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
get that co-pay paid, so that
the person can
get the oxygen they need.
Otherwise, they

47:34.051 --> 47:36.987 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
may likely be back in the
hospital early the
next week.

47:37.088 --> 47:42.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: But for many, the
obstacles
just keep on coming. David Kelly
Jr., an outreach

47:42.927 --> 47:47.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worker from LIGHT Health and
Wellness, a West
Baltimore community center, has
been counseling

47:47.465 --> 47:52.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anthony Chase for years. The two
drive to
a mall parking lot to have a
private and frank

47:53.037 --> 47:57.608 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversation about keeping
Chase's HIV and
bipolar disorder under control.

47:57.708 --> 48:00.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I'm working on myself right
now. I'm
working on all of me.

48:00.478 --> 48:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KELLY JR., LIGHT Health
and Wellness:
Well, a big part of that is
going to be definitely

48:02.847 --> 48:07.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maintaining your treatment
adherence, I think.
If you use that as a foundation
and build

48:07.785 --> 48:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from that, you know, everything
else sort
of...

48:10.421 --> 48:12.256 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Yes, falls in place.

48:12.356 --> 48:17.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: The hospitals,
too, have renewed
their focus on West Baltimore. A
well-respected

48:17.294 --> 48:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
homeless clinic recently opened
up inside
Bon Secours, and the hospital is
converting

48:23.134 --> 48:28.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a church near Sandtown into a
clinic that
will offer primary care, mental
health counseling

48:28.372 --> 48:29.907 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and social services.

48:30.007 --> 48:33.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: First step, pour the milk
into a bag,
and then you measure the
vanilla.

48:33.711 --> 48:37.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: And the University
of Maryland,
Baltimore, is partnering with
public schools

48:37.481 --> 48:42.686 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
to inspire young
African-Americans to become
health care professionals, and
training current

48:42.787 --> 48:47.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medical students to delve more
deeply into
the social conditions that
perpetuate poor

48:47.324 --> 48:49.260 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
health.

48:49.360 --> 48:54.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Pastor DeWitt's church, Johns
Hopkins recently
held focus groups to ask
residents why they

48:54.365 --> 48:59.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
used the emergency room instead
of going to
a doctor's office. But it's not
clear if these

48:59.403 --> 49:04.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
intensive efforts will be
sustained. Funding
for the health enterprise zones
expires next

49:04.508 --> 49:06.210 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

49:06.310 --> 49:09.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many here are asking how far
hospitals
can go, even when threatened
with financial

49:09.880 --> 49:13.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
penalties to fix toxic
neighborhoods.

49:13.117 --> 49:17.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For his part, Reaves remains
unconvinced that
all the attention the protests
brought to

49:17.354 --> 49:20.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his neighborhood over this last
year will
do much good.

49:20.391 --> 49:24.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE REAVES: Things will get
worser and worser
to me, but you got to keep on
living, though,

49:24.829 --> 49:25.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do what you got to do.

49:25.963 --> 49:27.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SARAH VARNEY: It's a fatalism
hard-earned.

49:27.798 --> 49:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour" and
Kaiser Health News,
I'm Sarah Varney in Baltimore.

49:34.038 --> 49:39.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a postscript
to our report:
Johns Hopkins officials say they
are committed

49:39.543 --> 49:43.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Baltimore community and
improving the
relationship.

49:43.447 --> 49:49.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That includes a series of
community events
on issues about the Henrietta
Lacks story,

49:49.153 --> 49:54.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
including a program and
scholarship for high
school students and a symposium
that attracts

49:54.158 --> 49:59.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over 1,000 people from the
community. The
events are planned in
cooperation with the

49:59.196 --> 50:20.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lacks family and they address
the ethical
issues related to biomedical
research.

50:20.517 --> 50:24.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Finally tonight, we close with
an unusual
work of art about Antonin
Scalia.

50:24.922 --> 50:30.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, the Arena Stage
theater here in
Washington put on a production
of "The Originalist,"

50:31.095 --> 50:33.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a play that offered a portrait
of Scalia.

50:33.797 --> 50:38.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time, Jeffrey Brown
profiled that show
and what it conveyed about the
man.

50:38.936 --> 50:40.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's an excerpt.

50:40.838 --> 50:45.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD GERO, "The Originalist":
The court
has been my theater, and I have
the costumes.

50:45.476 --> 50:50.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the new play
"The Originalist,"
the first thing you notice about
actor Edward

50:50.514 --> 50:55.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gero is his striking physical
resemblance
to the character he's playing,
the real-life

50:55.786 --> 50:57.955 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Supreme Court Justice Antonin
Scalia.

50:58.055 --> 51:07.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD GERO: I tell people what
they don't
want to hear. That's also what
makes me a

51:07.498 --> 51:12.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
monster. That's how half the
country see me,
aggressive, combative, law and
order conservative.

51:12.970 --> 51:21.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Other half sees me as a hero,
aggressive,
combative, law and order
conservative. Which

51:21.679 --> 51:23.480 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
am I?

51:23.580 --> 51:27.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: As it happens,
both the justice
and the actor trace their
heritage to nearby

51:27.284 --> 51:33.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
villages in Southern Italy. Both
are from
New Jersey, raised in Catholic
homes and schools.

51:33.223 --> 51:38.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To really be Scalia, all Gero
had to do was
take a short ride over to the
Supreme Court,

51:38.796 --> 51:41.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to watch the justice in action
to get the
mannerisms down.

51:41.799 --> 51:46.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD GERO: He sort of closes
his eyes a
little bit and heightens his
sense of listening.

51:46.303 --> 51:48.105 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, show
me. Show me.

51:48.205 --> 51:51.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD GERO: Well, you know, he
will -- he
will listen, and then when he
hears something,

51:52.042 --> 51:57.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then he will pounce, right? So
he sort of
gathers up and searching for the
right word

51:57.548 --> 52:01.251 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or for the logic of the
argument. Then, once
he grabs onto it, he will launch
and have

52:01.352 --> 52:03.120 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a question.

52:03.220 --> 52:06.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Antonin Scalia,
of course,
is the famously combative leader
of the court's

52:06.223 --> 52:10.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conservative wing, and currently
its longest-serving
member.

52:10.661 --> 52:17.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lover of opera, which the play
uses to great
effect, and operatic himself in
both charm

52:17.701 --> 52:21.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and bluster, he's an
intellectual powerhouse.

52:21.905 --> 52:26.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDWARD GERO: Look, I'm not an
ideologue. I
am an originalist.

52:26.577 --> 52:31.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And a firm
proponent that judges
should look only to the original
text and

52:32.016 --> 52:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meaning of the Constitution.

52:33.851 --> 52:38.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDWARD GERO: To interpret the
Constitution
as it is written and as it was
understood

52:38.622 --> 52:42.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when the authors crafted the
original document.
It's as important as that. Now,
the other

52:42.426 --> 52:50.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side of the argument is obvious
and wrong.
The Constitution is a living
document. It

52:50.134 --> 52:57.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
must change with the times.
Nonsense. Society
changes. Fashion changes. The
Constitution

52:57.741 --> 52:59.543 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stands.

52:59.643 --> 53:04.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can watch
Jeff's full story
from last year on that play on
our Web site

53:04.515 --> 53:06.383 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:06.483 --> 53:12.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, on the "NewsHour" online
right now:
How many people does it take to
keep a major

53:13.023 --> 53:18.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conspiracy under wraps? While
some believe
that the Apollo 11 moon landing
was staged,

53:18.962 --> 53:24.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new mathematical equation
calculates that
hundreds of thousands of people
would have

53:24.668 --> 53:28.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be really good at keeping
secrets for that
theory to be true.

53:28.972 --> 53:33.811 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

53:33.911 --> 53:35.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:35.746 --> 53:41.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Tuesday, Malcolm Brabant
reports on the
recent rise of anti-Semitism in
Europe.

53:41.418 --> 53:43.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

evening. For all of us at the
