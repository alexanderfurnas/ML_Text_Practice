JUDY WOODRUFF: Welcome to our "PBS NewsHour"
special live coverage of the president's address

00:27.094 --> 00:30.264 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to a joint session of Congress and to the
nation.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.932 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:32.032 --> 00:36.169 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This will be President Trump's first opportunityto speak before Congress.

00:36.270 --> 00:41.608 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He said today the time is right for a new
immigration law, as long as both sides can

00:41.708 --> 00:43.543 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
compromise.

00:43.644 --> 00:48.615 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mr. Trump addresses a divided nation, with
high approval among Republicans, but disappointing

00:48.715 --> 00:51.218 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
numbers from Democrats and even many independents.

00:51.318 --> 00:57.491 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He is also facing questions from Republican
lawmakers on priorities like health care and

00:57.591 --> 00:59.493 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
federal spending.

00:59.593 --> 01:03.797 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Here with me now at the "NewsHour" table tonight,
our regular contributors, syndicated columnist

01:03.897 --> 01:09.803 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mark Shields, New York Times columnist David
Brooks, and Amy Walter of The Cook Political

01:09.903 --> 01:11.638 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Report.

01:11.738 --> 01:16.009 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Also joining us are Matt Schlapp, chair of
the American Conservative Union, and Karine

01:16.109 --> 01:17.511 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Jean-Pierre.

01:17.611 --> 01:22.049 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She was a senior adviser to MoveOn.org during
the 2016 elections.

01:22.149 --> 01:26.687 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we welcome all of you tonight for the
next couple of hours, as we hear the president's

01:26.787 --> 01:28.555 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
address.

01:28.655 --> 01:33.026 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
David Brooks, it is the president's first
chance to, I guess, make a second impression?

01:33.126 --> 01:36.964 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think so, and try to
talk to people who he hasn't already won over,

01:37.064 --> 01:41.401 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
try to lead an organization, instead of just
being the person who will do everything himself

01:41.501 --> 01:43.303 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
because he knows more about everything than
anybody else.

01:43.403 --> 01:45.739 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He has got to rally a coalition.

01:45.839 --> 01:49.676 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so, from what we have seen in the excerpts,
maybe a little of a softer, gentler kind of

01:49.776 --> 01:52.446 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the roly-poly, gentle Donald Trump.

01:52.546 --> 01:57.351 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What will be interesting to me is, does he
try to actually build a coalition and, two,

01:57.451 --> 01:59.219 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
does he get into any details?

01:59.319 --> 02:02.055 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Is it sort of, I am going to make a gesture
to child care, I am going to make a gesture

02:02.155 --> 02:05.759 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to health care, I am going to make a gesture
to immigration, or does he actually draw some

02:05.859 --> 02:07.627 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
edges?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.663 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields, what are you
looking for, as we keep an eye on the chamber

02:09.763 --> 02:11.164 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as the president approaches?

02:11.264 --> 02:13.567 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: As a member of the roly-poly
caucus

02:13.667 --> 02:14.568 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:14.668 --> 02:16.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MARK SHIELDS: As David said

02:16.169 --> 02:17.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:17.938 --> 02:23.777 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: president, who is a pretty trim
guy, and who doesn't trim on issues.

02:23.877 --> 02:30.384 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I think the question, Judy, symbolically,
he reaches across in a great ceremonial moment

02:30.484 --> 02:34.621 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for all presidents and for citizens, extends
the olive branch.

02:34.721 --> 02:39.626 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I -- if David is really curious about
his getting into the policy specifics, I would

02:39.726 --> 02:44.164 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ask him not to expect too much, because that
is not Donald Trump's strong suit.

02:44.264 --> 02:50.270 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter, as we wait for
that announcement that the president is there,

02:50.370 --> 02:52.539 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
do we look for specifics, and does he really
need to give specifics?

02:52.639 --> 02:55.142 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political Report: No,
I don't think that it -- most presidents do

02:55.242 --> 03:00.881 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
these as these sort of big vision statements,
and a whole bunch gets thrown in there that

03:00.981 --> 03:03.550 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
they would love to do, but are not must-haves.

03:03.650 --> 03:10.357 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it is also pretty clear, though, that
his -- the folks in Congress, his Republicans,

03:10.457 --> 03:16.096 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
want him to give them a way, to show them
where your priorities are, what we are going

03:16.196 --> 03:17.431 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
to be able to get done this year.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.466 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
That may not happen in this speech.

03:19.566 --> 03:23.804 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Remember, this Congress can only handle so
much.

03:23.904 --> 03:30.010 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And getting through two very big pieces of
legislation, health care reform and tax reform,

03:30.110 --> 03:35.482 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that alone is going to take up all of their
energy and capital.

03:35.582 --> 03:38.718 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Trying to squeeze more in is going to be very
difficult thing to do.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.456 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So a lot of this is going to be talked about
tonight that may not go anywhere in 2017.

03:42.556 --> 03:47.427 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it looks like the president
is about to enter.

03:47.527 --> 03:54.634 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MAN: Mr. Speaker, the president of the United
States!

03:54.734 --> 03:57.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:57.137 --> 04:01.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there he is.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.510 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Matt Schlapp is joining us from the American
Conservative Union.

04:03.610 --> 04:10.250 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You have wanted to see a Republican walk downthat aisle for a few years.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.486 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House Directorof Political Affairs: Yes.

04:12.586 --> 04:15.489 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think it -- these are always great moments,
right?

04:15.589 --> 04:22.162 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And Donald Trump is -- has got the opportunity
with a very big television audience to address

04:22.262 --> 04:25.332 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people in a substantive way on his policy
priorities.

04:25.432 --> 04:30.003 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, part of this is reacquainting the American
people with what he wants to do to get the

04:30.103 --> 04:32.539 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
economy going, which is what this is all about.

04:32.639 --> 04:35.375 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And, second of all, he -- I agree with Amy.

04:35.475 --> 04:39.346 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
It is also about urging Congress to get going.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.415 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Presidents always have a fickle relationship
with Congress, even the members of their own

04:42.516 --> 04:44.117 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
party.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.520 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he is going to try to urge them to work
together and get some stuff done.

04:46.620 --> 04:50.157 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Karine Jean-Pierre, Republicanscertainly are in the majority.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.691 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE, Democratic Strategist:
They sure all.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.793 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They have got all three branches
of government right now.

04:53.894 --> 04:55.395 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: That's exactly right.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.297 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what is the role of theDemocrats, the opposition party?

04:57.397 --> 05:01.301 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I think that the Democrats
need to continue to listen to the folks who

05:01.401 --> 05:03.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are on the street.

05:03.236 --> 05:08.408 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You know, the resistance has been very loud
since the day after inauguration, where we

05:08.508 --> 05:10.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had the women's march.

05:10.177 --> 05:14.347 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they need to listen to the people, very
simple, very easily.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.082 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And they have shown that they are listening.

05:16.183 --> 05:18.852 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think they just need to continue to
do that.

05:18.952 --> 05:21.755 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks, we have -- we
are watching.

05:21.855 --> 05:25.058 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And we are watching Melania Trump, I think.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.928 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There she is in the front row up above looking
down.

05:28.028 --> 05:31.631 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That is the traditional seat for the firstlady, watching her husband.

05:31.731 --> 05:34.668 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The president continues to make his way toward
the front.

05:34.768 --> 05:41.341 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We just caught a quick glimpse of House Speaker
Paul Ryan and Vice President Mike Pence, first

05:41.441 --> 05:46.980 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
time in his role, David, as the man sittingthere next to the speaker.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.483 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
I am looking at this group right now.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.953 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It looks like mostly Republicans greeting
him.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.754 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There are a few Democrats.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.123 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: This is the end of an era on
that aisle, where we had Eliot Engel from

05:57.224 --> 06:02.028 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
New York, the House member, who camped out
probably six months early to get that seat.

06:02.128 --> 06:07.400 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And there was a tendency for the female members
of the House to wear bright red, so they can

06:07.500 --> 06:08.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
show up on the TV.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now they are all wearing white.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.772 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But there has been a changing of the guard
even along that aisle.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.476 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa Desjardins is with us
from the Capitol.

06:16.576 --> 06:18.712 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Lisa, you have been talking to some members.

06:18.812 --> 06:20.347 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
What are they telling you?

06:20.447 --> 06:23.116 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: You know, it depends on theside that you are talking to.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.620 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Democrats think there's going to be a lot
to oppose in tonight's speech, no surprise.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.056 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But Republicans, interestingly, they know
that their fate is tied to this president.

06:30.156 --> 06:33.326 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I do hear some anxiety, as well as some
hope from them.

06:33.426 --> 06:37.931 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Also, I am concerned about my wardrobe color
of red being out of date, now that David Brooks

06:38.031 --> 06:39.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has brought that up.

06:39.366 --> 06:41.134 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:41.234 --> 06:43.937 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just quickly, Lisa, when you
say Republicans express anxiety, what do you

06:44.037 --> 06:44.938 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mean?

06:45.038 --> 06:46.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Yes.

06:46.273 --> 06:47.641 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Well, we were just speaking to Senator John
Thune.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.809 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
He's in Republican leadership in the Senate.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.878 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And he said, "I am anxious to hear what the
president said."

06:51.978 --> 06:57.584 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And what he meant by that is that they know
this is an unconventional president, who sometimes

06:57.684 --> 07:01.121 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
has, in their words, not executed things the
way they would like.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.924 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they are interested in his words tonight,
because, sometimes, the president's words,

07:05.025 --> 07:07.861 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
they will admit, have gotten him and Republicans
into trouble.

07:07.961 --> 07:13.400 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, they are hoping for a solid address, as
Amy said, that covers broad vision, but they

07:13.500 --> 07:15.735 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
say, with this president, you never can be
too sure.

07:15.835 --> 07:21.141 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We are watching the president
turn and hand a copy of his remarks to the

07:21.241 --> 07:22.776 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
vice president, to the House speaker.

07:22.876 --> 07:28.248 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is a role -- it is a first for him to get
a chance to do this.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.784 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we just got a quick glimpse of women dressed
in white.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.585 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And we will be able to talk about that later.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.121 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
But we are watching this.

07:35.221 --> 07:38.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is a first, and it is worth looking at
it and listening.

09:12.886 --> 09:32.505 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP: and citizens of America, tonight,
as we mark the conclusion of our celebration

09:32.605 --> 09:38.878 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of Black History Month, we are reminded of
our nation s path toward civil rights and

09:38.978 --> 10:06.172 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the work that still remains to be done.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Recent threats

10:07.540 --> 10:09.275 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Recent threats targeting Jewish community

10:09.375 --> 10:15.181 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries,
as well as last week s shooting in Kansas

10:15.281 --> 10:21.955 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
City, remind us that while we may be a nation
divided on policies, we are a country that

10:22.055 --> 10:33.633 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
stands united in condemning hate and evilin all of its very ugly forms.

10:33.733 --> 10:47.080 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Each American generation passes the torch

10:47.180 --> 10:55.021 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of truth, liberty and justice, in an unbroken
chain all the way down to the present.

10:55.121 --> 10:58.725 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That torch is now in our hands.

10:58.825 --> 11:02.028 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And we will use it to light up the world.

11:02.128 --> 11:07.967 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am here tonight to deliver a message of
unity and strength, and it is a message deeply

11:08.067 --> 11:11.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
delivered from my heart.

11:11.838 --> 11:17.877 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A new chapter

11:17.977 --> 11:23.983 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
of American greatness is now beginning.

11:24.083 --> 11:28.521 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A new national pride is sweeping across our
nation.

11:28.621 --> 11:35.628 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And a new surge of optimism is placing impossibledreams firmly within our grasp.

11:35.728 --> 11:41.434 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What we are witnessing today is the renewal
of the American spirit.

11:41.534 --> 11:54.847 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our allies will find that America is once
again ready to lead.

11:54.948 --> 12:06.392 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
All the nations of the world friend or

12:06.492 --> 12:14.300 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
foe will find that America is strong,
America is proud, and America is free.

12:14.400 --> 12:21.975 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In nine years, the United States will celebrate
the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250

12:22.075 --> 12:27.413 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
years since the day we declared our independence.

12:27.513 --> 12:32.619 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It will be one of the great milestones inthe history of the world.

12:32.719 --> 12:37.790 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But what will America look like as we reach
our 250th year?

12:37.890 --> 12:42.261 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What kind of country will we leave for our
children?

12:42.362 --> 12:48.901 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades
past to define the course of our future.

12:49.002 --> 12:55.942 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For too long, we ve watched our middle class
shrink as we ve exported our jobs and wealth

12:56.042 --> 12:57.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to foreign countries.

12:57.910 --> 13:03.616 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We ve financed and built one global project
after another, but ignored the fates of our

13:03.716 --> 13:11.324 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore,
Detroit, and so many other places throughout

13:11.424 --> 13:13.192 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our land.

13:13.292 --> 13:18.831 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We ve defended the borders of other nations,
while leaving our own borders wide open, for

13:18.931 --> 13:27.273 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
anyone to cross, and for drugs to pour inat a now unprecedented rate.

13:27.373 --> 13:33.913 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
And we ve spent trillions and trillions
of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure

13:34.013 --> 13:37.684 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
at home has so badly crumbled.

13:37.784 --> 13:44.791 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our
feet.

13:44.891 --> 13:53.166 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The rebellion started as a quiet protest,
spoken by families of all colors and creeds,

13:53.266 --> 14:00.907 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
families who just wanted a fair shot for their
children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.

14:01.007 --> 14:09.882 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus,
as thousands of citizens now spoke out together,

14:09.982 --> 14:14.053 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
from cities small and large, all across our
country.

14:14.153 --> 14:20.827 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake,
and the people turned out by the tens of millions,

14:20.927 --> 14:28.835 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and they were all united by one very simple,
but crucial demand, that America must put

14:28.935 --> 14:43.483 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
its own citizens first, because only then
can we truly make America great again.

14:43.583 --> 14:59.999 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Dying industries will come roaring back to

15:00.099 --> 15:01.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

15:01.501 --> 15:05.037 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Heroic veterans will get the care they so
desperately need.

15:05.138 --> 15:11.110 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our military will be given the resources its
brave warriors so richly deserve.

15:11.210 --> 15:16.616 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced
with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports

15:16.716 --> 15:22.155 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and railways, gleaming across our very, very
beautiful land.

15:22.255 --> 15:28.661 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down
and ultimately stop.

15:28.761 --> 15:35.835 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And our neglected inner cities will see a
rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.

15:35.935 --> 15:42.141 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Above all else, we will keep our promises
to the American people.

15:42.241 --> 15:49.148 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you.

15:49.248 --> 15:56.789 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
It s been a little over a month since my
inauguration, and I want to take this moment

15:56.889 --> 16:03.329 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to update the nation on the progress I vemade in keeping those promises.

16:03.429 --> 16:10.803 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General
Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel,

16:10.903 --> 16:16.042 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Walmart, and many others, have announced that
they will invest billions and billions of

16:16.142 --> 16:31.958 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
dollars in the United States and will create
tens of thousands of new American jobs.

16:32.058 --> 16:45.004 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
The stock market has gained almost $3 trillion

16:45.104 --> 16:49.575 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in value since the election on November 8th,
a record.

16:49.675 --> 16:55.982 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We ve saved taxpayers hundreds of millions
of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic

16:56.082 --> 17:03.656 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
and it is a fantastic new F-35 jet
fighter, and we ll be saving billions more

17:03.756 --> 17:07.226 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
on contracts all across our government.

17:07.326 --> 17:14.066 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have placed a hiring freeze on non-military
and non-essential federal workers.

17:14.166 --> 17:21.641 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have begun to drain the swamp of government
corruption by imposing a five-year ban on

17:21.741 --> 17:32.919 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
lobbying by executive branch officials and
a lifetime ban

17:33.019 --> 17:39.191 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you.

17:39.292 --> 17:43.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

17:43.496 --> 17:48.701 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for
a foreign government.

17:48.801 --> 17:54.540 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
We have undertaken a historic effort to massively
reduce job-crushing regulations, creating

17:54.640 --> 18:00.780 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a deregulation task force inside of every
government agency

18:00.880 --> 18:09.121 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
and we re imposing a new rule which

18:09.221 --> 18:16.896 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
mandates that for every one new regulation,
two old regulations must be eliminated.

18:16.996 --> 18:28.541 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
We re going to stop the regulations that

18:28.641 --> 18:42.455 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
threaten the future and livelihood of our
great coal miners.

18:42.555 --> 18:53.866 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
We have cleared the way for the construction

18:53.966 --> 19:03.142 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
of the Keystone and Dakota Access Pipelines

19:03.242 --> 19:12.618 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
thereby creating tens of thousands of

19:12.718 --> 19:14.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jobs.

19:14.520 --> 19:29.268 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
And I ve issued a new directive that new
American pipelines be made with American steel.

19:29.368 --> 19:40.446 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
We have withdrawn the United States from the

19:40.546 --> 19:45.251 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
job-killing Trans- Pacific Partnership.

19:45.351 --> 19:51.657 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
And with the help of Prime Minister Justin

19:51.757 --> 19:57.696 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Trudeau, we have formed a council with our
neighbors in Canada to help ensure that women

19:57.797 --> 20:04.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
entrepreneurs have access to the networks,
markets, and capital they need to start a

20:04.570 --> 20:16.715 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
business and live out their financial dreams.

20:16.816 --> 20:30.162 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
(APPLAUSE) To protect our citizens, I have
directed the Department of Justice to form

20:30.262 --> 20:34.767 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
a task force on reducing violent crime.

20:34.867 --> 20:39.672 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have further ordered the Departments of
Homeland Security and Justice, along with

20:39.772 --> 20:45.444 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the Department of State and the director of
national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive

20:45.544 --> 21:00.593 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels
that have spread all across our nation.

21:00.693 --> 21:11.370 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
We will stop the drugs from pouring into our

21:11.470 --> 21:17.109 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
country and poisoning our youth, and we will
expand treatment for those who have become

21:17.209 --> 21:27.419 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
so badly addicted.

21:27.520 --> 21:39.465 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
At the same time, my administration has answered

21:39.565 --> 21:47.673 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the pleas of the American people for immigrationenforcement and border security.

21:47.773 --> 21:53.712 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
By finally enforcing our immigration laws,

21:53.812 --> 21:59.885 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
we will raise wages, help the unemployed,
save billions and billions of dollars, and

21:59.985 --> 22:06.225 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
make our communities safer for everyone.

22:06.325 --> 22:12.464 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
We want all Americans to succeed, but that

22:12.565 --> 22:16.969 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
can t happen in an environment of lawless
chaos.

22:17.069 --> 22:32.218 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We must restore integrity and the rule of
law at our borders.

22:32.318 --> 22:45.931 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
For that reason, we will soon begin the construction

22:46.031 --> 22:56.141 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of a great, great wall along our southern
border.

22:56.242 --> 23:05.918 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
As we speak tonight, we are removing gang

23:06.018 --> 23:11.790 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
members, drug dealers, and criminals that
threaten our communities and prey on our very

23:11.890 --> 23:14.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
innocent citizens.

23:14.126 --> 23:19.765 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as
I promised throughout the campaign.

23:19.865 --> 23:26.572 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
To any in Congress who do not believe we should
enforce our laws, I would ask you this one

23:26.672 --> 23:32.711 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
question: What would you say to the American
family that loses their jobs, their income,

23:32.811 --> 23:44.857 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
or their loved one, because America refused
to uphold its laws and defend its borders?

23:44.957 --> 23:52.064 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Our obligation is to serve, protect, and defend

23:52.164 --> 23:54.767 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the citizens of the United States.

23:54.867 --> 24:06.945 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are also taking strong measures to protect
our nation from radical Islamic terrorism.

24:07.046 --> 24:22.027 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
According to data provided by the Department

24:22.127 --> 24:27.533 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of Justice, the vast majority of individuals
convicted of terrorism and terrorism-related

24:27.633 --> 24:33.972 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
offenses since 9/11 came here from outside
of our country.

24:34.073 --> 24:40.279 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston
to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes,

24:40.379 --> 24:42.614 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
even the World Trade Center.

24:42.715 --> 24:47.953 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium,
in Germany, and all over the world.

24:48.053 --> 24:54.326 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow
uncontrolled entry from places where proper

24:54.426 --> 25:05.471 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vetting cannot occur.

25:05.571 --> 25:17.816 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Those given the high honor of admission to

25:17.916 --> 25:22.988 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the United States should support this country
and love its people and its values.

25:23.088 --> 25:28.827 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to
form inside America, and we cannot allow our

25:28.927 --> 25:35.267 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

25:35.367 --> 25:44.109 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
(APPLAUSE) That is why my administration has
been working on improved vetting procedures,

25:44.209 --> 25:49.815 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and we will shortly take new steps to keep
our nation safe, and to keep those out who

25:49.915 --> 25:52.317 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will do us harm.

25:52.418 --> 26:01.059 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
As promised, I directed the Department of

26:01.160 --> 26:07.699 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Defense to develop a plan to demolish and
destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages

26:07.800 --> 26:13.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians,
and men, women, and children of all faiths

26:13.372 --> 26:15.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and all beliefs.

26:15.207 --> 26:19.878 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We will work with our allies, including our
friends and allies in the Muslim world, to

26:19.978 --> 26:29.021 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.

26:29.121 --> 26:45.904 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
I have also imposed new sanctions on entities

26:46.004 --> 26:52.177 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and individuals who support Iran s ballistic
missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable

26:52.277 --> 27:00.319 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
alliance with the state of Israel.

27:00.419 --> 27:14.433 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint

27:14.533 --> 27:21.306 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a justice to the United States Supreme Court,
from my list of 20 judges, who will defend

27:21.406 --> 27:30.516 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our Constitution.

27:30.616 --> 27:41.727 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scalia

27:41.827 --> 27:56.642 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
with us in the gallery tonight.

27:56.742 --> 28:10.155 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Thank you, Maureen.

28:10.255 --> 28:15.928 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will
forever be a symbol of American justice.

28:16.028 --> 28:23.735 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil
Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep

28:23.835 --> 28:26.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
devotion to the law.

28:26.371 --> 28:31.910 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He was confirmed unanimously by the Court
of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to

28:32.010 --> 28:39.718 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
swiftly approve his nomination.

28:39.818 --> 28:53.231 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must

28:53.332 --> 29:00.305 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
take as a country, we must honestly acknowledgethe circumstances we inherited.

29:00.405 --> 29:03.742 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ninety- four million Americans are out of
the labor force.

29:03.842 --> 29:07.479 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
Over 43 million people are now living in poverty.

29:07.579 --> 29:11.783 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And over 43 million Americans are on food
stamps.

29:11.883 --> 29:17.022 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working
years are not working.

29:17.122 --> 29:21.259 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have the worst financial recovery in 65
years.

29:21.360 --> 29:27.733 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In the last 8 years, the past administration
has put on more new debt than nearly all of

29:27.833 --> 29:29.668 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the other presidents combined.

29:29.768 --> 29:36.875 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
We ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing
jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we ve

29:36.975 --> 29:43.915 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
lost 60,000 factories since China joined the
World Trade Organization in 2001.

29:44.016 --> 29:52.290 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our trade deficit in goods with the world
last year was nearly $800 billion.

29:52.391 --> 30:00.666 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And overseas, we have inherited a series oftragic foreign policy disasters.

30:00.766 --> 30:04.970 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Solving these, and so many other pressing
problems, will require us to work past the

30:05.070 --> 30:08.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
differences of party.

30:08.607 --> 30:13.745 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It will require us to tap into the American
spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout

30:13.845 --> 30:16.815 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
our long and storied history.

30:16.915 --> 30:23.055 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad,
we must restart the engine of the American

30:23.155 --> 30:29.294 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
economy, making it easier for companies to
do business in the United States and much,

30:29.394 --> 30:37.469 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
much harder for companies to leave our country.

30:37.569 --> 30:52.718 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Right now, American companies are taxed at

30:52.818 --> 30:55.787 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.

30:55.887 --> 31:01.393 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My economic team is developing historic tax
reform that will reduce the tax rate on our

31:01.493 --> 31:08.266 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere
and with anyone.

31:08.366 --> 31:17.275 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)It will be a big, big cut.

31:17.375 --> 31:22.414 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At the same time, we will provide massivetax relief for the middle class.

31:22.514 --> 31:28.386 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
We must create a level playing field for Americancompanies and our workers.

31:28.487 --> 31:33.024 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
&nbsp;
Have to do it.

31:33.125 --> 31:37.229 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Currently, when we ship products out of America,

31:37.329 --> 31:42.734 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
many other countries make us pay very high
tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies

31:42.834 --> 31:50.142 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ship their products into America, we chargethem nothing or almost nothing.

31:50.242 --> 31:55.480 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I just met with officials and workers from
a great American company, Harley-Davidson.

31:55.580 --> 32:01.887 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In fact, they proudly displayed five of their
magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA,

32:01.987 --> 32:08.760 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
on the front lawn of the White House.

32:08.860 --> 32:15.634 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
And they wanted me to ride one, and I said,

32:15.734 --> 32:17.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
No, thank you.

32:17.335 --> 32:20.972 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)
At our meeting, I asked them, how are you

32:21.072 --> 32:23.341 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doing, how is business?

32:23.441 --> 32:25.210 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They said that it s good.

32:25.310 --> 32:30.782 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I asked them further, how are you doing with
other countries, mainly international sales?

32:30.882 --> 32:35.253 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TRUMP: They told me without even complaining,
because they have been so mistreated for so

32:35.353 --> 32:40.592 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
long that they ve become used to it that
it s very hard to do business with other

32:40.692 --> 32:44.729 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
countries because they tax our goods at such
a high rate.

32:44.830 --> 32:53.905 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They said that in the case of another country,
they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.

32:54.005 --> 32:55.841 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
They weren t even asking for a change.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But I am.

32:57.642 --> 33:04.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I believe

33:04.316 --> 33:20.832 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
I believe strongly in free trade, but it also

33:20.932 --> 33:23.201 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
has to be fair trade.

33:23.301 --> 33:27.706 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
It s been a long time since we had fair
trade.

33:27.806 --> 33:33.612 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln,
warned that the abandonment of the protective

33:33.712 --> 33:40.719 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
policy by the American government will producewant and ruin among our people.

33:40.819 --> 33:48.960 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Lincoln was right, and it s time we heededhis advice and his words.

33:49.060 --> 33:54.799 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
I am not going to let America and its great

33:54.900 --> 34:00.338 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
companies and workers be taken advantage
of us any longer.

34:00.438 --> 34:08.079 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They have taken advantage of our country no
longer.

34:08.179 --> 34:14.352 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
I am going to bring back millions of jobs.

34:14.452 --> 34:20.759 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Protecting our workers also means reformingour system of legal immigration.

34:20.859 --> 34:30.001 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
The current, outdated system depresses wages

34:30.101 --> 34:34.906 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for our poorest workers and puts great pressure
on taxpayers.

34:35.006 --> 34:41.046 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia,
and many others, have a merit-based immigration

34:41.146 --> 34:42.414 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

34:42.514 --> 34:49.988 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
It s a basic principle that those seeking

34:50.088 --> 34:54.292 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to enter a country ought to be able to support
themselves financially.

34:54.392 --> 35:00.131 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule,
straining the very public resources that our

35:00.231 --> 35:02.667 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
poorest citizens rely upon.

35:02.767 --> 35:08.039 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
According to the National Academy of Sciences,
our current immigration system costs American

35:08.139 --> 35:12.777 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.

35:12.877 --> 35:17.615 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Switching away from this current system of
lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting

35:17.716 --> 35:21.953 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a merit-based system, we will have so many
more benefits.

35:22.053 --> 35:28.093 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It will save countless dollars, raise workers
wages, and help struggling families, including

35:28.193 --> 35:31.730 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
immigrant families, enter the middle class.

35:31.830 --> 35:42.874 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they will do it quickly, and they willbe very, very happy, indeed.

35:42.974 --> 35:49.147 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
I believe that real and positive immigration

35:49.247 --> 35:57.055 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
reform is possible, as long as we focus on
the following goals: To improve jobs and wages

35:57.155 --> 36:05.530 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for Americans; to strengthen our nation s
security; and to restore respect for our laws.

36:05.630 --> 36:13.071 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If we are guided by the well-being of American
citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats

36:13.171 --> 36:28.353 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
can work together to achieve an outcome that
has eluded our country for decades.

36:28.453 --> 36:40.832 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower,

36:40.932 --> 36:48.139 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
initiated the last truly great national infrastructure
program: The building of the interstate highway

36:48.239 --> 36:49.641 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

36:49.741 --> 37:03.421 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The time has come for a new program of national
rebuilding.

37:03.521 --> 37:16.301 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
America has spent approximately $6 trillion

37:16.401 --> 37:21.272 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure
at home is crumbling.

37:21.372 --> 37:27.912 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt
our country twice, and maybe even three times,

37:28.012 --> 37:34.853 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.

37:34.953 --> 37:40.825 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
To launch our national rebuilding, I will

37:40.925 --> 37:47.599 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
be asking Congress to approve legislation
that produces a $1 trillion investment in

37:47.699 --> 37:53.238 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
infrastructure of the United States, financed
through both public and private capital, creating

37:53.338 --> 38:06.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
millions of new jobs.

38:06.317 --> 38:21.566 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
This effort will be guided by two core principles:

38:21.666 --> 38:25.737 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
Buy American and hire American.

38:25.837 --> 38:32.610 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Tonight, I am also calling on this Congress

38:32.710 --> 38:47.058 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to repeal and replace Obamacare

38:47.158 --> 39:01.973 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
with reforms that expand choice, increase

39:02.073 --> 39:09.981 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
access, lower costs, and at the same timeprovide better health care.

39:10.081 --> 39:16.387 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Mandating every American to buy government-approved

39:16.487 --> 39:25.029 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
health insurance was never the right solution
for our country.

39:25.129 --> 39:31.436 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
The way to make health insurance available

39:31.536 --> 39:36.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to everyone is to lower the cost of health
insurance, and that is what we are going to

39:36.841 --> 39:43.681 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

39:43.781 --> 39:53.858 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Obamacare premiums nationwide have increased

39:53.958 --> 39:56.261 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
by double and triple digits.

39:56.361 --> 40:02.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent
last year alone.

40:02.800 --> 40:08.706 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said
Obamacare is failing in his state, the state

40:08.806 --> 40:12.677 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
of Kentucky, and it s unsustainable and
collapsing.

40:12.777 --> 40:19.717 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
One third of the counties have only one insurer,
and they re losing them fast, they are losing

40:19.817 --> 40:21.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them so fast.

40:21.286 --> 40:22.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They re leaving.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.822 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And many Americans have no choice at all.

40:24.922 --> 40:26.958 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There s no choice left.

40:27.058 --> 40:32.530 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Remember when you were told that you could
keep your doctor and keep your plan?

40:32.630 --> 40:37.535 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We now know that all of those promises have
been totally broken.

40:37.635 --> 40:52.950 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisivelyto protect all Americans.

40:53.051 --> 41:06.531 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Action is not a choice; it is a necessity.

41:06.631 --> 41:13.071 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans
in Congress to work with us to save Americans

41:13.171 --> 41:18.009 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
from this imploding Obamacare disaster.

41:18.109 --> 41:26.551 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Here are the principles that should guide

41:26.651 --> 41:31.923 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Congress as we move to create a better healthcare system for all Americans.

41:32.023 --> 41:38.363 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
First, we should ensure that Americans with
pre-existing conditions have access to coverage

41:38.463 --> 41:48.840 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
and that we have a stable transition for Americans
currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.

41:48.940 --> 42:00.651 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Secondly, we should help Americans purchase

42:00.752 --> 42:06.057 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
their own coverage, through the use of tax
credits and expanded health savings accounts,

42:06.157 --> 42:16.067 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
but it must be the plan they want, not the
plan forced on them by our government.

42:16.167 --> 42:27.111 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Thirdly, we should give our state governors

42:27.211 --> 42:37.622 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the resources and flexibility they need with
Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.

42:37.722 --> 42:48.833 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Fourth, we should implement legal reforms

42:48.933 --> 42:54.939 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary
costs that drive up the price of insurance

42:55.039 --> 43:08.453 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and work to bring down the artificially high
price of drugs and bring them down immediately.

43:08.553 --> 43:18.296 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
And finally, the time has come to give Americans

43:18.396 --> 43:28.239 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the freedom to purchase health insurance across
state lines

43:28.339 --> 43:35.980 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
which will create a truly competitive

43:36.080 --> 43:43.154 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
national marketplace that will bring costs
way down and provide far better care.

43:43.254 --> 43:45.823 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So important.

43:45.923 --> 43:50.561 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Everything that is broken in our country can
be fixed.

43:50.661 --> 43:53.764 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Every problem can be solved.

43:53.865 --> 43:58.703 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And every hurting family can find healing
and hope.

43:58.803 --> 44:07.211 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our citizens deserve this, and so much more,
so why not join forces and finally get the

44:07.311 --> 44:25.162 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
job done and get it done right?

44:25.263 --> 44:31.802 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
On this and so many other things, Democrats

44:31.903 --> 44:36.974 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and Republicans should get together and unite
for the good of our country and for the good

44:37.074 --> 44:41.012 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the American people.

44:41.112 --> 44:46.918 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
My administration wants to work with members

44:47.018 --> 44:54.091 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of both parties to make childcare accessible
and affordable, to help ensure new parents

44:54.191 --> 45:04.035 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
that they have paid family leave

45:04.135 --> 45:13.744 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
to invest in women s health, and to

45:13.844 --> 45:26.657 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
promote clean air and clean water, and to
rebuild our military and our infrastructure.

45:26.757 --> 45:35.900 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
True love for our people requires us to find

45:36.000 --> 45:42.573 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
common ground, to advance the common good,
and to cooperate on behalf of every American

45:42.673 --> 45:47.311 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
child who deserves a much brighter future.

45:47.411 --> 45:54.085 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
An incredible young woman is with us this
evening who should serve as an inspiration

45:54.185 --> 45:55.886 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to us all.

45:55.987 --> 46:03.094 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us
in the gallery is a rare disease survivor,

46:03.194 --> 46:12.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Megan Crowley.

46:12.970 --> 46:22.380 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Megan

46:22.480 --> 46:34.959 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a

46:35.059 --> 46:39.263 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rare and serious illness, when she was 15
months old.

46:39.363 --> 46:42.400 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
She was not expected to live past five.

46:42.500 --> 46:48.806 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On receiving this news, Megan s dad, John,
fought with everything he had to save the

46:48.906 --> 46:52.543 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
life of his precious child.

46:52.643 --> 46:57.915 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He founded a company to look for a cure and
helped develop the drug that saved Megan s

46:58.015 --> 46:59.250 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

46:59.350 --> 47:13.497 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore
at Notre Dame.

47:13.597 --> 47:27.244 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Megan s story is about the unbounded power

47:27.344 --> 47:30.448 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
of a father s love for a daughter.

47:30.548 --> 47:35.886 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But our slow and burdensome approval process
at the Food and Drug Administration keeps

47:35.986 --> 47:43.360 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
too many advances, like the one that saved
Megan s life, from reaching those in need.

47:43.461 --> 47:50.568 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If we slash the restraints, not just at the
FDA but across our government, then we will

47:50.668 --> 47:57.575 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
be blessed with far more miracles just like
Megan.

47:57.675 --> 48:13.090 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
In fact, our children will grow up in a nation

48:13.190 --> 48:14.925 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of miracles.

48:15.025 --> 48:20.431 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But to achieve this future, we must enrich
the mind and the souls of every American

48:20.531 --> 48:21.632 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
child.

48:21.732 --> 48:28.506 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Education is the civil rights issue of our
time.

48:28.606 --> 48:35.312 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
I am calling upon members of both parties

48:35.412 --> 48:41.285 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to pass an education bill that funds school
choice for disadvantaged youth, including

48:41.385 --> 48:51.595 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
millions of African-American and Latino children.

48:51.695 --> 49:01.572 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
These families should be free to choose the

49:01.672 --> 49:10.548 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
public, private, charter, magnet, religious,
or home school that is right for them.

49:10.648 --> 49:17.621 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable

49:17.721 --> 49:20.491 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
woman, Denisha Merriweather.

49:20.591 --> 49:26.530 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As a young girl, Denisha struggled in schooland failed third grade twice.

49:26.630 --> 49:32.069 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But then she was able to enroll in a private
center for learning, great learning center,

49:32.169 --> 49:36.607 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship
program.

49:36.707 --> 49:42.680 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Today, she is the first in her family to graduate,
not just from high school, but from college.

49:42.780 --> 49:47.184 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Later this year, she will get her master s
degree in social work.

49:47.284 --> 50:04.068 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We want all children to be able to break the
cycle of poverty just like Denisha.

50:04.168 --> 50:18.349 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
But to break the cycle of poverty, we must

50:18.449 --> 50:23.220 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
also break the cycle of violence.

50:23.320 --> 50:30.995 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest
single- year increase in nearly half a century.

50:31.095 --> 50:37.001 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot
last year alone, and the murder rate so far

50:37.101 --> 50:39.603 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
this year has been even higher.

50:39.703 --> 50:47.811 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
This is not acceptable in our society.

50:47.912 --> 50:55.586 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Every American child should be able to grow

50:55.686 --> 51:02.092 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
up in a safe community, to attend a great
school, and to have access to a high- paying

51:02.192 --> 51:05.429 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

51:05.529 --> 51:10.968 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
But to create this future, we must work with

51:11.068 --> 51:24.815 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
not against not against the menand women of law enforcement.

51:24.915 --> 51:37.127 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
We must build bridges of cooperation and trust,

51:37.227 --> 51:42.833 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
not drive the wedge of disunity and it s
really, it s what it is, division.

51:42.933 --> 51:46.337 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It s pure, unadulterated division.

51:46.437 --> 51:47.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to unify.

51:47.671 --> 51:51.442 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
Police and sheriffs are members of our community.

51:51.542 --> 51:56.146 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
They re friends and neighbors, they re
mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and

51:56.246 --> 52:01.151 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
they leave behind loved ones every day who
worry about whether or not they ll come

52:01.251 --> 52:03.620 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
home safe and sound.

52:03.721 --> 52:12.062 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We must support the incredible men and women
of law enforcement.

52:12.162 --> 52:28.145 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
And we must support the victims of crime.

52:28.245 --> 52:33.650 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have ordered the Department of Homeland
Security to create an office to serve American

52:33.751 --> 52:35.185 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
victims.

52:35.285 --> 52:41.191 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The office is called VOICE, Victims of Immigration
Crime Engagement.

52:41.291 --> 52:46.930 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are providing a voice to those who have
been ignored by our media and silenced by

52:47.031 --> 52:47.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
special interests.

52:48.032 --> 52:48.899 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Joining us

52:48.999 --> 52:59.543 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Joining us

52:59.643 --> 53:06.116 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in the audience tonight are four very brave
Americans whose government failed them.

53:06.216 --> 53:15.559 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver,Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.

53:15.659 --> 53:23.167 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Jamiel s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered
by an illegal immigrant gang member who had

53:23.267 --> 53:25.335 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
just been released from prison.

53:25.436 --> 53:31.708 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Jamiel Shaw, Jr., was an incredible young
man with unlimited potential who was getting

53:31.809 --> 53:38.515 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ready to go to college where he would have
excelled as a great college quarterback.

53:38.615 --> 53:40.984 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But he never got the chance.

53:41.085 --> 53:49.226 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
His father, who is in the audience tonight,
has become a very good friend of mine.

53:49.326 --> 53:59.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jamiel, thank you.

53:59.636 --> 54:06.410 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

54:06.510 --> 54:12.883 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica

54:12.983 --> 54:14.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Davis.

54:14.751 --> 54:20.390 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Their husbands Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver
and Detective Michael Davis were slain

54:20.491 --> 54:24.027 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
in the line of duty in California.

54:24.128 --> 54:26.763 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
They were pillars of their community.

54:26.864 --> 54:33.137 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These brave men were viciously gunned down
by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record

54:33.237 --> 54:35.072 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and two prior deportations.

54:35.172 --> 54:40.110 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Should have never been in our country.

54:40.210 --> 54:43.380 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.

54:43.480 --> 54:49.186 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Jenna, I want you to know that your father
was a hero and that tonight you have the love

54:49.286 --> 54:57.394 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of an entire country supporting you and praying
for you.

54:57.494 --> 55:18.849 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%

you to know that we will never stop fighting
for justice.

55:22.219 --> 55:25.455 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.

55:25.556 --> 55:30.794 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We will always honor their memory.

55:30.894 --> 55:38.502 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide

55:38.602 --> 55:44.708 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the men and women of the United States military
with the tools they need to prevent war if

55:44.808 --> 55:58.288 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
they must they have to fight and they
only have to win.

55:58.388 --> 56:10.234 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds

56:10.334 --> 56:24.548 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the military, eliminates the defense sequester

56:24.648 --> 56:32.723 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
and calls for one of the largest increases

56:32.823 --> 56:37.227 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
in national defense spending in American history.

56:37.327 --> 56:40.197 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My budget will also increase funding for our
veterans.

56:40.297 --> 56:53.143 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our veterans have delivered for this nation,
and now we must deliver for them.

56:53.243 --> 57:03.520 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
The challenges we face as a nation are great.

57:03.620 --> 57:05.989 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
But our people are even greater.

57:06.089 --> 57:20.671 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And none are greater or braver than those
who fight for America in uniform.

57:20.771 --> 57:34.017 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn

57:34.117 --> 57:42.492 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy Special Operator,
Senior Chief William Ryan Owens.

57:42.592 --> 57:49.266 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero,
battling against terrorism and securing our

57:49.366 --> 57:59.176 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nation.

57:59.276 --> 58:21.832 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
I just spoke to our great General Mattis just

58:21.932 --> 58:30.140 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, Ryan
was a part of a highly successful raid that

58:30.240 --> 58:35.946 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
generated large amounts of vital intelligence
that will lead to many more victories in the

58:36.046 --> 58:38.582 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
future against our enemy.

58:38.682 --> 58:44.955 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Ryan s legacy is etched into eternity.

58:45.055 --> 59:19.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

59:19.389 --> 01:00:31.328 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
And Ryan is looking down right now.

01:00:31.428 --> 01:00:32.696 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know that.

01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:38.134 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
And he s very happy, because I think he
just broke a record.

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:46.276 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater

01:00:46.376 --> 01:00:51.748 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
act of love than to lay down one s life
for one s friends.

01:00:51.848 --> 01:00:56.987 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for
his country, and for our freedom.

01:00:57.087 --> 01:01:11.134 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we will never forget Ryan.

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:25.715 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
To those allies who wonder what kind of a

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:31.621 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
friend America will be, look no further thanthe heroes who wear our uniform.

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:38.461 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust,
and meaningful engagement with the world.

01:01:38.562 --> 01:01:45.101 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
It is American leadership based on vital security
interests that we share with our allies all

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the globe.

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:53.510 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged
through the bonds of two world wars, that

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:56.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dethroned fascism

01:01:56.146 --> 01:02:09.826 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
and a Cold War and defeated communism.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:14.631 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
But our partners must meet their financial

01:02:14.731 --> 01:02:16.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
obligations.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:24.708 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And now, based on our very strong and frank
discussions, they are beginning to do just

01:02:24.808 --> 01:02:25.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:28.044 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring
in.

01:02:28.144 --> 01:02:30.981 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very nice.

01:02:31.081 --> 01:02:39.489 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:45.462 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the Middle East, or in the Pacific, to take
a direct and meaningful role in both strategic

01:02:45.562 --> 01:02:50.900 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and military operations, and pay their fair
share of the cost.

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:52.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Have to do that.

01:02:52.802 --> 01:03:00.510 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We will respect historic institutions, but
we will respect the foreign rights of all

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:01.778 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nations.

01:03:01.878 --> 01:03:09.285 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they have to respect our rights as a nation,
also.

01:03:09.386 --> 01:03:15.859 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:22.098 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the will of the people, and America respects
the right of all nations to chart their own

01:03:22.198 --> 01:03:23.099 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
path.

01:03:23.199 --> 01:03:26.036 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
My job is not to represent the world.

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:38.048 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My job is to represent the United States of
America.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:49.726 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
But we know that America is better off when

01:03:49.826 --> 01:03:52.896 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
there is less conflict, not more.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:56.566 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We must learn from the mistakes of the past.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:04:02.672 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have seen the war and the destruction that
have ravaged and raged throughout the world.

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:04.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All across the world.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:10.647 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The only long-term solution for these humanitarian
disasters, in many cases, is to create the

01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:18.488 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
conditions where displaced persons can safely
return home and begin the long, long process

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:22.592 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of rebuilding.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:28.131 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
America is willing to find new friends, and

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:33.236 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
to forge new partnerships, where shared interests
align.

01:04:33.336 --> 01:04:37.574 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We want harmony and stability, not war and
conflict.

01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:41.511 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We want peace, wherever peace can be found.

01:04:41.611 --> 01:04:45.682 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
America is friends today with former enemies.

01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:53.523 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought
on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wars.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:59.796 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This history should give us all faith in the
possibilities for a better world.

01:04:59.896 --> 01:05:07.971 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Hopefully, the 250th year for America will
see a world that is more peaceful, more just,

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and more free.

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:17.413 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens
from across our nation came to Philadelphia

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:20.950 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
to celebrate America s centennial.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:26.723 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At that celebration, the country s builders
and artists and inventors showed off their

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:28.525 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wonderful creations.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:32.796 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone
for the first time.

01:05:32.896 --> 01:05:36.900 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Remington unveiled the first typewriter.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.270 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
An early attempt was made at electric light.

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:46.376 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph
and an electric pen.

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:56.486 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Imagine the wonders our country could know
in America s 250th year.

01:05:56.586 --> 01:06:02.425 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
Think of the marvels we could achieve if we

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:05.562 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
simply set free the dreams of our people.

01:06:05.662 --> 01:06:12.468 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Cures to the illnesses that have always plaguedus are not too much to hope.

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:17.640 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
American footprints on distant worlds are
not too big a dream.

01:06:17.740 --> 01:06:23.146 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Millions lifted from welfare to work is not
too much to expect.

01:06:23.246 --> 01:06:29.285 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And streets where mothers are safe from fear
schools where children learn in peace,

01:06:29.385 --> 01:06:42.398 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.

01:06:42.498 --> 01:06:53.309 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
When we have all of this, we will have made

01:06:53.409 --> 01:06:57.513 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
America greater than ever before, for all
Americans.

01:06:57.614 --> 01:06:59.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is our vision.

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is our mission.

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:03.753 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
But we can only get there together.

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:07.557 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We are one people, with one destiny.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:10.226 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We all bleed the same blood.

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:15.732 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We all salute the same great American flag.

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:25.441 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And we are all made by the same God.

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:42.058 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)
When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate

01:07:42.158 --> 01:07:50.166 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will
look back on tonight as when this new chapter

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:53.836 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of American greatness began.

01:07:53.937 --> 01:07:57.407 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
The time for small thinking is over.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:08:01.844 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The time for trivial fights is behind us.

01:08:01.945 --> 01:08:07.917 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We just need the courage to share the dreams
that fill our hearts, the bravery to express

01:08:08.017 --> 01:08:15.058 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence
to turn those hopes and those dreams into

01:08:15.158 --> 01:08:16.893 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action.

01:08:16.993 --> 01:08:24.834 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
From now on, America will be empowered by
our aspirations, not burdened by our fears,

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:33.509 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
inspired by the future, not bound by failures
of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:35.445 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by our doubts.

01:08:35.545 --> 01:08:41.617 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal
of the American spirit.

01:08:41.718 --> 01:08:48.257 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am asking all members of Congress to join
me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things

01:08:48.358 --> 01:08:50.293 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for our country.

of our nation s path toward civil rights

01:08:52.362 --> 01:08:54.030 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
and the work that still remains to be done.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:30.867 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
divided on policies, we are a country that
stands united in condemning hate and evil

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:46.516 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
That torch is now in our hands.

01:09:46.616 --> 01:09:55.124 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And we will use it to light up the world.

01:09:55.224 --> 01:10:11.507 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am here tonight to deliver a message of
unity and strength, and it is a message deeply

01:10:11.607 --> 01:10:16.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
delivered from my heart.

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:17.346 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A new chapter

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:18.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:20.349 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
of American greatness is now beginning.

01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:24.353 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A new national pride is sweeping across our
nation.

01:10:24.454 --> 01:10:32.361 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And a new surge of optimism is placing impossibledreams firmly within our grasp.

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:36.999 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What we are witnessing today is the renewal
of the American spirit.

01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:40.203 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our allies will find that America is once
again ready to lead.

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:41.871 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:47.343 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
All the nations of the world friend or
foe will find that America is strong,

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:49.212 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
America is proud, and America is free.

01:10:49.312 --> 01:10:54.517 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In nine years, the United States will celebrate
the 250th anniversary of our founding, 250

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:58.121 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
years since the day we declared our independence.

01:10:58.221 --> 01:11:03.659 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It will be one of the great milestones inthe history of the world.

01:11:03.759 --> 01:11:09.065 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But what will America look like as we reach
our 250th year?

01:11:09.165 --> 01:11:13.569 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What kind of country will we leave for our
children?

01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:21.210 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I will not allow the mistakes of recent decades
past to define the course of our future.

01:11:21.310 --> 01:11:29.418 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For too long, we ve watched our middle class
shrink as we ve exported our jobs and wealth

01:11:29.519 --> 01:11:31.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to foreign countries.

01:11:31.387 --> 01:11:38.594 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We ve financed and built one global project
after another, but ignored the fates of our

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:43.766 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
children in the inner cities of Chicago, Baltimore,
Detroit, and so many other places throughout

01:11:43.866 --> 01:11:45.635 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our land.

01:11:45.735 --> 01:11:49.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We ve defended the borders of other nations,
while leaving our own borders wide open, for

01:11:49.372 --> 01:11:55.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
anyone to cross, and for drugs to pour inat a now unprecedented rate.

01:11:55.511 --> 01:11:59.549 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
And we ve spent trillions and trillions
of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:01.250 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
at home has so badly crumbled.

01:12:01.350 --> 01:12:03.819 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Then, in 2016, the earth shifted beneath our
feet.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:08.491 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The rebellion started as a quiet protest,
spoken by families of all colors and creeds,

01:12:08.591 --> 01:12:12.495 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
families who just wanted a fair shot for their
children, and a fair hearing for their concerns.

01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:17.166 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But then the quiet voices became a loud chorus,
as thousands of citizens now spoke out together,

01:12:17.266 --> 01:12:19.702 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
from cities small and large, all across our
country.

01:12:19.802 --> 01:12:25.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Finally, the chorus became an earthquake,
and the people turned out by the tens of millions,

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:31.314 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and they were all united by one very simple,
but crucial demand, that America must put

01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:36.419 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
its own citizens first, because only then
can we truly make America great again.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:37.620 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:39.689 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Dying industries will come roaring back to
life.

01:12:39.789 --> 01:12:42.658 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Heroic veterans will get the care they so
desperately need.

01:12:42.758 --> 01:12:46.329 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our military will be given the resources its
brave warriors so richly deserve.

01:12:46.429 --> 01:12:49.131 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Crumbling infrastructure will be replaced
with new roads, bridges, tunnels, airports

01:12:49.232 --> 01:12:51.701 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and railways, gleaming across our very, very
beautiful land.

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:54.637 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our terrible drug epidemic will slow down
and ultimately stop.

01:12:54.737 --> 01:12:58.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And our neglected inner cities will see a
rebirth of hope, safety, and opportunity.

01:12:58.841 --> 01:13:02.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Above all else, we will keep our promises
to the American people.

01:13:02.511 --> 01:13:03.412 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.181 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

It s been a little over a month since my
inauguration, and I want to take this moment

01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:12.622 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to update the nation on the progress I vemade in keeping those promises.

tens of thousands of new American jobs.

(APPLAUSE)

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:31.874 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

in value since the election on November 8th,

01:13:31.974 --> 01:13:33.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a record.

01:13:33.909 --> 01:13:35.811 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

of dollars by bringing down the price of fantastic

on contracts all across our government.

and non-essential federal workers.

01:13:42.852 --> 01:13:46.522 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have begun to drain the swamp of government
corruption by imposing a five-year ban on

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:49.258 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
lobbying by executive branch officials and

a foreign government.

01:13:54.797 --> 01:13:56.565 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
We have undertaken a historic effort to massively
reduce job-crushing regulations, creating

01:13:56.666 --> 01:13:58.934 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a deregulation task force inside of every
government agency

01:14:02.972 --> 01:14:04.407 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
two old regulations must be eliminated.

(APPLAUSE)

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:10.346 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%

directed the Department of Justice to form

a task force on reducing violent crime.

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:56.192 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have further ordered the Departments of
Homeland Security and Justice, along with

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.351 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

save billions and billions of dollars, and

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
chaos.

01:15:35.798 --> 01:15:40.102 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We must restore integrity and the rule of

innocent citizens.

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:56.051 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Bad ones are going out as I speak, and as
I promised throughout the campaign.

To any in Congress who do not believe we should
enforce our laws, I would ask you this one

01:16:02.324 --> 01:16:07.296 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
question: What would you say to the American
family that loses their jobs, their income,

01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:12.168 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
or their loved one, because America refused

(APPLAUSE)

01:16:14.003 --> 01:16:16.806 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%

01:16:31.253 --> 01:16:37.693 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have seen the attacks at home, from Boston
to San Bernardino to the Pentagon and, yes,

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:39.462 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
even the World Trade Center.

01:16:39.562 --> 01:16:45.301 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have seen the attacks in France, in Belgium,
in Germany, and all over the world.

01:16:45.401 --> 01:16:49.138 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is not compassionate, but reckless to allow
uncontrolled entry from places where proper

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:50.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
vetting cannot occur.

01:16:50.239 --> 01:16:52.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:56.712 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Those given the high honor of admission to
the United States should support this country

01:16:56.812 --> 01:17:00.216 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
and love its people and its values.

01:17:00.316 --> 01:17:03.919 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to
form inside America, and we cannot allow our

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:06.088 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
nation to become a sanctuary for extremists.

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:10.092 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
(APPLAUSE) That is why my administration has
been working on improved vetting procedures,

01:17:10.192 --> 01:17:17.533 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and we will shortly take new steps to keep
our nation safe, and to keep those out who

01:17:17.633 --> 01:17:18.534 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
will do us harm.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:20.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:17:20.436 --> 01:17:22.204 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As promised, I directed the Department of
Defense to develop a plan to demolish and

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:27.076 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
destroy ISIS, a network of lawless savages
that have slaughtered Muslims and Christians,

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:30.679 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and men, women, and children of all faiths
and all beliefs.

01:17:30.779 --> 01:17:33.616 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We will work with our allies, including our
friends and allies in the Muslim world, to

01:17:33.716 --> 01:17:35.618 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:37.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:40.189 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have also imposed new sanctions on entities
and individuals who support Iran s ballistic

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:43.225 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
missile program, and reaffirmed our unbreakable
alliance with the state of Israel.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:45.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:47.229 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Finally, I have kept my promise to appoint
a justice to the United States Supreme Court,

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:51.233 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
from my list of 20 judges, who will defend
our Constitution.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:52.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:56.739 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am greatly honored to have Maureen Scaliawith us in the gallery tonight.

01:17:56.839 --> 01:17:57.740 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
(APPLAUSE)

01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you, Maureen.

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:03.445 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Her late, great husband, Antonin Scalia, will
forever be a symbol of American justice.

01:18:03.546 --> 01:18:09.451 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
To fill his seat, we have chosen Judge Neil
Gorsuch, a man of incredible skill and deep

01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:11.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
devotion to the law.

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:17.993 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He was confirmed unanimously by the Court
of Appeals, and I am asking the Senate to

01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.728 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
swiftly approve his nomination.

01:18:19.828 --> 01:18:21.630 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.966 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Tonight, as I outline the next steps we must
take as a country, we must honestly acknowledge

01:18:24.066 --> 01:18:25.301 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the circumstances we inherited.

01:18:25.401 --> 01:18:27.202 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ninety- four million Americans are out of
the labor force.

01:18:27.303 --> 01:18:29.972 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
Over 43 million people are now living in poverty.

01:18:30.072 --> 01:18:32.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And over 43 million Americans are on food
stamps.

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:37.046 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
More than 1 in 5 people in their prime working
years are not working.

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:39.782 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have the worst financial recovery in 65
years.

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:45.321 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In the last 8 years, the past administration
has put on more new debt than nearly all of

01:18:45.421 --> 01:18:47.222 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the other presidents combined.

01:18:47.323 --> 01:18:51.527 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
We ve lost more than one-fourth of our manufacturing
jobs since NAFTA was approved, and we ve

01:18:51.627 --> 01:18:55.230 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
lost 60,000 factories since China joined the
World Trade Organization in 2001.

01:18:55.331 --> 01:18:59.201 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our trade deficit in goods with the world
last year was nearly $800 billion.

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:02.037 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And overseas, we have inherited a series oftragic foreign policy disasters.

01:19:02.137 --> 01:19:04.773 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Solving these, and so many other pressing
problems, will require us to work past the

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:06.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
differences of party.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:09.144 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It will require us to tap into the American
spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout

01:19:09.244 --> 01:19:11.013 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
our long and storied history.

01:19:11.113 --> 01:19:13.248 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But to accomplish our goals at home and abroad,
we must restart the engine of the American

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:15.851 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
economy, making it easier for companies to
do business in the United States and much,

01:19:15.951 --> 01:19:17.186 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
much harder for companies to leave our country.

01:19:17.286 --> 01:19:19.054 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:20.923 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Right now, American companies are taxed at
one of the highest rates anywhere in the world.

01:19:21.023 --> 01:19:22.391 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My economic team is developing historic tax
reform that will reduce the tax rate on our

01:19:22.491 --> 01:19:25.394 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere
and with anyone.

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:26.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:19:26.495 --> 01:19:27.997 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It will be a big, big cut.

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:32.468 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At the same time, we will provide massivetax relief for the middle class.

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:36.205 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
We must create a level playing field for Americancompanies and our workers.

01:19:36.305 --> 01:19:37.206 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
&nbsp;
Have to do it.

01:19:37.306 --> 01:19:39.074 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:19:39.174 --> 01:19:41.210 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Currently, when we ship products out of America,
many other countries make us pay very high

01:19:41.310 --> 01:19:44.613 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
tariffs and taxes, but when foreign companies
ship their products into America, we charge

01:19:44.713 --> 01:19:46.415 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
them nothing or almost nothing.

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:49.385 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I just met with officials and workers from
a great American company, Harley-Davidson.

01:19:49.485 --> 01:19:53.856 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In fact, they proudly displayed five of their
magnificent motorcycles, made in the USA,

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:56.392 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
on the front lawn of the White House.

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:57.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:19:57.860 --> 01:20:00.863 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they wanted me to ride one, and I said,
No, thank you.

01:20:00.963 --> 01:20:02.331 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:20:02.431 --> 01:20:05.334 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At our meeting, I asked them, how are you
doing, how is business?

01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:07.202 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They said that it s good.

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:11.407 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I asked them further, how are you doing with
other countries, mainly international sales?

01:20:11.507 --> 01:20:17.413 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TRUMP: They told me without even complaining,
because they have been so mistreated for so

01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:22.317 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
long that they ve become used to it that
it s very hard to do business with other

01:20:22.418 --> 01:20:25.621 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
countries because they tax our goods at such
a high rate.

01:20:25.721 --> 01:20:29.491 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They said that in the case of another country,
they taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.

01:20:29.591 --> 01:20:31.160 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
They weren t even asking for a change.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:32.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But I am.

01:20:32.261 --> 01:20:33.162 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I believe

01:20:33.262 --> 01:20:34.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:37.132 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I believe strongly in free trade, but it also
has to be fair trade.

01:20:37.232 --> 01:20:41.570 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
It s been a long time since we had fair
trade.

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:47.376 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The first Republican president, Abraham Lincoln,
warned that the abandonment of the protective

01:20:47.476 --> 01:20:54.516 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
policy by the American government will producewant and ruin among our people.

01:20:54.616 --> 01:21:02.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Lincoln was right, and it s time we heededhis advice and his words.

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:03.959 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
(APPLAUSE)

01:21:04.059 --> 01:21:10.566 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am not going to let America and its great
companies and workers be taken advantage

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:11.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of us any longer.

01:21:12.034 --> 01:21:15.237 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They have taken advantage of our country no
longer.

01:21:15.337 --> 01:21:16.271 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:19.308 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I am going to bring back millions of jobs.

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:23.779 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Protecting our workers also means reformingour system of legal immigration.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:25.681 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
(APPLAUSE)

01:21:25.781 --> 01:21:30.686 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The current, outdated system depresses wages
for our poorest workers and puts great pressure

01:21:30.786 --> 01:21:32.688 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on taxpayers.

01:21:32.788 --> 01:21:35.190 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Nations around the world, like Canada, Australia,
and many others, have a merit-based immigration

01:21:35.290 --> 01:21:36.191 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
system.

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:38.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:42.431 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It s a basic principle that those seeking
to enter a country ought to be able to support

01:21:42.531 --> 01:21:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
themselves financially.

01:21:44.433 --> 01:21:49.872 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Yet, in America, we do not enforce this rule,
straining the very public resources that our

01:21:49.972 --> 01:21:51.807 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
poorest citizens rely upon.

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:56.111 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
According to the National Academy of Sciences,
our current immigration system costs American

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:58.680 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.

01:21:58.781 --> 01:22:03.085 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Switching away from this current system of
lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting

01:22:03.185 --> 01:22:06.722 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a merit-based system, we will have so many
more benefits.

01:22:06.822 --> 01:22:14.029 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It will save countless dollars, raise workers
wages, and help struggling families, including

01:22:14.129 --> 01:22:17.633 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
immigrant families, enter the middle class.

01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:21.970 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they will do it quickly, and they willbe very, very happy, indeed.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.806 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
(APPLAUSE)

01:22:23.906 --> 01:22:28.310 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I believe that real and positive immigration
reform is possible, as long as we focus on

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:39.421 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the following goals: To improve jobs and wages
for Americans; to strengthen our nation s

01:22:39.521 --> 01:22:42.424 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
security; and to restore respect for our laws.

01:22:42.524 --> 01:22:50.365 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If we are guided by the well-being of American
citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats

01:22:50.465 --> 01:22:55.270 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
can work together to achieve an outcome that
has eluded our country for decades.

01:22:55.370 --> 01:22:57.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:22:57.539 --> 01:23:00.876 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Another Republican president, Dwight D. Eisenhower,
initiated the last truly great national infrastructure

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:05.247 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
program: The building of the interstate highway

The time has come for a new program of national
rebuilding.

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:12.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:16.692 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
America has spent approximately $6 trillion
in the Middle East, all the while our infrastructure

01:23:16.792 --> 01:23:18.594 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at home is crumbling.

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:24.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
With the $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt
our country twice, and maybe even three times,

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:29.204 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
if we had people who had the ability to negotiate.

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:31.006 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.875 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
To launch our national rebuilding, I will
be asking Congress to approve legislation

01:23:32.975 --> 01:23:36.411 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that produces a $1 trillion investment in
infrastructure of the United States, financed

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:39.114 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
through both public and private capital, creating
millions of new jobs.

01:23:39.214 --> 01:23:40.849 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:44.152 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
This effort will be guided by two core principles:Buy American and hire American.

01:23:44.253 --> 01:23:45.787 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
&nbsp;
(APPLAUSE)

01:23:45.888 --> 01:23:50.792 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Tonight, I am also calling on this Congressto repeal and replace Obamacare

01:23:50.893 --> 01:23:52.628 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
(APPLAUSE)

01:23:52.728 --> 01:23:58.000 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with reforms that expand choice, increase
access, lower costs, and at the same time

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:00.002 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
provide better health care.

01:24:00.102 --> 01:24:02.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:24:02.137 --> 01:24:06.041 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Mandating every American to buy government-approved
health insurance was never the right solution

01:24:06.141 --> 01:24:07.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for our country.

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:09.344 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:16.418 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The way to make health insurance available
to everyone is to lower the cost of health

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:19.521 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
insurance, and that is what we are going to
do.

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:21.123 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:24:21.223 --> 01:24:24.693 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Obamacare premiums nationwide have increasedby double and triple digits.

01:24:24.793 --> 01:24:29.865 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As an example, Arizona went up 116 percent
last year alone.

01:24:29.965 --> 01:24:36.738 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Governor Matt Bevin of Kentucky just said
Obamacare is failing in his state, the state

01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:38.674 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
of Kentucky, and it s unsustainable and
collapsing.

01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:41.710 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
One third of the counties have only one insurer,
and they re losing them fast, they are losing

01:24:41.810 --> 01:24:43.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
them so fast.

01:24:43.345 --> 01:24:44.246 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They re leaving.

01:24:44.346 --> 01:24:47.049 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And many Americans have no choice at all.

01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:48.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There s no choice left.

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:54.256 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Remember when you were told that you could
keep your doctor and keep your plan?

01:24:54.356 --> 01:24:59.661 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We now know that all of those promises have
been totally broken.

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:04.433 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Obamacare is collapsing, and we must act decisivelyto protect all Americans.

01:25:04.533 --> 01:25:05.467 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
&nbsp;
(APPLAUSE)

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:08.370 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Action is not a choice; it is a necessity.

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:15.444 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So I am calling on all Democrats and Republicans
in Congress to work with us to save Americans

01:25:15.544 --> 01:25:17.479 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
from this imploding Obamacare disaster.

01:25:17.579 --> 01:25:19.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:25:19.448 --> 01:25:24.886 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Here are the principles that should guide
Congress as we move to create a better health

01:25:24.987 --> 01:25:27.089 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
care system for all Americans.

01:25:27.189 --> 01:25:30.859 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
First, we should ensure that Americans with
pre-existing conditions have access to coverage

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:35.897 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
and that we have a stable transition for Americans
currently enrolled in the health care exchanges.

01:25:35.998 --> 01:25:37.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:25:37.833 --> 01:25:42.571 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Secondly, we should help Americans purchase
their own coverage, through the use of tax

01:25:42.671 --> 01:25:48.543 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
credits and expanded health savings accounts,
but it must be the plan they want, not the

01:25:48.643 --> 01:25:51.179 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
plan forced on them by our government.

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:53.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:57.252 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thirdly, we should give our state governors
the resources and flexibility they need with

01:25:57.352 --> 01:26:00.922 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Medicaid to make sure no one is left out.

01:26:01.023 --> 01:26:02.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:06.828 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Fourth, we should implement legal reforms
that protect patients and doctors from unnecessary

01:26:06.928 --> 01:26:12.300 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
costs that drive up the price of insurance
and work to bring down the artificially high

01:26:12.401 --> 01:26:14.302 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
price of drugs and bring them down immediately.

01:26:14.403 --> 01:26:16.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:20.909 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And finally, the time has come to give Americans
the freedom to purchase health insurance across

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:21.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
state lines

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:26:23.745 --> 01:26:27.783 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
which will create a truly competitive
national marketplace that will bring costs

01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:30.786 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
way down and provide far better care.

01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:32.087 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So important.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:36.525 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Everything that is broken in our country can
be fixed.

01:26:36.625 --> 01:26:38.493 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Every problem can be solved.

01:26:38.593 --> 01:26:42.097 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And every hurting family can find healing
and hope.

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:46.902 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our citizens deserve this, and so much more,
so why not join forces and finally get the

01:26:47.002 --> 01:26:50.105 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
job done and get it done right?

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:52.007 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:26:52.107 --> 01:26:56.878 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On this and so many other things, Democrats
and Republicans should get together and unite

01:26:56.978 --> 01:27:07.789 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
for the good of our country and for the good
of the American people.

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:09.658 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:27:09.758 --> 01:27:13.728 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My administration wants to work with members
of both parties to make childcare accessible

01:27:13.829 --> 01:27:17.632 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and affordable, to help ensure new parents
that they have paid family leave

01:27:17.732 --> 01:27:19.367 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:27:19.468 --> 01:27:25.207 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
to invest in women s health, and to
promote clean air and clean water, and to

01:27:25.307 --> 01:27:27.776 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
rebuild our military and our infrastructure.

01:27:27.876 --> 01:27:29.611 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:27:29.711 --> 01:27:34.449 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
True love for our people requires us to find
common ground, to advance the common good,

01:27:34.549 --> 01:27:40.322 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and to cooperate on behalf of every American
child who deserves a much brighter future.

01:27:40.422 --> 01:27:46.862 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
An incredible young woman is with us this
evening who should serve as an inspiration

01:27:46.962 --> 01:27:48.663 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to us all.

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:54.469 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Today is Rare Disease Day, and joining us
in the gallery is a rare disease survivor,

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:55.470 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Megan Crowley.

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:56.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Megan

01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:58.273 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:27:58.373 --> 01:28:02.210 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Megan was diagnosed with Pompe disease, a
rare and serious illness, when she was 15

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:03.211 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
months old.

01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:06.281 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
She was not expected to live past five.

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:12.320 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On receiving this news, Megan s dad, John,
fought with everything he had to save the

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.823 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
life of his precious child.

01:28:14.923 --> 01:28:24.099 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He founded a company to look for a cure and
helped develop the drug that saved Megan s

01:28:24.199 --> 01:28:25.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

01:28:25.534 --> 01:28:28.937 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Today she is 20 years old and a sophomore
at Notre Dame.

01:28:29.037 --> 01:28:30.605 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:28:30.705 --> 01:28:34.976 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Megan s story is about the unbounded power
of a father s love for a daughter.

01:28:35.076 --> 01:28:42.417 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But our slow and burdensome approval process
at the Food and Drug Administration keeps

01:28:42.517 --> 01:28:48.423 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
too many advances, like the one that saved
Megan s life, from reaching those in need.

01:28:48.523 --> 01:28:54.629 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If we slash the restraints, not just at the
FDA but across our government, then we will

01:28:54.729 --> 01:28:58.366 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
be blessed with far more miracles just like
Megan.

01:28:58.466 --> 01:28:59.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:28:59.834 --> 01:29:04.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In fact, our children will grow up in a nation
of miracles.

01:29:04.372 --> 01:29:12.581 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But to achieve this future, we must enrich
the mind and the souls of every American

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:13.782 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
child.

01:29:13.882 --> 01:29:18.987 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Education is the civil rights issue of our
time.

01:29:19.087 --> 01:29:20.822 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:29:20.922 --> 01:29:28.296 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am calling upon members of both parties
to pass an education bill that funds school

01:29:28.396 --> 01:29:33.301 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
choice for disadvantaged youth, including
millions of African-American and Latino children.

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:35.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:29:35.270 --> 01:29:37.672 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These families should be free to choose the
public, private, charter, magnet, religious,

01:29:37.772 --> 01:29:40.175 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
or home school that is right for them.

01:29:40.275 --> 01:29:41.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:29:41.977 --> 01:29:45.847 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkablewoman, Denisha Merriweather.

01:29:45.947 --> 01:29:52.487 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
As a young girl, Denisha struggled in schooland failed third grade twice.

01:29:52.587 --> 01:29:58.126 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But then she was able to enroll in a private
center for learning, great learning center,

01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:02.697 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with the help of a tax credit and a scholarship
program.

01:30:02.797 --> 01:30:09.037 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Today, she is the first in her family to graduate,
not just from high school, but from college.

01:30:09.137 --> 01:30:14.009 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Later this year, she will get her master s
degree in social work.

01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:20.582 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We want all children to be able to break the
cycle of poverty just like Denisha.

01:30:20.682 --> 01:30:22.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:24.185 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But to break the cycle of poverty, we must
also break the cycle of violence.

01:30:24.286 --> 01:30:28.490 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The murder rate in 2015 experienced its largest
single- year increase in nearly half a century.

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:32.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In Chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot
last year alone, and the murder rate so far

01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.261 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
this year has been even higher.

01:30:33.361 --> 01:30:34.396 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
This is not acceptable in our society.

01:30:34.496 --> 01:30:36.231 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:30:36.331 --> 01:30:37.432 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Every American child should be able to grow
up in a safe community, to attend a great

01:30:37.532 --> 01:30:40.268 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
school, and to have access to a high- paying
job.

01:30:40.368 --> 01:30:42.037 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:30:42.137 --> 01:30:45.507 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But to create this future, we must work with
not against not against the men

01:30:45.607 --> 01:30:47.108 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and women of law enforcement.

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:48.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:52.814 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We must build bridges of cooperation and trust,
not drive the wedge of disunity and it s

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:53.815 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
really, it s what it is, division.

01:30:53.915 --> 01:30:54.816 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It s pure, unadulterated division.

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:55.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have to unify.

01:30:56.084 --> 01:30:57.752 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
Police and sheriffs are members of our community.

01:30:57.852 --> 01:30:59.487 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
They re friends and neighbors, they re
mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, and

01:30:59.587 --> 01:31:02.957 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
they leave behind loved ones every day who
worry about whether or not they ll come

01:31:03.058 --> 01:31:04.426 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
home safe and sound.

01:31:04.526 --> 01:31:05.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We must support the incredible men and women
of law enforcement.

01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:06.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:31:06.394 --> 01:31:08.163 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And we must support the victims of crime.

01:31:08.263 --> 01:31:09.798 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I have ordered the Department of Homeland
Security to create an office to serve American

01:31:09.898 --> 01:31:11.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
victims.

01:31:11.433 --> 01:31:13.134 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The office is called VOICE, Victims of Immigration
Crime Engagement.

01:31:13.234 --> 01:31:15.003 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are providing a voice to those who have
been ignored by our media and silenced by

01:31:15.103 --> 01:31:16.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
special interests.

01:31:16.104 --> 01:31:17.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Joining us

01:31:17.105 --> 01:31:18.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:19.307 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Joining us in the audience tonight are four
very brave Americans whose government failed

01:31:19.407 --> 01:31:20.909 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

01:31:21.009 --> 01:31:22.811 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Their names are Jamiel Shaw, Susan Oliver,Jenna Oliver, and Jessica Davis.

01:31:22.911 --> 01:31:24.879 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Jamiel s 17-year-old son was viciously murdered
by an illegal immigrant gang member who had

01:31:24.979 --> 01:31:26.715 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
just been released from prison.

01:31:26.815 --> 01:31:31.586 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Jamiel Shaw, Jr., was an incredible young
man with unlimited potential who was getting

01:31:31.686 --> 01:31:37.292 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
ready to go to college where he would have
excelled as a great college quarterback.

01:31:37.392 --> 01:31:39.060 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But he never got the chance.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:43.031 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
His father, who is in the audience tonight,
has become a very good friend of mine.

01:31:43.131 --> 01:31:44.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Jamiel, thank you.

01:31:44.132 --> 01:31:45.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

01:31:45.133 --> 01:31:46.234 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:31:46.334 --> 01:31:48.002 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Also with us are Susan Oliver and Jessica
Davis.

01:31:48.103 --> 01:31:51.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Their husbands Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver
and Detective Michael Davis were slain

01:31:51.373 --> 01:31:52.474 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
in the line of duty in California.

01:31:52.574 --> 01:31:54.342 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
They were pillars of their community.

01:31:54.442 --> 01:31:57.245 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
These brave men were viciously gunned down
by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record

01:31:57.345 --> 01:31:58.246 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and two prior deportations.

01:31:58.346 --> 01:31:59.280 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Should have never been in our country.

01:31:59.381 --> 01:32:01.149 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Sitting with Susan is her daughter, Jenna.

01:32:01.249 --> 01:32:04.919 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Jenna, I want you to know that your father
was a hero and that tonight you have the love

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.389 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of an entire country supporting you and praying
for you.

01:32:07.489 --> 01:32:09.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:11.493 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
To Jamiel, Jenna, Susan and Jessica, I want
you to know that we will never stop fighting

01:32:11.593 --> 01:32:12.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for justice.

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:14.028 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Your loved ones will never, ever be forgotten.

01:32:14.129 --> 01:32:16.297 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We will always honor their memory.

01:32:16.398 --> 01:32:18.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:32:18.333 --> 01:32:21.970 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Finally, to keep America safe, we must provide
the men and women of the United States military

01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:26.941 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with the tools they need to prevent war if
they must they have to fight and they

01:32:27.041 --> 01:32:28.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
only have to win.

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:30.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:32:30.378 --> 01:32:33.081 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am sending Congress a budget that rebuilds
the military, eliminates the defense sequester

01:32:33.181 --> 01:32:35.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:32:35.150 --> 01:32:38.453 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and calls for one of the largest increases
in national defense spending in American history.

01:32:38.553 --> 01:32:42.157 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My budget will also increase funding for our
veterans.

01:32:42.257 --> 01:32:45.660 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our veterans have delivered for this nation,
and now we must deliver for them.

01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:32:46.861 --> 01:32:47.662 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The challenges we face as a nation are great.

01:32:47.762 --> 01:32:49.330 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
But our people are even greater.

01:32:49.431 --> 01:32:52.233 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And none are greater or braver than those
who fight for America in uniform.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:54.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:32:54.269 --> 01:32:55.069 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn
Owens, the widow of U.S. Navy Special Operator,

01:32:55.170 --> 01:32:56.938 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Senior Chief William Ryan Owens.

01:32:57.038 --> 01:33:00.875 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ryan died as he lived, a warrior and a hero,
battling against terrorism and securing our

01:33:00.975 --> 01:33:01.876 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nation.

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:03.778 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:33:03.878 --> 01:33:05.780 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I just spoke to our great General Mattis just
now who reconfirmed that, and I quote, Ryan

01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:10.985 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
was a part of a highly successful raid that
generated large amounts of vital intelligence

01:33:11.085 --> 01:33:17.392 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that will lead to many more victories in thefuture against our enemy.

01:33:17.492 --> 01:33:19.327 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Ryan s legacy is etched into eternity.

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:20.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:21.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:33:21.429 --> 01:33:22.564 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And Ryan is looking down right now.

01:33:22.664 --> 01:33:23.932 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know that.

01:33:24.032 --> 01:33:25.500 align:left position:87.5%,start line:86.67% size:12.5%
And he s very happy, because I think he
just broke a record.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:27.302 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:33:27.402 --> 01:33:31.706 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater
act of love than to lay down one s life

01:33:31.806 --> 01:33:33.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for one s friends.

01:33:33.508 --> 01:33:37.178 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for
his country, and for our freedom.

01:33:37.278 --> 01:33:38.546 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we will never forget Ryan.

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:40.381 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:33:40.482 --> 01:33:43.151 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
To those allies who wonder what kind of a
friend America will be, look no further than

01:33:43.251 --> 01:33:45.019 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the heroes who wear our uniform.

01:33:45.119 --> 01:33:48.656 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust,
and meaningful engagement with the world.

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:52.460 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
It is American leadership based on vital security
interests that we share with our allies all

01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:54.295 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the globe.

01:33:54.395 --> 01:33:57.031 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged
through the bonds of two world wars, that

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dethroned fascism

01:33:58.132 --> 01:33:59.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:33:59.133 --> 01:34:00.034 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
and a Cold War and defeated communism.

01:34:00.134 --> 01:34:01.336 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:01.436 --> 01:34:03.171 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But our partners must meet their financial
obligations.

01:34:03.271 --> 01:34:04.906 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And now, based on our very strong and frank
discussions, they are beginning to do just

01:34:05.006 --> 01:34:06.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:06.908 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring
in.

01:34:07.008 --> 01:34:07.909 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Very nice.

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:09.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:09.878 --> 01:34:11.679 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in
the Middle East, or in the Pacific, to take

01:34:11.779 --> 01:34:12.747 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
a direct and meaningful role in both strategic
and military operations, and pay their fair

01:34:12.847 --> 01:34:13.748 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
share of the cost.

01:34:13.848 --> 01:34:15.550 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Have to do that.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:19.888 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We will respect historic institutions, but
we will respect the foreign rights of all

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:21.155 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
nations.

01:34:21.256 --> 01:34:22.624 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they have to respect our rights as a nation,
also.

01:34:22.724 --> 01:34:24.526 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:24.626 --> 01:34:25.960 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Free nations are the best vehicle for expressing
the will of the people, and America respects

01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:28.763 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the right of all nations to chart their own
path.

01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:32.400 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
My job is not to represent the world.

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:37.238 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
My job is to represent the United States of
America.

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:38.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:42.143 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But we know that America is better off when
there is less conflict, not more.

01:34:42.243 --> 01:34:44.879 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We must learn from the mistakes of the past.

01:34:44.979 --> 01:34:50.318 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We have seen the war and the destruction that
have ravaged and raged throughout the world.

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:52.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All across the world.

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:55.390 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The only long-term solution for these humanitarian
disasters, in many cases, is to create the

01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:59.160 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
conditions where displaced persons can safely
return home and begin the long, long process

01:34:59.260 --> 01:35:00.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of rebuilding.

America is willing to find new friends, and
to forge new partnerships, where shared interests

01:35:06.601 --> 01:35:07.769 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
align.

01:35:07.869 --> 01:35:11.806 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We want harmony and stability, not war and
conflict.

01:35:11.906 --> 01:35:15.343 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We want peace, wherever peace can be found.

01:35:15.443 --> 01:35:18.246 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
America is friends today with former enemies.

01:35:18.346 --> 01:35:22.784 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought
on the opposite side of these terrible, terrible

01:35:22.884 --> 01:35:24.485 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wars.

01:35:24.586 --> 01:35:27.055 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This history should give us all faith in the
possibilities for a better world.

01:35:27.155 --> 01:35:31.359 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Hopefully, the 250th year for America will
see a world that is more peaceful, more just,

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:33.194 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and more free.

01:35:33.294 --> 01:35:36.164 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
On our 100th anniversary in 1876, citizens
from across our nation came to Philadelphia

01:35:36.264 --> 01:35:37.999 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
to celebrate America s centennial.

01:35:38.099 --> 01:35:41.836 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
At that celebration, the country s builders
and artists and inventors showed off their

01:35:41.936 --> 01:35:43.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
wonderful creations.

01:35:43.438 --> 01:35:46.608 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Alexander Graham Bell displayed his telephone
for the first time.

01:35:46.708 --> 01:35:48.142 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Remington unveiled the first typewriter.

01:35:48.242 --> 01:35:50.612 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
An early attempt was made at electric light.

01:35:50.712 --> 01:35:53.648 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thomas Edison showed an automatic telegraph
and an electric pen.

01:35:53.748 --> 01:35:56.985 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Imagine the wonders our country could know
in America s 250th year.

01:35:57.085 --> 01:35:58.820 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:02.457 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Think of the marvels we could achieve if we
simply set free the dreams of our people.

01:36:02.557 --> 01:36:05.960 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Cures to the illnesses that have always plaguedus are not too much to hope.

01:36:06.060 --> 01:36:09.397 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
American footprints on distant worlds are
not too big a dream.

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:13.234 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Millions lifted from welfare to work is not
too much to expect.

01:36:13.334 --> 01:36:17.872 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And streets where mothers are safe from fear
schools where children learn in peace,

01:36:17.972 --> 01:36:21.709 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and jobs where Americans prosper and grow are not too much to ask.

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.544 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
(APPLAUSE)

01:36:23.645 --> 01:36:27.015 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When we have all of this, we will have made
America greater than ever before, for all

01:36:27.115 --> 01:36:28.016 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Americans.

01:36:28.116 --> 01:36:29.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is our vision.

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:30.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is our mission.

01:36:30.118 --> 01:36:31.019 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
But we can only get there together.

01:36:31.119 --> 01:36:32.020 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We are one people, with one destiny.

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.087 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We all bleed the same blood.

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:35.823 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We all salute the same great American flag.

01:36:35.923 --> 01:36:39.360 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And we are all made by the same God.

01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:41.229 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

01:36:41.329 --> 01:36:44.432 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
When we fulfill this vision, when we celebrate
our 250 years of glorious freedom, we will

01:36:44.532 --> 01:36:48.736 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
look back on tonight as when this new chapterof American greatness began.

01:36:48.836 --> 01:36:52.206 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
The time for small thinking is over.

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:54.509 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
The time for trivial fights is behind us.

01:36:54.609 --> 01:36:59.681 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We just need the courage to share the dreams
that fill our hearts, the bravery to express

01:36:59.781 --> 01:37:04.952 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
the hopes that stir our souls, and the confidence
to turn those hopes and those dreams into

01:37:05.053 --> 01:37:06.788 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action.

01:37:06.888 --> 01:37:10.058 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
From now on, America will be empowered by
our aspirations, not burdened by our fears,

01:37:10.158 --> 01:37:17.899 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
inspired by the future, not bound by failures
of the past, and guided by a vision, not blinded

01:37:17.999 --> 01:37:19.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by our doubts.

01:37:19.534 --> 01:37:23.771 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am asking all citizens to embrace this renewal
of the American spirit.

01:37:23.871 --> 01:37:28.776 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am asking all members of Congress to join
me in dreaming big, and bold, and daring things

01:37:28.876 --> 01:37:30.144 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for our country.

01:37:30.244 --> 01:37:32.113 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am asking everyone watching tonight to seize
this moment.

01:37:32.213 --> 01:37:33.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Believe in yourselves.

01:37:33.214 --> 01:37:34.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Believe in your future.

01:37:34.449 --> 01:37:36.284 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And believe, once more, in America.

01:37:36.384 --> 01:37:39.620 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DONALD TRUMP: Thank you, God bless you, andGod bless the United States.

01:37:41.622 --> 01:37:43.991 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that concludes President
Trump's address to a joint session of Congress,

01:37:44.092 --> 01:37:45.460 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
his first address to a joint session.

01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:47.595 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Coming up in just a few minutes will be the
Democrats' response.

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:50.298 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It will be delivered by the former Kentucky
Governor Steve Beshear.

01:37:50.398 --> 01:37:57.038 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And a woman named Astrid Silva, she was brought
to the United States as a child without legal

01:37:57.138 --> 01:38:00.208 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
documentation, one of the dreamers, she'snow an immigration activist.

01:38:00.308 --> 01:38:02.577 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She will deliver the Democrats' Spanish-language
response.

01:38:02.677 --> 01:38:07.548 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Still joining here us at the "NewsHour" table
in Washington are Mark Shields, David Brooks,

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:09.817 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
Amy Walter, Matt Schlapp, and Karine Jean-Pierre.

01:38:09.917 --> 01:38:15.323 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mark Shields, this was Donald Trump's, some
would say, second attempt to tell the American

01:38:15.423 --> 01:38:17.792 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
people what he wants to do as president.

01:38:17.892 --> 01:38:19.660 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We have heard his inaugural address.

01:38:19.761 --> 01:38:21.496 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
This was a very different speech.

01:38:21.596 --> 01:38:25.099 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: Very, very different speech,
short on American carnage, a lot more upbeat

01:38:25.199 --> 01:38:26.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in sections.

01:38:27.034 --> 01:38:32.440 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I -- what just amazes me about him is, he
goes from an appeal to unity, and we have

01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:36.244 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to work together, and then insists on calling
the Democratic health plan a disaster, which

01:38:36.344 --> 01:38:37.979 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
is not a bridge-building -- is not bridge-building
language.

01:38:38.079 --> 01:38:40.114 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, you know, it was -- it is an expensive
speech.

01:38:40.214 --> 01:38:42.850 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is a very -- there's a -- you put a dollar
sign next to that.

01:38:42.950 --> 01:38:45.253 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But he did do what other presidents have done
that was far more traditional and ceremonial

01:38:45.353 --> 01:38:46.621 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
than the Donald Trump we have come to expect.

01:38:46.721 --> 01:38:48.656 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It -- there was a little self-congratulatory
at the outset.

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:52.059 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And he returns to that from time to time.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:57.298 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I have to admit, I was just blown away
by the section on Ryan Owens, which seemed

01:38:57.398 --> 01:38:58.733 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
incredibly self-serving on his part.

01:38:58.833 --> 01:39:00.568 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He had been criticized for that mission.

01:39:00.668 --> 01:39:04.038 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, today, he blamed it on the commanders,
the military commanders, and said that his

01:39:04.138 --> 01:39:07.708 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
death was theirs.

01:39:07.809 --> 01:39:09.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I don't know.

01:39:09.744 --> 01:39:12.980 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That just struck me as a -- it was an unseemly
invocation and use of a widow who is obviously

01:39:13.080 --> 01:39:14.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
grieving.

01:39:14.749 --> 01:39:18.452 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I give it a very -- he gave himself a
C, I think, on presentation today.

01:39:18.553 --> 01:39:20.421 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I would give him a C-plus.

01:39:20.521 --> 01:39:23.724 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He gave himself a C today on
messaging.

01:39:23.825 --> 01:39:25.059 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: Messaging, yes.

01:39:25.159 --> 01:39:26.894 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Brooks, what did you
think?

01:39:26.994 --> 01:39:32.133 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: I guess, on the Trump scale,
I would give it an A. It is the best speech

01:39:32.233 --> 01:39:33.568 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I have ever seen him give, I think.

01:39:33.668 --> 01:39:38.806 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was action-packed, so you got the sense
a lot was happening.

01:39:38.906 --> 01:39:44.612 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It had the right balance of anger about the
situation, was a lot more upbeat than normal,

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:48.316 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
so it had a better emotional mix, I would
say.

01:39:48.416 --> 01:39:53.287 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I thought the Ryan Owens moment was actually
a powerful moment to watch her and her testimony.

01:39:53.387 --> 01:39:56.257 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It was also a little shift in the Republican
Party.

01:39:56.357 --> 01:39:59.493 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If you are trying to work with the working
class that is having severe problems, you

01:39:59.594 --> 01:40:03.130 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
can't simply be a party that, well, governmentis going to get out of the way.

01:40:03.231 --> 01:40:07.535 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that's where the Republicans have been
for the last 20 years.

01:40:07.635 --> 01:40:14.442 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so he gave an action plan that included
some family leave and things like that, unexpected

01:40:14.542 --> 01:40:15.977 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
from a Republican president.

01:40:16.077 --> 01:40:17.011 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I thought it was -- people will say itis a conventional speech.

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:19.814 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
He has risen to the level of conventional.

01:40:19.914 --> 01:40:25.553 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, substantively, he has actually shifted
ground for the Republican Party away from

01:40:25.653 --> 01:40:26.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the conventional.

01:40:27.054 --> 01:40:29.991 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So I thought it was the best thing I have
seen him from him.

01:40:30.091 --> 01:40:31.826 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter, something different?

01:40:31.926 --> 01:40:36.898 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY WALTER: No, I would say -- I would have
to much more with David on this, and that,

01:40:36.998 --> 01:40:41.669 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
now, when we would go out on the campaign
trail, and even right after President Trump

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:47.241 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
was elected, voters would say over and over
again, I just wish that he would act more

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:48.342 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidential.

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:51.078 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I am hoping he is going to be more presidential.

01:40:51.178 --> 01:40:56.984 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I wonder, once he is in office, he's going
to able to get off Twitter or get off the

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:58.853 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
off-the-cuff statements and really focus.

01:40:58.953 --> 01:41:02.924 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And as I was listening to the speech, I thought,
well, just imagine if this is what he did

01:41:03.024 --> 01:41:08.396 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
every day, that there weren't the 5:00 a.m.
Twitter screeds, there wasn't the attack on

01:41:08.496 --> 01:41:13.167 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
people that he disagreed with, but that hejust focused on these issues.

01:41:13.267 --> 01:41:19.006 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it would be a very -- we would be at avery different place right now.

01:41:19.106 --> 01:41:24.078 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, the question in my mind isn't, did he
give a good speech, because I think he did,

01:41:24.178 --> 01:41:26.614 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
and he accomplished what he set out to accomplish.

01:41:26.714 --> 01:41:28.616 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
It's, can he do this every day?

01:41:28.716 --> 01:41:32.520 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that's what it is going to require toget a lot of this big stuff.

01:41:32.620 --> 01:41:34.355 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Some of it is never going to happen.

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:37.124 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But on taxes, and on Obamacare, he has got
to be this disciplined every day, and to be

01:41:37.224 --> 01:41:41.696 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
able to keep coming back to the things hesaid were very important.

01:41:41.796 --> 01:41:48.235 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Also important to note that he did mention
in here an issue that had been coming here,

01:41:48.336 --> 01:41:50.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there, everywhere.

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:54.041 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mike Pence, the vice president, had to go,
when he went overseas, to assure our European

01:41:54.141 --> 01:41:55.943 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
allies we are OK with NATO.

01:41:56.043 --> 01:41:57.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did that again.

01:41:57.111 --> 01:41:58.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

01:41:58.813 --> 01:42:02.883 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY WALTER: He did that specifically in this
speech to say, we believe in NATO.

01:42:02.984 --> 01:42:05.386 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt Schlapp, what did you
take away?

01:42:05.486 --> 01:42:07.655 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: I thought it was a great speech.

01:42:07.755 --> 01:42:10.157 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think the people we elect to the presidency
change the presidency.

01:42:10.257 --> 01:42:12.059 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And Donald Trump has changed the presidency.

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:15.429 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He talks in a way we haven't seen a president
talk before.

01:42:15.529 --> 01:42:19.133 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
He tweets in a way we have never seen a president
tweet before.

01:42:19.233 --> 01:42:25.373 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And to a certain extent, you know, when you
watch that chamber, it is separated right

01:42:25.473 --> 01:42:27.341 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
from left, Democrat from Republican.

01:42:27.441 --> 01:42:34.849 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it was strange to me that he wasn't so
much talking to them as he was talking to

01:42:34.949 --> 01:42:38.519 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
this forgotten man and woman, this middle-class
voter in flyover country who might have his

01:42:38.619 --> 01:42:40.821 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
name on the front of his work shirt.

01:42:40.921 --> 01:42:43.090 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
That's what his whole focus is.

01:42:43.190 --> 01:42:44.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is on that voter.

01:42:45.092 --> 01:42:50.131 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think it is a little -- it is a little
different to have a president to do that.

01:42:50.231 --> 01:42:53.467 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Yes, he called Republicans and Democrats towork together on the big things.

01:42:53.567 --> 01:42:55.002 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Yes, he attacked Obama on what he sees as
his failings.

01:42:55.102 --> 01:42:56.604 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
But his voice is the voice for that voter.

01:42:56.704 --> 01:42:58.773 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And that's the voter that put him in office.

01:42:58.873 --> 01:43:00.508 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine Jean-Pierre?

01:43:00.608 --> 01:43:04.478 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes, so I think it was
basically a toned-down campaign speech.

01:43:04.578 --> 01:43:06.814 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It was lots of rhetoric, little details.

01:43:06.914 --> 01:43:12.386 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
One of the things that I think was actually
newsworthy is that he didn't talk about Russia

01:43:12.486 --> 01:43:15.756 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
at all and all of the scandal that is swirling
around him.

01:43:15.856 --> 01:43:18.192 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He doubled down on mass deportation, on the
Muslim ban, on taking people's health care

01:43:18.292 --> 01:43:19.994 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

01:43:20.094 --> 01:43:21.829 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And there is another thing that I realize
he didn't do, speaking of a campaign-type

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:23.464 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
speech, is that, normally, on the campaign,
he would rail against the -- Goldman Sachs

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:27.001 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
and talk about how he is the man of the people.

01:43:27.101 --> 01:43:29.870 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And you didn't kind of -- you didn't hearthat language either in this.

01:43:29.970 --> 01:43:34.241 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It was striking, Mark, that
it -- actually, I want to go to John -- our

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:37.011 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
John Yang, who is at the White House.

01:43:37.111 --> 01:43:42.349 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
John, North Lawn of the White House, you and
I were at the lunch with the president today

01:43:42.450 --> 01:43:44.218 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
with other television reporters and anchors.

01:43:44.318 --> 01:43:47.254 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it was striking to me then that Russia
-- he wasn't engaging on the Russia question,

01:43:47.354 --> 01:43:52.726 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
which has been out there hanging over his
administration for the last several weeks.

01:43:52.827 --> 01:43:58.599 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Well, I think that, I mean, the
fact that he didn't talk about it tonight,

01:43:58.699 --> 01:44:07.074 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think that this was a speech where he was
trying not to get bogged down in sort of reacting

01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:11.679 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to the controversy surrounding him and trying
to be a little broader and a little -- the

01:44:11.779 --> 01:44:17.952 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
words we kept hearing today, be a little more
uplifting, be a little more optimistic.

01:44:18.052 --> 01:44:21.589 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think that tone at the end with the closing
little coda of trying to pull people together

01:44:21.689 --> 01:44:26.293 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and rise above and try to do new things, I
think that was the message that they wanted

01:44:26.393 --> 01:44:30.097 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to leave the country with and to leave Congress
with at the end of this message..

01:44:30.197 --> 01:44:32.633 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: John is at the White House
for us.

01:44:32.733 --> 01:44:36.971 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And on the Capitol -- on Capitol Hill, at
Statuary Hall -- we are not going to go to

01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:42.443 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Lisa Desjardins right now, but we will go
to her in a few minutes.

01:44:42.543 --> 01:44:45.613 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, Mark, I want to come back to what Matt
and Karine were just saying, I mean, really,

01:44:45.713 --> 01:44:48.382 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
two very different views of this speech.

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:53.320 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it seems me he was combining some of,
you know, what we have been hearing from him,

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:56.257 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the mantra we have heard from him about crime

01:44:56.357 --> 01:44:58.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

01:44:58.225 --> 01:45:02.029 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: and about saving money and
about -- and he spoke about how much he wants

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:04.498 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to spend on defense, but he didn't dwell on
that.

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:09.203 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He did talk about reaching out and helping
those who need help.

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:11.472 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, I mean, he did.

01:45:11.572 --> 01:45:12.740 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He returned to the theme.

01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:14.675 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Chicago.

01:45:14.775 --> 01:45:17.978 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I mean, you take Chicago out of the equation,
and there isn't a lot of domestic conversation.

01:45:18.078 --> 01:45:22.183 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And there is nothing that he is going to do
on Chicago, except support the police, which

01:45:22.283 --> 01:45:24.485 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think, most American presidents, has been
their position.

01:45:24.585 --> 01:45:29.089 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This is the first American president in my
lifetime who has not welcomed the designation

01:45:29.190 --> 01:45:31.759 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
as leader of the free world.

01:45:31.859 --> 01:45:34.094 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
He rejected the leader of the free world.

01:45:34.195 --> 01:45:37.164 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that is an enormous change in the definitionof an American president.

01:45:37.264 --> 01:45:38.832 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I just was struck by that.

01:45:38.933 --> 01:45:41.368 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you -- what do you mean
by that?

01:45:41.468 --> 01:45:45.406 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, in other words, he says,
I am not the leader of the -- I am just the

01:45:45.506 --> 01:45:46.640 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
leader of the United States.

01:45:46.740 --> 01:45:48.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am the leader of you.

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:50.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am the American leader.

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:55.082 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I'm not -- and America has welcomed, sometimes
reluctantly, but nobly and to the transformation

01:45:55.182 --> 01:45:58.852 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of the planet, that -- that responsibility
of being the leader of the free world.

01:45:58.953 --> 01:46:01.121 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And without it, there wouldn't be a free world.

01:46:01.222 --> 01:46:03.123 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

01:46:03.224 --> 01:46:05.059 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Before we hear from Steve Beshear, the former
governor of Kentucky, for the Democratic response,

01:46:05.159 --> 01:46:11.632 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
we are going to go quickly to our Lisa Desjardins
on the Hill, who with is with a Democratic

01:46:11.732 --> 01:46:12.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
senator -- Lisa.

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:14.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

01:46:14.702 --> 01:46:17.071 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm with Senator Heidi Heitkamp.

01:46:17.171 --> 01:46:22.309 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She's one of the moderates in Congress who
may decide what President Trump is able to

01:46:22.409 --> 01:46:23.644 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
get through the Senate or not.

01:46:23.744 --> 01:46:25.279 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
What did you think of this speech?

01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:26.880 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:46:26.981 --> 01:46:29.049 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
HEIDI HEITKAMP (D), North Dakota: Well, Ithought it was well-measured.

01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:35.489 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I thought that it was very, very hard to disagree
with any of the goals, any of the aspirations.

01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:37.391 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I think the devil is in the details.

01:46:37.491 --> 01:46:42.663 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think we are obviously very concerned
about what is going to happen with health

01:46:42.763 --> 01:46:47.301 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
care, what is going to happen with tax reductions,
making sure that they really go to people

01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:49.169 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who need them.

01:46:49.270 --> 01:46:52.806 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think -- I think we're -- you know,
who can argue with all of the great aspirations

01:46:52.906 --> 01:46:54.408 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
that the president set out tonight?

01:46:54.508 --> 01:46:56.377 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I will tell you, I was disappointed.

01:46:56.477 --> 01:47:01.749 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Rural America really delivered for this president,
and there was nothing in this speech that

01:47:01.849 --> 01:47:03.217 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
really addressed some of the challenges.

01:47:03.317 --> 01:47:04.752 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: He did speak about urban
America in the speech.

01:47:04.852 --> 01:47:05.753 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:47:05.853 --> 01:47:07.588 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
HEIDI HEITKAMP: I think a lot of it was.

01:47:07.688 --> 01:47:13.260 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I was hoping for a recognition that some
of the greatest poverty in America actually

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.095 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
exists in rural areas.

01:47:15.195 --> 01:47:19.066 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We need to do everything we can to continue
to help our agricultural sector, but also

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:20.834 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
work to build rural America.

01:47:20.934 --> 01:47:24.204 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: Senator Heidi Heitkamp, thank
you so much for joining us -- Judy.

01:47:24.305 --> 01:47:26.106 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Lisa.

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:31.745 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, as you just said, Senator Heitkamp, one
of those who is from what we call a red state.

01:47:31.845 --> 01:47:36.950 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She is a Democrat, so she has to think about
how both Democrats and Republicans in her

01:47:37.051 --> 01:47:38.786 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state are reacting.

01:47:38.886 --> 01:47:42.656 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Just quickly, David Brooks, before we go to
the Democratic response, are you surprised

01:47:42.756 --> 01:47:45.993 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that he didn't mention anything about rural
America?

01:47:46.093 --> 01:47:48.062 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: I guess so.

01:47:48.162 --> 01:47:51.699 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mark is right that he had some domestic policy
things, but -- on infrastructure, but he was

01:47:51.799 --> 01:47:53.300 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
pretty skimpy on that stuff.

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:57.504 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we're going to comeback to that in a moment.

01:47:57.604 --> 01:48:03.677 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are told that Governor Beshear, former
governor -- former governor of Kentucky, is

01:48:03.777 --> 01:48:05.145 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ready.

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:07.114 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
STEVE BESHEAR (D), Former Governor of Kentucky:
I'm Steve Beshear.

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:09.116 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:11.852 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That was former Kentucky Governor
Steve Beshear, delivering the Democrats' response

01:48:11.952 --> 01:48:13.921 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to the president's address to a joint session
of Congress.

01:48:14.021 --> 01:48:17.791 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And we should say that the Democrats' Spanish-language
response was delivered by a woman named Astrid

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:19.660 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Silva.

01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:22.629 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
She was a dreamer brought to this country
without legal documentation, but now an activist

01:48:22.730 --> 01:48:24.565 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
for the cause of immigration reform.

01:48:24.665 --> 01:48:28.502 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
David Brooks, Steve Beshear, somebody who
-- he spoke very plainly and said, the president,

01:48:28.602 --> 01:48:33.941 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you need to be the champion of all the people,not the champion of Wall Street.

01:48:34.041 --> 01:48:36.744 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: I thought that was really good,
too.

01:48:36.844 --> 01:48:39.780 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I thought that was one of the better responses.

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:41.782 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
He spoke humanely, naturally, not canned.

01:48:41.882 --> 01:48:43.951 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
It helps to have a 72-year-old guy, maybe.

01:48:44.051 --> 01:48:45.686 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He is not running for anything anymore.

01:48:45.786 --> 01:48:48.188 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And so he can just be a little more relaxed.

01:48:48.288 --> 01:48:50.057 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
I thought he was very genuine.

01:48:50.157 --> 01:48:57.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Two things struck me as interesting, one,
that there is just a ton of energy in activism

01:48:57.631 --> 01:49:00.901 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in blue America right now.

01:49:01.001 --> 01:49:04.138 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the Democrats chose as their respondent
a white guy from red America, and a rural

01:49:04.238 --> 01:49:05.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guy through the pores.

01:49:05.973 --> 01:49:09.309 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so that was interesting to me, the choice
of what demographic to emphasize.

01:49:09.410 --> 01:49:13.680 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The second thing and I think one of the reasons
they chose him is, Kentucky is a state where

01:49:13.781 --> 01:49:15.482 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
the Affordable Care Act is doing super well.

01:49:15.582 --> 01:49:18.352 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so, if they want somebody to say, no,
this is working, we have got to keep this,

01:49:18.452 --> 01:49:19.520 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Kentucky is the place you want to go.

01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:20.988 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter?

01:49:21.088 --> 01:49:23.056 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY WALTER: I -- Gosh, I just find myself
saying, David is right.

01:49:23.157 --> 01:49:24.057 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:49:24.158 --> 01:49:25.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:49:25.192 --> 01:49:27.027 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
AMY WALTER: We are on the same wavelength.

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:28.929 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the interesting thing, when we talk about
the Affordable Care Act and where it is going

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:33.333 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to go from here, it is pretty clear that,
from the speech that we heard from President

01:49:33.434 --> 01:49:40.007 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Trump tonight and the response from the former
governor of Kentucky, is a showdown between

01:49:40.107 --> 01:49:44.711 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
how many people get their costs reduced vs.
how many people get to stay on Obamacare.

01:49:44.812 --> 01:49:48.282 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the challenge for Obamacare from the very
beginning has been this, that, while there

01:49:48.382 --> 01:49:52.519 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
are millions of more people that have health
care in this country, there are millions more

01:49:52.619 --> 01:49:56.123 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
who get their health insurance through means
that is not Obamacare.

01:49:56.223 --> 01:49:58.292 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And a lot of those folks are worried.

01:49:58.392 --> 01:50:02.129 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Either they have seen their premiums increase
or they're worried they are going to increase.

01:50:02.229 --> 01:50:06.700 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so when I hear from voters out there about
this issue, what I hear first and foremost

01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:08.335 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about cost.

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:12.172 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That is the challenge for Trump, is to -- hesaid he is going to lower costs.

01:50:12.272 --> 01:50:15.075 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Is his administration going to be able to
do that?

01:50:15.175 --> 01:50:20.848 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And is it going to be -- or is it going to
be, as Steve Beshear, former governor, said,

01:50:20.948 --> 01:50:26.320 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that you are going to have millions of people
kicked off a system that was helping them?

01:50:26.420 --> 01:50:30.457 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Which one of those things is going to become
more potent in this over health care?

01:50:30.557 --> 01:50:32.860 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And Beshear made his line on people getting
kicked off.

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:35.262 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And we're going to hear from Republicans about
the cost piece.

01:50:35.362 --> 01:50:40.300 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, we're going to come
back to this discussion in just a minute.

01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:44.104 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, right now, our Lisa Desjardins is Capitol
Hill with a Republican, Congressman Jim Jordan

01:50:44.204 --> 01:50:45.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from Ohio -- Lisa.

01:50:45.539 --> 01:50:46.306 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right, notable Congressman
Jim Jordan.

01:50:46.406 --> 01:50:47.808 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thank you for joining us.

01:50:47.908 --> 01:50:48.809 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:50:48.909 --> 01:50:51.178 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
JIM JORDAN (R), Ohio: You bet.

01:50:51.278 --> 01:50:54.948 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: What did you make of this
speech?

01:50:55.048 --> 01:50:58.218 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You're thought of as a very conservative member
of the House.

01:50:58.318 --> 01:50:59.319 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:50:59.419 --> 01:51:01.221 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JIM JORDAN: Well, I thought it was very good.

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:03.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really did.

01:51:03.190 --> 01:51:06.894 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think, right at the start, when he said
America is ready to lead, it sort of sets

01:51:06.994 --> 01:51:09.730 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
a different tone, a different context, a different
framework than frankly what we conservatives

01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:10.964 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
have seen with the previous president.

01:51:11.064 --> 01:51:12.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So I liked that.

01:51:12.866 --> 01:51:17.304 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I thought it was a great speech, well delivered,
well done, and said the right things.

01:51:17.404 --> 01:51:24.311 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I really think the moment that everyone
is going to remember is Carryn Owens, was

01:51:24.411 --> 01:51:26.113 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
just powerful.

01:51:26.213 --> 01:51:30.517 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You think about what she has went through
in and the sacrifice her husband made and

01:51:30.617 --> 01:51:32.152 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
what he has meant to our country.

01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:35.255 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I thought this was a really powerful moment,but, overall, just very good.

01:51:35.355 --> 01:51:38.458 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: We have been hearing that
from Democrats as well.

01:51:38.559 --> 01:51:39.459 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:40.961 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
JIM JORDAN: Yes.

01:51:41.061 --> 01:51:41.461 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: I want to ask you about two
issues and one question.

01:51:41.562 --> 01:51:42.462 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:51:42.563 --> 01:51:44.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM JORDAN: Sure.

01:51:44.398 --> 01:51:46.033 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: Sort of usually a trick of
a White House reporter, but we're tonight

01:51:46.133 --> 01:51:47.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the Capitol.

01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.101 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:51:48.201 --> 01:51:49.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM JORDAN: Right.

01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.637 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president presented a
budget that would slash domestic discretionary

01:51:50.737 --> 01:51:51.638 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spending.

01:51:51.738 --> 01:51:53.373 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right, that is his outline.

01:51:53.473 --> 01:51:56.510 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And at the same time this week, we also have
Affordable Care Act moving forward.

01:51:56.610 --> 01:51:59.212 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Both of those issues, are you in line with
where the president is going right now?

01:51:59.313 --> 01:52:00.981 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:52:01.081 --> 01:52:02.983 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JIM JORDAN: I think, on the Affordable Care
Act, I think he said repeal and replace.

01:52:03.083 --> 01:52:07.754 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He talked about giving Medicaid, the flexibility
back to the governors in the states.

01:52:07.854 --> 01:52:09.556 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We're all for that, block-granting Medicaid.

01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:15.329 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We just -- we need to put the same repeal
bill on President Trump's desk that we put

01:52:15.429 --> 01:52:17.197 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
on President Obama's desk.

01:52:17.297 --> 01:52:20.200 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then the replacement legislation, we have
introduced one that we think will actually

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:21.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bring down the costs.

01:52:21.401 --> 01:52:23.170 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, I think

01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:25.539 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: But your conference isn't
all necessarily in agreement on a full repeal.

01:52:25.639 --> 01:52:27.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:52:27.541 --> 01:52:30.077 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JIM JORDAN: Well, there is only one plan that
is consistent with what we told the voters.

01:52:30.177 --> 01:52:34.181 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It's one the House Freedom Caucus put forward
and Dr. Paul has put forward on the Senate

01:52:34.281 --> 01:52:35.182 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

01:52:35.282 --> 01:52:37.050 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
So, I think that that makes sense.

01:52:37.150 --> 01:52:40.687 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The budget, what Mick Mulvaney rolled out
this week and what -- President Trump's budget,

01:52:40.787 --> 01:52:42.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
we like.

01:52:42.656 --> 01:52:48.028 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It ups defense spending and it says, let's
get rid of the waste and redundancy, and let's

01:52:48.128 --> 01:52:49.196 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cut non-defense.

01:52:49.296 --> 01:52:50.731 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's what conservatives have always been
for.

01:52:50.831 --> 01:52:54.201 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are supposed to spend your tax dollarson defending this country.

01:52:54.301 --> 01:52:57.037 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That is paramount importance, issue number
for the federal government, responsibility

01:52:57.137 --> 01:52:58.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
number one.

01:52:58.739 --> 01:53:00.540 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But you also have got offset it, because wehave got $20 trillion debt.

01:53:00.641 --> 01:53:02.342 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, I like where that is going.

01:53:02.442 --> 01:53:06.747 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I'm encouraged by what I heard from Mr. Mulvaney
and from the president.

01:53:06.847 --> 01:53:07.981 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: OK.

01:53:08.081 --> 01:53:09.950 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thank you very much, Congressman Jim Jordan
of Ohio.

01:53:10.050 --> 01:53:10.951 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

01:53:11.051 --> 01:53:11.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JIM JORDAN: You bet.

01:53:12.052 --> 01:53:12.953 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Back to you, Judy.

01:53:13.053 --> 01:53:13.954 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Lisa.

01:53:14.054 --> 01:53:15.422 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And thanks to Congressman Jordan.

01:53:15.522 --> 01:53:19.026 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Karine Jean-Pierre, we keep coming back to
the Affordable Care Act.

01:53:19.126 --> 01:53:20.527 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Isn't that interesting, the Obama legacy?

01:53:20.627 --> 01:53:22.396 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Right.

01:53:22.496 --> 01:53:25.032 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You know, one thing that Republicans have
done these past several weeks is make Obamacare

01:53:25.132 --> 01:53:26.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
popular again.

01:53:26.533 --> 01:53:28.201 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They sold Obamacare better than Democrats
did for six years.

01:53:28.301 --> 01:53:33.740 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
I mean, that's the -- we had a hard time communicatingthe importance of Obamacare.

01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.242 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And now people are realizing that they don't
want their health care taken away.

01:53:35.342 --> 01:53:36.610 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that is something Republicans are dealing
with.

01:53:36.710 --> 01:53:38.445 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is not just rhetoric now.

01:53:38.545 --> 01:53:41.181 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You actually have to govern and make something
happen.

01:53:41.281 --> 01:53:43.283 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
How do you speak to the tens of millions of
Americans who are relying on this very important

01:53:43.383 --> 01:53:45.152 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
health care that they have?

01:53:45.252 --> 01:53:49.723 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Matt Schlapp, that was
part of what Steve Beshear, the former governor

01:53:49.823 --> 01:53:51.625 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
of Kentucky, was telling us in his response.

01:53:51.725 --> 01:53:55.295 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, you know, it is important
to remember one of the remembers that Donald

01:53:55.395 --> 01:53:58.632 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
Trump is the president is because these Obamacare
premium letters went out right before the

01:53:58.732 --> 01:54:00.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
election.

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:03.336 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And these premium increases have been a shock
to families all across the country.

01:54:03.437 --> 01:54:09.209 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that is the fundamental question here,
which is, Obamacare did not keep its promise

01:54:09.309 --> 01:54:11.144 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to make health care affordable.

01:54:11.244 --> 01:54:16.016 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I agree you can roll out numbers to say that
there are more people who actually have health

01:54:16.116 --> 01:54:17.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
insurance.

01:54:17.451 --> 01:54:18.819 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It doesn't mean they have greater access to
health care.

01:54:18.919 --> 01:54:20.654 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It doesn't mean that we have done anything
to control the costs.

01:54:20.754 --> 01:54:22.589 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think the bottom line is, if we don't
do anything to try to fix our health care

01:54:22.689 --> 01:54:24.424 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
system, it is on a rocky road.

01:54:24.524 --> 01:54:25.992 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the American voter has sent a message
in three out of the last four elections that

01:54:26.093 --> 01:54:27.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it is not acceptable.

01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:29.463 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But there is still -- I mean,
Mark, there is a lot of struggling going on

01:54:29.563 --> 01:54:30.363 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to figure out among Republicans what theyare going to replace it with.

01:54:30.464 --> 01:54:31.698 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
MARK SHIELDS: No, there certainly

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:32.532 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Or even if there should be
a replacement.

01:54:32.632 --> 01:54:33.233 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: No, that's right.

01:54:33.333 --> 01:54:34.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean -- and I agree.

01:54:34.701 --> 01:54:36.470 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I agree with Matt that the letter in October
was devastating.

01:54:36.570 --> 01:54:36.970 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I think, if it weren't a problem, you
would see a lot more Republicans holding town

01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:38.805 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
meetings.

01:54:38.905 --> 01:54:40.607 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the ones who have, have been confronted
with the face of people who have who have

01:54:40.707 --> 01:54:41.541 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
faced death or worse, but the Obama health
care plan has saved their lives, has given

01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:43.376 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
them coverage that they didn't have.

01:54:43.477 --> 01:54:44.044 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Steve Beshear did a couple of things, Judy,
that the Democrats have been faulted for,

01:54:44.144 --> 01:54:44.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and legitimately so.

01:54:44.911 --> 01:54:45.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are a coastal party.

01:54:45.612 --> 01:54:47.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're an elite party.

01:54:47.447 --> 01:54:49.316 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
They're a party of what is the great new Cabernet
and what is to the trendiest thing?

01:54:49.416 --> 01:54:50.517 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
This was salt of the earth, Friday night football
in the bleachers, Sunday night in churches.

01:54:50.617 --> 01:54:51.418 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Democrats don't talk about Sunday morning
pews.

01:54:51.518 --> 01:54:52.352 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And Steve Beshear not only did it.

01:54:52.452 --> 01:54:52.919 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He didn't do it in a contrived way.

01:54:53.019 --> 01:54:53.720 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It was natural.

01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:55.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was comfortable doing it.

01:54:55.655 --> 01:54:57.457 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think it is always a tough thing to
answer the president, any president, in the

01:54:57.557 --> 01:54:58.091 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
State of the Union or a joint session, because
of all of the ceremony, the Joint Chiefs and

01:54:58.191 --> 01:54:59.993 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the Supreme Court.

01:55:00.093 --> 01:55:00.694 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And they did it right by not trying to emulate
it, do it in a statehouse or in a city hall,

01:55:00.794 --> 01:55:01.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or in a formal setting.

01:55:01.862 --> 01:55:03.597 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So I think, in that sense, it really worked.

01:55:03.697 --> 01:55:04.531 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
One thing that we should do, President Trump
cannot resist taking credit for things he

01:55:04.631 --> 01:55:06.333 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
doesn't deserve and are very risky.

01:55:06.433 --> 01:55:08.201 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He said the stock market had increased almost
$3 trillion in value since his election.

01:55:08.301 --> 01:55:10.103 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Post hoc, propter hoc, as they say in Latin,
because, after this, because of this -- and

01:55:10.203 --> 01:55:11.505 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
that is dangerous stuff, because, you know,
if -- he is going to be held accountable when

01:55:11.605 --> 01:55:13.073 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the stock market does take a dip, and does
hit a rough patch.

01:55:13.173 --> 01:55:14.808 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
The last time we had 12 days in a row or anything
like that was 1987.

01:55:14.908 --> 01:55:16.610 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You will recall what happened in 1987, when
the closest thing to 1929 we faced.

01:55:16.710 --> 01:55:18.445 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: But you don't deny there is
an enthusiasm in corporate America and in

01:55:18.545 --> 01:55:18.879 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the economy for the fact that we are going
to actually do something to get our economy

01:55:18.979 --> 01:55:19.713 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rolling?

01:55:19.813 --> 01:55:21.114 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MARK SHIELDS: I think there is.

01:55:21.214 --> 01:55:21.882 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think there would have been even if Hillary
Clinton had won.

01:55:21.982 --> 01:55:23.483 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think that was building.

01:55:23.583 --> 01:55:24.251 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I think there is a sense that they aregoing to have their taxes cut.

01:55:24.351 --> 01:55:25.452 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He promised that to them.

01:55:25.552 --> 01:55:26.686 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, back to Capitol
Hill.

01:55:26.787 --> 01:55:28.255 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our Lisa Desjardins is with Senator Ted Cruz
-- Lisa.

01:55:28.355 --> 01:55:29.890 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right, former presidential
candidate Ted Cruz.

01:55:29.990 --> 01:55:30.991 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What did you make -- you wanted to be at thatpodium tonight at one point.

01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:31.825 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
What did you make of this president's speech?

01:55:31.925 --> 01:55:33.727 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:55:33.827 --> 01:55:35.428 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TED CRUZ (R), Texas: Well, I thought it was
a strong, bold, positive vision for the country.

01:55:35.529 --> 01:55:37.330 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think it was -- it was a reflection
of where millions of Americans are.

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.998 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The number one priority I hear from Texans,
I hear from people across the country is jobs

01:55:38.098 --> 01:55:39.032 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and economic growth.

01:55:39.132 --> 01:55:40.901 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
People are frustrated with the stagnation.

01:55:41.001 --> 01:55:41.334 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
People are frustrated with manufacturing jobs
going away, with less opportunity for our

01:55:41.434 --> 01:55:43.270 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids.

01:55:43.370 --> 01:55:44.471 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, tonight, what I heard from President
Trump was a bold vision that begins with repealing

01:55:44.571 --> 01:55:45.739 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Obamacare, the biggest job killer in this
country.

01:55:45.839 --> 01:55:46.573 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think this election was a referendum on
Obamacare.

01:55:46.673 --> 01:55:48.508 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That includes regulatory reform.

01:55:48.608 --> 01:55:49.309 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I was very encouraged to hear so much emphasis
on reducing the burdens of Washington on small

01:55:49.409 --> 01:55:50.911 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
businesses and job creators.

01:55:51.011 --> 01:55:52.746 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that includes also fundamental tax reform,simplifying the tax code.

01:55:52.846 --> 01:55:53.380 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The result of all of that, I believe, will
be booming economic growth, millions of new

01:55:53.480 --> 01:55:55.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
high-paying jobs.

01:55:55.148 --> 01:55:56.883 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think that is exactly what Americans are
looking for from their president.

01:55:56.983 --> 01:55:58.718 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: You know, I counted at one
point 44 different topics in that speech.

01:55:58.819 --> 01:55:59.219 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
States of the Union or messages to Congress
often have sort of a laundry list of ideas

01:55:59.319 --> 01:56:00.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and goals.

01:56:01.054 --> 01:56:01.788 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But I didn't hear anything about how this
president would pay for those things.

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:03.657 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That is going to be your job.

01:56:03.757 --> 01:56:05.525 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Are you concerned about that, especially with
a $1 trillion infrastructure plan, on top

01:56:05.625 --> 01:56:05.926 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of all of the ideas he had, keeping coverage,
keeping subsidies for Affordable Care Act?

01:56:06.026 --> 01:56:07.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:56:07.394 --> 01:56:08.261 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
TED CRUZ: There is no doubt the details are
very important.

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:10.130 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
How things are paid for is important.

01:56:10.230 --> 01:56:10.964 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But the only way to pay for our fundamental
needs, the only way to pay down our debt is

01:56:11.064 --> 01:56:12.265 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to bring back economic growth.

01:56:12.365 --> 01:56:14.134 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Economic growth is the only the first-order
variable.

01:56:14.234 --> 01:56:14.835 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If you look at the federal budget, everything
else is a second- or third-order variable.

01:56:14.935 --> 01:56:16.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Economic growth is key.

01:56:16.469 --> 01:56:18.038 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Since World War II, we have averaged 3.3 percent
economic growth a year.

01:56:18.138 --> 01:56:19.406 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In the Obama eight years, we were consistentlyat 1 and 2 percent GDP growth.

01:56:19.506 --> 01:56:21.308 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
If we don't change that, we can't solve any
of the problems.

01:56:21.408 --> 01:56:23.176 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the reason I was so energized is, I heard
tonight an agenda that, if we deliver on it,

01:56:23.276 --> 01:56:24.477 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
if we repeal Obamacare, if we have serious
regulatory reform, serious tax reform, a simple

01:56:24.578 --> 01:56:25.579 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
flat tax, I think we can see 4, 5 percent
GDP growth.

01:56:25.679 --> 01:56:27.447 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We can see millions of new jobs, higher wages.

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:28.114 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
That in turn will generate billions of additional
tax revenue to meet the needs we have.

01:56:28.215 --> 01:56:29.482 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: OK.

01:56:29.583 --> 01:56:29.883 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Texas Senator Ted Cruz, thank you for joining
us -- Judy.

01:56:29.983 --> 01:56:30.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:56:30.650 --> 01:56:31.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TED CRUZ: Thank you.

01:56:31.484 --> 01:56:32.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, Lisa.

01:56:32.285 --> 01:56:33.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And thank you, Senator Cruz.

01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:34.688 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, David Brooks, are we party poopers to
be worrying about how much things cost?

01:56:34.788 --> 01:56:35.188 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: Absolutely.

01:56:35.288 --> 01:56:36.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:56:36.623 --> 01:56:37.557 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: We are going to grow our way
of out of this.

01:56:37.657 --> 01:56:38.825 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Senator Cruz is actually wrong about that.

01:56:38.925 --> 01:56:39.526 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You can't grow your way out of the entitlements
issue.

01:56:39.626 --> 01:56:41.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You know, it's funny.

01:56:41.494 --> 01:56:42.229 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Republican -- the establishment of the
Republican Party stood for America is a global

01:56:42.329 --> 01:56:43.063 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
leader, leading the free world.

01:56:43.163 --> 01:56:44.865 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It stood for entitlement reform.

01:56:44.965 --> 01:56:45.398 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The Tea Party wing of the party stood for
cutting the debt and shrinking the size of

01:56:45.498 --> 01:56:46.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

01:56:46.766 --> 01:56:48.101 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Donald Trump has come in and reversed both
of those.

01:56:48.201 --> 01:56:49.970 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so he has had this radical effect on the
Republican Party.

01:56:50.070 --> 01:56:51.905 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The one part of the party that he has kept
orthodox on is on deregulation and tax reform.

01:56:52.005 --> 01:56:53.773 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so what we see is a guy who is redefining
the Republican Party, both from the Republican

01:56:53.874 --> 01:56:55.075 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
establishment, the Paul Ryan wing, but also
from the Freedom Caucus, Tea Party wing, and

01:56:55.175 --> 01:56:56.877 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
then keeping one element that is pretty much
the same.

01:56:56.977 --> 01:56:58.812 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But we are seeing dramatic changes in what
a modern American party stands for, a much

01:56:58.912 --> 01:56:59.646 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
more activist government than any compassionate
conservative or any big government conservative

01:56:59.746 --> 01:57:01.481 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
heretofore would have asked for.

01:57:01.581 --> 01:57:02.015 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Karine Jean-Pierre, that
makes it harder for Democrats to counter,

01:57:02.115 --> 01:57:03.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doesn't it?

01:57:03.917 --> 01:57:04.751 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: It does, but, I mean,
the way that I see all of this is that is

01:57:04.851 --> 01:57:06.486 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
the Democratic Party is in streets.

01:57:06.586 --> 01:57:07.921 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That's who -- those are the people who are
truly going to move this party forward.

01:57:08.021 --> 01:57:08.822 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think that a perfect example is what
we saw in Delaware.

01:57:08.922 --> 01:57:09.522 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We took back a state Senate seat.

01:57:09.623 --> 01:57:09.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have the majority.

01:57:10.023 --> 01:57:10.757 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And

01:57:10.857 --> 01:57:11.858 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: It is Delaware.

01:57:11.958 --> 01:57:13.660 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes, but here is the thing.

01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:15.562 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The interesting thing about that story is
that they had hundreds, close to thousands

01:57:15.662 --> 01:57:16.229 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of people come out to volunteer to help with
that seat, because people were reinvigorated.

01:57:16.329 --> 01:57:18.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were engaging.

01:57:18.198 --> 01:57:20.000 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, if we can do that a little bit at a time
with special races that are coming up, like

01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:20.567 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
in Georgia 6, and other races in 2017, leading
to 2018, I think that will make a difference

01:57:20.667 --> 01:57:22.435 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Democrats.

01:57:22.535 --> 01:57:23.737 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the war of ideas, Amy,
is it equally possible for the Democrats to

01:57:23.837 --> 01:57:25.605 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
come back, because they have got energy in
the streets?

01:57:25.705 --> 01:57:26.806 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY WALTER: Well, it is always better to have
energy and anger than it is to have love.

01:57:26.907 --> 01:57:28.675 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I'm sorry to say, in politics, that is the
case.

01:57:28.775 --> 01:57:29.643 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And you want -- if you are up for reelection,
you want people who are angry and inspired

01:57:29.743 --> 01:57:30.911 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
and going to turn out no matter what.

01:57:31.011 --> 01:57:32.779 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, Democrats definitely have some opportunities
there.

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:34.414 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But the challenge for Democrats, we have talked
about this a lot, is where that energy is,

01:57:34.514 --> 01:57:36.216 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
which is, in many cases, in the same placesthat Hillary Clinton carried.

01:57:36.316 --> 01:57:37.050 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Where they need that energy is in places where
you had Senator Heidi Heitkamp camp on.

01:57:37.150 --> 01:57:37.884 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It needs to be in North Dakota.

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:38.685 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It needs to be in West Virginia.

01:57:38.785 --> 01:57:40.420 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It needs to be in Missouri.

01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.222 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It needs to be in suburban America, where
the race for the House is going to be.

01:57:42.322 --> 01:57:42.722 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so the Democrats' geography challenge
is going to be the most interesting thing

01:57:42.822 --> 01:57:44.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to watch.

01:57:44.691 --> 01:57:45.258 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so where that -- you know, it is great
to have energy, but it has to be in the right

01:57:45.358 --> 01:57:47.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
place to win seats.

01:57:47.227 --> 01:57:48.795 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Matt Schlapp, thinking
back to what the president had to say tonight,

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:49.462 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and it was -- he had a little bit of somethingfor a lot of people in there.

01:57:49.562 --> 01:57:51.331 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

01:57:51.431 --> 01:57:52.832 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a message that is
going to touch some Democrats or independents

01:57:52.933 --> 01:57:54.234 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
who just really weren't willing to give him
much of a listen before?

01:57:54.334 --> 01:57:55.402 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: Remember, he did very well with
independents.

01:57:55.502 --> 01:57:57.370 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
And he did very well with working-class Democrats.

01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:58.071 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
And he won in states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania,
Michigan that Republicans haven't been even

01:57:58.171 --> 01:57:59.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that close to winning.

01:57:59.639 --> 01:58:01.041 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
So he already has got the making of an interesting
new coalition.

01:58:01.141 --> 01:58:03.009 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I actually do disagree with much of what
was said here tonight.

01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.777 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I actually think there is already a budget
plan that he is -- that already has been semi-rolled

01:58:03.877 --> 01:58:05.578 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
out that has massive cuts.

01:58:05.679 --> 01:58:06.012 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He is actually trying to make responsible
decisions on the discretionary side of the

01:58:06.112 --> 01:58:06.913 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
house.

01:58:07.013 --> 01:58:08.248 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I agree with you on entitlements.

01:58:08.348 --> 01:58:10.183 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You are not going to grow your way to fix
those things.

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:10.984 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
That is not something you are going to tackle
in the first year, when you have to take care

01:58:11.084 --> 01:58:11.618 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
of Obamacare and tax reform.

01:58:11.718 --> 01:58:13.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And let's face it.

01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:15.088 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He talked about the five-point plan he hasfor an Obamacare replacement.

01:58:15.188 --> 01:58:15.789 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Paul Ryan has passed an Obamacare replacement,
which Obama vetoed, in the reconciliation

01:58:15.889 --> 01:58:16.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a couple of years ago.

01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:18.725 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Tom Price has had a bill every year in Congress.

01:58:18.825 --> 01:58:20.393 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
This is not going to be that hard to figure
out what the Republican replacement is for

01:58:20.493 --> 01:58:21.628 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Obamacare, although they are going to have
to get them themselves through it.

01:58:21.728 --> 01:58:23.296 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think the same thing will be true for
taxes.

01:58:23.396 --> 01:58:25.165 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Remember, both of those issues will flow throughthe budget and reconciliation.

01:58:25.265 --> 01:58:25.598 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, they are actually going to be able to
get these two big accomplishments in the first

01:58:25.699 --> 01:58:27.067 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

01:58:27.167 --> 01:58:27.600 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you are saying we are being
too -- some of us

01:58:27.701 --> 01:58:28.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:58:29.069 --> 01:58:29.869 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: You are a being a little dour,
a little dour.

01:58:29.970 --> 01:58:30.704 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A little dour, OK.

01:58:30.804 --> 01:58:31.204 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We are being served notice here.

01:58:31.304 --> 01:58:33.073 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:58:33.173 --> 01:58:35.075 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, before we get any
further, I want to go back to our John Yang

01:58:35.175 --> 01:58:36.042 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
at the White House, who is -- John, the president
did bring out -- talk a little bit more tonight

01:58:36.142 --> 01:58:37.911 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
about his idea about immigration reform.

01:58:38.011 --> 01:58:38.311 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, tomorrow, we are going to see the specifics
of the re-rollout of the so-called travel

01:58:38.411 --> 01:58:39.646 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ban.

01:58:39.746 --> 01:58:41.481 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What's it -- do you know what it is going
to look like?

01:58:41.581 --> 01:58:43.216 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JOHN YANG: Well, they think they have gotten
around some of the issues that -- the due

01:58:43.316 --> 01:58:44.884 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
process issues, that the Ninth Circuit, or
that the judge in Seattle objected to.

01:58:44.985 --> 01:58:46.086 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It is going to apply only to people -- futuretravelers to the United States.

01:58:46.186 --> 01:58:47.187 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
It won't affect people who are green card
holders.

01:58:47.287 --> 01:58:48.989 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
It will not affect people who are in the air.

01:58:49.089 --> 01:58:49.422 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There will be -- what they objected to the
first time -- sort of warning that this is

01:58:49.522 --> 01:58:50.824 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coming.

01:58:50.924 --> 01:58:52.692 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But we are going to see this rollout, as many
presidents do.

01:58:52.792 --> 01:58:53.393 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Things that came up in the speech, he is going
to do things to reinforce those themes for

01:58:53.493 --> 01:58:55.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rest of the week.

01:58:55.362 --> 01:58:57.163 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Thursday, he goes down to the Norfolk Naval
-- Navy Shipyard, and he will give a speech

01:58:57.263 --> 01:58:58.598 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
at the USS Gerald Ford, the first of the new
class of super carriers, to talk about building

01:58:58.698 --> 01:59:00.433 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
up the military, protecting America, from
that point of view.

01:59:00.533 --> 01:59:00.867 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Friday, in Orlando, a school choice event,
so building on some of the themes you heard

01:59:00.967 --> 01:59:02.168 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tonight.

01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:03.403 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you, John Yang at the
White House.

01:59:03.503 --> 01:59:04.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Mark Shields, the president is not standing
still.

01:59:04.471 --> 01:59:05.805 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MARK SHIELDS: He is not standing still.

01:59:05.905 --> 01:59:06.773 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And in response to my good friend Matt, the
happy warrior, the

01:59:06.873 --> 01:59:07.307 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Oh, you are setting me up.

01:59:07.407 --> 01:59:08.241 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:59:08.341 --> 01:59:08.742 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MARK SHIELDS: The cheerful optimist.

01:59:08.842 --> 01:59:09.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

01:59:09.943 --> 01:59:10.677 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: We are going to expand choices.

01:59:10.777 --> 01:59:11.845 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
We are going to increase access.

01:59:11.945 --> 01:59:12.645 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
We are going to acknowledge preexisting condition.

01:59:12.746 --> 01:59:13.847 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
We are going to lower costs.

01:59:13.947 --> 01:59:14.814 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And -- but -- and this is going to be done
cheaper.

01:59:14.914 --> 01:59:16.716 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
It is going to be better for everybody.

01:59:16.816 --> 01:59:18.651 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And the only thing I compare it to, returning
to David's roly-poly mention at the outset,

01:59:18.752 --> 01:59:20.520 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
is the hot fudge sundae diet, which was advertised
in one of those weekly papers available at

01:59:20.620 --> 01:59:21.588 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the checkout counter at the grocery store,
where, if you eat four hot fudge sundaes every

01:59:21.688 --> 01:59:22.389 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
day, you will lose eight pounds by Thursday.

01:59:22.489 --> 01:59:22.922 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I like that.

01:59:23.023 --> 01:59:23.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I like that.

01:59:23.723 --> 01:59:24.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Exactly.

01:59:24.391 --> 01:59:24.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it is painless.

01:59:24.958 --> 01:59:25.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is ouchless.

01:59:25.925 --> 01:59:26.659 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And I -- the devil was in the details.

01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:27.560 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Everything is in the details.

01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:28.661 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Life and death are in the details.

01:59:28.762 --> 01:59:30.296 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
And I don't think it is going to sail through.

01:59:30.397 --> 01:59:32.198 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Selling a tax cut is about the easiest thingto do politically imaginable.

01:59:32.298 --> 01:59:32.699 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And selling a tax cut to a Republican Congress,
I mean, is truly like giving beer to Marines

01:59:32.799 --> 01:59:33.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on leave.

01:59:33.633 --> 01:59:34.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I mean, it is not a tough sell.

01:59:34.601 --> 01:59:35.135 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: So, it is going to happen.

01:59:35.235 --> 01:59:37.037 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

01:59:37.137 --> 01:59:38.772 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Well, I mean, they are going to argue about
just how much the Goldman Sachs crowd is going

01:59:38.872 --> 01:59:39.305 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to get, whether they are going to 80 percent
or 83, but they will have a tax cut.

01:59:39.406 --> 01:59:40.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:42.709 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: I would just like to say, there
was a five-point plan.

01:59:42.809 --> 01:59:44.210 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And it was to allow for preexisting conditions,
to transition from state exchanges and get

01:59:44.310 --> 01:59:45.378 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
rid of them, to expand HSAs and have tax credits
that are refundable.

01:59:45.478 --> 01:59:47.213 align:left position:62.5%,start line:93.33% size:37.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: These are health savings accounts.

01:59:47.313 --> 01:59:48.748 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: To give the governors block
grants on Medicaid, and to have tort reform.

01:59:48.848 --> 01:59:50.483 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Now, that is a five-part plan that Republicans
are going to get behind.

01:59:50.583 --> 01:59:51.151 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, by the way, most of this can be done
on reconciliation, with simply 50 votes.

01:59:51.251 --> 01:59:51.851 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, get ready, Mark.

01:59:51.951 --> 01:59:52.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is coming your way.

01:59:53.053 --> 01:59:53.887 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But that doesn't cover everybody.

01:59:53.987 --> 01:59:54.421 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
That's not going to cover everybody.

01:59:54.521 --> 01:59:55.455 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:59:55.555 --> 01:59:57.257 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: But that's not the question.

01:59:57.357 --> 01:59:58.158 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I think what Amy said earlier, we are not
going to make the line in the sand on the

01:59:58.258 --> 01:59:59.859 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
number of people who are covered.

01:59:59.959 --> 02:00:00.560 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are going to make the line in the stand
on the affordability of health care.

02:00:00.660 --> 02:00:01.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

02:00:02.062 --> 02:00:02.595 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I think it is a much heavier
political lift.

02:00:02.695 --> 02:00:03.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

02:00:03.263 --> 02:00:03.863 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

02:00:03.963 --> 02:00:05.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.

02:00:05.899 --> 02:00:06.232 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
DAVID BROOKS: I think the health savings accounts,
an idea I support, by the way, is a tough

02:00:06.332 --> 02:00:07.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lift.

02:00:07.300 --> 02:00:08.034 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
I think there are a lot of people who

02:00:08.134 --> 02:00:09.836 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Never, ever sold.

02:00:09.936 --> 02:00:10.336 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: A lot of people who feel, I
got enough risk and insecurity in my life

02:00:10.437 --> 02:00:11.237 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
right now.

02:00:11.337 --> 02:00:12.839 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Am I really going to take this on?

02:00:12.939 --> 02:00:14.641 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I remember the Social Security reform fightthat George W. Bush fought.

02:00:14.741 --> 02:00:15.208 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And you could face a similar sort of deal,
especially in a country that is much more

02:00:15.308 --> 02:00:17.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
distress-filled.

02:00:17.177 --> 02:00:17.710 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And, as for tax reform, if they go to cut
the corporate rates, a good idea, by the way,

02:00:17.811 --> 02:00:18.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that, they can do.

02:00:18.445 --> 02:00:19.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They will do that.

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:21.781 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
If they -- but he was talking about comprehensive
tax reform.

02:00:21.881 --> 02:00:23.650 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
If they do something a little more comprehensive,
with the normal model of simplifying the rates

02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:25.485 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and widening the base, getting rid of some
of the loopholes, that is a much tougher thing.

02:00:25.585 --> 02:00:26.152 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Every treasury secretary comes into office
and discovers, oh, I want to get rid of all

02:00:26.252 --> 02:00:27.720 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these loopholes.

02:00:27.821 --> 02:00:28.788 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Every loophole has a veto bloc somewhere inthis town surrounding it.

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:30.657 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
Those are both super tough political lifts.

02:00:30.757 --> 02:00:31.357 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I am not saying it is impossible, but I would
not be surprised if they were zero for two

02:00:31.458 --> 02:00:33.293 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the end of this year.

02:00:33.393 --> 02:00:34.561 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, I'm going to interrupt
and go back to the Capitol, our Lisa Desjardins,

02:00:34.661 --> 02:00:36.329 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
who is just running into all sorts of important
people.

02:00:36.429 --> 02:00:37.163 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
The ambassador from the United States to the
U.N., Nikki Haley, is with you, Lisa.

02:00:37.263 --> 02:00:38.965 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: That's right.

02:00:39.065 --> 02:00:40.400 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Ambassador Haley, thank you so much for joining
us here in our corner of the Capitol.

02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:42.268 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NIKKI HALEY, U.S. Ambassador To The United
Nations: Thank you.

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:44.037 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: What, especially in your
job, was important about this speech tonight?

02:00:44.137 --> 02:00:45.505 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NIKKI HALEY: Well, I think, if you heard his
tone on foreign policy, it was spot on.

02:00:45.605 --> 02:00:46.473 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What we want our allies to know is, we are
going to have your back.

02:00:46.573 --> 02:00:48.308 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
We want them to have our backs as well.

02:00:48.408 --> 02:00:48.741 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And then what we want to do is, those that
challenge us, we are going to call them out

02:00:48.842 --> 02:00:50.410 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
on it.

02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:51.511 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And I think he made it very clear that Americais going to be a leader again.

02:00:51.611 --> 02:00:52.445 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
We are going to really show our strength again.

02:00:52.545 --> 02:00:53.213 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
And I think he is all about action.

02:00:53.313 --> 02:00:55.081 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
So it was a great speech.

02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:56.149 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: He has spoken on the campaign
trail and again tonight about making sure

02:00:56.249 --> 02:00:57.984 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
NATO allies carry their share of the costs.

02:00:58.084 --> 02:00:58.685 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
How do you determine what that is, and how
do you execute that exactly, and when do you

02:00:58.785 --> 02:01:00.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
start executing that?

02:01:00.587 --> 02:01:01.521 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NIKKI HALEY: Well, they should be paying based
on what their revenues are coming in.

02:01:01.621 --> 02:01:03.523 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
That's what they are supposed to be doing.

02:01:03.623 --> 02:01:04.491 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
But what has happened with all of these organizations
is, they have become very dependent on the

02:01:04.591 --> 02:01:06.292 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
United States to just carry the burden.

02:01:06.392 --> 02:01:07.127 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What he is saying is, we want to work with
you, you are our allies, but you have got

02:01:07.227 --> 02:01:08.628 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
to help us carry this burden.

02:01:08.728 --> 02:01:09.996 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: When do you start building
that kind of pressure?

02:01:10.096 --> 02:01:11.231 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NIKKI HALEY: Well, you know, and I think they're
responding.

02:01:11.331 --> 02:01:12.499 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Already, he is getting great responses from
NATO.

02:01:12.599 --> 02:01:14.100 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
They are starting to get the money that is
coming in.

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:15.201 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are starting to spread that word throughthe United Nations as well.

02:01:15.301 --> 02:01:16.136 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
And I think those things are really important.

02:01:16.236 --> 02:01:17.604 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: One quick question.

02:01:17.704 --> 02:01:18.371 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Our panel has talked a lot about President
Trump as an organizer.

02:01:18.471 --> 02:01:19.272 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
What is he like as a boss?

02:01:19.372 --> 02:01:20.540 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
How is he communicating with you?

02:01:20.640 --> 02:01:21.207 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
NIKKI HALEY: You know, I just met with him
yesterday.

02:01:21.307 --> 02:01:22.408 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is very flexible.

02:01:22.509 --> 02:01:23.443 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He allows us to do our job, which is what
I love.

02:01:23.543 --> 02:01:25.178 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
He supports us there through the process.

02:01:25.278 --> 02:01:26.112 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And if there is anything we need, all we have
to do is call him or come see him.

02:01:26.212 --> 02:01:27.147 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He has been fantastic to work with.

02:01:27.247 --> 02:01:27.714 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: You call his cell phone?

02:01:27.814 --> 02:01:28.348 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is it that easy?

02:01:28.448 --> 02:01:29.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NIKKI HALEY: Yes.

02:01:30.049 --> 02:01:30.717 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You just give him a phone call, or you justsay, I need to come see you.

02:01:30.817 --> 02:01:31.751 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He is incredibly flexible.

02:01:31.851 --> 02:01:33.620 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
&nbsp;
But he really wants us to be at our best.

02:01:33.720 --> 02:01:34.320 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
He wants us to surround ourselves with the
people that make a good team, but he has been

02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:36.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a great leader so far.

02:01:36.289 --> 02:01:37.157 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
LISA DESJARDINS: U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley,
thank you so much for joining us -- Judy.

02:01:37.257 --> 02:01:37.924 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thanks to the ambassador.

02:01:38.024 --> 02:01:39.659 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Thanks to you again, Lisa.

02:01:39.759 --> 02:01:41.461 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Amy Walter, I actually didn't hear that much
about foreign policy in this speech.

02:01:41.561 --> 02:01:43.229 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
AMY WALTER: No, because, remember, this is
America first, and this is about being the

02:01:43.329 --> 02:01:45.064 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
president of America, and it is on -- he ran
on that platform and on domestic issues.

02:01:45.165 --> 02:01:46.866 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I just want to go back to this point about
whether or not we can see Democrats working

02:01:46.966 --> 02:01:48.735 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
with Republicans and whether he is taking
away that sort of core Democratic -- some

02:01:48.835 --> 02:01:49.669 align:left position:62.5%,start line:86.67% size:37.5%
of the core Democratic principles on the economy,
blue-collar workers, things like that.

02:01:49.769 --> 02:01:51.504 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
The question is where he leads from.

02:01:51.604 --> 02:01:53.339 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so if he leads from some of the issues
he outlined today and in the way he outlined

02:01:53.439 --> 02:01:55.074 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
them, yes, you could see a plausible path
forward for bringing some Democrats forward.

02:01:55.175 --> 02:01:56.910 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But if he is leading on, we have this executive
order, that is going to alienate.

02:01:57.010 --> 02:01:58.845 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We heard his -- during the speech, when he
was talking about illegal immigrants and the

02:01:58.945 --> 02:02:00.180 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
crimes they were committing, and he was putting
a new task force together, there were audible

02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:01.981 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
groans in the audience, Democrats saying,
that is right.

02:02:02.081 --> 02:02:03.550 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
We are going to focus on an entire segment
of law enforcement for an issue that they

02:02:03.650 --> 02:02:05.451 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
don't -- they believe that immigrants arebeing unfairly targeted on.

02:02:05.552 --> 02:02:07.287 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, if he is leading from a place of division,
let's do the things that are really dividing

02:02:07.387 --> 02:02:09.122 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
the Democrats and Republicans, or, in this
case, broader -- more broadly, the country,

02:02:09.222 --> 02:02:10.957 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
you are not going to get the buy-in as if
you are leading with the other piece of it.

02:02:11.057 --> 02:02:12.792 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And so I think that is always going to be
this balancing act for so many members, even

02:02:12.892 --> 02:02:14.661 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
members of his own party, who want him to
lead with many of the things in the speech,

02:02:14.761 --> 02:02:15.295 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
and then find themselves on the defensive
when he goes and does something that is outside

02:02:15.395 --> 02:02:16.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of what they need.

02:02:16.429 --> 02:02:17.597 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Less than two minutes here.

02:02:17.697 --> 02:02:19.465 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Matt Schlapp, is that something you are worried
about?

02:02:19.566 --> 02:02:21.334 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes, well, I think -- I can
see the path in the first two years, for sure.

02:02:21.434 --> 02:02:22.168 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I actually think the questions of immigration
and trade and some of these E.O.s are very

02:02:22.268 --> 02:02:23.136 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
popular in states where Heidi

02:02:23.236 --> 02:02:25.038 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Executive orders, right.

02:02:25.138 --> 02:02:25.605 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MATT SCHLAPP: Where Heidi Heitkamp camp will
be running and Claire McCaskill will be running

02:02:25.705 --> 02:02:27.440 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Joe Manchin.

02:02:27.540 --> 02:02:28.007 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, for the first two years, I can see how
the politics work with the Senate seats that

02:02:28.107 --> 02:02:29.742 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
are up in '18.

02:02:29.842 --> 02:02:30.443 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
You know, I am not smart enough to know how
it goes in the two years after that.

02:02:30.543 --> 02:02:32.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine?

02:02:32.478 --> 02:02:33.313 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: So, I'm going to basically
end it the way -- same way I started it, which

02:02:33.413 --> 02:02:35.048 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
is actions speak louder than words.

02:02:35.148 --> 02:02:35.882 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And his actions these last 30-some-odd days
have proven to be divisive and dark.

02:02:35.982 --> 02:02:37.717 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And here is a perfect example.

02:02:37.817 --> 02:02:38.284 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Today, he talked to -- he did an executive
order on HBCUs, historical black college and

02:02:38.384 --> 02:02:40.086 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
universities.

02:02:40.186 --> 02:02:41.521 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that was an opportunity to -- that was
an opportunity to reach across the aisle.

02:02:41.621 --> 02:02:42.222 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And when you read the executive order, there
is nothing there.

02:02:42.322 --> 02:02:43.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is a nothing burger.

02:02:43.523 --> 02:02:44.457 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
There is actually no new money to help out
HBCUs.

02:02:44.557 --> 02:02:46.292 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
So, that is what it has been looking like.

02:02:46.392 --> 02:02:47.560 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
Either you have executive orders that are
just like press releases, they're glorified

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:48.928 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
press releases, or they're pretty divisive
and dark.

02:02:49.028 --> 02:02:49.862 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, bring us all together,
Mark and David.

02:02:49.963 --> 02:02:50.363 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
You have got 20 seconds to do it in.

02:02:50.463 --> 02:02:51.664 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:02:51.764 --> 02:02:52.899 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, Judy, I think it's going
to -- OK.

02:02:52.999 --> 02:02:54.067 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
I will say David is right about a tax -- the
tax cut.

02:02:54.167 --> 02:02:54.734 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
In 1986, Bill Bradley was the architect of
it.

02:02:54.834 --> 02:02:56.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It took five years.

02:02:56.502 --> 02:02:58.238 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But, if you are just talking about a corporatetax cut, that will sail through.

02:02:58.338 --> 02:02:59.572 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
But if you are really getting into personal
and getting rid of loopholes, then you are

02:02:59.672 --> 02:03:00.540 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
back and forth, and it is not going to be
an easy thing.

02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:02.375 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You get the last word.

02:03:02.475 --> 02:03:03.309 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
DAVID BROOKS: Quickly, he has been leaking
air since the inauguration, losing support.

02:03:03.409 --> 02:03:04.210 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He will have reversed that tonight.

02:03:04.310 --> 02:03:05.545 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
He will get a boost in the polls.

02:03:05.645 --> 02:03:07.013 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
A lot of people think, OK, he seems normal,
seems good.

02:03:07.113 --> 02:03:08.381 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
So, he stopped the slide that he has had since
Inauguration Day.

02:03:08.481 --> 02:03:08.881 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thus spake -- spoke -- spake
David Brooks.

02:03:08.982 --> 02:03:09.649 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:03:09.749 --> 02:03:10.149 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
DAVID BROOKS: Spake a lot.

02:03:10.250 --> 02:03:11.484 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:03:11.584 --> 02:03:13.319 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you all for staying here
all night.

02:03:13.419 --> 02:03:14.387 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And that concludes our special live coverage
of the president's address to Congress and

02:03:14.487 --> 02:03:15.321 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
to the nation, and the Democrats' response.

02:03:15.421 --> 02:03:15.955 align:left position:87.5%,start line:93.33% size:12.5%
Thanks to all of our guests tonight.

02:03:16.055 --> 02:03:17.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

02:03:17.156 --> 02:03:18.725 align:left position:75%,start line:93.33% size:25%
Stay with us as our coverage continues online.

02:03:18.825 --> 02:03:22.825 align:left position:75%,start line:86.67% size:25%
And for all of us at the "PBS NewsHour," thankyou, and we will see you soon.
