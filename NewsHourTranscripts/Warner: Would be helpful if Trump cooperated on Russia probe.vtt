JUDY WOODRUFF: The Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence
met behind closed doors this

00:04.833 --> 00:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week with three key
figures in their expanding
Russia investigation,
National Security Director

00:12.400 --> 00:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mike Rogers, the director
of national intelligence,
Dan Coats, and special
counsel Robert Mueller.

00:17.333 --> 00:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And with us now, the committee's
top Democrat, its vice chairman,
Virginia Senator Mark Warner.

00:23.666 --> 00:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator, first off, you
-- we have been hearing,
been discussing with
NPR's Carrie Johnson

00:30.100 --> 00:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the fact that the special
counsel has expanded his
investigation to include
potential obstruction

00:36.433 --> 00:37.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of justice.

00:37.900 --> 00:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is that something your
committee is doing as well?

00:39.766 --> 00:42.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ÑMD-BOÑSEN.

00:42.266 --> 00:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER (D), Virginia:
Well, Judy, I'm not
going to comment on
the expanse of special

00:46.900 --> 00:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
counselor Mueller's
investigation.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think it's an indication
of how serious it is that he
is obviously recruiting some

00:55.533 --> 00:59.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the top talent from
around the country to
assist him in this effort.

00:59.000 --> 01:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It shows how seriously
he's taking this effort,
and, frankly, how
seriously the vast majority

01:05.966 --> 01:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of elected officials, Democrats
and Republicans, who realize
that the Russian intervention

01:11.700 --> 01:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was massive in our elections.

01:13.033 --> 01:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have got to get
to the bottom of it.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have got to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

01:16.833 --> 01:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It really appears that
the only elected official
maybe in Washington
that doesn't accept the

01:24.133 --> 01:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
potential dangerousness of
the Russian intervention
is actually the president
of the United States.

01:29.466 --> 01:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, that's
what I wanted to ask you about.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president has been
actively tweeting today.

01:32.766 --> 01:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Among other things, he said
they went after a -- he said
they made up a phony collusion

01:39.266 --> 01:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russians story,
they found zero proof,
and now, he said, they're
going after obstruction

01:41.833 --> 01:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of justice because
they found nothing.

01:43.633 --> 01:45.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:45.166 --> 01:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK WARNER: That's, you know,
just factually not appropriate.

01:51.700 --> 01:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, we are still early on
into particularly some of the
individuals that were affiliated

01:56.966 --> 02:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Trump campaign and
their potential contacts or
communications with Russians.

02:02.666 --> 02:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We thought we would be further
along, but for the fact that the
president, in an unprecedented

02:07.266 --> 02:11.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way, fired the FBI
director, Jim Comey.

02:11.000 --> 02:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had obviously a pattern
here where there are at least
reports of other individuals

02:17.433 --> 02:19.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that were at least
contacted by the president.

02:19.666 --> 02:22.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I'm not going to comment
on the specifics of
the individuals we saw.

02:22.900 --> 02:26.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's -- we need
to keep confidential.

02:26.866 --> 02:31.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we do have the
former National Security
Adviser General Flynn
who was fired because

02:31.700 --> 02:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he didn't come forward with
his contacts with the Russians.

02:34.233 --> 02:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have had the attorney general
recuse himself because he didn't
fully disclose his contacts

02:39.966 --> 02:41.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the Russians.

02:41.966 --> 02:46.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If the president's rendition
is true, you know, that there's
no there there, why wouldn't

02:48.966 --> 02:53.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he collaborate with
the investigation to
get this cleared up, as
opposed to his constant

02:55.466 --> 02:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tweetage saying that this is
a witch-hunt and fake news?

02:58.100 --> 03:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think there's any member
of the Senate that believes this
is fake news that the Russians

03:03.066 --> 03:07.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interfered, just as they
interfered in France,
just as they will
probably interfere in the

03:07.000 --> 03:09.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
German elections coming
up later this year.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it's a national
security threat.

03:11.133 --> 03:13.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, while we're
talking about the question of
whether there is obstruction

03:13.766 --> 03:18.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or not, I know your committee
met this week, as we have
just reported, with Dan Coats,

03:21.200 --> 03:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the director of national
intelligence, and
also with the National
Security Agency director,

03:23.200 --> 03:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Rogers, in both cases,
presumably asking questions
that they wouldn't -- they were

03:29.200 --> 03:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not willing the answer
in open session.

03:31.900 --> 03:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Were they able to shed any
more light on this question of
whether they -- go ahead, yes.

03:35.033 --> 03:36.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:36.033 --> 03:38.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:38.033 --> 03:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I'm not going
to get into the content
of their testimony.

03:44.433 --> 03:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will say that it's very
important that sources
and methods in terms
of how we discovered

03:49.800 --> 03:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian intervention, that that
is maintained and preserved,
and there's an appropriate

03:55.566 --> 03:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
classified portion.

03:57.600 --> 04:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think there are questions
that still need to be
explored about, if a president

04:04.033 --> 04:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was calling on these subjects,
how much of that is classified.

04:08.300 --> 04:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not going to comment again
on any specifics, but these are
all -- and what I worry about

04:14.166 --> 04:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is, is there a pattern emerging?

04:16.166 --> 04:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's something, again,
that time will tell and,
obviously, the special counsel,

04:22.233 --> 04:24.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Mueller, will
continue to look into.

04:24.800 --> 04:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You met
with the special counsel,
as we said, yesterday,
you and Chairman Richard

04:28.466 --> 04:31.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Burr.

04:31.000 --> 04:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can you explain for us
the difference between
the mission of what you're
doing, your committee,

04:35.933 --> 04:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the House Intelligence
Committee, vs. what
Mr. Mueller is doing?

04:38.466 --> 04:39.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

04:39.466 --> 04:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK WARNER: Sure.

04:40.966 --> 04:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, special counsel Mueller
has got a criminal standard.

04:44.133 --> 04:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In many cases, that criminal
standard is quite high.

04:47.533 --> 04:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He will have to -- if he
chooses to bring charges against
anyone, they will have to

04:52.033 --> 04:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meet those legal standards.

04:54.333 --> 04:58.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
We're leading a
counterintelligence
investigation that
started with looking
at Russian interference

05:01.200 --> 05:06.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our election, was broadened
to include any potential
communication or collaboration

05:08.166 --> 05:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between officials in part of
either campaign, and the focus
is generally on folks affiliated

05:12.933 --> 05:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with the Trump campaign,
and the Russians.

05:15.000 --> 05:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We have actually not
had a chance to get to
many of the witnesses
that have been at least

05:21.733 --> 05:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bandied about because, again,
this -- we have been superseded
in a way by the firing of

05:28.633 --> 05:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Director Comey, then President
Trump disparages Director Comey
in front of the Russians, saying

05:35.900 --> 05:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on national television that he
fired him because of the Russia
investigation, all things that,

05:42.866 --> 05:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at least for this senator, raise
a lot of questions that I'm
still trying to sort through.

05:46.133 --> 05:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, no concern
you're going to get in each
other's way, that what your

05:49.666 --> 05:50.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
committee...

05:50.666 --> 05:51.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

05:51.666 --> 05:54.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I think
that's something that we
have to make sure there's
appropriate deconfliction.

05:56.300 --> 06:00.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the end of the day, you know,
the criminal investigation, we
can't do anything that would

06:01.400 --> 06:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interfere with that
criminal investigation.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, you know, I'm not
going to, again, comment
about our conversations
with special counsel

06:10.100 --> 06:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mueller, but I think it was
a good first step, and I
think we will have to have
ongoing communications.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Just one
final quick question.

06:15.366 --> 06:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vice President Mike Pence, it
was announced today, has hired
his own private counsel to

06:20.066 --> 06:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
address any issues arising out
of the Russia investigation.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you have a comment on that?

06:24.700 --> 06:26.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: No, I don't have
a comment, but I just -- other
than the fact that it would

06:30.033 --> 06:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be helpful if the administration
actually collaborated and
cooperated with all of us.

06:37.033 --> 06:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the Russians did in 2016
in the United States, the
Russians have also done in the

06:42.966 --> 06:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
French elections, they will
do in the German elections.

06:45.033 --> 06:49.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, as a state that
has statewide elections
this year, I'm concerned
about their ongoing

06:50.700 --> 06:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
efforts to try to, frankly, sow
chaos in our democratic process.

06:54.066 --> 06:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And let me be clear.

06:55.333 --> 06:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is not about
relitigating 2016.

06:56.833 --> 06:57.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

06:57.833 --> 06:59.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK WARNER: It's not about
the Russians being for
Republicans or Democrats.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Russians are for
their own interests.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have to be careful about
this new form of conflict.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But just
very quickly, Senator,
so I understand, you're
saying the administration

07:08.933 --> 07:10.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is not collaborating
right now with you?

07:10.566 --> 07:12.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:12.066 --> 07:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK WARNER: I wish there
was closer cooperation.

07:14.100 --> 07:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a number of members
of the administration who
volunteered to come forward.

07:17.166 --> 07:20.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There are a number of
individuals that work
on the Trump campaign.

07:20.300 --> 07:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I don't see what
value is added by the
president's constant
dismissal of the seriousness

07:27.633 --> 07:29.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of this threat.

07:29.700 --> 07:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Mark
Warner, the vice chairman of
the Senate Select Committee on

07:33.033 --> 07:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Intelligence, we thank you.

07:34.233 --> 07:35.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

07:35.233 --> 07:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK WARNER: Thank you, Judy.
