JUDY WOODRUFF: This week
marks the 50th anniversary
of the landmark Supreme
Court decision Loving

00:05.933 --> 00:07.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
vs. Virginia.

00:07.833 --> 00:11.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 1967, the justices struck
down Virginia's laws prohibiting
interracial marriage.

00:14.233 --> 00:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In her latest book, "Loving:
Interracial Intimacy in
America and the Threat
to White Supremacy,"

00:20.700 --> 00:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgetown University
law Professor Sheryll
Cashin explores the
history of white supremacy

00:26.566 --> 00:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this country and how
relationships between different
races challenge that ideology.

00:31.733 --> 00:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As part of our Race
Matters series, I sat down
with Cashin yesterday.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Sheryll Cashin, thank you
very much for joining us.

00:38.766 --> 00:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the title of the book refers
to the Virginia couple, Richard
Loving, his wife, Mildred,

00:45.300 --> 00:49.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who were arrested, thrown in
jail for the crime of marrying
each other in the state

00:51.066 --> 00:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Virginia in the 1950s,
and then, in 1967, the
Supreme Court decision.

00:56.433 --> 01:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But your story, your telling
of this story, the book, goes
much earlier than that, to

01:02.400 --> 01:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the -- before the
beginning of this country.

01:04.466 --> 01:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ÑMDNMÑSHERYLL CASHIN, Author,
"Loving: Interracial Intimacy
in America and the Threat

01:06.533 --> 01:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to White Supremacy":
The anti-miscegenation
law was created as part
of the law of slavery.

01:11.033 --> 01:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the 1600s, you had
white indentured servants
and black indentured
servants and slaves working

01:17.633 --> 01:20.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
together, fraternizing together.

01:20.400 --> 01:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when slave owners wanted
to transition to black chattel
slavery, they had this problem.

01:27.300 --> 01:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so they put in slave
codes laws that penalized
interracial sex and marriage.

01:33.533 --> 01:36.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that was --
began in the 1660s.

01:36.166 --> 01:41.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, for the next 300
years, you had the state of
Virginia and other states trying

01:42.600 --> 01:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to separate people like
Mildred and Richard Loving.

01:45.733 --> 01:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Going back to the
beginning, was this something
that was just bred in the

01:50.566 --> 01:53.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
psyche of the people who
lived in this country?

01:53.033 --> 01:55.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where did it come from?

01:55.066 --> 01:59.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERYLL CASHIN: Well, in the
elite capitalist class, the
landed gentry that could afford

02:01.666 --> 02:06.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to buy big estates and
own people, this idea
of the supremacy of the
white Christian goes

02:09.933 --> 02:11.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back to the Crusades.

02:11.933 --> 02:16.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is much evidence that,
in colonial Virginia, in the
colonies, the working bonded

02:19.733 --> 02:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people didn't have a
concept of whiteness or
supremacy or race at all.

02:26.133 --> 02:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They related to each other
as struggling people.

02:29.033 --> 02:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's only when the slave owning
class needs to teach people to
treat each other differently

02:36.233 --> 02:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
based on race for utilitarian
reasons that that begins.

02:39.700 --> 02:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What were the
forces along the way in the
history of this country that

02:47.233 --> 02:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were pushing against
people coming together,
that were working against,
not just intermarriage,

02:54.333 --> 02:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but friendships, any kind of
connections between the races?

02:57.400 --> 03:00.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN: Right.

03:00.166 --> 03:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wherever you have a regime
of the color line, whether
it's slavery or Jim Crow
or a divide-and-conquer

03:05.800 --> 03:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of politics, there's
an economic story there.

03:09.300 --> 03:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What the elites most
feared was that struggling
whites and people of
color would come together

03:16.400 --> 03:20.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in politics to demand
more of economic elites.

03:20.933 --> 03:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, along
the way, as you point out
throughout the book, there were

03:24.300 --> 03:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also forces at work to bring
the two -- not just the two,
but to bring all races together.

03:31.300 --> 03:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN: America
has been in this dance
from the beginning.

03:35.700 --> 03:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been two ideas,
the beautiful, egalitarian,
fundamental idea of universal

03:44.166 --> 03:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
human dignity in Thomas
Jefferson's words in
the Declaration of
Independence, but also

03:51.033 --> 03:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this regime of white supremacy
that is really designed
to help with capitalism.

03:58.033 --> 04:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And throughout this period,
there have always been a small
cadre of people that crossed

04:06.566 --> 04:08.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lines for alliance or for love.

04:08.966 --> 04:11.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I feature some
of those people.

04:11.066 --> 04:15.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Some of my favorites are
Frederick Douglass and
Thaddeus Stevens, who
not only were radical

04:17.600 --> 04:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their politics, but were
radical enough to have women
of a different race as their

04:22.533 --> 04:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lovers or common law
wives or -- or wives.

04:24.333 --> 04:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why were
they able to prevail
in some instances?

04:28.633 --> 04:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERYLL CASHIN: The
radical Republicans behind
Reconstruction prevailed
with the idea that

04:35.633 --> 04:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people of color and progressive
open-minded whites would
come together in politics for

04:42.033 --> 04:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the common good and create
things like public education.

04:44.933 --> 04:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My bottom line point is that the
class of what I call culturally
dexterous person that's

04:51.900 --> 04:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
open to difference in
this country and wants to
make it work is growing.

04:54.833 --> 04:58.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's what
I wanted to ask you, because
you do use the term cultural

04:58.066 --> 04:59.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dexterity throughout.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN: Right.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
do you mean by that?

05:02.533 --> 05:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SHERYLL CASHIN: So, cultural
dexterity is the ability to
enter a situation where you

05:08.300 --> 05:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are outnumbered by a
different group and
experience that with comfort,
even wonder, an enhanced

05:16.800 --> 05:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
capacity for dealing with
people of a different group.

05:19.766 --> 05:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the opposite
of colorblindness.

05:22.333 --> 05:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the ability to see
and understand difference
and accept it, rather
than sort of demanding

05:29.500 --> 05:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that someone else assimilate
to your cultural norms.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why do
you think it's spreading?

05:34.600 --> 05:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know there are people who
look at the racial divide in
this country today and say, yes,

05:38.433 --> 05:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have made progress, but we
have such a long way to go.

05:41.366 --> 05:42.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN:
Yes, I will agree.

05:42.866 --> 05:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I acknowledge that we're in
a state of toxic polarity.

05:47.633 --> 05:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But all I'm saying is that I
believe we're going to get to
a point where a critical mass

05:54.566 --> 05:57.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of folks, particularly white
people in this country, have
accepted the loss of centrality

05:59.200 --> 06:01.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of whiteness.

06:01.300 --> 06:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you combine those folks
with growing populations of
people of color, you're going

06:07.600 --> 06:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get a majority coalition
that will fight together
for the common good.

06:14.400 --> 06:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even if, along
the way, you may always have
a group of people who fiercely

06:19.200 --> 06:20.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
believe something different.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN: Yes.

06:22.433 --> 06:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm not saying that interracial
relationships are going to make
racism go away, or -- nothing

06:25.833 --> 06:27.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like that.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There will always
probably be some people,
unfortunately, that are racist.

06:32.966 --> 06:35.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I think they're
a minority now.

06:35.233 --> 06:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they
will continue to be a
minority in this country.

06:39.733 --> 06:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what gives me hope is that
there is a growing population
of folks who like diversity

06:47.233 --> 06:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and want to make it work and
want to be part of the coalition
for bringing everybody along.

06:54.500 --> 06:58.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sheryll Cashin,
the book is "Loving: Interracial
Intimacy in America and

06:58.966 --> 07:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Threat to White Supremacy,"

07:01.533 --> 07:02.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

07:02.766 --> 07:02.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SHERYLL CASHIN:
Thank you so much.
