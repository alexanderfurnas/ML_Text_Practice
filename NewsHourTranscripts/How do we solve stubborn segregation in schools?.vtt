GWEN IFILL: As the Supreme Court
considers
yet another major affirmative
action case,

00:05.739 --> 00:11.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
tonight's Race Matters
conversation focuses
on what happens before students
get to college

00:11.445 --> 00:15.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when they grow up in mostly
segregated inner-city
schools.

00:15.616 --> 00:21.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
"PBS NewsHour" special
correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault is reporting a
year-long series

00:21.588 --> 00:24.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on solutions to the questions
raised by race.

00:25.025 --> 00:29.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, she talks with Pedro
Noguera, a professor
at the University of California,
Los Angeles,

00:30.030 --> 00:32.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who has found what can work.

00:32.699 --> 00:37.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Despite
an historic
Supreme Court ruling some 61
years ago outlawing

00:37.905 --> 00:43.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
segregated schools, today, huge
numbers of
students remain in separate and
unequal schools,

00:43.644 --> 00:45.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most in inner cities.

00:45.445 --> 00:49.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it doesn't have to be that
way, says Pedro
Noguera, director of the Center
for Study

00:49.683 --> 00:54.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of School Transformation at
UCLA. I met him
in New York, where he was about
to speak with

00:54.821 --> 00:55.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a group of educators.

00:55.956 --> 00:59.259 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Professor Noguera, thank you so
much for joining
us.

00:59.293 --> 01:04.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sixty-one years after separate
and unequal
was ruled illegal, you say it's
still happening.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Why?

01:06.700 --> 01:08.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA, University of
California, Los
Angeles: Well, it's happening
because the

01:08.402 --> 01:12.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
courts have basically made it
very difficult
to continue to pursue
integration.

01:12.773 --> 01:16.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's after we made quite a
bit of progress
in this country, especially in
the South,

01:16.877 --> 01:20.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but now we know that schools in
the North
and the West are more segregated
now than

01:20.547 --> 01:25.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they were 30 years ago. So, we
now find ourselves
in a situation where not only
are schools

01:25.485 --> 01:31.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increasingly racially separate,
but we're
also concentrating the poorest
children in

01:31.525 --> 01:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
schools that have the fewest
resources.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Why?

01:34.494 --> 01:38.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: I would say it's
a combination
of lack of investment in schools
that serve

01:38.665 --> 01:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
poor children and the fact that
we have no
longer the political will.

01:43.170 --> 01:50.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But you
have argued
that separate schools play a
role in perpetuating

01:50.177 --> 01:53.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
inequality, not just in the
schools, but in
general.

01:53.146 --> 01:55.048 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PEDRO NOGUERA: They do.

01:55.082 --> 02:01.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They do, because separate has
still been unequal
in education. The racially
separate schools,

02:01.221 --> 02:04.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even when the schools do a good
job, the learning
opportunities you have a child
will influence

02:04.691 --> 02:10.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the kind of college you go into,
the kind
of profession you have access
to, the kind

02:10.130 --> 02:12.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of income you earn.

02:12.099 --> 02:16.636 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so if we really are
interested in creating
a society that's more equal and
less characterized

02:16.670 --> 02:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by racial divisions, then we
need to put more
investment in education and
leveling the playing

02:21.575 --> 02:23.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
field and integrating our
schools.

02:23.443 --> 02:26.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: There
have been schools
that have started that are
supposed to be

02:27.014 --> 02:31.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
making up for these disparities,
like the
charter schools and magnet
schools.

02:31.651 --> 02:35.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What impact are those kinds of
schools having,
though, on public education?

02:35.922 --> 02:39.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Well, in fact,
many of the
charter schools are even more
segregated than

02:39.860 --> 02:41.695 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the public schools.

02:41.728 --> 02:44.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Middle-class families,
particularly middle-class
African-American families, want
integrated

02:44.965 --> 02:46.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
schools for their kids.

02:46.800 --> 02:51.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Not long
ago, Professor
Raj Chetty told me about an
experiment that

02:51.138 --> 02:56.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
took young people out of
segregated communities
into more integrated
communities. But even

02:56.543 --> 03:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he said that, while those were
successful,
you needed to fix those within
the community.

03:01.715 --> 03:06.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, you have some solutions and
some examples
where that works.

03:06.153 --> 03:08.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Yes, and --
because we do have
examples.

03:08.121 --> 03:14.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tulsa, Oklahoma, for example,
here, you have
a city, a very red state, the
best high school

03:14.895 --> 03:19.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the city, Booker T.
Washington, is 50 percent
black, and it is a school that
the entire

03:19.533 --> 03:22.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
city looks up to. That should be
a model for
the country.

03:22.602 --> 03:25.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But why
is it a school
that everybody looks up to?

03:25.939 --> 03:27.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Because of the
quality of education
provided.

03:27.808 --> 03:31.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: You just
said that
there wasn't the will in these
communities.

03:31.845 --> 03:33.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So what happens in that case?

03:33.747 --> 03:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Well, Tulsa --
it's interesting,
because Tulsa has a very ugly
history. In

03:36.650 --> 03:40.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1924, there was the race riots
there, where
the black community was burned
to the ground,

03:40.487 --> 03:42.289 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Greenwood.

03:42.322 --> 03:46.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been an effort,
though, in Tulsa
to invest in early childhood
education. Every

03:46.159 --> 03:51.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
child gets quality early
childhood education.
Every school is a community
school.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.732 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How did
it get to
that point?

03:52.766 --> 03:54.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Good question.

03:54.601 --> 03:58.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Hope Franklin, a great
historian, was
a leader in the effort in
promoting the idea

03:59.005 --> 04:03.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of reparations for black folks
in Tulsa. After
he died, his students...

04:03.376 --> 04:05.178 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: He was a
pre-Ta-Nehisi
Coates?

04:05.212 --> 04:05.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

04:05.879 --> 04:07.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: That's right.

04:07.614 --> 04:13.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his students, white students
from Duke
University, took up the effort
to rebuild

04:13.253 --> 04:17.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Greenwood after he died. There
is a big monument
in Tulsa to John Hope Franklin
built by his

04:18.024 --> 04:22.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
former students, most of whom
are affluent
whites in Tulsa.

04:22.095 --> 04:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is an important part of
the history
too. It's, we make our greatest
advances when

04:26.800 --> 04:32.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not just African-Americans
that are pushing
the issue, when whites, when
Latinos, when

04:32.105 --> 04:38.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asians, when the mosaic of
America recognizes
that we can be a better nation
if we are working

04:38.111 --> 04:40.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together, if we are serving each
other's interests.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, there are others
like it in
other parts of the country that
are showing

04:43.617 --> 04:49.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us that you don't have to wait
until we solve
the problem of poverty or
inequality. You

04:49.789 --> 04:53.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can do a lot in education now
that would help
to move our society forward.

04:53.193 --> 04:57.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: But one
of the things
you have talked about is how
there are needs

04:57.764 --> 05:03.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
beyond just the basic education,
particularly
for urban students, and I guess
you mean predominantly

05:03.236 --> 05:04.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
African-American or children of
color.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Well, absolutely.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are many children in this
country -- because
we have the highest child
poverty rates of

05:09.476 --> 05:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all advanced nations; 22 percent
of kids in
this country come from families
at or below

05:14.281 --> 05:17.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the poverty level. So, we have a
lot of kids
coming to school who are hungry,
who don't

05:17.817 --> 05:21.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have adequate housing, whose
have basic needs
not being met.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Schools serving those children
need other
resources. They need social
workers. They

05:24.691 --> 05:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need psychologists. They might
need a food
program. They might need health
workers on

05:29.629 --> 05:34.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
site in order for those kids to
be able to
concentrate on education and for
their teachers

05:34.367 --> 05:36.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to concentrate on teaching them.

05:36.136 --> 05:37.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT:
Brockton, Massachusetts,
you gave an example.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: What Brockton
shows us -- it's
the largest high school in the
state, 4,200

05:41.341 --> 05:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
students -- that by focusing on
the student
needs, you can, even without
moving them,

05:47.214 --> 05:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
create a school that's the pride
of the community.

05:49.449 --> 05:54.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brockton is one of the only
urban high schools
in the state of Massachusetts
that gets a

05:54.154 --> 05:59.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
level one rating. And that's
because over
one-third of their senior class
gets the highest

05:59.626 --> 06:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
possible test score in the
state. And the
demographics of the kids who get
that score

06:04.664 --> 06:06.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
match the demographics of the
school.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: And how
did it get
that way?

06:07.434 --> 06:08.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: They focus on
literacy.

06:08.935 --> 06:10.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: They
who?

06:10.737 --> 06:13.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: The school. They
make sure
that every teacher, regardless
of the subject

06:13.406 --> 06:18.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they teach, is a teacher of
literacy, whether
it be science, or math, or art,
or music.

06:18.278 --> 06:22.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Literacy is what's promoted,
because they
understand that strong literacy
skills, reading,

06:23.016 --> 06:25.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
writing, speaking, is the key to
a strong
education.

06:25.952 --> 06:31.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have stuck with that
for the last
15 years or more. And it shows
in the results.

06:31.725 --> 06:37.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: How
committed do you
think America is to maintaining
public education?

06:37.831 --> 06:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: I think we're at
a crossroads.

06:40.934 --> 06:45.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I try to remind people the
public education
system is the only system that
accepts all

06:45.905 --> 06:49.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children. If we don't educate
our children
well, we're all in trouble. The
retirees -- and

06:49.709 --> 06:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have a growing number of
retirees in America,
most of whom are white -- are
going to be

06:53.847 --> 06:58.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increasingly dependent on a
younger, more
diverse work force to support
them in their

06:58.551 --> 07:00.353 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
retirement.

07:00.387 --> 07:02.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, even if they really care
about the kids,
if they just care about
themselves, they should

07:02.789 --> 07:06.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be concerned about the future of
public education.
People who are concerned about
their property

07:06.226 --> 07:10.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
values should be concerned about
public education,
because the quality of the
schools affects

07:10.363 --> 07:12.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the value of your property.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're all in this together.
And that's
what it takes, is, we need
leadership that

07:15.935 --> 07:21.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gets people to see it's in our
interests as
a country to invest in our
children, to invest

07:21.074 --> 07:23.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in our schools. And we haven't
had that for
many years.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLAYNE HUNTER-GAULT: Except
in the places
you mentioned.

07:25.045 --> 07:27.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PEDRO NOGUERA: Yes. At the local
level you,
see it.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
