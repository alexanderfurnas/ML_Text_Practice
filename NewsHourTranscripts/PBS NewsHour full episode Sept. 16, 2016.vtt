JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.472 --> 00:06.440 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.473 --> 00:08.208 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:

00:08.242 --> 00:12.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Barack Obama was born in the
United States,

00:12.379 --> 00:14.081 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
period.

00:14.114 --> 00:19.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Reversing his
longstanding
claim, Donald Trump acknowledges
President

00:19.119 --> 00:24.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obama is a native-born citizen,
as Hillary
Clinton argues history can't be
erased.

00:24.391 --> 00:30.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
He has led the birther movement
to delegitimize

00:30.964 --> 00:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our first black president.

00:32.766 --> 00:38.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then: In Syria, a
shaky cease-fire
is tested, as the U.N. attempts
to deliver

00:38.872 --> 00:43.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aid to those stuck in the
war-torn city of
Aleppo.

00:43.343 --> 00:48.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus: Protests from more than a
hundred Native
American tribes slow the
construction of an

00:48.682 --> 00:52.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oil pipeline near a reservation,
but the fight
is far from over.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD,
Standing Rock Sioux
Tribe: When that oil spills,
who's going to

00:55.589 --> 00:56.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come save us?

00:56.823 --> 00:58.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're Indian people.

00:58.125 --> 00:59.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're expendable.

00:59.426 --> 01:00.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who is going to come?

01:00.594 --> 01:02.729 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who is going to come and give us
water?

01:02.763 --> 01:04.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

01:04.531 --> 01:08.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze a full
week of news.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:11.271 --> 01:15.542 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:15.575 --> 01:29.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The presidential
campaign took
a sudden detour today, back to
President Obama's

01:29.356 --> 01:31.191 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
origins.

01:31.224 --> 01:36.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the first time, Donald Trump
said publicly
the president is, indeed,
American by birth.

01:36.396 --> 01:39.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in the process, he stirred
up a new storm
of criticism.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: For the
presidential opponents
both holding events within
blocks of the White

01:44.805 --> 01:47.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
House, the day was a battle over
truths.

01:47.174 --> 01:52.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His aides had said it recently,
but, for the
first time, Donald Trump himself
acknowledged

01:52.779 --> 01:56.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
President Obama is a
natural-born American
citizen.

01:56.583 --> 02:02.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
President Barack Obama was born
in the United

02:02.456 --> 02:04.858 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
States, period.

02:04.891 --> 02:11.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we all want to get back to
making America
strong and great again.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

02:13.700 --> 02:17.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It was a
complete reversal
for the man who years stoking
the so-called

02:17.270 --> 02:18.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
birther controversy.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.674 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is on "The Today Show" in
2011.

02:20.707 --> 02:24.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You are not
allowed to be president
if you are not born in this
country.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.413 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He may not have been born in
this country.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: When the White
House made
the president's birth
certificate public two

02:29.683 --> 02:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weeks later, Trump questioned if
the document
was real.

02:33.920 --> 02:38.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even as a presidential
candidate, in January
of this year, Trump refused to
acknowledge

02:38.925 --> 02:41.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the president was indeed born in
Hawaii.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.363 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOLF BLITZER, CNN: Is he a
natural-born citizen?

02:43.397 --> 02:44.598 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Who knows?

02:44.631 --> 02:45.599 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Who knows?

02:45.632 --> 02:47.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who cares right now?

02:47.200 --> 02:49.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Today, clearly,
Hillary Clinton
cared, even before Trump spoke.

02:49.569 --> 02:55.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
For five years, he has led the
birther movement

02:55.575 --> 03:01.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to delegitimize our first black
president.

03:01.982 --> 03:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His campaign was founded on this
outrageous
lie.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is no erasing it in
history.

03:09.389 --> 03:12.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There was more
outrage from
members of the Congressional
Black Caucus,

03:12.959 --> 03:15.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who said Trump is unrepentant
and an opportunist.

03:15.162 --> 03:16.129 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:16.163 --> 03:17.898 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
G.K.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BUTTERFIELD (D), North Carolina:
By any definition,
Donald Trump is a disgusting
fraud.

03:19.800 --> 03:25.605 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: At the White
House today,
President Obama declined to
respond to Trump's

03:25.639 --> 03:27.507 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
public change on the issue.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
I was pretty confident about
where I was born.

03:30.510 --> 03:33.647 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think most people were as
well.

03:33.680 --> 03:41.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my hope would be that the
presidential
election reflects more serious
issues than

03:41.321 --> 03:42.689 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.492 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Trump today
raised another
birther controversy.

03:45.525 --> 03:47.828 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He alleged Clinton is to blame.

03:47.861 --> 03:58.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Hillary Clinton
and her campaign
of 2008 started the birther
controversy.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.108 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I finished it.

04:01.141 --> 04:03.844 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There is no
evidence of that.

04:03.877 --> 04:06.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fact-checks proving it to be
false abound.

04:06.947 --> 04:12.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's 2008 campaign did
fight tooth and
nail with President Obama, but
she never questioned

04:12.786 --> 04:14.654 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his birthplace.

04:14.688 --> 04:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was one more geographic
story today,
where Trump chose to hold his
event, his new

04:20.060 --> 04:22.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
D.C. hotel.

04:22.095 --> 04:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When Trump took cameras on a
hotel tour, but
wouldn't allow producers who
would ask questions,

04:26.600 --> 04:31.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of the major networks
refused to use the
footage, seeing it as a
publicity stunt.

04:31.571 --> 04:33.974 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Lisa
Desjardins.

04:34.007 --> 04:38.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Donald Trump
and Hillary
Clinton will be the only
candidates at the

04:38.345 --> 04:41.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
first presidential debate in 10
days.

04:41.248 --> 04:46.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Commission on Presidential
Debates said
today that Libertarian candidate
Gary Johnson

04:46.453 --> 04:52.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Green Party nominee Jill
Stein don't have
high enough standings in public
opinion polls

04:52.259 --> 04:54.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to qualify.

04:54.094 --> 04:58.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: A
suicide bomber
killed at least 24 worshipers
and injured

04:58.865 --> 05:02.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dozens more at a Sunni mosque in
Northwest
Pakistan.

05:02.936 --> 05:09.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The attacker struck at the
village of Ambar
in a tribal region near the
Afghan border.

05:09.142 --> 05:15.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Despite this, security in
Pakistan has actually
improved since 2013, with
attacks dropping

05:15.182 --> 05:17.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by nearly half.

05:17.684 --> 05:21.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama made a new push
today for
the Trans-Pacific trade deal.

05:21.588 --> 05:27.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been roundly denounced by
both Democrats
and Republicans during this
campaign season.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president blamed that on
misinformation.

05:29.462 --> 05:36.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: If you're
frustrated about rules
of trade that disadvantage
America, if you're

05:36.203 --> 05:41.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
frustrated about jobs being
shipped overseas,
then you want to get this thing
passed, you

05:41.474 --> 05:43.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
want to get this thing done.

05:43.376 --> 05:48.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Republican
Governor John Kasich
of Ohio was among political and
business leaders

05:48.215 --> 05:52.385 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meeting with the president, and
urging Congress
to approve the deal.

05:52.419 --> 05:57.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Senate Republican Leader
Mitch McConnell
says there won't be a vote
before Mr. Obama

05:57.257 --> 05:58.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
leaves office.

05:58.992 --> 06:03.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On Wall Street today, dropping
oil prices
were a factor as the Dow Jones
industrial

06:03.129 --> 06:08.235 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
average lost 88 points to close
at 18123.

06:08.268 --> 06:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell five and the S&amp;P
500 dropped
eight.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the week, the Nasdaq rose 2
percent.

06:14.841 --> 06:18.178 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Dow and the S&amp;P gained a
fraction.

06:18.211 --> 06:24.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as of today, beer began
flowing beneath
the streets of a medieval
Belgian city.

06:24.217 --> 06:30.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
After five months of
construction, a brewery
in Bruges opened a two-mile-long
underground

06:30.657 --> 06:34.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pipeline to pump beer to a
suburban bottling
plant.

06:34.928 --> 06:38.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It replaces heavy trucks rolling
down narrow,
cobblestone streets.

06:38.865 --> 06:45.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
XAVIER VANNESTE, De Halve Maan:
We have up
to four to five of these tanker
trucks a day

06:45.305 --> 06:49.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sometimes, and that's really
becoming difficult
for environmental reasons.

06:49.976 --> 06:56.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But also, just in general, the
livability
of the inner center of Bruges is
sometimes

06:56.349 --> 06:57.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
threatened to that.

06:58.018 --> 07:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The pipeline was
partially
financed through a crowdfunding
appeal.

07:02.555 --> 07:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Top contributors receive a
bottle of beer
every day for the rest of their
lives.

07:07.360 --> 07:14.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
a desperate
need for aid in Syria, despite
the shaky cease-fire;

07:14.701 --> 07:20.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump's appeal in one of
Ohio's Democratic
strongholds; the ongoing battle
over the Dakota

07:21.007 --> 07:34.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
oil pipeline; and much more.

07:34.054 --> 07:39.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last Friday, the U.S. and Russia
announced
a deal to resume a tenuous
cease-fire in Syria,

07:39.726 --> 07:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in order to get much needed
humanitarian aid
to badly deprived civilians
throughout the

07:44.698 --> 07:46.199 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

07:46.232 --> 07:50.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It went into effect Monday
evening, and, thus
far, the results are mixed.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner begins our coverage.

07:53.606 --> 07:59.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The day began
with claims
of progress in the four-day old
cease-fire.

07:59.879 --> 08:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Syrian state television showed
bulldozers
apparently clearing the Castello
Road into

08:05.418 --> 08:07.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
war-ravaged Aleppo.

08:07.787 --> 08:12.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the crucial link for
humanitarian aid
convoys to enter Aleppo from
Turkey.

08:13.026 --> 08:17.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Russians also announced that
Syrian army
units had pulled out of the
area.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, within hours, all that
changed.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.167 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VLADIMIR SAVCHENKO, Syria
(through translator):
Opposition groups have not
started pulling

08:25.772 --> 08:28.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
armor and weapons from Castello
Road.

08:28.308 --> 08:32.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result, Syrian military
vehicles and
government troops were returned
to the positions

08:32.712 --> 08:34.481 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they occupied earlier.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Rebel fighters
denied that,
and said government forces never
left in the

08:38.785 --> 08:40.553 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first place.

08:40.587 --> 08:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We are
currently
around a mile away from Castello
Road, whereas

08:45.058 --> 08:48.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the regime can be seen over
there traveling
through normally.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.029 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Nothing has changed for them.

08:50.063 --> 08:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's only us who have been
forced to retreat.

08:52.031 --> 08:56.302 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: The
finger-pointing left
U.N. convoys stuck at the
Turkish border for

08:56.336 --> 08:59.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
another day, without Syrian
government permission
to enter.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENS LAERKE, U.N. Office for the
Coordination
of Humanitarian Affairs: We are
as ready to

09:02.008 --> 09:05.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go as we can possibly be.

09:05.044 --> 09:14.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The modalities for ensuring safe
passage have
not yet been cleared and given
to us so that

09:14.087 --> 09:15.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we can move.

09:15.922 --> 09:21.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Secretary of
State John Kerry
and Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov

09:21.227 --> 09:25.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
had negotiated the cease-fire in
Geneva last
weekend.

09:25.131 --> 09:29.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They spoke by phone today, and,
according
to the State Department, Kerry
said the delays

09:29.669 --> 09:34.073 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on opening access for
humanitarian aid were
unacceptable.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House went further,
blaming the
Russians.

09:36.843 --> 09:40.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
They are the ones that have made
a commitment

09:40.079 --> 09:45.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to use their influence with the
Assad regime
to reduce the violence and allow
humanitarian

09:45.885 --> 09:47.220 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
access.

09:47.253 --> 09:52.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And either the Russians are
unable to live
up to the agreement.

09:52.292 --> 09:56.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe they don't have the juice
and influence
that they claim to have and that
we all thought

09:56.296 --> 09:57.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they had.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.132 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Or maybe they're just unwilling.

09:59.165 --> 10:04.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Meanwhile,
there are other
signs the cease-fire is fraying.

10:04.137 --> 10:09.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavy fighting was reported
today around the
capital, Damascus.

10:09.943 --> 10:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tensions have cropped up
within the U.S.-backed
coalition battling the Islamic
State in Syria.

10:17.050 --> 10:22.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This amateur video today was
said to show
Americans, possibly special
forces, leaving

10:22.689 --> 10:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a Syrian border town after
rebels protested
their presence.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Margaret
joins me now.

10:29.395 --> 10:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Margaret, one week in, it
looks like this
deal is not holding up well.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.368 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What has gone wrong, and has
anything going
right?

10:35.401 --> 10:38.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, the one
thing that's
going right, Judy, is you don't
have all this

10:38.571 --> 10:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heavy bombing of civilians, so
we can't lose
sight of that.

10:42.041 --> 10:46.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People are allowed to go out in
Aleppo and
shop if there's anything to buy.

10:46.079 --> 10:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's not happening, as we
just showed
in the setup, is that
humanitarian aid is

10:50.350 --> 10:52.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not getting through.

10:52.285 --> 10:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that was, as Josh Earnest
said, the Russians'
job to make sure that President
Assad would

10:56.890 --> 11:00.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
let these convoys in, and
they're just not
getting in.

11:00.960 --> 11:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The two tracks, if both of those
were satisfied,
then they were going to set up
this joint

11:05.398 --> 11:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
operations center, where the
U.S. and Russians
would somehow work together to
target the

11:10.537 --> 11:15.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Islamic State and the
al-Qaida-linked group
which used to be called the
Nusra Front.

11:15.074 --> 11:19.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the White House made clear
today, unless
the other two checks are
satisfied, they're

11:19.746 --> 11:23.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to even get to this
joint integration
center or operational center.

11:23.816 --> 11:27.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the Russians
are saying,
though, that the United States
bears some

11:27.654 --> 11:28.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the responsibility.

11:28.755 --> 11:30.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, you know,
they have
a point.

11:30.657 --> 11:35.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. responsibility was to
lean on its
clients, which are the
U.S.-vetted or CIA-vetted

11:36.029 --> 11:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rebels, the so-called moderate
opposition.

11:38.998 --> 11:43.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they have been, in many
areas, really
entangled with this
al-Qaida-linked group,

11:43.369 --> 11:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not ideologically, but simply
because they
fight more effectively together.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have been told by people
who have spoken
to the military commanders of
these groups

11:53.880 --> 11:55.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that many of them are very
suspicious.

11:55.582 --> 11:59.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say, well, if we have to
disentangle
from the Nusra fighters, who are
the most

11:59.686 --> 12:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
effective ones, means we have to
fall back,
the U.S. and Russians will bomb
the Nusra

12:04.257 --> 12:06.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fighters, and Assad's forces
will come take
the territory.

12:06.693 --> 12:11.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Margaret,
explain, though,
this apparent division between
the State Department

12:11.898 --> 12:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Pentagon over working
with the Russians.

12:14.233 --> 12:17.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Well, it's
really interesting,
Judy, because not that you don't
always have

12:17.870 --> 12:22.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this kind of friction -- or
often -- but to
have it burst into the open like
this.

12:22.976 --> 12:27.580 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The other day, I was at a
conference in which
the new head of CENTCOM, General
Votel, was

12:27.614 --> 12:32.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
speaking, and he said, look, we
can't -- there's
a trust deficit with the
Russians.

12:32.151 --> 12:33.886 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't know what their
objectives are.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will say one thing, and
they don't follow
up.

12:36.122 --> 12:41.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is particularly true in
this whole
Ukraine over these years of the
Ukraine conflict,

12:41.160 --> 12:44.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the Russians would promise
to do one
thing and they would do
something else.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There are also specific risks.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are not going to really
operate together.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were supposed to share
intelligence.

12:50.370 --> 12:54.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, here are the Nusra fighters,
here are
the ISIS fighters.

12:54.340 --> 12:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what the Americans are very
afraid of
is that the Russians will take
the information

12:58.177 --> 13:04.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that superior U.S. intelligence
has, either
use that information to bomb the
U.S.-backed

13:04.717 --> 13:08.554 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rebels or pass that info on to
the Assad forces.

13:08.588 --> 13:13.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One military colonel, one Army
colonel suggested
that to me.

13:13.226 --> 13:19.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that also it's hard to tell
the Russians
what we know without indicating
how we know

13:19.098 --> 13:20.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

13:20.466 --> 13:24.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the secretary of defense, Ash
Carter, has
actually spoken out.

13:24.337 --> 13:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the other interesting I
heard today, Judy,
is that this debate is being
used by opponents

13:29.742 --> 13:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this deal in Moscow to say,
well, if the
American military isn't even
going to obey

13:34.380 --> 13:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the orders, why should we do
anything?

13:36.382 --> 13:42.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this really,
though, Margaret,
the last gasp of this
information on Syria,

13:42.055 --> 13:44.824 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and if that's the case, then
what happens
after that?

13:44.857 --> 13:46.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: I'm afraid so.

13:46.693 --> 13:50.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I went to the very first --
Secretary Kerry
keeps saying, we want to get to
this political

13:51.030 --> 13:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
transition, these talks where
there will be
a discussion of a process and
President Assad

13:56.235 --> 13:58.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will slowly fade away.

13:58.104 --> 14:04.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I went to the very first
talks back in,
you know, Switzerland almost
three years ago.

14:04.644 --> 14:07.380 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think it's moved at all.

14:07.413 --> 14:09.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And at this point, that is a
distant dream.

14:09.549 --> 14:14.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they could only get at least
an end to
a lot of the carnage on the
ground -- in other

14:14.821 --> 14:21.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
words, they -- Kerry and Lavrov
are now negotiating
over a fifth of a loaf, and that
now even

14:21.994 --> 14:22.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
appears in doubt.

14:22.995 --> 14:23.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tough, tough
story to follow.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Yes, very.

14:25.198 --> 14:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Margaret Warner,
we thank you.

14:38.778 --> 14:44.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now part two of our
on-the-ground report from
Ohio, one of the crucial swing
states in this

14:44.383 --> 14:46.185 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
presidential election.

14:46.219 --> 14:51.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, John Yang reports from
a county in
Northeastern Ohio that's
normally a Democratic

14:51.257 --> 14:57.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stronghold, but where, because
of the sluggish
economy, Republicans are hoping
to make inroads.

14:57.096 --> 15:02.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This story is also part of our
ongoing reporting
initiative Chasing the Dream:
poverty and

15:02.802 --> 15:04.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Opportunity in America.

15:04.804 --> 15:10.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: In the Moore
household in Newton
Falls, Ohio, Donald Trump's
approval rating

15:10.843 --> 15:18.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is just about 100 percent, three
generations
of voters, including a longtime
Democrat who's

15:18.217 --> 15:24.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
never voted Republican,
enthusiastically backing
the New York millionaire.

15:25.024 --> 15:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You might call 21-year-old Danny
Moore a Trump
scholar.

15:29.195 --> 15:31.297 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He wrote a college paper about
his nomination.

15:31.330 --> 15:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANNY MOORE, Trump Supporter: It
was about
the desire to be part of the
movement to return

15:34.734 --> 15:38.037 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America to its greatness and
dominance in
the world.

15:38.070 --> 15:42.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The dominance of Donald Trump
leads his supporters
to believe he can and will do
this for America.

15:43.009 --> 15:44.443 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: He got an A.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.046 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAN MOORE, Trump Supporter:
We're on a course
that is not sustainable.

15:47.079 --> 15:52.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Danny gave Trump's
book, "The Art
of the Deal," to his father,
Dan, a self-described

15:52.985 --> 15:58.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
swing voter who says he was on
the Obama bandwagon
in 2008 and 2012.

15:58.758 --> 15:59.725 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And now?

15:59.759 --> 16:01.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who are you voting for this
fall?

16:01.294 --> 16:03.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAN MOORE: Absolutely Donald
Trump.

16:04.030 --> 16:09.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With him being a real estate
developer and
being involved in the
construction industry,

16:09.268 --> 16:12.839 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he had to be a good
problem-solver.

16:12.872 --> 16:16.475 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANCES KIMPTON, Trump
Supporter: He's going
to build the wall, and they're
going to pay

16:16.509 --> 16:18.277 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for it.

16:18.311 --> 16:22.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Dan's 75-year-old
mother-in-law,
Frances Kimpton, is a lifelong
Democrat who

16:22.315 --> 16:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
switched parties to vote for
Trump in the
Ohio primary.

16:25.384 --> 16:29.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCES KIMPTON: I would go in,
and I would
vote straight down the ticket
everything Democrat.

16:29.856 --> 16:33.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But now I'm going to do
everything Republican.

16:33.359 --> 16:35.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I can't wait to do it.

16:35.494 --> 16:41.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trumbull County is
one of Ohio's
most reliably Democratic
counties, delivering

16:41.500 --> 16:47.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
majorities around 60 percent to
the party's
nominees since 1996.

16:47.773 --> 16:52.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Trump is trying to narrow
that gap here
and across Northeastern Ohio.

16:52.778 --> 16:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's visited the region five
times since August
with a message about the
economy.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
We're going to bring jobs back
to Ohio.

17:01.921 --> 17:05.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's an appeal
tailor-made for
Trumbull County.

17:06.025 --> 17:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One out of every four jobs that
was here 15
years ago is gone, 26,000 in
all, including

17:15.034 --> 17:19.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more than 1,000 that disappeared
when this
steel mill closed in 2012.

17:19.939 --> 17:27.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dan Moore, a member of the
United Steel Workers
Union, has watched the
industry's slow, painful

17:27.947 --> 17:29.048 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
decline.

17:29.081 --> 17:31.717 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAN MOORE: working-class
families were being
hurt.

17:31.751 --> 17:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're losing their homes,
they're losing
their cars.

17:33.753 --> 17:39.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One day, you're middle class or
upper middle
class, and the next day you're
poverty class.

17:39.392 --> 17:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He blames trade deals
like NAFTA
championed by President Bill
Clinton.

17:44.063 --> 17:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAN MOORE: I believe that Donald
Trump can
do something to help, you know,
make it a

17:50.870 --> 17:55.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fairer playing board.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's been very clear about his
position on
NAFTA.

17:59.445 --> 18:05.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I believe that a Trump
presidency will take
a close look at NAFTA and the
language of

18:05.818 --> 18:11.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that agreement, and, if it can't
be reformed,
he's on record saying we will
walk away from

18:11.691 --> 18:13.526 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.295 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Like her son-in-law,
Frances Kimpton
doesn't think President Obama
has done enough.

18:16.329 --> 18:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRANCES KIMPTON: When Obama was
running, I
voted for him.

18:20.099 --> 18:25.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then I found out that he
didn't live up
to what he said he was going to
do.

18:25.538 --> 18:30.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I voted for him twice, and I
couldn't believe
how the situation is now.

18:30.242 --> 18:35.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trade has been an
issue in Trumbull
County since native son William
McKinley was

18:35.147 --> 18:36.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
president.

18:37.016 --> 18:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was at his memorial in Niles
that we spoke
with Kyle Kondik of the
University of Virginia

18:43.656 --> 18:45.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Center for Politics.

18:45.424 --> 18:49.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He wrote a book about Ohio's
significance
in presidential elections, "The
Bellwether."

18:49.862 --> 18:52.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE KONDIK, University of
Virginia: These
are areas where anti-free trade
populism has

18:52.631 --> 18:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
been popular for a very long
time.

18:54.867 --> 18:58.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is generally a region that
feels like
maybe it has not benefited from
trade agreements

18:58.871 --> 19:00.639 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
such as NAFTA.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trumbull County was actually
Trump's second
best county in the whole state
in terms of

19:04.010 --> 19:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the primary, and there's some
thought that
that will translate to the
general election

19:07.380 --> 19:09.181 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as well.

19:09.215 --> 19:12.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But Trump's message
doesn't resonate
with other Democrats here, even
though they

19:12.318 --> 19:15.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
see the same economic
conditions.

19:15.688 --> 19:21.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At Hillary Clinton's local field
office, Marie
Yancey, a retired autoworker,
was making phone

19:21.927 --> 19:23.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
calls.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARIE YANCEY, Clinton Volunteer:
With Obama
saving our jobs, she's going to
continue on.

19:25.431 --> 19:30.002 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If they had let the auto
industry fail, how
many jobs around here would we
not have?

19:30.036 --> 19:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's why she has my vote.

19:31.837 --> 19:36.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We talked to some
steelworkers
who talk about the steel jobs
that have gone

19:36.308 --> 19:37.276 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

19:37.309 --> 19:38.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they talked about trade.

19:38.544 --> 19:39.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some of them are Democrats.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say that is the reason
they're going
to vote for Trump.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do you say to them?

19:43.749 --> 19:46.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIE YANCEY: I don't understand
where their
thinking comes from.

19:46.585 --> 19:48.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I just don't trust Trump.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Trump thinks this
presidency is like
running "The Apprentice."

19:51.757 --> 19:53.626 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can't just say, you're
hired.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Jim Roan is a retired
banker.

19:55.861 --> 20:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM ROAN, Clinton Supporter: I
don't really
see anything concrete about what
he's talking

20:01.233 --> 20:02.968 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

20:03.002 --> 20:07.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's fine to say, this has got
to change,
and I'm going to change it, but
unless he's

20:07.473 --> 20:13.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Superman, which I don't think he
is, it just
isn't going to change that
easily.

20:13.112 --> 20:18.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's some very deep-seated
problems here,
and they're not going to go away
instantly.

20:18.617 --> 20:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In this topsy-turvy
election year,
the traditional voting patterns
in this crucial

20:24.590 --> 20:27.726 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
battleground state are in doubt.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Analyst Kyle Kondik:

20:29.662 --> 20:33.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KYLE KONDIK: The key question
about Ohio is,
how much can Clinton gain
amongst traditional

20:33.566 --> 20:40.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans in the affluent
suburbs vs. how
much can Trump gain with
traditional Democrats

20:40.172 --> 20:45.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the maybe-not-so-affluent
blue-collar regions
of the state?

20:45.144 --> 20:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Like this county,
where declining
economic fortunes are leading
voters like

20:48.848 --> 20:52.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Moores to rethink their
political allegiances.

20:52.852 --> 20:56.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Trumbull
County, Ohio.

20:56.755 --> 21:01.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will bring
you additional
Chasing the Dream ground reports
in the coming

21:01.827 --> 21:04.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
weeks.

21:04.163 --> 21:15.708 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:15.741 --> 21:20.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields
and David Brooks analyze the
week's political

21:20.112 --> 21:26.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news; students who choose
computer coding
over a college degree; and a
police officer's

21:26.585 --> 21:28.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take on building public trust.

21:29.021 --> 21:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: As we reported last
week, a protest
in North Dakota continues to
grow against

21:34.760 --> 21:38.230 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a major oil pipeline continues
to grow.

21:38.264 --> 21:43.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over 100 Native American tribes
have joined
the fight against the project,
saying that

21:43.669 --> 21:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it threatens one tribe's water
supply and
its sacred lands.

21:48.307 --> 21:53.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
While the U.S. Justice
Department has put
a temporary halt to part of the
project, as

21:53.245 --> 21:57.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the "NewsHour"'s William
Brangham reports,
the fight is far from over.

21:57.249 --> 22:07.993 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: After months
of protest,
it was a moment to celebrate.

22:08.027 --> 22:13.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last Friday, the Department of
Justice blocked
construction on part of the $4
billion Dakota

22:13.265 --> 22:18.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Access Pipeline, the very
pipeline that brought
these thousands of protesters
here to rural

22:18.437 --> 22:22.575 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
North Dakota.

22:22.608 --> 22:26.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But celebration soon turned to
suspicion.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.948 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's because work on the
pipeline hasn't
fully stopped.

22:28.981 --> 22:35.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In areas outside of federal
jurisdiction,
construction continues, as do
efforts to block

22:35.487 --> 22:36.655 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least 22 people were arrested
this week.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LIZ MCKENZIE, Protester: It is
most definitely
not a victory.

22:41.393 --> 22:45.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Liz McKenzie
drove 1,000
miles from Albuquerque to
protest with her

22:45.798 --> 22:47.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fellow Native Americans.

22:47.533 --> 22:53.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LIZ MCKENZIE: People are finally
noticing
us, not as beings of the past,
not as, like,

22:53.305 --> 22:56.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
costumes you buy in Halloween
stores.

22:56.075 --> 23:00.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, we are here, we are still
fighting,
and that does mean a lot.

23:00.613 --> 23:05.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Dakota
Access Pipeline
begins in North Dakota's Bakken
oil fields,

23:05.150 --> 23:11.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and would carry crude oil almost
1,200 miles
through South Dakota and Iowa
down to Illinois.

23:11.223 --> 23:16.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The pipeline's original path
crossed the Missouri
River just north of Bismarck, a
city that's

23:16.195 --> 23:18.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
90 percent white.

23:18.097 --> 23:22.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when concerns were raised
about a potential
oil spill there, the pipeline
was rerouted

23:22.701 --> 23:27.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
south to go under the river
right next to
the Standing Rock Reservation.

23:27.573 --> 23:32.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Missouri River is the
reservation's primary
source of drinking water.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.447 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The tribe says a spill there
could be catastrophic
for them.

23:35.481 --> 23:38.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when construction started, a
plea for
help went out.

23:38.550 --> 23:42.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD,
Standing Rock Sioux
Tribe: I am asking anybody who's
willing to

23:42.855 --> 23:46.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stand with us to say that water
is important
to come stand with us.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ladonna Brave
Bull Allard
put out that call.

23:49.695 --> 23:53.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is a member of Standing
Rock, and her
land looks over the ridge where
the pipeline

23:53.365 --> 23:55.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would be built.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD: When
I put the
call out, I really thought maybe
40 people

23:57.870 --> 23:59.238 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would come.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's overwhelming.

24:00.673 --> 24:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In my own vision, I didn't
expect this.

24:04.476 --> 24:08.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now over a
hundred Native
American tribes from across
North America

24:08.881 --> 24:10.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have joined Standing Rock's
movement.

24:10.849 --> 24:14.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in this sprawling camp, a
community has
formed.

24:14.486 --> 24:17.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This kitchen serves donated food
to all.

24:17.389 --> 24:21.360 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kids can take classes at a
makeshift school.

24:21.393 --> 24:24.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Cords of donated firewood are
split and stacked,
free for the taking.

24:24.897 --> 24:30.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why do you think that this has
taken off and
spoken to so many people from so
many parts

24:30.336 --> 24:31.303 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country?

24:31.337 --> 24:33.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD: The
water.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know how precious that water
is.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.243 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We know that we must stand for
the water.

24:38.277 --> 24:40.512 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mni Wiconi, we say, water of
life.

24:40.546 --> 24:44.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, every time we drink water,
we remind ourself
how important the water is.

24:44.516 --> 24:46.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Don't you do that?

24:46.919 --> 24:48.821 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You will now.

24:48.854 --> 24:53.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Protecting the
water spurred
Brenda Guachena to drive 30
hours from Southern

24:53.125 --> 24:54.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
California to be here.

24:54.893 --> 24:57.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's from the Rincon Band of
Luiseno Indians.

24:57.763 --> 25:02.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She came with dozens of people,
including
her grandkids, and brought
trucks full of

25:02.201 --> 25:03.969 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
donated supplies.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRENDA GUACHENA, Rincon Band of
Luiseno Indians:
Walking in, it was so humbling
to see all

25:05.871 --> 25:07.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of these flags.

25:07.606 --> 25:11.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of the people, of the native
people in
all the reservations that showed
up here to

25:11.443 --> 25:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show Standing Rock, we're here
to support
you, and we're not going to let
people do

25:15.314 --> 25:16.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this to us anymore.

25:16.548 --> 25:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Guy Jones was
born in Standing
Rock.

25:19.118 --> 25:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says the tribes are tired of
being ignored.

25:21.553 --> 25:25.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUY JONES, North Dakota: They
didn't want
it in Bismarck, but it was, oh,
it's OK if

25:25.724 --> 25:29.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Indians -- you can go down
and run it
through the reservation where
all those Indians

25:29.395 --> 25:30.362 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
live.

25:30.396 --> 25:31.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, who cares about the
Indians?

25:31.630 --> 25:36.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's one of the things
that kind of
incensed people.

25:36.969 --> 25:41.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The company
that's building
the pipeline energy, Energy
Transfer Partners,

25:41.173 --> 25:43.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
says it's followed all the
rules.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it points out the pipeline
isn't even
on a reservation land.

25:46.612 --> 25:51.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Plus, it argues that moving oil
via modern
pipelines is a far safer way
than putting

25:51.583 --> 25:56.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it on trucks or trains, which
statistics show
are far more likely to crash and
spill.

25:56.922 --> 26:00.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also says the pipeline will
generate revenue
and jobs for North Dakota.

26:00.793 --> 26:03.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We asked the company several
times to talk
with us on camera.

26:03.562 --> 26:05.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They didn't make anyone
available.

26:05.631 --> 26:09.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We did speak with Ron Ness,
president of the
North Dakota Petroleum Council,
the trade

26:09.935 --> 26:12.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
association that includes Energy
Transfer
Partners.

26:12.704 --> 26:15.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RON NESS, President, North
Dakota Petroleum
Council: Pipelines are the most
safe -- most

26:15.374 --> 26:20.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
efficient, safest, and
cost-effective way
to move oil to market.

26:20.512 --> 26:25.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the products get there
virtually 100 percent
of the time without issue.

26:25.350 --> 26:30.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That said, the
2.5 million
miles of oil and gas pipelines
across the

26:30.923 --> 26:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. do sometimes leak and
rupture, and when
they do, they often spill far
more oil than

26:36.361 --> 26:38.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a single train car carries.

26:38.697 --> 26:44.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since 1995, there's been more
than 2,000 significant
accidents on oil and gas
pipelines, causing

26:44.636 --> 26:47.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about $3 billion in property
damage.

26:48.006 --> 26:53.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For example, in July 2010, at
least 800,000
gallons of crude oil spilled
into the Kalamazoo

26:53.812 --> 26:55.614 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
River near Marshall, Michigan.

26:55.647 --> 27:00.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was one of the largest inland
oil spills
in U.S. history, and the
costliest.

27:00.686 --> 27:04.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Almost 5,000 acres of wetland
habitat was
inundated with oil.

27:04.890 --> 27:06.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hundreds of animals were killed.

27:06.325 --> 27:09.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thousands more were recovered,
cleaned and
released.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Full recovery could take
decades.

27:11.597 --> 27:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And just this summer, a pipeline
in Canada
spilled about 65,000 gallons of
oil and other

27:17.503 --> 27:22.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
toxins into the North
Saskatchewan River,
polluting the drinking water
used by the James

27:22.508 --> 27:24.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Smith Cree Nation.

27:24.276 --> 27:28.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Petroleum Council says those
kinds of
spills near the Standing Rock
Reservation

27:28.347 --> 27:29.615 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are very unlikely.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RON NESS: This pipe is 90 feet
below the riverbed.

27:32.417 --> 27:35.020 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not going to leak right
into the river.

27:35.053 --> 27:39.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's got the detection equipment
and the shutoff
valves on each side of this
pipeline.

27:39.658 --> 27:44.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But Ladonna
Allard doesn't
believe the industry's
assurances.

27:44.162 --> 27:49.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She says half-a-million gallons
of oil coursing
every day under their drinking
water is not

27:49.434 --> 27:50.936 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
safe.

27:50.969 --> 27:52.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LADONNA BRAVE BULL ALLARD: When
that oil spills,
who's going to come save us?

27:52.771 --> 27:53.739 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're Indian people.

27:53.772 --> 27:54.740 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're expendable.

27:54.773 --> 27:55.741 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Who is going to come?

27:55.774 --> 27:58.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who is going to come and give us
water?

27:58.076 --> 28:02.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The tribe's
other concern
is that, even though the
pipeline is just

28:02.614 --> 28:07.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off their reservation, it still
runs right
through areas they say are
sacred ancestral

28:07.786 --> 28:09.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
grounds.

28:09.655 --> 28:13.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ten days ago, the tribe
submitted evidence
of newly discovered artifacts
and burial sites,

28:13.759 --> 28:16.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
asking a state court for an
emergency injunction.

28:16.962 --> 28:22.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But before the court could make
a decision,
bulldozers started digging in
that area.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protesters broke through a fence
to try and
stop them.

28:24.503 --> 28:28.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were met with pepper spray
and guard
dogs.

28:28.140 --> 28:32.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, the tribe sued the
U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, arguing that, in
its meetings

28:32.744 --> 28:36.748 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with the tribe, the Corps
ignored their concerns.

28:36.782 --> 28:40.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Archambault II is chairman
of the Standing
Rock Sioux Tribe.

28:40.185 --> 28:42.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID ARCHAMBAULT II, Chairman,
Standing Rock
Sioux Tribe: They never heard
us.

28:42.120 --> 28:48.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was just a process that keeps
moving forward
because of the interest of
economic development,

28:48.794 --> 28:51.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the interest of money, the
interest of greed.

28:51.897 --> 28:56.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But, last
Friday, a federal
court in Washington rejected the
tribe's suit,

28:56.134 --> 28:58.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
allowing the pipeline to
proceed.

28:58.070 --> 29:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was at that point that the
Justice Department
halted the project, directing
the Corps and

29:02.374 --> 29:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other agencies to take a second
look at the
tribe's concerns.

29:06.378 --> 29:09.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now that the Department of
Justice has stepped
in and said they're going to
halt this construction,

29:09.881 --> 29:12.384 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
temporarily at least, is this
over for you?

29:12.417 --> 29:16.989 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID ARCHAMBAULT II: It's far
from over,
and we knew this coming in.

29:17.022 --> 29:22.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regardless of the outcome from
the court's
decision, this was the
beginning.

29:22.194 --> 29:25.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's the start.

29:25.230 --> 29:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We finally are getting people to
hear.

29:28.367 --> 29:32.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For now, on
the lands near
the reservation, construction
equipment sits

29:32.704 --> 29:35.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
idle while the federal reviews
are under way.

29:35.841 --> 29:40.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite this delay, work on the
pipeline continues
elsewhere in North Dakota.

29:40.412 --> 29:45.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back at the camp, people have
begun building
shelters, so their vigil can
carry on through

29:45.250 --> 29:47.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the coming winter.

29:47.052 --> 29:52.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
near the Standing Rock
Reservation in North

29:53.025 --> 29:54.793 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Dakota.

29:54.826 --> 29:58.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On a related
note, a large
gasoline pipeline that supplies
the Eastern

29:58.730 --> 30:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States was shut down this
week after
a quarter-million gallons of
gasoline leaked

30:04.236 --> 30:06.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
near Birmingham, Alabama.

30:06.071 --> 30:11.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, online, you can hear more
Native American
voices from the front lines of
the Standing

30:11.343 --> 30:14.112 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rock protest in an audio slide
show.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.848 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's on our Facebook page,
Facebook.com/NewsHour.

30:16.882 --> 30:26.925 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Next, to the analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

30:26.925 --> 30:32.364 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Next, to the analysis of Shields
and Brooks.

30:32.397 --> 30:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

30:36.001 --> 30:36.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome back, gentlemen.

30:36.968 --> 30:37.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

30:37.969 --> 30:39.304 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're together in
person.

30:39.337 --> 30:41.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's good to see you.

30:41.173 --> 30:44.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mark, let's start with the
birther lie.

30:44.342 --> 30:46.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the only way to describe
it.

30:46.044 --> 30:47.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump talked about this
for years.

30:47.979 --> 30:53.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, he did finally say that
he believes
the president, President Obama,
was born in

30:53.618 --> 30:55.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the United States.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then he turned around and
said Hillary
Clinton started all this.

30:57.556 --> 31:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where does this leave this story
about the
birther controversy?

31:00.759 --> 31:03.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I'm not absolutely
sure.

31:03.995 --> 31:09.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think it's important to
establish right
at the outset that he wasn't
only the loudest

31:09.801 --> 31:17.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the highest-profile and the
most persistent
and the most well-publicized
birther, he,

31:17.876 --> 31:19.044 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

31:19.077 --> 31:20.045 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
He lied.

31:20.078 --> 31:22.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He lied consistently and
persistently.

31:22.147 --> 31:28.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, without explanation
or excuse,
he just changed his position and
tried to

31:28.453 --> 31:32.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
absolutely falsely shift the
blame onto Hillary
Clinton.

31:32.791 --> 31:36.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And this was an appeal to -- he
debased democracy.

31:36.728 --> 31:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He debased the national debate.

31:39.431 --> 31:43.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He appealed to that which is
most ignoble
or least noble in all of us

31:43.935 --> 31:49.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think -- I would like to
put to rest
right now one of the great
theories of the

31:49.307 --> 31:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Clinton, Bill Clinton, years.

31:51.076 --> 31:55.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bill Clinton was accused of
being a skirt
chaser, a draft dodger, trimming
the truth.

31:55.547 --> 31:59.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we were told by all sorts of
conservative
religious leaders, politically
conservative

31:59.785 --> 32:03.588 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
religious leaders, then,
character, character
was the dominant issue.

32:03.622 --> 32:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why you had to oppose
Bill Clinton
and support his impeachment.

32:07.092 --> 32:10.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a man running right now
for president
right now who's without
character.

32:10.529 --> 32:12.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's AWOL.

32:12.164 --> 32:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He and character are mutually
exclusive.

32:14.199 --> 32:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the silence, with rare and
conspicuous
and admirable exceptions, with
Mr. Moore of

32:21.673 --> 32:26.645 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Southern Baptists and Mr.
Mohler, is -- is
just deafening.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We found out that character is
not an issue.

32:28.947 --> 32:32.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Supreme Court turns out to
be the defining
issue.

32:32.317 --> 32:33.518 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David.

32:33.552 --> 32:35.587 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, I agree.

32:35.620 --> 32:39.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What struck me was that,
especially reading
the comment, the statement from
the Trump

32:39.558 --> 32:43.929 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
campaign, which we heard
summarized by Trump
himself earlier in the
broadcast, you know,

32:43.962 --> 32:45.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we're always used to spin.

32:45.864 --> 32:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Usually, there's some tangential
relationship
to the truth, but a corroding
relationship

32:50.869 --> 32:53.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the truth, frankly, as
politics has gone
on over the years.

32:53.905 --> 32:58.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now we're in a reverse,
Orwellian inversion
of the truth with this.

32:58.743 --> 33:03.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so we have a team of
staffers and then
the candidate himself who have
taken the normal

33:03.215 --> 33:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spin and smashed all the rules.

33:06.318 --> 33:08.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we are really in Orwell
land.

33:08.086 --> 33:09.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are in "1984."

33:09.855 --> 33:13.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's interesting that an
authoritarian
personality type comes in at the
same time

33:13.258 --> 33:19.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a complete disrespect for
even tangential
relationship to the truth that
words are unmoored.

33:19.431 --> 33:24.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I do think this statement
sort of shocked
me with the purification of a
lot of terrible

33:24.069 --> 33:25.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trends that have been happening.

33:25.804 --> 33:29.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what's white is black,
and what is
up is down, what is down is up.

33:29.541 --> 33:32.444 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that really is something new
in politics.

33:32.477 --> 33:36.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the fact that there is no
penalty for
it, apparently -- he's doing
fantastic in

33:36.147 --> 33:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the last two weeks in the polls
-- is just
somehow where we have gotten.

33:39.484 --> 33:43.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it does
come, Mark, as
the polls are tightening.

33:43.154 --> 33:45.523 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's to the benefit of
Donald Trump.

33:45.557 --> 33:46.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton has slipped.

33:46.925 --> 33:48.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is up.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's ahead in some of the
battleground states.

33:51.329 --> 33:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What are we -- I asked both of
you last week
what you think is going on.

33:55.066 --> 34:00.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, do you -- is there some
new evidence
or explanation for what's
happening?

34:00.572 --> 34:06.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I mean, I don't
know if this
is a precise explanation, Judy,
but certainly

34:06.044 --> 34:11.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's a valid possibility
that, as
he has become -- he doesn't
punch out the

34:11.716 --> 34:18.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cleaning lady, he doesn't abuse
parking lot
attendants on camera, therefore,
he's now

34:18.123 --> 34:19.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
presidential.

34:19.925 --> 34:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact that he hasn't tweeted
without -- with
a couple of exceptions, that he
is working

34:25.931 --> 34:33.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
off a Teleprompter, which he at
one point
wanted to outlaw and prohibit,
and somehow

34:33.338 --> 34:37.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is talking about -- about
policies, not talking
policy.

34:37.042 --> 34:40.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He is talking about the
possibility of policy.

34:40.412 --> 34:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, I -- then he becomes
somehow more
acceptable to people, And I
think particularly

34:47.285 --> 34:48.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to Republicans.

34:48.420 --> 34:51.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was getting a high 70 percent
of Republicans.

34:51.756 --> 34:56.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now several most -- or recent
polls have showed
him getting in the high 80
percent of Republicans.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that accounts for
his surge or
lift.

34:59.597 --> 35:03.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he's running
against a
candidate who doesn't know why
she wants to

35:03.535 --> 35:06.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be president, at least that she
can express
to anybody else.

35:06.705 --> 35:11.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, as we have been saying
for 18 months,
this is a change year, what
change is Hillary

35:11.710 --> 35:12.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton offering?

35:12.944 --> 35:15.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, if you want change, you
have only
got one option.

35:15.714 --> 35:20.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so as he becomes only
moderately terrible,
he becomes acceptable, and I
think grudgingly

35:20.919 --> 35:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acceptable to most people, not
enthusiastically
acceptable, but grudgingly
acceptable.

35:25.790 --> 35:29.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we're now at a point he's
doing well in
Ohio, he's doing well around the
country.

35:29.094 --> 35:31.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's almost tied nationally.

35:31.262 --> 35:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think we're now at the
point where one
adequate debate performance by
him and suddenly

35:35.834 --> 35:38.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he almost becomes either even or
even a slight
front-runner.

35:38.269 --> 35:40.071 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Really?

35:40.105 --> 35:41.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And this is at a
time, it should
be remembered, when, according
to the last

35:41.873 --> 35:46.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington Post poll, 62 percent
of Americans
said he's not qualified to be
president.

35:46.144 --> 35:48.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So both these things are
happening at the
same time.

35:48.313 --> 35:51.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which raises some
questions.

35:51.182 --> 35:52.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But this has happened.

35:52.951 --> 35:56.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, by the way, we should
mentioned again,
it now is clear it's just going
to be Donald

35:56.454 --> 36:00.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump and Hillary Clinton, that
these other
candidate, Gary Johnson and Jill
Stein, will

36:00.592 --> 36:02.527 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not be involved.

36:02.560 --> 36:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Mark, it also comes as
Hillary Clinton's
has had some problems, the
basket of deplorables

36:07.465 --> 36:09.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comment from a week ago.

36:10.001 --> 36:13.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some people have said that is
going to be
something the Trump people will
hang around

36:13.605 --> 36:15.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her neck for the rest of the
campaign.

36:15.173 --> 36:19.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that the kind of thing that
just is damaging
and it keeps on being damaging?

36:19.878 --> 36:20.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Sure.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Sure it is.

36:22.781 --> 36:28.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can recall, as you do, David
does, in 2008,
when -- at a fund-raiser, when
the front-runner

36:28.686 --> 36:34.893 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
said people in small
Pennsylvania towns who
had lost hope and lost jobs
cling to their

36:34.926 --> 36:36.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
guns and religion.

36:36.761 --> 36:43.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his opponent said Americans
deserve a
leader who will stand up for
them, not a leader

36:43.768 --> 36:45.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who looks down on them.

36:45.603 --> 36:50.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was Barack Obama who said
that, Hillary
Clinton who took advantage of
it, won the

36:50.508 --> 36:52.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Pennsylvania primary.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These things happen at
fund-raisers, Judy.

36:54.345 --> 37:00.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney, Palm Beach, stand
up and says,
47 percent of Americans, I can't
tell them

37:00.085 --> 37:01.619 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take responsibility for their
own live.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.221 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They expect a job.

37:03.254 --> 37:04.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They expect a paycheck.

37:04.389 --> 37:05.490 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They expect health care.

37:05.523 --> 37:07.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They expect food.

37:07.325 --> 37:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Telling people what they want to
hear, that's
what Hillary Clinton was doing
last Friday

37:10.395 --> 37:16.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night, telling a New York
liberal crowd that,
you know, the people on the
other side were

37:16.935 --> 37:23.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
xenophobic, they were racist,
they were homophobic,
Islamophobic, you name it.

37:23.575 --> 37:30.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it -- I will tell you, what
bothered me
the most -- and Donald Trump
took advantage

37:30.849 --> 37:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of it, and understandably -- she
had done
the same thing in 2008, when she
took advantage

37:34.986 --> 37:36.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of it -- what bothered me the
most was irredeemable.

37:36.821 --> 37:38.022 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

37:38.056 --> 37:41.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: You don't --
America is built
on redemption.

37:41.926 --> 37:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People came here because things
weren't working
out.

37:44.395 --> 37:51.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My generation, the old, oldest
fart generation,
OK, 13 percent of us were in
favor of same-sex

37:51.803 --> 37:55.507 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marriage 15 years ago, now 41
percent.

37:55.540 --> 37:59.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On civil rights, America changed
has dramatically
and profoundly.

37:59.577 --> 38:03.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We believe in redemption, not
just because
you're a liberal, because you're
an American.

38:03.448 --> 38:07.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that -- when you write off
people and
blame the customer, that is
really bad.

38:07.919 --> 38:15.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, David,
Barack Obama stayed
in a race, overcame that, was
elected president.

38:15.693 --> 38:20.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this more damaging for
Hillary Clinton
than -- clearly that was
damaging, too, but...

38:20.098 --> 38:21.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Right, that was
damaging, too.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's two elements here.

38:22.867 --> 38:24.702 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
One is snobbery.

38:24.736 --> 38:28.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as Mark says, it's just us
rich people
talking to each other about
those poor people.

38:28.339 --> 38:30.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that never works.

38:30.241 --> 38:31.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then there's the sociology
element.

38:31.876 --> 38:33.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They both -- it's bad sociology.

38:33.578 --> 38:36.548 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They should leave the sociology
to us amateurs.

38:36.581 --> 38:37.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

38:37.982 --> 38:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But, third, the
irredeemable
is what leapt out at me.

38:42.487 --> 38:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the person who was at the
Emanuel Baptist
-- AME Church in Charleston,
they believe

38:48.960 --> 38:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the guy who shot and killed
their close friends
was redeemable, but she thinks
millions of

38:53.965 --> 38:55.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Americans aren't?>

38:55.533 --> 39:00.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that speaks and I think it
plays, because
there is a brittleness there.

39:00.104 --> 39:01.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I don't know if there is a
brittleness
within.

39:01.306 --> 39:02.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I sort of doubt it.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think she's probably a very
good person
within.

39:04.709 --> 39:08.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there has been a brittleness
to her public
persona that has been ungenerous
and ungracious.

39:08.980 --> 39:12.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it plays a little to that
and why people
just don't want to latch on.

39:12.850 --> 39:17.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and, David,
your comment
a minute ago about Hillary
Clinton, and both

39:17.322 --> 39:21.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of you have been saying this in
one way or
another for a number of months,
hasn't given

39:21.893 --> 39:26.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a rationale, a reason to vote
for her for
president.

39:26.464 --> 39:30.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark, do you still feel you're
not hearing
that from Hillary Clinton?

39:30.235 --> 39:36.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Judy, I mean, by a
10-to-1 margin
in swing states, battleground
states, they

39:36.241 --> 39:38.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have outspent Donald Trump on
television.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And their message has been
relentless.

39:40.345 --> 39:41.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's been in his own words.

39:41.479 --> 39:42.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been true, things he's
said.

39:42.981 --> 39:46.050 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They have run up all the
negatives they can
run up Donald Trump.

39:46.084 --> 39:51.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have told people this is a
man who's
a bully, he's mean-spirited,
he's narrow-minded,

39:51.322 --> 39:56.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's all of these things, he's
not to be trusted,
not to be believed, and here's
the evidence

39:56.494 --> 39:58.363 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

39:58.396 --> 40:05.169 align:left position:25%,start line:66.67% size:75%
And yet, among
18-to-34-year-olds, a key
element
in Barack Obama's winning, his
coalition,

40:05.203 --> 40:07.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she's at 27 percent favorable,
56 percent
favorable.

40:08.006 --> 40:09.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It isn't just a matter of
policy.

40:09.974 --> 40:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She has adopted Bernie Sanders'
positions
on student loans and so forth.

40:14.445 --> 40:16.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's got to be something
there.

40:16.247 --> 40:20.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There has got to be a connection
as to what
she wants to do, how she's going
to be a better

40:20.885 --> 40:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- and it's going to be a better
America and
why it makes a difference.

40:24.322 --> 40:25.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

40:25.323 --> 40:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's too late for her to be
likable.

40:26.391 --> 40:28.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's not going to win that.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But she can at least say, OK,
you don't like
him, you don't like me, but
here's my change.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's my change.

40:32.230 --> 40:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And just four things, here's my
change.

40:34.332 --> 40:36.034 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm going to burn down the
house on this.

40:36.067 --> 40:39.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But somehow that clarity of
message has not
been there.

40:39.671 --> 40:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there were
some economic
numbers, census report, David,
that came out

40:43.808 --> 40:48.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this week that said the poverty
rate has improved
in this country.

40:48.279 --> 40:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Middle -- people who are earning
middle incomes,
their salaries have gone up.

40:53.751 --> 40:59.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet, you know, you still
see, as we saw
in John Yang's report from Ohio,
many Americans

40:59.490 --> 41:00.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aren't feeling that.

41:00.491 --> 41:01.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

41:01.492 --> 41:02.694 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The numbers were fantastic.

41:02.727 --> 41:06.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The poorer you are, the better
your increase,
basically.

41:06.464 --> 41:10.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the decline in the poverty
rate, decline
in inequality, the numbers were
just fantastic.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think two things are going
on here.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.405 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One, it's not touching
everywhere.

41:14.439 --> 41:18.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Obviously, if you're in a coal
or an industrial
area, you're still not feeling
it.

41:18.743 --> 41:23.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Second, the incomes are still,
on average,
lower than they were in 1999 in
real terms.

41:23.781 --> 41:29.587 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, third, we are
over-reporting the negativism
in this country, that we are --
every -- if

41:29.620 --> 41:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's not bad, then we don't talk
about it,
because somehow that's a
betrayal...

41:32.824 --> 41:33.791 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

41:33.825 --> 41:34.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's more
newsworthy.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.761 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

41:36.794 --> 41:39.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And the negativity
is exaggerated,
compared to what you actually
see in the diversity

41:39.130 --> 41:40.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the country.

41:40.131 --> 41:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's a good
point.

41:42.734 --> 41:47.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, cheers to John Yang on
that wonderful
piece on Trumbull County, Ohio,
where, 15

41:47.972 --> 41:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
years ago, one out of four jobs
have been
lost in the past 15 years.

41:54.512 --> 41:59.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he explained just exactly
what has gone
to the Rust Belt of America.

41:59.817 --> 42:02.453 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But let's just say good news.

42:02.487 --> 42:04.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is good news.

42:04.122 --> 42:06.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The rising tide lifts all
yachts.

42:06.057 --> 42:09.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's row boats and dinghies.

42:09.560 --> 42:14.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And poverty is down, and income
up, the highest,
Judy, in 49 years.

42:14.699 --> 42:17.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Something -- maybe the president
deserves
a little credit.

42:17.935 --> 42:23.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe policies are working and
America, it
isn't midnight.

42:23.307 --> 42:25.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It could be dawn.

42:25.176 --> 42:26.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Trump, cheer up.

42:26.677 --> 42:28.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Eventually, the news will get
worse.

42:28.746 --> 42:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mea culpa, the
news business
focuses on the negative.

42:32.617 --> 42:35.019 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It makes better stories.

42:35.052 --> 42:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you both, Mark Shields,
David Brooks.

42:37.789 --> 42:42.860 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
See you next week.

42:42.894 --> 42:56.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, tonight, we wrap up our
week-long series
Rethinking College with a look
at students

42:56.040 --> 43:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are choosing cheaper and
shorter computer
coding training as an
alternative to a college

43:01.646 --> 43:02.613 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
degree.

43:02.647 --> 43:04.215 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Hari Sreenivasan has our report.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES REID, Coding Instructor:
We're going to
just be taking notes.

43:06.717 --> 43:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's called a
high-tech
boot camp, six months of intense
work that

43:11.088 --> 43:13.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turns a beginner computer coder
into a software
engineer.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WES REID: I'm going to show guys
a tool.

43:15.893 --> 43:17.895 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If it stresses you out, don't
use it.

43:17.929 --> 43:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The academics
are difficult,
but the camps all but promise
jobs that pay

43:22.200 --> 43:24.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than double the median
income in America.

43:24.902 --> 43:26.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WES REID: It's an immersive
program.

43:26.437 --> 43:27.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's incredibly tough.

43:27.939 --> 43:32.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So tough, only
20 percent
of those who apply get accepted.

43:32.076 --> 43:33.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Instructor Wes Reid:

43:33.911 --> 43:37.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WES REID: The things that we're
really focused
on is, how do we get people as
career-ready

43:37.181 --> 43:39.116 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as fast as possible?

43:39.150 --> 43:40.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Students are
flooding in.

43:40.918 --> 43:46.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From 2014 to 2015, the number of
graduates
from coding boot camps jumped by
138 percent.

43:46.324 --> 43:52.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: And there isn't, like, any
general education
classes that you have to take or
stuff that's

43:52.563 --> 43:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not necessary used for your end
goal.

43:55.299 --> 43:59.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It's a
learning model that
is not only experiencing
explosive growth,

43:59.570 --> 44:02.874 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but also attracting tens of
millions of dollars
of private investment.

44:02.907 --> 44:05.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM DETERS, Co-Founder and CEO,
Galvanize:
The world is evolving so quickly
that, in

44:05.710 --> 44:09.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these times, we have got to
constantly be
reskilling, upskilling and
moving.

44:09.747 --> 44:13.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Denver-based
Galvanize,
one of the new breed of
high-tech schools,

44:13.451 --> 44:15.553 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just received a $45 million
investment.

44:15.586 --> 44:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM DETERS: We have grown to
1,700 students
we will teach this year.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Jim Deters is
the CEO and
founder of Galvanize.

44:22.426 --> 44:27.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM DETERS: We have moved to a
skills-based
economy, and we want to create
alternative

44:27.532 --> 44:32.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paths for anybody with aptitude,
drive, and
determination to have an
opportunity and get

44:33.004 --> 44:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more affordable access to
skills.

44:35.506 --> 44:40.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As the price
of a traditional
college education soars, what's
emerging are

44:40.311 --> 44:45.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cheaper alternatives like
software boot camps,
places that teach very specific
skills for

44:45.650 --> 44:47.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jobs that pay well.

44:47.318 --> 44:54.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So far, federal education
officials like what
they see.

44:54.091 --> 44:58.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last month, the Department of
Education opened
up $17 million for students to
pay for boot

44:59.030 --> 45:01.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
camps like New York's Flatiron
School.

45:01.899 --> 45:03.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Secretary of Education John
King:

45:03.634 --> 45:06.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KING, U.S. Education
Secretary: We're
trying to identify pathways that
will help

45:07.004 --> 45:10.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people get access to good jobs
in high-demand
fields.

45:10.975 --> 45:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Eight coding
schools that
partner with accredited colleges
will now

45:14.445 --> 45:19.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be able to offer federal loans
and grants
under a new pilot project called
EQUIP.

45:19.350 --> 45:24.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KING: We know that we need
to ensure
we have the work force ready to
compete in

45:24.422 --> 45:29.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the 21st century, and we need
new pathways
and new innovation to ensure
that we have

45:29.594 --> 45:31.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the work force we need.

45:31.495 --> 45:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coding is a good example, huge
demand for
folks with coding skills, but
we're not producing

45:36.400 --> 45:38.269 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enough.

45:38.302 --> 45:42.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Some boot
camps aren't waiting
for government funds to help
their students

45:42.306 --> 45:45.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pay the $10,000 to $20,000
tuition costs.

45:45.776 --> 45:49.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Galvanize has partnered with the
private lender
Skills Fund.

45:49.113 --> 45:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Skills Fund allows students to
pay interest-only
loans until they graduate.

45:53.217 --> 45:57.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM DETERS: Regardless whether
they have a
B.A., or dropped out of
community college,

45:57.722 --> 46:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or they came from straight out
of high school,
we want to create that pathway.

46:00.825 --> 46:05.997 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Twenty-two-year-old Isaac
Collier held multiple jobs after
high school,

46:06.030 --> 46:07.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but never made more than
$20,000.

46:07.898 --> 46:11.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISAAC COLLIER, Student: I was an
audiovisual
technician, and I was also
instructing martial

46:12.003 --> 46:13.871 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arts, and instructing teaching
of guitar.

46:13.904 --> 46:15.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The pay was never enough.

46:15.940 --> 46:17.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It just got tiring.

46:17.074 --> 46:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was paycheck to paycheck.

46:18.676 --> 46:22.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: At first
glance, Galvanize
seemed too expensive for
Collier.

46:22.213 --> 46:24.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The boot camp's Web development
class costs
$21,000.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISAAC COLLIER: I was like
really, really nervous.

46:27.652 --> 46:29.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was too expensive.

46:29.520 --> 46:33.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But, once
accepted, Collier
found that getting a private
loan was easy.

46:33.491 --> 46:38.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's because Skills Fund
partners only with
coding boot camps that have high
graduation

46:38.295 --> 46:39.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and job placement rates.

46:39.563 --> 46:42.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM DETERS: Our placement rates
are around
90-plus percent.

46:42.233 --> 46:45.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES REID: Its position, like,
this would be
like position absolute.

46:45.336 --> 46:51.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After boot
camp, Collier
expects to land an $80,000
salary as a software

46:51.308 --> 46:52.510 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
developer.

46:52.543 --> 46:53.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISAAC COLLIER: It's something
that's very
challenging.

46:53.844 --> 46:56.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very hard, but I feel like
the reward
is well worth it.

46:56.313 --> 46:59.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WES REID: The determining factor
isn't if
you had higher education.

46:59.917 --> 47:03.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's how much you're willing to
work during
the class and really put in the
effort.

47:03.854 --> 47:06.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Alexander Holt
is a policy
analyst with New America.

47:06.957 --> 47:11.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Holt likes the Skills Fund
model, because,
unlike traditional student
loans, the money

47:11.095 --> 47:12.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is tied to actual job placement.

47:12.897 --> 47:17.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER HOLT, New America:
Effectively,
what Skills Fund is trying to do
is be a private

47:17.968 --> 47:22.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
market accreditor, so they're
trying to mimic
what the federal government
does, except all

47:22.640 --> 47:24.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the incentives are in the right
place in the
private market.

47:24.975 --> 47:27.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM DETERS: We won't get paid if
they don't
get paid.

47:27.578 --> 47:32.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're really aligning our
interests with both
the student and the lender in a
way, honestly,

47:32.116 --> 47:34.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that it should be.

47:34.051 --> 47:40.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER HOLT: It makes more
sense to have
the risk on private lenders and
private companies,

47:40.791 --> 47:42.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as opposed to the taxpayer.

47:42.593 --> 47:45.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Critics of the
department
of education's new EQUIP program
are concerned

47:45.896 --> 47:50.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government lending may encourage
the kind
of abuses that became notorious
with for-profit

47:50.634 --> 47:51.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
colleges.

47:51.635 --> 47:53.838 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: We are Corinthian
Colleges.

47:53.871 --> 47:59.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER HOLT: You open up all
of these federal
dollars, and you don't have
great accountability,

47:59.643 --> 48:01.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and bad actors flood in.

48:01.479 --> 48:06.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And these schools end up just
enrolling a
lot of low-income students, and
we have terrible

48:06.550 --> 48:08.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
outcomes, and the students are
left with debt.

48:08.586 --> 48:13.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Given that
for-profit colleges
have a mixed track record, at
best, of succeeding

48:13.657 --> 48:16.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in putting people back in the
work force,
why?

48:16.761 --> 48:18.462 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why take this route?

48:18.496 --> 48:21.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KING: This is a very
targeted initiative
focused on work force
development.

48:21.265 --> 48:24.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will rigorously evaluate it
to make sure
that it's working.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.437 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If programs aren't working, we
will stop them.

48:26.470 --> 48:30.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So far, boot
camps have
won high job placement rates by
enrolling

48:30.741 --> 48:33.544 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
students who already have
college degrees.

48:33.577 --> 48:37.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But new students with less
traditional educations
pose new challenges.

48:37.815 --> 48:44.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER HOLT: One thing that's
unclear is,
are employers hiring these
people because

48:44.221 --> 48:45.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they also have a bachelor's
degree?

48:45.990 --> 48:50.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will they just hire them if they
only have
the certificate from the boot
camps?

48:50.060 --> 48:54.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: As his first
exposure to
post-secondary education, Isaac
Collier says

48:54.298 --> 48:55.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coding is a good fit.

48:55.599 --> 48:56.834 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ISAAC COLLIER: It's a good
challenge.

48:56.867 --> 48:57.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's always overcoming
obstacles.

48:57.968 --> 48:58.936 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I feel smarter, honestly,
after it.

48:58.969 --> 49:00.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I just -- I do.

49:00.638 --> 49:06.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

49:06.710 --> 49:18.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, to
another in our
Brief But Spectacular series.

49:18.489 --> 49:23.727 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, Oakland, California,
police officer
Damon Gilbert offers his candid
thoughts on

49:23.761 --> 49:25.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what it means to wear a badge in
2016.

49:25.930 --> 49:28.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DAMON GILBERT, Oakland,
California, Police
Department: Any time you put on
a bulletproof

49:28.933 --> 49:35.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vest to start your day off to
work, you have
to know that you may or may not
come back

49:35.072 --> 49:39.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home to your child, to your
wife, to your
grandmother, to your auntie.

49:39.410 --> 49:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that in itself is scary.

49:41.178 --> 49:48.052 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That in itself is scary.

49:48.085 --> 49:54.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anybody that tells you that they
haven't been
scared, I'm under the full
impression that

49:54.291 --> 49:55.626 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're a total liar.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's there, and you're human.

49:57.695 --> 49:59.230 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're not a robot.

49:59.263 --> 50:00.331 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You actually have emotions.

50:00.364 --> 50:03.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We train you and put you in
realistic predicaments.

50:03.601 --> 50:07.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do I make sure that my
finger is not on
the trigger, but my finger is
indexed?

50:07.805 --> 50:12.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do I function when I'm
talking to the
radio while keeping an eye on
unknown threats?

50:12.109 --> 50:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many times, I have given a
direct order or
a lawful order, and it's been
met with (EXPLETIVE

50:16.914 --> 50:20.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DELETED) you, or it's been met
with, come
on, let's fight.

50:20.050 --> 50:23.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, I have never been in
that situation
where I have actually had to
pull the trigger.

50:23.821 --> 50:26.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every time you see something on
TV, it's a
clip of an officer with a gun.

50:26.690 --> 50:31.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what tends to happen is, the
community
thinks that every call an
officer goes to,

50:31.462 --> 50:33.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're using their gun.

50:33.063 --> 50:34.565 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's not the case.

50:34.598 --> 50:38.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in Oakland, we work in one
of the most
violent cities in North America.

50:38.402 --> 50:43.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When we see videos that are
definitely disturbing,
it hits home.

50:43.741 --> 50:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you see it as a citizen,
and it shocks
your conscience, a lot of times,
when I see

50:48.312 --> 50:51.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same footage or we see the
same footage,
it shocks our conscience as
well.

50:51.181 --> 50:52.950 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then we want answers.

50:52.983 --> 50:57.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My heart sank when I have seen
everything
that I have seen over the past
couple months,

50:57.788 --> 50:59.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
couple years.

50:59.556 --> 51:03.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seeing the response to different
riots, and
different violent protests,
protests that

51:03.227 --> 51:06.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
go wrong, it's heartbreaking,
because I see
both sides.

51:06.830 --> 51:11.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see the officers out there who
are probably
on a 24-hour day, and people
don't know that.

51:11.468 --> 51:14.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I understand the other
end, where
people are frustrated.

51:14.038 --> 51:21.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have seen different things
that definitely
leave some questions that need
to be answered,

51:21.211 --> 51:23.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and they're angry.

51:23.047 --> 51:25.816 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, you have to give the
people a voice,
and that maybe their anger isn't
necessarily

51:25.849 --> 51:27.618 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
towards you.

51:27.651 --> 51:32.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may be toward another contact
that they
had with another police officer
10 years ago.

51:32.156 --> 51:35.693 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's tough for the
African-American community
when dealing with the police.

51:35.726 --> 51:41.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I personally have been pulled
over multiple
times as a police officer.

51:41.365 --> 51:44.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I actually was arrested in high
school for
doing something I didn't do.

51:44.702 --> 51:47.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why would I want to impose that
feeling on
you?

51:48.005 --> 51:54.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because I was mad, I was angry,
I was disappointed,
I wanted revenge.

51:54.078 --> 51:58.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a difference between
getting into
police work for the right
reasons and the

51:58.115 --> 51:59.817 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wrong reasons.

51:59.850 --> 52:02.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The wrong reasons would be, I
don't like people,
I don't like talking with
people.

52:02.953 --> 52:06.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The wrong reasons would be,
well, I want to
feel -- well, it makes me feel
bigger, and

52:06.724 --> 52:08.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
badder, and tougher.

52:08.492 --> 52:11.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You get into this business to
help out the
community, to serve the
community, to be a

52:11.562 --> 52:12.930 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
servant.

52:12.963 --> 52:16.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know my circle of influence is
very small,
but it starts with me.

52:16.800 --> 52:21.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, when I go out there, I have
to make sure
that I'm doing the right thing.

52:21.171 --> 52:25.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I believe that will help
start the process
of doing things correctly and
building back

52:25.075 --> 52:26.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the public trust.

52:26.543 --> 52:27.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Damon Gilbert.

52:27.911 --> 52:31.749 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And this is my Brief But
Spectacular take
on being a police officer.

52:31.782 --> 52:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You can watch
additional Brief
But Spectacular episodes on our
Web site,

PBS.org/NewsHour/Brief.

52:39.556 --> 52:45.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen Ifill is preparing for
"Washington Week,"
which airs later this evening --
Gwen.

52:45.662 --> 52:47.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Hey, Judy.

52:47.464 --> 52:51.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you boil it all down, and
the question
this week comes down to, who do
you believe?

52:51.969 --> 52:55.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is Donald Trump done questioning
the president's
citizenship?

52:55.406 --> 52:57.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is Hillary Clinton healthy?

52:57.574 --> 53:01.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you cut taxes and still,
say, repair the
nation's bridges?

53:01.712 --> 53:06.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the polls tighten, we examine
what's at
stake tonight on "Washington
Week."

53:06.850 --> 53:09.420 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will be
watching.

53:09.453 --> 53:13.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday with
my interview with "The
Atlantic"'s Jonathan

53:13.690 --> 53:18.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rauch to discuss his theory that
American
politics has gone off the rails
because of

53:18.362 --> 53:20.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
too much reform.

53:20.230 --> 53:21.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
