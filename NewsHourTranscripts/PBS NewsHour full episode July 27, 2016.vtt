President Obama, Vice President

INDIRA LAKSHMANAN, Journalist:
As soon as
she had a job to do and was a
Cabinet member

00:41.341 --> 00:46.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States, she seemed
completely
relaxed and completely focused
on doing that

00:46.079 --> 00:47.314 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

00:47.347 --> 00:49.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan
in Washington.

00:49.182 --> 00:52.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%

Freddie Gray case.

00:54.655 --> 00:58.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A controversial death which
sparked national
protests ends with charges
dropped on three

00:58.792 --> 01:02.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remaining officers involved, a
defeat for
the city's top prosecutor.

01:02.996 --> 01:11.004 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:11.038 --> 01:13.874 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:13.907 --> 01:24.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Democratic
delegates here
in Philadelphia have now
completed their national

01:24.117 --> 01:25.886 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ticket.

01:25.919 --> 01:30.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Clinton's vice

01:30.324 --> 01:31.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
presidential running mate.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He will be a main speaker
tonight.

01:33.894 --> 01:38.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so will President Obama,
making the case
that his former secretary of
state is the

01:38.799 --> 01:43.203 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nation's best hope of coming
together and
staying safe.

01:43.236 --> 01:45.272 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Correspondent John Yang begins
our coverage:

01:45.305 --> 01:50.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At the White House,
President Obama
prepared for his last convention
as president.

01:50.744 --> 01:54.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION: How do you feel about
tonight, Mr.
President?

01:55.015 --> 01:59.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
What's happening tonight?

01:59.720 --> 02:00.754 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Oh.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That was a joke.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You look so serious.

02:03.090 --> 02:04.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I feel great.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Also on the program
tonight, Vice
President Biden, and Hillary
Clinton's choice

02:06.526 --> 02:08.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be the next vice president.

02:08.562 --> 02:12.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This morning, Virginia Senator
Tim Kaine spoke
to home state delegates.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:13.934 --> 02:16.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM KAINE (D-VA), Vice
Presidential Candidate:
She's going to open up who we
are as a nation,

02:16.203 --> 02:18.271 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who the leadership of this
nation is.

02:18.305 --> 02:21.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And people are going to be able
to see themselves
in that office who never could
have imagined

02:21.808 --> 02:23.577 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it before.

02:23.610 --> 02:28.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's great for men to be
able to stand
and support strong women leaders
all across

02:28.281 --> 02:30.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this nation.

02:30.083 --> 02:34.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Away from the
convention, more
fireworks over those hacked
Democratic National

02:34.187 --> 02:35.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Committee e-mails.

02:36.023 --> 02:40.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American intelligence officials
say it appears
to be the work of the Russian
government.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.296 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, Donald Trump added fuel
to the fire.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I will tell you this.

02:45.432 --> 02:54.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russia, if you're listening, I
hope you're
able to find the 30,000 e-mails
that are missing.

02:54.174 --> 02:58.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think you will probably be
rewarded mightily
by our press.

02:58.545 --> 03:00.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's see if that happens.

03:00.280 --> 03:03.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The Clinton campaign
said that
moved it from being a political
issue to a

03:03.784 --> 03:05.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
question of national security.

03:05.919 --> 03:11.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in Philadelphia, Bernie
Sanders urged
supporters to close ranks behind
the woman

03:11.291 --> 03:12.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who defeated him.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:14.161 --> 03:15.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
It is not good enough just to
elect Hillary

03:15.762 --> 03:17.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton.

03:17.631 --> 03:23.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is to transform America, and
to make sure
that we have a Democratic
Senate, a Democratic

03:23.503 --> 03:26.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House and a Democratic president
who will
do that.

03:26.773 --> 03:28.375 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

03:28.408 --> 03:30.877 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Last night, dozens of
Sanders delegates
walked out of the convention.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.979 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: We don't believe that
Clinton is a
true Democrat.

03:33.013 --> 03:35.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't think she really
believes in a true
democracy.

03:35.348 --> 03:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You count every vote, in every
state, and
you make sure they all have
every right to

03:39.186 --> 03:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vote, in every single way.

03:40.187 --> 03:41.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She doesn't care about that.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.423 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She has taken away our votes and
our voice.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're making sure we're heard.

03:45.125 --> 03:49.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In an interview with
NBC's "Today
Show," Mr. Obama called for
unity.

03:49.763 --> 03:58.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: One of the dangers
in an election
like this is that people don't
take the challenge

03:58.738 --> 04:04.244 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seriously, they stay home, and
we end up getting
the unexpected.

04:04.277 --> 04:08.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: A message he will
bring directly
to the delegates tonight.

04:08.515 --> 04:11.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang in Philadelphia.

04:11.685 --> 04:18.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Next, we head down
to the convention
floor, where NPR's "Weekend
Edition Sunday"

04:18.125 --> 04:20.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
host, Rachel Martin, is standing
by.

04:20.560 --> 04:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rachel joins us every night this
week as part
of our joint "PBS NewsHour" and
NPR convention

04:26.099 --> 04:27.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rachel, what do we expect
tonight?

04:28.101 --> 04:30.036 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RACHEL MARTIN: Hey, Gwen.

04:30.070 --> 04:32.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the last couple of nights
here at the Democratic
National Convention have been
about healing

04:32.839 --> 04:35.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those wounds caused in the
primary battle.

04:35.575 --> 04:37.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, Democrats are going to
try to turn
the page.

04:37.644 --> 04:42.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The focus is going to be on two
very important
issues, national security and
the economy.

04:42.749 --> 04:46.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the past couple of days,
Donald Trump
has really hammered the
Democrats, saying,

04:46.887 --> 04:48.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where's the conversation about
ISIS?

04:48.388 --> 04:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where's all the talk about the
threat from
terrorism?

04:50.824 --> 04:56.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight will be the Democrats'
chance to answer
that and they will do it with
some heavy hitters,

04:56.863 --> 05:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of them, Leon Panetta, a
former director
of the CIA and former director
of defense.

05:01.801 --> 05:06.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will take the stage and make
the case as
to why Hillary Clinton should be
the next

05:06.206 --> 05:07.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
commander in chief.

05:08.008 --> 05:12.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, on the economy, another
heavy hitter,
Vice President Joe Biden, he has
said that

05:12.212 --> 05:16.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats have kind of forgotten
how to talk
to white working-class voters.

05:16.383 --> 05:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's going to reach directly out
to those
voters with his message tonight.

05:19.686 --> 05:25.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will also hear from Tim
Kaine, Hillary
Clinton's vice presidential
pick.

05:25.158 --> 05:30.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, finally, closing out the
evening, the
keynote address will be from
Barack Obama,

05:30.430 --> 05:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arguably Hillary Clinton's most
powerful surrogate.

05:33.233 --> 05:36.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All eyes will be on him and his
message this
evening -- back to you.

05:36.736 --> 05:37.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you,
Rachel.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will be talking to you
throughout the night.

05:40.073 --> 05:44.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As we know, conventions are
often a place
where relative newcomers capture
the national

05:44.744 --> 05:46.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
political spotlight.

05:46.179 --> 05:51.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2012, that was true for
Julian Castro,
then mayor of San Antonio.

05:51.184 --> 05:56.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now serving in President
Obama's Cabinet
as the secretary of housing and
urban development.

05:56.122 --> 06:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His brother, Joaquin Castro, is
a second-term
congressman from San Antonio.

06:01.728 --> 06:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both men are being floated as
potential next
heads of the Democratic National
Committee,

06:06.666 --> 06:08.201 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and both of them join us now.

06:08.235 --> 06:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome you to the
program.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
To Julian Castro first.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were -- I have to ask you,
you were clearly
on the list for Hillary Clinton
to consider

06:17.644 --> 06:19.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as her vice presidential running
mate.

06:19.613 --> 06:21.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You even did a tryout.

06:21.047 --> 06:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You went out and campaigned with
her.

06:22.449 --> 06:24.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She chose Tim Kaine.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Was he the best choice?

06:25.919 --> 06:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN CASTRO, U.S. Secretary of
Housing and
Urban Development: Oh, I think
he was.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She chose an excellent man.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He's a very good man.

06:30.624 --> 06:34.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's very well-prepared, having
been a governor,
a senator, sitting on the Senate
Foreign Relations

06:34.261 --> 06:36.062 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Committee.

06:36.096 --> 06:42.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Maybe most importantly, he
shares a broad,
inclusive view of America, so he
is going

06:42.202 --> 06:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a great vice presidential
nominee and
a great vice president to serve
her.

06:46.706 --> 06:51.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk about the
great inclusive
role, Congressman Castro.

06:51.378 --> 06:56.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that Tim Kaine, among
other great
qualities, speaks Spanish quite
fluently.

06:56.750 --> 07:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that brings me to the
question of what
two of the nation's leading
Latino politicians

07:01.288 --> 07:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think about how this campaign is
playing out,
and whether Texas is in play and
whether Latino

07:07.294 --> 07:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
voters are in play for Donald
Trump?

07:09.195 --> 07:10.964 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

07:10.997 --> 07:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAQUIN CASTRO (D), Texas: Well,
first, I
think that the Clinton campaign,
the Clinton-Kaine

07:12.699 --> 07:16.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign now, is doing an
excellent job connecting
with Latino voters.

07:16.102 --> 07:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have seen more permanent
residents in this
cycle wanting to become
citizens.

07:20.674 --> 07:24.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen more people,
including many Hispanics,
registering to vote.

07:24.044 --> 07:25.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so that's a good thing.

07:25.945 --> 07:31.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do believe that she will
get upwards
of 75 percent of the Latino vote
in this election.

07:31.584 --> 07:36.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact is Donald Trump is
trying to divide
Americans along racial and
ethnic lines, and

07:36.956 --> 07:38.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it's unhealthy for the country.

07:38.758 --> 07:43.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I say that as somebody who our
grandmother
came here from Mexico when she
was 6 years

07:43.229 --> 07:44.331 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
old.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And my grandmother was not a
murderer or a
rapist.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.968 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She was an orphan who came with
her younger
sister.

07:49.002 --> 07:55.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So to hear Donald Trump kick off
his campaign
with a slur against immigrants
was very hard

07:55.575 --> 07:57.644 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to take.

07:57.677 --> 08:03.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN CASTRO: He really has,
truly has motivated
the Latino community more than
any other presidential

08:03.283 --> 08:07.053 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
candidate, I think, in
generations, and motivated
them in a negative way.

08:07.087 --> 08:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so if the turnout rate in
2012 among Hispanics
was 48 percent, I expect it to
go at least

08:13.360 --> 08:15.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into the 50s for this election.

08:15.862 --> 08:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's going to, I think,
make a big difference
in places like Colorado, Nevada,
Florida,

08:20.934 --> 08:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even in places like Virginia,
with Northern
Virginia, as diverse as it is.

08:24.938 --> 08:29.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was a mistake for the
Republicans to nominate
someone who is seen in the
Hispanic community

08:29.876 --> 08:31.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as being against them.

08:31.644 --> 08:36.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
Congressman
Castro, you were quoted as
saying, I think,

08:36.783 --> 08:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just a couple of days ago that
part of the
vote that Donald Trump is
attracting has to

08:41.821 --> 08:43.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
do with a fear about the
economy.

08:43.456 --> 08:44.424 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOAQUIN CASTRO: Sure.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is Hillary
Clinton addressing
that?

08:47.394 --> 08:51.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know Vice President Joe Biden
said in an
interview I think just today
that the party

08:51.831 --> 08:55.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hasn't really spoken to those
Americans who
are worried about the economy.

08:55.735 --> 08:56.703 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

08:56.736 --> 08:57.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOAQUIN CASTRO: Yes.

08:57.737 --> 08:59.506 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
No, I think that she is.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama has brought this
country back
economically so far from where
we were when

09:03.176 --> 09:07.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he took office, and Hillary
Clinton is going
to take that baton and take us
even further.

09:07.747 --> 09:12.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what she's doing is what we
have done
for generations, which is really
build out

09:12.218 --> 09:14.587 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
an infrastructure of opportunity
in America.

09:14.621 --> 09:18.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means building great public
schools and
universities, a strong health
care system,

09:18.958 --> 09:22.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including keeping the Affordable
Care Act,
and then an economy that works
well for people

09:22.962 --> 09:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so that when they put in a hard
day's work,
they can support themselves and
their family

09:26.399 --> 09:28.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
members.

09:28.334 --> 09:31.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those are the fundamentals that
have distinguished
this nation from other nations
in the world.

09:31.171 --> 09:33.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she's going to build up
opportunity.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump is going to tear it
down if he
becomes president.

09:35.108 --> 09:39.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Julian Castro, I
want to ask you
about today's news, in which
Donald Trump

09:39.312 --> 09:45.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggested that maybe it might be
OK if Vladimir
Putin did some -- how do I put
this -- did

09:45.218 --> 09:48.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some checking into Hillary
Clinton's e-mails
and changed -- and shared them
with the world.

09:48.588 --> 09:51.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have, of course, been dealing
this week
with the DNC hack.

09:51.157 --> 09:55.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there has been a lot of
speculation, especially
among Democrats, that the
Russians are behind

09:56.029 --> 09:56.996 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What's your reaction to that?

09:58.865 --> 10:00.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN CASTRO: It's troubling,
to say the
least, first of all, that a
foreign government

10:00.867 --> 10:05.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be trying to influence the
outcome of
a national election in the
United States,

10:05.605 --> 10:10.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, secondly, that you have a
Republican
candidate who is embracing that,
effectively.

10:10.109 --> 10:17.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I especially cannot imagine
anyone who grew
up during the Cold War era
listening to Donald

10:17.183 --> 10:19.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump and saying, you know what,
that's a
guy that I want to support.

10:19.819 --> 10:21.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It makes zero sense.

10:21.588 --> 10:27.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's more evidence that he's
just unfit,
unprepared, just doesn't get it,
shouldn't

10:27.360 --> 10:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be the commander in chief of
this nation.

10:29.529 --> 10:35.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At the same time,
again, Congressman
Castro, it's clear not only are
Americans

10:35.335 --> 10:37.237 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
concerned, some of them,
concerned about the
economy.

10:37.270 --> 10:38.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are worried about security.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.472 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOAQUIN CASTRO: Right.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ISIS is out
there.

10:42.208 --> 10:46.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There have been a number of
shootings this
year for different parts of the
country.

10:46.312 --> 10:51.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, are we hearing from
this Democratic
Party at this convention what
Hillary Clinton's

10:51.284 --> 10:52.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plan is to do something about
it?

10:52.819 --> 10:53.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOAQUIN CASTRO: Yes, we
absolutely will tonight.

10:55.054 --> 10:56.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And she has been talking about
it on the campaign
trail.

10:56.890 --> 11:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's eminently more qualified
than Donald
Trump is on national security
and foreign

11:01.060 --> 11:02.295 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
policy.

11:02.328 --> 11:04.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You're right.

11:04.264 --> 11:08.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Terrorism has essentially become
a franchise
in the Middle East and North
Africa and increasingly

11:08.034 --> 11:09.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in other parts of the world.

11:09.802 --> 11:13.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Hillary Clinton is going to
make sure
that Americans are safe at home
and abroad.

11:13.373 --> 11:17.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me help our
viewers who are
confused just for a moment.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.678 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is Joaquin Castro.

11:18.711 --> 11:19.679 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is Julian Castro.

11:19.712 --> 11:20.914 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

11:20.947 --> 11:22.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOAQUIN CASTRO: I'm sorry that
we both wore
blue suits.

11:22.715 --> 11:24.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIAN CASTRO: I always said
that the way
to tell us apart is that, even
though we're

11:24.384 --> 11:26.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
twins, I'm a minute uglier than
he is.

11:26.152 --> 11:27.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, that's the shorthand.

11:27.820 --> 11:29.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We were hoping you
would wear
your congressional pin and help
us out.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But here's the thing.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.493 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You two have now been on the
scene for long
enough.

11:33.526 --> 11:38.197 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A San Antonio paper once wrote
that you were
double the talent and twice the
ambition.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I going to give you both the
chance to
be political analyst and tell
us, what does

11:41.801 --> 11:46.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton have to do in
the next four
months in order to win this
thing?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIAN CASTRO: She has got to do
what she's
been doing.

11:48.908 --> 11:53.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's going to have 30, 40
minutes tomorrow
night to connect with the
American people,

11:53.846 --> 11:59.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not in a 30-second ad, but to
lay out her
personal biography and why she's
qualified.

11:59.886 --> 12:06.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, she's taken 25
years of attacks
from the Republican spin
machine.

12:06.392 --> 12:11.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so she has the opportunity
tomorrow to
lay out the case, and I expect
her to do that.

12:12.031 --> 12:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With Tim Kaine, she has somebody
who can go
out and I think carry that
message well, including

12:16.636 --> 12:18.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to diverse communities.

12:18.404 --> 12:22.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're going to be a very
powerful ticket
together, and I expect that
she's going to

12:22.308 --> 12:23.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
win in November.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.277 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Joaquin
Castro...

12:24.310 --> 12:25.378 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOAQUIN CASTRO: And here's my
pin, by the
way.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.280 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm sorry...

12:27.313 --> 12:28.281 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

12:28.314 --> 12:29.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

12:29.549 --> 12:30.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How come you
didn't put that
on earlier?

12:30.316 --> 12:31.284 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:31.317 --> 12:33.152 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOAQUIN CASTRO: I was going to
do it later.

12:33.186 --> 12:36.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, at the same
time, Hillary
Clinton, yes, she's out there
making the case,

12:36.122 --> 12:39.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but there's this big trust gap,
if you will,
that she has.

12:39.659 --> 12:40.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does she address that?

12:40.693 --> 12:42.095 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

12:42.128 --> 12:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOAQUIN CASTRO: Well, I think
she's just got
to try to be herself.

12:43.896 --> 12:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's got to talk about the
issues that
Americans care about, which is
what she's

12:47.100 --> 12:48.801 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been doing.

12:48.835 --> 12:53.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As Julian said, this is somebody
who has faced
an incredible headwind, not just
when she

12:53.039 --> 12:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was on the national stage, but
even before
that, when she was first lady of
Arkansas

12:57.610 --> 13:02.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and her husband was governor,
so, really,
25 years in the national
spotlight, but 40

13:02.348 --> 13:04.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
years in politics.

13:04.651 --> 13:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's a lot of people running a
lot of negative
ads about you and trying to
define who you

13:08.921 --> 13:10.690 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are.

13:10.723 --> 13:14.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow night, she gets to tell
the American
people in an unvarnished way who
she is, what

13:15.028 --> 13:16.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
she believes and what she sees
for the country.

13:16.596 --> 13:17.597 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Julian Castro...

13:18.631 --> 13:19.599 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

GWEN IFILL: Joaquin Castro -- I
knew I was
going to do this.

13:22.168 --> 13:23.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joaquin Castro, Julian Castro,
thank you both
very much.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.837 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm glad you did
that, and
I didn't.

13:24.871 --> 13:25.838 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:25.872 --> 13:26.839 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOAQUIN CASTRO: Good to be with
you.

13:26.873 --> 13:27.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

13:27.874 --> 13:28.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you.

13:28.875 --> 13:32.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you both.

13:32.712 --> 13:37.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we turn to the final
installment of
our three-part series on Hillary
Clinton's

13:37.216 --> 13:39.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
life and legacy, which we have
just been talking
about.

13:39.686 --> 13:44.891 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Tonight, a look at her
post-first lady years,
from her run for the U.S.
Senate, to her hard-fought

13:44.924 --> 13:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
race for the White House in
2008, and finally
serving as America's top
diplomat.

13:50.096 --> 13:55.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We explore what drove Hillary
Clinton to carve
her own path in American
politics.

13:55.468 --> 14:01.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After supporting her husband's
political aspirations
for almost three decades,
Hillary Clinton

14:01.240 --> 14:03.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
decided it was her turn.

14:03.409 --> 14:09.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In February of 2000, while still
in the White
House, she threw her hat in the
race to replace

14:09.582 --> 14:13.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the longtime U.S. Senator from
New York Daniel
Patrick Moynihan.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REBECCA TRAISTER, Author, "All
The Single
Ladies: Unmarried Women and the
Rise of an

14:15.421 --> 14:18.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Independent Nation": Lots of
people assume
that Hillary Clinton has always
had this driving

14:18.825 --> 14:22.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
desire to be president, like her
entire life
has been shaped by an ambition
to be in the

14:22.595 --> 14:24.297 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
White House.

14:24.330 --> 14:26.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that may or may not be true,
but what
was certainly true was that it
wasn't something

14:26.466 --> 14:29.469 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that she could practically
envision for herself.

14:29.502 --> 14:35.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her version of the story is that
she didn't
consider taking on her own
independent political

14:35.374 --> 14:38.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
career until the end of her
husband's second
term in the White House.

14:38.778 --> 14:45.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Less than one
year later, with
the soon-to-be-former president
by her side,

14:45.752 --> 14:50.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton became the first first
lady elected
to public office.

14:50.723 --> 14:56.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former White House aide David
Gergen calls
Clinton's Senate years the
finest and probably

14:56.395 --> 14:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most satisfying years of her
public life.

14:59.098 --> 15:01.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN, Former White House
Aide: There's
a famous phrase about when you
go to the Senate,

15:02.001 --> 15:05.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are you going to be like a show
horse or a
workhorse?

15:05.705 --> 15:07.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she was very much the
workhorse.

15:07.373 --> 15:11.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She served on the
powerful
Senate Armed Services Committee,
worked to

15:11.811 --> 15:17.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extend health care to National
Guard members
and fought for expanded services
for veterans

15:17.583 --> 15:19.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and their families.

15:19.285 --> 15:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one vote in particular would
plague her
for years to come.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.158 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:25.191 --> 15:27.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D), New
York: This
is probably the hardest decision
I have ever

15:27.059 --> 15:29.262 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had to make.

15:29.295 --> 15:34.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Any vote that might lead to war
should be
hard.

15:34.801 --> 15:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I cast it with conviction.

15:36.569 --> 15:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton now calls
her 2002
vote to authorize the use of
military force

15:42.875 --> 15:44.811 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in Iraq a mistake.

15:44.844 --> 15:50.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in 2007, when she first set
her sights
on the presidency, she doubled
down on the

15:50.683 --> 15:52.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Iraq decision.

15:52.585 --> 15:55.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Reporter Indira Lakshmanan calls
it a political
miscalculation.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN, Journalist:
They thought
it was a coronation.

15:58.291 --> 16:04.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They thought that she was
definitely going
to have the Democratic
nomination in the bag.

16:04.063 --> 16:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so they were already, from
the beginning,
trying to have her run almost
like a general

16:08.501 --> 16:10.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
election candidate.

16:10.336 --> 16:15.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were trying to have her be
centrist or
even right of center, appeal to
the so-called

16:15.474 --> 16:17.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
security moms.

16:17.310 --> 16:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they were still in this kind
of post-9/11
mentality, without realizing
that certainly

16:22.548 --> 16:26.185 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats were so disenchanted
over the Iraq
War.

16:26.219 --> 16:32.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The 2008 campaign
quickly ran
into something else that caught
them off-guard,

16:32.124 --> 16:39.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a political newcomer named
Barack Obama, who
pulled off a surprise win in the
Iowa caucuses.

16:39.365 --> 16:45.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton's loss there led to a
memorable encounter
with a voter ahead of the New
Hampshire primary.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: My question is very
personal.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you do it?

16:49.075 --> 16:53.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I
couldn't do it if
I just didn't passionately
believe it was

16:53.079 --> 16:55.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the right thing to do.

16:55.181 --> 17:01.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You know, I have so many
opportunities from
this country.

17:01.287 --> 17:03.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I just don't want to see us fall
backwards.

17:03.823 --> 17:08.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: It was at
that moment that
she showed her humanity and her
vulnerability,

17:08.861 --> 17:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a lot of people credit that
with turning
the vote in New Hampshire around
for her.

17:12.865 --> 17:18.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton went on
to win New
Hampshire, along with 22 other
states.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
However, it wasn't enough.

17:20.206 --> 17:25.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Deeply disappointed, she waited
until after
the last Democratic primary in
June to throw

17:25.711 --> 17:27.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
her support to Obama.

17:27.580 --> 17:34.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: I move
Senator Barack
Obama of Illinois be selected by
this convention

17:34.387 --> 17:40.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by acclimation as the nominee of
the Democratic
Party for president of the
United States.

17:40.593 --> 17:42.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

17:42.461 --> 17:47.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But then she
campaigned hard
for him, and soon after his
November victory,

17:47.233 --> 17:52.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she agreed to become his
secretary of state.

17:52.605 --> 17:58.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Almost right away, Clinton
appeared more natural
as the nation's chief diplomat
than she had

17:58.444 --> 18:00.279 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been as a candidate.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: As soon as
she had a job
to do and was a Cabinet member
of the United

18:04.016 --> 18:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States, she seemed completely
relaxed and
completely focused on doing that
job.

18:08.721 --> 18:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: She worked to
gain the respect
of both foreign allies and
adversaries.

18:13.960 --> 18:18.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: Even when
there were times
and places where people were not
happy about

18:18.698 --> 18:24.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States foreign policy and
were not
thrilled to see her, she didn't
back down

18:24.136 --> 18:26.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and apologize for U.S. policies.

18:26.772 --> 18:33.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was interesting to see her,
even in difficult
situations sort of -- do a sort
of, like,

18:33.879 --> 18:35.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
jujitsu.

18:35.781 --> 18:40.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But with many
complex global
challenges, it was also a time
of disappointments

18:40.853 --> 18:42.088 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and failures.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.623 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: She didn't
get a Middle
East peace deal.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She didn't get an Iran nuclear
agreement.

18:46.459 --> 18:50.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was something that happened
under her
successor, John Kerry.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.698 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She didn't bring an end to the
Syrian war.

18:52.732 --> 18:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One wonders whether some of that
is a very
high bar to which to hold her
to, because

18:58.170 --> 19:01.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some of those seem like they're
intractable
problems.

19:01.140 --> 19:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton was also
a driving
force in the White House
decision to militarily

19:06.846 --> 19:11.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
support the overthrow of Libyan
dictator Moammar
Gadhafi.

19:11.817 --> 19:17.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama now calls his
administration's
lack of planning for what came
next the biggest

19:17.123 --> 19:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mistake of his presidency.

19:21.660 --> 19:28.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Libya spiraled into chaos, and
one year later,
the American Consulate in
Benghazi, Libya,

19:28.067 --> 19:29.602 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was attacked.

19:29.635 --> 19:34.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. Ambassador Christopher
Stevens and three
other Americans were killed.

19:34.940 --> 19:39.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans slammed Clinton for
not providing
the outpost with sufficient
security.

19:39.145 --> 19:42.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: What
difference, at
this point, does it make?

19:42.548 --> 19:46.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
INDIRA LAKSHMANAN: We can all
Monday-morning
quarterback, look back at it
now, and say,

19:46.585 --> 19:48.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was that a good decision, was it
not?

19:48.687 --> 19:53.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, had tens of
thousands of
people been slaughtered in Libya
because the

19:53.626 --> 19:59.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
United States, France, and
Britain, and NATO
had not come in, you know, the
situation could've

19:59.698 --> 20:01.634 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
been worse.

20:01.667 --> 20:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Clinton stepped
down from the
State Department in February
2013, amid speculation

20:06.605 --> 20:09.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she was readying another run for
the White
House.

20:09.442 --> 20:15.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID GERGEN: I think what
motivates her is
to be a transformational woman
leader.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.216 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I think she feels that.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's been trained for this all
her life.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's been preparing for it.

20:20.152 --> 20:23.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, talented men have
stepped forward
and had that opportunity.

20:23.189 --> 20:27.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Time for a woman to be a leader.

20:27.326 --> 20:31.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: With that, we turn
to syndicated
columnist Mark Shields, New York
Times columnist

20:31.864 --> 20:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Brooks, and Amy Walter of
The Cook Political
Report, who are also joining us
around the

20:36.268 --> 20:40.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
table each night for many long
hours to talk
about our live convention
coverage.

20:41.006 --> 20:42.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to start with you, David
Brooks.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.846 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We saw Bill Clinton last night
begin to make
the case.

20:46.879 --> 20:50.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, Donald Trump seemed to
jump back into
the spotlight.

20:50.149 --> 20:51.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's going on here?

20:51.917 --> 20:54.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, he can't be
out of the
spotlight, and he's clearly
decided that bad

20:54.553 --> 20:56.789 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
publicity is better than no
publicity.

20:56.822 --> 21:00.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he did something -- when
you think
about it, we're so inured to
what Donald Trump

21:00.593 --> 21:05.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is about to do that, if you step
back, what
he did today was kind of
amazing.

21:05.331 --> 21:08.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It wasn't really treasonous, but
it sort of
felt sort of that way, I mean,
calling on

21:08.767 --> 21:13.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Russians to release
documents and break
into -- or presuming they have
them from Hillary

21:13.272 --> 21:14.240 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Clinton's server.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's just mind-boggling,
frankly.

21:16.942 --> 21:20.012 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if it was done in a normal
political year,
it would be a career-ender.

21:20.045 --> 21:22.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But that's clearly not the case.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what he's done is, he's
stolen the
spotlight.

21:25.050 --> 21:28.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And now the Democratic
Convention is, on a
lot of screens, the small
screen, and Donald

21:28.921 --> 21:30.456 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Trump is the big screen.

21:30.489 --> 21:32.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You agree, Amy
Walter, Donald
Trump's stolen the spotlight?

21:32.958 --> 21:36.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: Well,
you know, this convention
tonight was already

21:37.029 --> 21:39.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be focused on national
security.

21:39.131 --> 21:43.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's been a lot of talk
both in conservative
media -- and we talked about it,
too -- that

21:43.836 --> 21:48.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with all the crises going on
around the world,
and it seems like daily or
weekly attacks

21:48.707 --> 21:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Europe, that the fact that
this convention
has not yet brought that up has
been glaring.

21:55.181 --> 21:57.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we now know we have Leon
Panetta tonight.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.718 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We're going to have the
president talk about
this.

21:59.752 --> 22:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those issues were already going
to be in the
fore.

22:02.121 --> 22:06.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the question with Donald
Trump, look,
I completely agree with David.

22:06.559 --> 22:10.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is now an emoji going
around -- I don't
know if you have seen it -- that
goes, like,

22:10.362 --> 22:12.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like, does it matter?

22:12.097 --> 22:13.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does this mean?

22:13.098 --> 22:14.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

22:14.900 --> 22:16.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And on the one hand,
you would
say, absolutely, that would be a
career-ender,

22:16.735 --> 22:20.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is the end of the campaign,
this is where,
right, you're talking about
temperament, et

22:20.105 --> 22:21.907 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cetera.

22:21.941 --> 22:24.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the other hand, you have a
candidate in
Hillary Clinton who has problems
with e-mails.

22:25.010 --> 22:27.713 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the issue of a server being
hacked is
a real big deal.

22:27.746 --> 22:33.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And having the focus once again
on Hillary
Clinton's e-mail server and its
vulnerability

22:33.152 --> 22:34.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is not good for Hillary Clinton
either.

22:34.954 --> 22:38.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, Mark Shields,
tonight, we
have the president of these
United States,

22:38.490 --> 22:43.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have Joe Biden, his vice
president, we
have Tim Kaine, who was just
nominated this

22:43.562 --> 22:44.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
afternoon to be vice president.

22:44.797 --> 22:48.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is it possible really for
anybody to steal
that spotlight?

22:48.200 --> 22:53.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think
Donald Trump has
absolutely dominated the story,
for the very

22:53.939 --> 22:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simple reason, the Republicans
have enjoyed
historically and recently an
advantage over

22:58.844 --> 23:03.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Democrats on national
security, sort of
national muscularity issues.

23:03.082 --> 23:10.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a time, as Amy described,
of increasing
concern, anxiety in this country
about security,

23:10.589 --> 23:17.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the well-being of people's
lives, Donald
Trump, I think, in strange way,
frittered

23:17.229 --> 23:25.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it away, what was Republicans --
by appearing
to be more defensive and
supportive of Putin

23:25.271 --> 23:27.473 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
than he is of his own United
States.

23:27.506 --> 23:34.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, any time
e-mails and hacking
are in the story, it is not good
for Secretary

23:34.079 --> 23:36.815 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton or candidate Clinton or
nominee Clinton.

23:36.849 --> 23:41.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, David
Brooks, with Donald
Trump hanging out there and all
the other

23:41.820 --> 23:47.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republicans who are just
salivating waiting
for there to be a big mistake, a
big, frankly,

23:47.426 --> 23:52.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
blowup out of this convention,
what does Hillary
Clinton need to do tonight and
tomorrow night?

23:52.564 --> 23:53.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would say this is beginning to
feel like
a successful convention.

23:55.301 --> 23:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The first couple of hours were
rocky.

23:57.436 --> 24:01.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then we had a sort of transition
the first
night, and then Michelle Obama's
triumphant

24:01.206 --> 24:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
address, and last night, Bill
Clinton's very,
very successful address.

24:04.343 --> 24:06.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I imagine Barack Obama will be
very good tonight.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I imagine Kaine will be very
personable.

24:08.480 --> 24:12.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's beginning to feel
like a successful
conventional convention.

24:12.751 --> 24:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the thing we have to doubt
is, does that
matter anymore?

24:16.855 --> 24:18.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are the rules so different?

24:18.791 --> 24:22.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Has basically the transformation
of society
changed the rules?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The unhappiness along class
lines?

24:24.663 --> 24:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Divisions along racial and
ethnic lines?

24:26.398 --> 24:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Have all the rules gone out?

24:28.334 --> 24:31.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so we're witnessing a
fundamental transformation
of how politics is done, how the
divisions

24:32.004 --> 24:33.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in society is done.

24:33.672 --> 24:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so hitting the normal
Democratic buttons
may not be enough anymore.

24:37.076 --> 24:39.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that is the open
question that
we will face in the weeks ahead.

24:40.012 --> 24:41.914 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:41.947 --> 24:46.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And then add on top
of that historic
disapproval ratings for both of
these candidates.

24:46.652 --> 24:51.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what success normally
would be is a
bump coming out of this, and we
have seen

24:51.957 --> 24:56.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in recent years that the bumps
have gotten
smaller and smaller as, again,
the media landscape

24:56.695 --> 24:58.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has changed.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, for Hillary
Clinton, just to
move her unfavorable ratings a
couple of points

25:01.967 --> 25:04.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be success, but she's
still going to
be underwater.

25:05.003 --> 25:08.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I don't think most
Democratic strategists
if they were honest would tell
you they don't

25:08.974 --> 25:11.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe she's ever going to be
in positive
territory.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, again, is it a success?

25:13.112 --> 25:14.747 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
On paper, sure.

25:14.780 --> 25:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But is it going to move the
normal -- the
numbers normally like we would
see?

25:19.585 --> 25:20.519 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Unlikely.

25:20.552 --> 25:21.653 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:21.687 --> 25:23.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Mark, yes,
weigh in on
this.

25:23.489 --> 25:26.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, no, the
argument that
always exists in campaigns, are
we going to

25:26.625 --> 25:28.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be a campaign of mobilization?

25:28.260 --> 25:32.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is, are we going to up the
numbers of
our own base voters?

25:32.331 --> 25:37.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this case, Democrats, it
would be minority
voters, younger voters and
women, especially

25:37.136 --> 25:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Hillary Clinton's case, to
try and reconstruct
the Barack Obama model and win
on that.

25:44.476 --> 25:49.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or do you go into persuasion,
which is to
try and reach out and reach the
disaffected

25:49.648 --> 25:51.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republicans?

25:51.383 --> 25:55.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I see no effort to make it
legitimate for
Republicans to come over and to
find what

25:55.521 --> 25:59.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have in common, especially
Republicans
who are alienated, threatened
and just turned

25:59.525 --> 26:01.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
off by Donald Trump.

26:01.260 --> 26:03.629 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think Michael Bloomberg
is the answer
to that.

26:03.662 --> 26:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, that's not exactly your
garden variety
suburban Republican.

26:08.434 --> 26:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He left the Republican Party for
his own devices
and his own interests.

26:12.738 --> 26:19.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think the Democrats, it
ties Hillary
Clinton very much to Barack
Obama, because

26:19.678 --> 26:23.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David has talked about she has
to talk about
change and how she's going to be
different.

26:23.148 --> 26:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at the same time, it's an
election of
continuity.

26:26.452 --> 26:31.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has to be different, but it
has to be she's
trying to get Barack Obama's
constituency

26:31.390 --> 26:33.892 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
energized and out in this
election.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Mark Shields, I want
to ask you
another question.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If we time, everybody can weigh
in.

26:37.729 --> 26:42.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Joe Biden, tonight, in many
ways, this
is his farewell turn, at least
at a national

26:42.568 --> 26:43.836 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
convention.

26:43.869 --> 26:45.070 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tell us about that.

26:45.103 --> 26:49.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Joe Biden, it's --
what it might
have been?

26:49.508 --> 26:55.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, 1988 -- elected to the
Senate in '72
at the age of 29 -- 1988, a
serious candidate,

26:55.914 --> 27:03.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stumbled, fell on a plagiarism
charge, ironically,
and then bounced back, was a
very successful

27:03.055 --> 27:09.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senator, with friends across the
aisle, becomes
vice president, was sought out
as a possible,

27:09.061 --> 27:15.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very likely candidate to succeed
Barack Obama,
in spite of his age and the
personal tragedy

27:15.667 --> 27:19.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of his son Beau's death, and
being a grandfather.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But he is a -- Joe is a
throwback.

27:21.540 --> 27:26.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joe is a throwback to the time
when senators
knew each other on the other
side of the aisle,

27:26.411 --> 27:30.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when they traveled across the
world together,
when they knew each other's
children, when

27:30.649 --> 27:32.184 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their kids went to school.

27:32.217 --> 27:36.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a different Washington,
and Joe Biden
embodies it at its best.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will talk about
it some more
later tonight.

27:38.023 --> 27:39.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Joe Biden
talks about that
a lot.

27:39.958 --> 27:40.926 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

27:40.959 --> 27:41.994 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, all right,
thank you all.

27:42.027 --> 27:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will see you a lot of you
later.

27:44.296 --> 27:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And starting at, speaking of
which, 8:00 p.m.
Eastern, David, Mark and Amy
will be back

27:49.268 --> 27:53.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for our special coverage,
NPR-"PBS NewsHour."

27:53.839 --> 28:00.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're all part of this coverage
of the Democratic
Convention here in Philadelphia
-- Hari.

28:00.746 --> 28:02.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks, Judy.

28:02.447 --> 28:05.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But, for now, we're
going to back
to Hari Sreenivasan in
Washington.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.818 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thank you,
Gwen.

28:06.852 --> 28:09.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The man
who tried
to assassinate President Ronald
Reagan will

28:09.988 --> 28:12.257 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
go free as early as next week.

A federal judge ruled today that
John Hinckley
Jr. no longer poses a risk.

28:16.562 --> 28:19.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hinckley shot and wounded
President Reagan
in March of 1981.

28:19.965 --> 28:25.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He was found not guilty by
reason of insanity,
and sent to a Washington mental
hospital.

28:25.203 --> 28:31.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's now 61, and already spends
17 days a
month at his mother's home in
Virginia.

28:31.043 --> 28:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, the Islamic State
group has claimed
a massive truck bombing that
killed at least

28:35.647 --> 28:37.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
48 people and wounded dozens
today.

28:37.349 --> 28:42.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The target was a crowded
district in a Kurdish-held
city near the Turkish border.

28:42.321 --> 28:46.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thick smoke poured into the air
in the aftermath
of the blast, and the resulting
fires set

28:46.625 --> 28:49.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
off additional explosions.

28:49.261 --> 28:53.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christian and Muslim leaders in
France called
for solidarity today, after
Islamic State

28:53.198 --> 28:55.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
attackers killed an elderly
Catholic priest.

28:56.001 --> 29:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The leader of the main mosque in
Paris said
all French Muslims condemn such
acts.

29:00.739 --> 29:04.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, mourners left flowers
and lit candles
at a makeshift memorial.

29:04.876 --> 29:08.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Pope Francis weighed in,
saying -- quote
-- "The world is at war."

29:08.547 --> 29:13.652 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): When I speak of
war, I talk about

29:13.685 --> 29:16.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
real war, not a religious war,
no.

29:16.388 --> 29:20.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a war of interests, a
war for money,
a war for resources of nature
and a war to

29:20.993 --> 29:22.294 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
control people.

29:22.327 --> 29:23.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is war.

29:23.862 --> 29:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anyone who thinks I am talking
of a religious
war, no.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
All the religions want peace.

29:28.834 --> 29:33.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The pope spoke
before arriving
in Krakow, Poland, for World
Youth Day celebrations.

29:33.839 --> 29:38.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds of thousands of young
people are
expected to attend, under heavy
security.

29:38.510 --> 29:43.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The crackdown in Turkey has
claimed more victims;
47 journalists were detained
today.

29:43.482 --> 29:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And state media reports dozens
of newspapers
and TV stations were closed.

29:48.487 --> 29:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government says it is
rooting out supporters
of an opposition cleric accused
of fomenting

29:52.591 --> 29:54.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
this month's failed coup.

29:54.660 --> 29:58.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, the
Federal Reserve
left interest rates unchanged
again, but it

29:58.330 --> 30:02.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
also said near-risks to the
economy have lessened.

30:02.267 --> 30:05.871 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That leaves open the possibility
of raising
rates later this year.

30:05.904 --> 30:07.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The news did little for Wall
Street.

30:07.339 --> 30:10.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost a point
to close at 18472.

30:10.409 --> 30:15.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 29 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped two.

30:15.947 --> 30:21.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And officials in Hiroshima,
Japan, are the
latest to object to the
smartphone game sensation

30:21.086 --> 30:22.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Pokemon GO.

30:22.954 --> 30:27.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say players are descending
on the atomic
bomb memorial park, and asking
that the site

30:27.959 --> 30:29.795 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be removed from the game.

30:29.828 --> 30:34.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want it done before August
6, the anniversary
of the U.S. attack that
destroyed much of

30:34.332 --> 30:45.077 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the city.

30:45.110 --> 30:50.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a surprise move today,
prosecutors in Baltimore
dropped all remaining charges
against three

30:50.182 --> 30:52.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
police officers in the Freddie
Gray case.

30:52.818 --> 30:57.889 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Gray died of spinal cord
injuries last year,
after being arrested and
transported unsecured

30:57.923 --> 30:59.458 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in a police van.

30:59.491 --> 31:04.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His death sparked widespread
protests, looting
and arson across Baltimore.

31:04.563 --> 31:09.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prosecutors charged six officers
connected
to the arrest, all of whom
pleaded not guilty.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first trial resulted in a
hung jury and
mistrial.

31:12.938 --> 31:15.440 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three others ended in separate
acquittals.

31:15.474 --> 31:19.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Baltimore state's attorney
Marilyn Mosby called
today's decision agonizing.

31:19.377 --> 31:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARILYN MOSBY, Baltimore State's
Attorney:
We stand by the medical
examiner's determination

31:23.915 --> 31:28.053 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Freddie Gray's death was a
homicide.

31:28.086 --> 31:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, after much thought and
prayer, it
has become clear to me that
without being

31:33.759 --> 31:38.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to work with an independent
investigatory
agency from the very start,
without having

31:38.597 --> 31:43.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a say in the election of whether
our cases
proceed in front of a judge or a
jury, without

31:43.635 --> 31:50.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communal oversight of policing
in this country,
without real substantive reforms
to the current

31:50.408 --> 31:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criminal justice, we could try
this case 100
times, and cases just like it,
and we would

31:57.549 --> 31:59.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
still end up with the same
result.

31:59.317 --> 32:02.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: After she
spoke, the head
of the police union in Baltimore
called Ms.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mosby's comments -- quote --
"outrageous."

32:05.023 --> 32:08.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lawyers for the police officers
had argued
that their client's actions
during the Gray

32:08.927 --> 32:10.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
arrest were justified.

32:10.462 --> 32:12.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For more on all this, we are
again joined
by Debbie Hines.

32:12.998 --> 32:17.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is a former Baltimore
prosecutor who today
practices law in Washington,
D.C.

32:17.335 --> 32:20.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
First, were you surprised by the
decision
this morning?

32:20.372 --> 32:23.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES, Former Baltimore
Prosecutor:
Oh, I think everybody was
surprised by the

32:23.475 --> 32:28.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision this morning, myself
included, because,
as it looked, Officer Miller's
case was going

32:28.446 --> 32:32.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to start to trial this week, and
then, of
course, Officer Porter would
have been tried

32:32.784 --> 32:34.686 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
later, and Sergeant Alicia
White.

32:34.719 --> 32:38.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I don't think anybody saw it
coming, but
I think it's a good move on the
part of the

32:38.623 --> 32:43.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
state's attorney, if she
evaluated it and
came to the determination that
there is no

32:43.228 --> 32:46.898 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
new, new evidence she can put
forth in any
of the cases.

32:46.932 --> 32:51.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And like she said, if she tried
it 100 more
before Judge Barry Williams, she
would get

32:51.169 --> 32:52.137 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the same result.

32:52.170 --> 32:53.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it was a good decision.

32:53.505 --> 32:56.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, is this a
way for her
to cut her losses?

32:56.341 --> 32:59.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: I don't want to
word it that
way.

32:59.644 --> 33:03.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that the way I would
word it is -- because
we don't look at it that way.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, in terms of prosecution,
it's not
a game.

33:06.585 --> 33:10.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a baseball game or a
football game,
in deciding what you are going
to do to cut

33:10.422 --> 33:11.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your losses.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.692 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's real-life criminal
prosecution.

33:13.725 --> 33:19.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that what she
decided is not cutting
her losses, but hopefully having
her team

33:19.064 --> 33:24.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and other members evaluate, and
just determining
that there wasn't any way that
they were going

33:24.336 --> 33:28.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to get a conviction based on the
evidence
that they have from the police
officers.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there
anything else that
can happen to the officers now?

33:31.610 --> 33:33.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is there any sort of
administrative discipline?

33:34.012 --> 33:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: Oh, that's a good
question,
because, yes, the officers are
going to be

33:39.317 --> 33:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reviewed administratively.

33:41.119 --> 33:45.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's a whole different
process and a
much more informal process, but
not as high

33:45.056 --> 33:49.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a standard process as proving
criminal
guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

33:49.794 --> 33:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, already, the officers,
although they -- the
charges are being dropped in all
of the cases,

33:55.433 --> 34:01.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they still can face suspension
or firing or
any other type of sanction that
the Baltimore

34:01.673 --> 34:03.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
City Police Department would
determine.

34:03.575 --> 34:08.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, interesting enough, it will
not be the
Baltimore City Police Department
that is going

34:08.380 --> 34:10.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to make the decision.

34:10.215 --> 34:14.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because of the high-profile-ness
of the case,
it has actually been assigned to
Howard County

34:14.953 --> 34:17.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in Maryland, and I believe
Montgomery County.

34:17.756 --> 34:21.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of those or both of those
jurisdictions
together are going to be looking
from the

34:21.459 --> 34:25.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
start all of the evidence that
may be against
the officers to see if there was
any misconduct.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But is there
enough then?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As you say, there are separate
standards.

34:31.136 --> 34:35.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is a possibility then
that they could
face administrative discipline,
but it just

34:35.407 --> 34:38.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- there wasn't enough evidence
for a criminal
conviction?

34:38.743 --> 34:40.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEBBIE HINES: Exactly.

34:40.445 --> 34:43.348 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, there have been
officers.

34:43.381 --> 34:51.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think there have been
approximately 75 officers
in recent years that had been
fired for misconduct

34:51.656 --> 34:53.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in office.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, we know that
there weren't
criminal charges that were
brought in most

34:55.727 --> 34:59.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of those cases, because we're
seeing how it
shakes out with these officers.

34:59.397 --> 35:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's a different standard.

35:01.099 --> 35:05.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The criminal standard is the
highest of high
standards, beyond a reasonable
doubt.

35:05.603 --> 35:11.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in an administrative hearing
or administrative
situation, it's just whether
they violated

35:11.076 --> 35:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any of the orders that the
police -- the police
department had.

35:15.580 --> 35:21.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But what about
the process
of transporting people from a
crime scene

35:21.252 --> 35:22.220 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to jail?

35:22.253 --> 35:23.922 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is that changing?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Has that changed?

35:25.757 --> 35:29.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems that Baltimore has had
a history
of settling lawsuits for this
very practice.

35:29.995 --> 35:32.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DEBBIE HINES: Exactly.

35:32.163 --> 35:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been difficult to prove in
a criminal
court of law what is a rough
ride, but there

35:39.004 --> 35:43.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has been change already as a
result of the
Freddie Gray case.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.643 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that is good news.

35:45.677 --> 35:49.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the police commissioner in
Baltimore has
determined that there are going
to be videos

35:49.481 --> 35:53.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
put in all of the police vans,
so hopefully
they will be operating and we
can exactly

35:53.585 --> 35:57.222 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
see what actually happens inside
the van.

35:57.255 --> 36:02.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a general order that
has already
been presented by the Baltimore
city police

36:02.193 --> 36:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chief to all of his entire force
that, from
this point forward, the
detainees, prisoners,

36:08.566 --> 36:15.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they must be seat-belted, they
cannot be lying
face down on the floor of the
van handcuffed

36:15.840 --> 36:17.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and shackled.

36:17.542 --> 36:22.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, lastly, one of the
things that is
going to be a definite change is
that, if

36:22.147 --> 36:29.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a prisoner asks for a medic, the
officers
must at least get a medic, a
paralegal, or

36:29.154 --> 36:30.588 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have the person sent to a
hospital.

36:30.622 --> 36:34.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally
,any impact
on Ms. Mosby's career?

36:34.759 --> 36:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: She's a political
public servant.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.632 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She's elected.

36:40.665 --> 36:45.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She just had started, as a
matter of fact,
in January of 2015, before these
cases.

36:45.970 --> 36:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so it's too early to say
what will happen
with her career.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.810 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, she definitely has a
very promising
career.

36:51.843 --> 36:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I would hope that the
citizens of Baltimore
wouldn't judge her by the
actions of what

36:57.415 --> 37:02.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happened in these cases, because
just bringing
the cases, Hari, is going to
bring about some

37:02.654 --> 37:04.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
change in Baltimore City
policing.

37:04.456 --> 37:08.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Debbie Hines,
thanks so much for joining us
today.

37:08.159 --> 37:09.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBBIE HINES: Thank you, Hari.

37:09.461 --> 37:23.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: NASA is trying
to fight
fire with fire in space.

37:23.608 --> 37:27.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Researchers are conducting new
experiments
that would limit fire danger for
future space

37:27.812 --> 37:29.614 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
travel.

37:29.647 --> 37:31.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien has our
encore look at this story, part
of our weekly

37:31.950 --> 37:34.552 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
series on The Leading Edge of
science and
technology.

37:34.586 --> 37:37.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN GRUNSFELD, NASA: We are
crossing an international
boundary.

37:37.789 --> 37:45.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are on the U.S. side now, and
now we are
on the Russian Mir space
station.

37:45.830 --> 37:51.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: By 1997, the
Russian space
station Mir was 11 years old and
showing its

37:51.136 --> 37:52.971 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
age.

37:53.004 --> 37:57.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
During the fifth shuttle mission
to the station,
astronaut John Grunsfeld
documented the warren

37:57.442 --> 38:02.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of modules brimming with a
disorienting maze
of cables, hoses and trash.

38:02.881 --> 38:04.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN GRUNSFELD: I feel like I am
exploring
a cave.

38:04.716 --> 38:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Can you imagine
being in a
fire here?

38:09.220 --> 38:14.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
U.S. astronaut Jerry Linenger
lived that nightmare
on February 23, 1997.

38:14.058 --> 38:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER, NASA: The fire
was basically
in this region here with the
flames shooting

38:22.267 --> 38:24.035 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
across this way.

38:24.068 --> 38:26.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The source was a
canister filled
with chemicals designed to
generate oxygen.

38:26.404 --> 38:31.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER: You have got a
two- or three-foot
flame, blowtorch-like in
intensity, sparks

38:31.976 --> 38:33.044 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
flying off the end of it.

38:33.077 --> 38:35.079 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It looks like a hundred
sparklers all at once.

38:35.113 --> 38:39.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Linenger and his
Russian crewmates
donned masks and frantically
fought the fire.

38:39.751 --> 38:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER: The fire took
about 14 minutes
total, and 14 minutes is a long
time with

38:45.623 --> 38:49.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a roaring fire and a blackout
from the smoke,
and no place to go.

38:49.727 --> 38:53.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if it were any bigger, I'm
pretty darn
sure we would have lost that
spacecraft.

38:53.731 --> 38:57.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: For NASA
scientists and engineers,
it was a big wakeup call.

38:57.569 --> 39:00.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY RUFF, NASA Glenn Research
Center: One
of the things that you learn is,
we really

39:00.605 --> 39:02.774 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
didn't have a way to put that
fire out.

39:02.807 --> 39:08.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Gary Ruff is a
scientist at
NASA's Glenn Research Center in
Cleveland,

39:08.947 --> 39:10.748 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ohio.

39:10.782 --> 39:14.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is where the agency does
most of its
research on fires in the
weightless environment

39:14.252 --> 39:16.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of space called microgravity.

39:16.154 --> 39:22.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY RUFF: They used water foam
fire extinguishers
that they had, but that probably
at most just

39:22.694 --> 39:25.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of cooled everything else
around it and
kept it from spreading.

39:25.763 --> 39:31.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Ruff leads a team
that is trying
to learn more about big fires in
space.

39:31.402 --> 39:36.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the plan is to deliberately
set one and
watch what happens, really.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.376 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, so what are we
looking at here,
David?

39:38.409 --> 39:40.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID URBAN, NASA: This is the
Saffire-III
module.

39:40.278 --> 39:46.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: David Urban is
the principal
investigator for the Spacecraft
Fire Experiment,

39:46.150 --> 39:47.552 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or Saffire.

39:47.585 --> 39:52.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We spoke beside Saffire-III,
slated for launch
at the end of 2016.

39:52.590 --> 39:59.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The one currently in space,
Saffire-I, is
an identical box strapped inside
a cargo ship.

39:59.297 --> 40:03.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Once the craft makes its
delivery, departs
and is a safe distance from the
International

40:03.968 --> 40:09.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Space Station, it will be time
to light the
fire inside Saffire.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fire on a spacecraft is a pretty
scary thing,
isn't it?

40:11.109 --> 40:12.944 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID URBAN: It's a very small
space.

40:12.977 --> 40:16.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you would normally tolerate
in your house
are completely non-tolerable in
a spacecraft.

40:17.015 --> 40:22.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: NASA's most
painful fire lesson
came in 1967, when three
astronauts were killed

40:22.887 --> 40:27.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
during a countdown test on the
launchpad in
Florida.

40:27.692 --> 40:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It prompted a lot of changes in
spacecraft
designs.

40:30.995 --> 40:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The agency took great pains to
eliminate flammable
materials wherever possible.

40:36.401 --> 40:39.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But fires in microgravity are
harder to predict.

40:39.404 --> 40:43.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of unanswered questions
about fires
in microgravity, right?

40:43.141 --> 40:45.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID URBAN: A huge number.

40:45.143 --> 40:48.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Basically, we don't really know
how fast they
will grow or how large they will
get, nor

40:48.379 --> 40:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do we really understand, given
the way the
spacecraft are built, how
quickly that temperature

40:54.719 --> 40:56.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and pressure rise will be a
problem for the
crew.

40:56.521 --> 41:01.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: On the ground,
when you light
a candle, the heat of the flame
melts the

41:01.693 --> 41:02.727 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
wax.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.961 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It pulls up into the wick.

41:03.995 --> 41:07.665 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It vaporizes, and that is what
fuels the flame.

41:07.699 --> 41:12.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So if gravity is pushing
everything downward,
what is it that makes a flame go
upwards?

41:13.004 --> 41:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, as it turns out, the flame
is surrounded
by higher-pressure air.

41:17.875 --> 41:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And gravity is pulling down
colder, denser
air, meaning there is more
pressure at the

41:22.980 --> 41:24.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
base of the flame.

41:24.582 --> 41:26.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what causes the flame to
go up.

41:26.718 --> 41:27.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's buoyancy.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.422 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the same thing that keeps a
boat afloat.

41:31.456 --> 41:37.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In space, when the gravity meter
reads zero,
the cool, dense air no longer
flows downward.

41:37.195 --> 41:41.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead, the air puts equal
pressure on the
flame from all directions.

41:41.599 --> 41:43.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The end result?

41:43.201 --> 41:45.370 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Candle flames in space are
spherical.

41:45.403 --> 41:50.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Over the years, NASA has
conducted several
combustion experiments on small
samples of

41:50.875 --> 41:57.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
paper, cloth, plastics and
hydrocarbons in
special chambers on Skylab, the
space shuttle

41:57.382 --> 41:58.483 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and station.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID URBAN: But they have all
been really
small.

42:00.385 --> 42:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so one of the open questions
that we have
got is how large that flame can
get.

42:04.389 --> 42:08.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: During the
Saffire-I test,
they will set fire to a piece of
cloth just

42:08.693 --> 42:09.994 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like this.

42:10.027 --> 42:14.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's 75 percent cotton, the rest
fiberglass
to give it strength.

42:14.565 --> 42:19.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They will analyze the fire with
sensors that
measure temperature, airflow,
velocity, carbon

42:19.904 --> 42:22.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dioxide, and oxygen.

42:22.039 --> 42:26.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But their main instrument will
be two cameras
and some controlled lighting.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The images in the data will be
beamed back
to Earth.

42:29.580 --> 42:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When the experiment is done, the
cargo ship
will be will be guided to its
own fiery end

42:34.118 --> 42:35.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
over the South Pacific.

42:35.987 --> 42:41.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Saffire team is planning
three more experiments,
for a total of six.

42:41.592 --> 42:47.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fires will grow larger,
eventually simulating
a full-fledged spacecraft fire
scenario.

42:47.064 --> 42:52.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY RUFF: Since we're going to
release the
gases into the cabin, we want to
have some

42:52.303 --> 42:56.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
material there that the crew
would have to
help clean up after a fire.

42:56.641 --> 42:59.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Jerry Linenger
would certainly
not disagree with that.

42:59.444 --> 43:00.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER: Packing up.

43:00.878 --> 43:02.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Time to head home.

43:02.647 --> 43:07.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Linenger made it
home safe
and sound after all, but by the
skin of his

43:08.019 --> 43:08.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
teeth.

43:09.020 --> 43:10.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JERRY LINENGER: People say how
brave you were.

43:10.922 --> 43:11.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

43:11.923 --> 43:13.291 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bravery, you have got to have an
option.

43:13.324 --> 43:15.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got to have an option
to run.

43:15.126 --> 43:19.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: As NASA sets its
sights on
long-duration human missions to
Mars, it really

43:19.797 --> 43:25.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't a question of if there
will be a fire,
just when and how will the crew
be equipped

43:25.436 --> 43:27.538 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to respond?

43:27.572 --> 43:35.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Cleveland.

43:35.813 --> 43:42.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Back to Gwen
and Judy in
Philadelphia.

43:42.587 --> 43:47.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Now for a lighter
take on the
convention that is nominating
its first woman,

43:47.325 --> 43:51.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we turn to Samantha Bee, the
former "Daily
Show" correspondent who became
host of "Full

43:52.029 --> 43:54.131 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Frontal" on TBS in February.

43:54.165 --> 43:59.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She's one of only two women
hosting a late-night
comedy show, which means --
we're two women,

43:59.871 --> 44:00.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Judy and I.

44:00.872 --> 44:02.140 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And people ask us this question
all the time.

44:02.173 --> 44:03.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE, Host, "Full
Frontal With Samantha
Bee": Yes.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Means exactly what?

44:04.141 --> 44:07.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: I don't know what
it means.

44:07.144 --> 44:08.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm just doing my job.

44:08.846 --> 44:11.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm just doing the work and
keeping my head
down and my eyes forward, as I'm
sure you

44:11.315 --> 44:12.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
do every day.

44:12.550 --> 44:14.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Most of it is
politics, though,
isn't it?

44:14.051 --> 44:16.420 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: Well, yes, but
isn't all of
life?

44:16.454 --> 44:22.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: You told "Rolling
Stone" that
having Donald Trump as the
nominee of the

44:22.293 --> 44:24.662 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Republican Party had been a
godsend for you.

44:24.695 --> 44:26.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What did you mean?

44:26.597 --> 44:31.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: Well, I mean, when
you're trying
to launch a satirical -- a
politically topical

44:31.068 --> 44:37.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
show, what better gift could you
possibly
ask for than someone who turns
out -- turns

44:37.675 --> 44:42.647 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
out offensive ideas and
statements on a daily
basis, sometimes multiple times
a day?

44:42.680 --> 44:44.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's been -- it's been -- we
have been lucky.

44:44.315 --> 44:47.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Would you say you're
a Democrat
or Republican, or neither?

44:47.752 --> 44:52.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: I would say I
definitely -- I
think my leanings are very clear
from the

44:52.623 --> 44:53.991 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
show.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I actually prefer to think
of myself in
a more independent way.

44:56.427 --> 44:57.395 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Why?

44:57.428 --> 44:58.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA BEE: Because...

44:58.429 --> 44:59.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Why not just
embrace...

44:59.430 --> 45:00.398 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: I do embrace it.

45:00.431 --> 45:01.532 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I definitely am excited for
Hillary.

45:01.566 --> 45:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think there is any
question about
it.

45:04.435 --> 45:07.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like to be able to make jokes
about both
sides of the aisle.

45:07.705 --> 45:10.274 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I tend to give myself -- I
like to give
myself a little freedom.

45:10.308 --> 45:11.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

45:11.909 --> 45:14.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What kind of
material, though,
does Hillary Clinton provide?

45:14.378 --> 45:16.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If Donald Trump is the gift that
keeps on
giving, what about her?

45:16.948 --> 45:18.115 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA BEE: Yes.

45:18.149 --> 45:20.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, it is a little bit more
challenging,
actually.

45:20.084 --> 45:24.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, definitely, last week,
we found ourselves
with such an abundance of
material from the

45:24.422 --> 45:25.456 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beginning.

45:25.489 --> 45:28.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, from Monday to Thursday,
it was incredible.

45:28.492 --> 45:31.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was an overflowing basket of
goodies for
us to choose from.

45:31.929 --> 45:36.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, we do a show
that's three acts
long and 21 minutes, and we
ended up writing

45:36.367 --> 45:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
six acts of comedy and just
doing everything,
doing all of the extras as Web
extras and

45:41.405 --> 45:43.207 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
putting them up on the Web.

45:43.240 --> 45:47.078 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This week is -- we're finding
it, but it is
a little bit more -- you know,
we're having

45:47.111 --> 45:49.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to find a sliver, a way to get
in.

45:49.614 --> 45:51.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's a little more nuanced.

45:51.816 --> 45:55.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not just a banquet for us
to select from.

45:55.086 --> 45:58.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we're having to be a little
more careful
a little bit -- and digging a
little deeper,

45:58.856 --> 45:59.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for sure.

45:59.824 --> 46:00.791 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Your show is tough.

46:00.825 --> 46:01.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You use tough language.

46:01.826 --> 46:02.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA BEE: Thank you.

46:02.827 --> 46:03.861 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

46:03.894 --> 46:04.862 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We could not really
air it here.

46:04.895 --> 46:05.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA BEE: I know.

46:05.896 --> 46:06.864 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I know.

46:06.897 --> 46:08.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a salty show.

46:08.666 --> 46:10.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's a salty show,
which women
are not used to hearing from --
people are

46:10.668 --> 46:11.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not used to hearing from a
woman.

46:12.003 --> 46:13.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: No, they're not
that used to
it.

46:13.838 --> 46:16.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: What kind of
feedback do you get?

46:16.207 --> 46:20.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: I don't -- you
know, I think
I stay out of the feedback loop,
to be perfectly

46:20.311 --> 46:21.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
honest with you.

46:21.312 --> 46:23.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Really?

46:23.147 --> 46:24.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: I don't engage
with it too much,
because I know that I'm doing a
show that

46:24.582 --> 46:25.950 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
comes from my heart.

46:25.983 --> 46:30.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're doing a show that comes
from a place
of passion and interest.

46:31.022 --> 46:34.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we use salty language,
because that's
the language we feel like using
to express

46:34.525 --> 46:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our thoughts and our concerns.

46:35.693 --> 46:37.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's really cathartic for
us.

46:37.862 --> 46:40.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I tend to not drop in to the
criticism
of that.

46:40.264 --> 46:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I tend to just -- I prefer to do
my own thing.

46:42.533 --> 46:47.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I prefer to steer my own ship,
and not -- you
know, I think that any time you
try to create

46:47.938 --> 46:53.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comedy or you try to create a
piece of art
by consensus, you -- I mean,
it's impossible

46:53.811 --> 46:55.379 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to do a quality product.

46:55.413 --> 46:59.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think -- so, I don't
listen to critics
all that much.

46:59.850 --> 47:00.951 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't read about myself.

47:00.985 --> 47:01.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's much better.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Sounds good.

47:03.054 --> 47:04.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm going to try that.

47:04.055 --> 47:05.122 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:05.156 --> 47:06.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: It's actually
paradise, if I
may.

47:06.057 --> 47:07.792 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:07.825 --> 47:08.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: You can live in a
bubble in
which you think you're doing a
good job all

47:08.959 --> 47:10.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the time if you don't read what
other people
say.

47:10.928 --> 47:12.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:12.763 --> 47:15.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Samantha Bee, you
have expressed
some views on how few women
there are doing

47:15.066 --> 47:19.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what you do, doing late-night
comedy or any
kind of comedy, having their own
show.

47:19.570 --> 47:21.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do you think there aren't
more women doing
that?

47:21.072 --> 47:23.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: I wish that I had
a great answer
for that.

47:23.240 --> 47:25.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wish that I had a funny and
creative answer.

47:25.309 --> 47:28.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the truth is, I just don't
-- I really
don't know.

47:28.145 --> 47:32.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I do think that that will
change, and
I certainly hope that it will
change.

47:32.750 --> 47:35.953 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would love to have a
sisterhood of late-night
comedy hosts.

47:35.986 --> 47:38.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think it
puts more pressure
on you?

47:38.422 --> 47:42.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: It doesn't --
well, as I said,
I stay out of -- I stay out of
that feedback

47:42.426 --> 47:43.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
loop.

47:43.427 --> 47:44.395 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Pressure...

47:44.428 --> 47:46.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:46.197 --> 47:47.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: So, the pressure
-- I don't
allow that pressure to really
infiltrate.

47:47.198 --> 47:48.332 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I let that conversation be held
by other people.

47:48.365 --> 47:49.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

47:49.366 --> 47:50.935 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let me ask you this.

47:50.968 --> 47:53.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diversity in newsrooms certainly
is a big
issue.

47:53.404 --> 47:58.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you see on the air is often
-- reflected
the interests of the people who
are deciding

47:58.042 --> 47:59.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they're going to tell you what
you need to
know.

47:59.877 --> 48:02.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In a comedy writer's room, how
is that reflected?

48:02.613 --> 48:03.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Do you have more women?

48:03.748 --> 48:05.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you have more people of color
than we normally
see?

48:05.816 --> 48:06.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA BEE: We do.

48:06.784 --> 48:07.752 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
We do.

48:07.785 --> 48:09.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I believe we do.

48:09.520 --> 48:13.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we certainly made an
absolute effort to
-- we wanted to create a diverse
workplace.

48:13.390 --> 48:18.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was one of our missions
from the very
start, because the show runner,
Jo Miller,

48:18.496 --> 48:23.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and myself, we are both women
who, we feel
like we didn't naturally -- we
didn't fall

48:23.734 --> 48:28.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into comedy and comedy writing
in an obvious
way.

48:28.506 --> 48:32.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We didn't set -- we didn't begin
our lives
thinking, I'm going to be a
comedy writer

48:32.076 --> 48:33.711 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one day and I'm going to host my
own show.

48:33.744 --> 48:36.313 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We both worked on the fringes.

48:36.347 --> 48:37.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We worked in other jobs.

48:37.348 --> 48:39.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We came to it rather late in
life.

48:39.984 --> 48:45.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we identify with people
who don't have
access to comedy rooms.

48:45.422 --> 48:49.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we wanted to definitely
create a space
in which we could bring people
in from the

48:49.860 --> 48:53.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
outside, people who wouldn't
expect to naturally
work in comedy.

48:53.330 --> 48:57.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we make efforts to do that,
I mean, every
day and in every way.

48:57.301 --> 49:00.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, we will
keep looking
for you here in Philadelphia.

49:00.337 --> 49:01.972 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA BEE: Thank you.

49:02.006 --> 49:03.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Samantha Bee,
"Full Frontal,"
thank you very much for dropping
by.

49:03.073 --> 49:03.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: Thank you so much
for having
me.

49:04.008 --> 49:05.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Thank you for making
us laugh.

49:05.342 --> 49:06.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SAMANTHA BEE: Oh.

49:06.343 --> 49:07.311 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We could use that.

49:07.344 --> 49:10.614 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMANTHA BEE: We could all use a
laugh.

49:10.648 --> 49:15.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally
tonight, we mark
the end of the primary season by
looking back

49:15.920 --> 49:20.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
at some of the iconic
photographs from the
2016 campaign so far.

49:20.591 --> 49:23.360 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we hear from the talented
men and women
who capture those images.

49:23.394 --> 49:27.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MELINA MARA, The Washington
Post: Covering
politicians is fascinating,
because they're

49:27.097 --> 49:28.899 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
almost like another breed.

49:28.933 --> 49:33.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a political photojournalist,
my job isn't
only to document their message,
but it's also

49:33.971 --> 49:36.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to document the human being.

49:36.740 --> 49:38.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Melina Mara.

49:38.075 --> 49:41.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm the national political
photographer for
The Washington Post.

49:41.178 --> 49:46.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I have been on the campaign
trail with
Hillary Clinton for about a
year-and-a-half.

49:46.550 --> 49:50.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think she's very comfortable
with who she
is as a person.

49:50.221 --> 49:53.624 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have a great time
photographing her, because
she's full of expression, she's
full of physicality.

49:53.657 --> 49:58.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHIP SOMODEVILLA, Getty Images:
I think just
photographing Trump is
fascinating.

49:58.295 --> 50:01.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He is such a character.

50:01.265 --> 50:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's very conscious of the
camera.

50:02.566 --> 50:07.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He loves the camera, and it
comes across in
his pictures.

50:07.204 --> 50:08.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Chip Somodevilla.

50:09.006 --> 50:12.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I have been a staff
photographer for Getty
Images in Washington, D.C., for
11 years.

50:12.910 --> 50:18.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This campaign cycle blended in
immediately
from the last campaign cycle, so
we have been

50:18.782 --> 50:22.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
covering this campaign the last
four years,
more or less.

50:22.119 --> 50:25.189 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JIM BOURG, Reuters News
Pictures: In my experience
in over 30 years of doing this,
there has

50:25.222 --> 50:27.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
never been a campaign cycle like
this.

50:27.725 --> 50:29.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Jim Bourg.

50:29.126 --> 50:32.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm the editor in charge of
Washington at
Reuters News Pictures.

50:32.396 --> 50:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Going back to when I started in
political
photography, in presidential
campaign photography,

50:36.333 --> 50:38.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
it used to be a lot more
freewheeling.

50:38.535 --> 50:40.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You used to show up for the
events.

50:40.204 --> 50:44.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You used to have a lot more
interaction with
the candidates, yourself
personally.

50:44.975 --> 50:47.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This campaign has been
dramatically different
in this regard.

50:47.978 --> 50:53.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now the two nominees have staffs
and campaigns
that are much more aggressive
about keeping

50:53.350 --> 50:56.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the press at a distance than we
have ever
experienced before.

50:56.520 --> 51:00.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK PETERSON, MSNBC
Photography: All these
events are orchestrated, and I
feel like it's

51:00.624 --> 51:06.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the photographer's job to try
and circumvent
that.

51:06.964 --> 51:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My name is Mark Peterson.

51:09.600 --> 51:15.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for this campaign cycle, I
have been doing
pictures for MSNBC Photography.

51:15.973 --> 51:21.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I started the Political Theater
Project in
2013.

51:21.378 --> 51:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With this, you know, I converted
the stuff
to black and white and really
accented the

51:28.352 --> 51:34.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flash, and I use that to try and
make things
have more of a dimension to it
and also to

51:34.091 --> 51:36.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
highlight the theatrical nature
of it.

51:36.560 --> 51:39.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILARY SWIFT, The New York
Times: Something
that I kind of discovered early
on was that

51:39.596 --> 51:44.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the crowds were almost more
interesting than
the candidates, because the
crowds really

51:44.668 --> 51:46.937 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spoke to who the candidate was.

51:46.971 --> 51:48.772 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My name is Hilary Swift.

51:48.806 --> 51:51.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm a freelance photographer
for The New
York Times.

51:51.241 --> 51:56.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This has been the first campaign
and convention
I have ever been a part of or
worked on.

51:56.680 --> 52:01.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been really surprising to
me in a lot
of ways in getting to see people
from all

52:01.418 --> 52:07.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the country coming together
and showing
up to support someone, and often
also showing

52:07.925 --> 52:11.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up to not support ideas that
they don't agree
with.

52:11.195 --> 52:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MELINA MARA: In 2016, we are
needed.

52:15.899 --> 52:22.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A political photojournalist
brings something
that words can't do, brings the
humanity to

52:22.740 --> 52:24.041 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the coverage.

52:24.074 --> 52:26.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it really is who this person
is.

52:26.310 --> 52:31.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it really does educate the
voter in a
way that they can say, who are
you?

52:31.815 --> 52:33.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can I vote for you?

52:33.250 --> 52:37.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I don't know what
we would
do without these photographers.

52:37.621 --> 52:39.590 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're amazing.

52:39.623 --> 52:42.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Once again, a
reminder that still
shots sometimes capture more
than moving pictures.

52:42.326 --> 52:44.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For sure, even
though we love
TV.

52:44.828 --> 52:47.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And from here in Philadelphia,
that's the
"NewsHour" for now.

52:47.131 --> 52:49.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But stay with us.

52:49.099 --> 52:52.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will be back right here at
8:00 p.m. Eastern
for live special coverage of
this increasingly

52:52.936 --> 52:57.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
noisy Democratic National
Convention, where
vice presidential nominee Tim
Kaine will speak,

52:57.875 --> 52:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
followed by President Obama.

52:59.376 --> 53:00.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:00.344 --> 53:02.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:02.146 --> 53:12.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"
thank you, and we will see you
back here soon.
