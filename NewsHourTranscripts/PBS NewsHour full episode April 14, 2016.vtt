JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:05.939 --> 00:10.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight, we
examine the
campaign environment this
election year for

00:10.911 --> 00:16.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
paid campaign ads. Are they the
most reliable
way to get a message out?

00:16.483 --> 00:22.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, a Chicago task force finds
systematic
racism in its police department
and calls

00:22.890 --> 00:25.392 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for sweeping changes.

00:25.492 --> 00:30.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a new approach to financial
advice, putting
it on one index card?

00:30.264 --> 00:33.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK, University of
Chicago: All
the financial experts actually
had a pretty

00:33.734 --> 00:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
simple set of things that they
suggested that
you do, and basically all of
them would say

00:39.873 --> 00:41.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tune out all the other stuff.

00:41.475 --> 00:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:48.982 --> 00:51.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:51.752 --> 01:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Democratic
presidential
contenders face another showdown
moment tonight.

01:01.795 --> 01:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton and Bernie
Sanders debate
in Brooklyn, just five days
before the New

01:06.767 --> 01:08.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
York state primary.

01:08.735 --> 01:13.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, Donald Trump's
campaign manager,
Corey Lewandowski, will not be
prosecuted

01:13.974 --> 01:19.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for grabbing the arm of a woman
reporter.
A state attorney in Palm Beach,
Florida, said

01:19.446 --> 01:24.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today that there's not enough
evidence to
make a case of misdemeanor
battery.

01:24.584 --> 01:29.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
U.S. military
announced new moves in the South
China Sea,

01:29.623 --> 01:35.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in response to a Chinese
buildup. Defense
Secretary Ash Carter said joint
patrols with

01:35.128 --> 01:41.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Philippines Navy are already
under way.
In Manila for war games with the
Philippines

01:41.535 --> 01:46.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
military, he said the goal is
not to be provocative,
but to tamp down tensions.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: Our
efforts to do more together
demonstrate America's

01:49.843 --> 01:56.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
unbreakable commitment to the
defense of this
nation, the security and
stability of the

01:56.183 --> 02:01.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Asia Pacific, and the principles
that have
helped so many in the region to
rise and prosper.

02:01.822 --> 02:08.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. also
plans to rotate
more troops and warplanes
through the Philippines.

02:08.462 --> 02:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China criticized the moves as a
challenge
to its sovereignty and security.

02:13.300 --> 02:18.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the trade front, China's
government has
agreed to scrap some of the
subsidies it gives

02:18.638 --> 02:23.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to companies that export goods.
The U.S. Trade
Representative's Office said
today that Beijing's

02:23.643 --> 02:30.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
decision affects specialty
steel, agriculture,
textiles, and other sectors.
Washington says

02:30.350 --> 02:35.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the subsidies let China flood
the market with
cheaply priced goods.

02:35.822 --> 02:40.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian President Vladimir Putin
sought to
ease his country's economic
jitters today

02:41.028 --> 02:47.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in his annual televised call-in
show. Putin
took a number of questions from
Russian citizens

02:47.234 --> 02:50.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that ranged from worries about
stagnant growth
to food shortages.

02:50.871 --> 02:56.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through
translator): I hope and I am
almost sure that

02:56.309 --> 03:00.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is a temporary situation
and that step
by step, along with markets
being filled with

03:00.614 --> 03:04.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
locally produced foodstuff,
prices will be
going down as well.

03:04.384 --> 03:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Putin also warned
the U.S.
to abandon what he called
imperial ambitions

03:10.557 --> 03:13.727 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and to respect Russian
interests.

03:13.827 --> 03:18.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rescue workers in Southern Japan
searched
into the night for survivors
after an earthquake

03:18.765 --> 03:24.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toppled homes and killed at
least two people.
News footage showed a TV
station's offices

03:24.704 --> 03:30.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shaking violently on the island
of Kyushu.
Elsewhere, firefighters battled
blazes set

03:31.011 --> 03:33.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
off by building collapses.

03:33.680 --> 03:39.152 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There were new protests in
Nigeria today over
the fate of the so-called Chibok
schoolgirls.

03:39.252 --> 03:45.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than 200 were kidnapped by
Boko Haram
militants two years ago today,
prompting a

03:45.292 --> 03:48.128 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worldwide campaign for their
release.

03:48.228 --> 03:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now CNN has aired apparently
recent video
of 15 of the girls.

03:53.834 --> 03:58.205 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Jonathan Rugman of
Independent Television
News reports on the reaction.

03:58.305 --> 04:06.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: Boko Haram last
filmed about
half the group a month into
their kidnapping.

04:06.513 --> 04:12.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A rescue seemed possible after
British and
American aerial intelligence
spotted a group

04:12.185 --> 04:18.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the forest, but it was judged
too dangerous
for the hostages.

04:18.725 --> 04:24.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Boko Haram's commander demanded
his fellow
fighters' release from prison in
exchange

04:24.197 --> 04:31.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the girls. Two years on, a
few of the
Chibok families and their
supporters marched

04:31.771 --> 04:37.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the capital, Abuja, still
demanding answers
from a government which claims
negotiations

04:37.544 --> 04:42.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are ongoing, but which has told
them almost
nothing.

04:42.716 --> 04:48.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Parents stunned by the release
to the media
of new pictures, yet no release
of the children

04:48.788 --> 04:55.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
themselves, this the reaction of
one mother
after recognizing her daughter's
school friends,

04:55.762 --> 04:59.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
though her own daughter had not
appeared.

04:59.299 --> 05:04.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Though much of the world has
moved on, in
the refugee camps of
Northeastern Nigeria,

05:04.471 --> 05:10.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they cannot. Boko Haram roughly
translates
as "Western education is
forbidden." While

05:10.777 --> 05:16.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
millions have fled its would-be
caliphate,
it has killed over 600 teachers
and abducted

05:16.750 --> 05:19.619 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
around 2,000 girls and boys.

05:19.719 --> 05:24.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The fate of most
of the Chibok
girls remains a mystery.

05:24.691 --> 05:30.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Microsoft
is suing the
federal government over a law
that lets investigators

05:30.163 --> 05:35.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
look at customer e-mails and
files without
telling the customer. The
company says it

05:35.302 --> 05:39.206 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
happened 5,600 times in 18
months.

05:39.306 --> 05:45.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial
average gained 18 points to
close at 17926.

05:45.111 --> 05:50.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell a point, and the
S&amp;P 500 added
a fraction.

05:50.917 --> 05:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on the South Lawn of the
White House today,
President Obama and Vice
President Biden welcomed

05:56.389 --> 06:01.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hundreds of cyclists from the
Wounded Warrior
Project. The annual event is in
its ninth

06:01.795 --> 06:06.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
year. Today's participants rode
a lap around
the grounds of the White House
before heading

06:07.067 --> 06:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out into Washington. The ride
aims to raise
awareness of wounded veterans
and their abilities.

06:14.207 --> 06:19.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
how the 2016
presidential race is also
breaking the rules

06:19.212 --> 06:26.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of political advertising;
Chicago finds its
police force guilty of
systematic racism;

06:27.020 --> 06:31.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
financial advice simplified to
fit on one
index card; and much more.

06:31.424 --> 06:33.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

06:33.260 --> 06:36.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
FDA approves
an additive in corn flour to
help protect

06:36.463 --> 06:39.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
women from birth defects; a bill
to legalize
physician-assisted suicide is
introduced in

06:39.599 --> 06:43.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Canada; and screenwriter and
actor Danny Strong
on why writing should be based
on passion,

06:43.169 --> 06:45.005 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not experience.

06:45.105 --> 06:49.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now we turn to politics and our
series looking
at how this election differs
from years past.

06:49.342 --> 06:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we focus on the change
in advertising,
how candidates are communicating
with voters,

06:55.548 --> 07:00.754 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
both in paid and free media.

07:00.854 --> 07:06.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's nothing quite like the
candidates
meeting directly with voters,
but paid political

07:06.660 --> 07:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ads on TV long ago became the
way to reach
more people than the candidates
themselves

07:12.899 --> 07:14.601 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ever could in person.

07:14.701 --> 07:21.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The firm Kantar Media CMAG keeps
track of
ads, and it reports total
spending on spots

07:21.975 --> 07:28.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for and about the candidates has
topped $380
million so far this election
season. That

07:29.082 --> 07:35.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
figure includes not just
spending on ads by
the candidates, but also that by
outside supportive

07:35.588 --> 07:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
groups, so-called super PACs.

07:37.957 --> 07:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ironically, two candidates who
dropped out,
Republicans Jeb Bush and Marco
Rubio, account

07:44.564 --> 07:50.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for about one-third of this
season's total,
while Democrats Bernie Sanders
and Hillary

07:50.370 --> 07:54.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton have benefited from $100
million in
ad spending together.

07:54.541 --> 07:57.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I spent peanuts, and I'm by far
number one.

07:57.944 --> 08:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the most
telling number
may be $17 million. That's all
that Donald

08:04.084 --> 08:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump has spent as he's sat
astride the front-runner
position in the GOP. Instead,
Trump has relied

08:10.990 --> 08:17.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mainly on what's called free
media: news coverage
and social media like Twitter.

08:17.497 --> 08:22.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
All of the candidates use
Twitter, but Trump
has made strategic use of tweets
to get his

08:22.635 --> 08:28.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
message out. He has more than
seven million
followers. Hillary Clinton has
nearly six

08:28.908 --> 08:30.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
million.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's also the extensive
exposure candidates
are getting from news coverage,
prime-time

08:34.948 --> 08:41.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV debates, and nationally
televised town
halls. This evening, for
instance, Ted Cruz

08:41.788 --> 08:47.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and John Kasich will appear in
town halls
in New York, and Clinton and
Sanders debate

08:47.861 --> 08:49.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Brooklyn.

08:49.929 --> 08:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more on how paid and free
media are shaping
the presidential race, we're
joined now by

08:54.934 --> 09:01.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Elizabeth Wilner, the senior
vice president
for political advertising at
Kantar Media.

09:01.107 --> 09:06.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Ken Goldstein, he's
political science
professor at the University of
San Francisco.

09:06.746 --> 09:07.981 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we welcome both of you to
the "NewsHour."

09:08.081 --> 09:09.883 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN GOLDSTEIN, University of San
Francisco:
Thank you.

09:09.983 --> 09:10.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER, Senior Vice
President for
Political Advertising, Kantar
Media: Thank

09:10.316 --> 09:12.152 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, to listen to
those numbers
that we just heard, Elizabeth
Wilner, you

09:14.120 --> 09:19.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
would think that paid
advertising has not
had the impact in this election
cycle that

09:19.859 --> 09:20.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it has in the past.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do you see it?

09:22.228 --> 09:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER: Well, Donald
Trump has changed
the dynamic.

09:24.798 --> 09:29.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Historically, paid advertising
and the ability
of candidates to raise enormous
sums of money,

09:29.869 --> 09:32.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that has helped to distinguish
the front-runner,
right, who has the most money to
spend on

09:32.772 --> 09:37.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TV. In this case, the candidate
who has spent
the least amount of money on TV
and put the

09:37.377 --> 09:40.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
least effort into his TV
advertising is the
front-runner on the Republican
side.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
it, Ken?

09:42.782 --> 09:45.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KEN GOLDSTEIN: Well, as
Elizabeth pointed
out, usually, the rule in
politics is follow

09:45.885 --> 09:47.754 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the money.

09:47.854 --> 09:51.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if you followed the money
here, you would
get to Right to Rise that spent
$75 million

09:51.591 --> 09:55.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on behalf of Jeb Bush, and who
is not in the
race anymore, or Conservative
Solutions Project,

09:55.929 --> 09:59.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who spent $50 million on behalf
of Marco Rubio.

09:59.699 --> 10:06.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, overall, it suggests it may
not be having
an impact, but what we did see
in Wisconsin

10:06.306 --> 10:08.908 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
was a focused advertising
effort.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Wisconsin
primary a couple
weeks ago.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN GOLDSTEIN: The Wisconsin
primary a couple
weeks ago.

10:12.812 --> 10:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A focused advertising effort,
along with some
other things, still can move
numbers.

10:17.083 --> 10:22.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But when you look
at that,
Elizabeth Wilner, and you look
at the money

10:22.222 --> 10:27.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was spent earlier by --
even by the candidates
who are no longer in the race,
what did you

10:27.160 --> 10:28.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
learn from that this year?

10:29.095 --> 10:33.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER: Well, we
learned that voters
are looking for something that
they clearly

10:33.132 --> 10:36.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't see in the array of
candidates who
were out there early spending
money on TV.

10:37.003 --> 10:40.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There were a number of
candidates spending
a lot of money in Iowa. None of
them -- you

10:40.773 --> 10:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, they all dropped out early
on. The candidates
who were spending most money
wound up having

10:46.546 --> 10:48.915 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to drop out in February or
March.

10:49.015 --> 10:53.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What we saw was voters looking
for something
that they just weren't getting
from the usual

10:54.053 --> 10:55.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
slate.

10:55.722 --> 10:58.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And is it, Ken
Goldstein, that
the messages weren't working?

10:58.324 --> 11:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I'm not asking you to
analyze what
voters saw in every one of these
spots, but

11:03.162 --> 11:08.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was there something quantitative
-- qualitatively
different this year about what
these candidates

11:08.334 --> 11:10.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
were saying in their ads?

11:10.236 --> 11:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN GOLDSTEIN: I think we're all
guilty -- and
I'm probably the most guilty --
of falling

11:14.407 --> 11:18.545 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into the trap of counting the
bombs, looking
at the targeting, how much --
how many ads,

11:18.645 --> 11:20.346 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
how much money was spent.

11:20.446 --> 11:25.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we forget the message
matters. And so,
yes, how much money you spend
matters, how

11:25.184 --> 11:29.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many ads you air matters. If you
target it
smart, that matters. But, at the
end of the

11:29.722 --> 11:34.427 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
day, if the message isn't
compelling, the
effect of that ad is still going
to be zero.

11:34.527 --> 11:39.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's what we saw
in lot of these
early primaries, where, as
Elizabeth said,

11:39.432 --> 11:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the message, even if brilliantly
targeted
and lots of money behind it, was
either not

11:44.537 --> 11:48.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crafted correctly or that's just
not what
the voters wanted to buy.

11:48.308 --> 11:51.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It does look
like, Elizabeth
Wilner, that some of the -- at
least on the

11:51.778 --> 11:56.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic side, some of the
spots that Hillary
Clinton and Bernie Sanders were
using earlier,

11:57.016 --> 11:58.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're still using.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER: Yes, they are
repeating
some of the same spots over and
over again

12:00.987 --> 12:05.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as they go from state to state.
Clearly, they
have some favorites that they
feel are particularly

12:05.224 --> 12:07.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
effective.

12:07.160 --> 12:11.030 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The ad narrated by Morgan
Freeman for Hillary
Clinton gets played over and
over again. And

12:11.130 --> 12:15.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on Bernie Sanders' behalf, the
America ad
also gets played over and over
again.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do they
measure what is
effective?

12:17.337 --> 12:22.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER: I assume they
are focus-grouping.
And I assume they are
poll-testing and trying

12:22.775 --> 12:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to determine which ads work.

12:24.577 --> 12:29.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Sanders' case, the America ad
got a lot
of social media pickup, so they
determined

12:29.849 --> 12:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that that was an effective ad.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Ken Goldstein, we
of course
also mentioned -- we're talking
about how

12:34.921 --> 12:37.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much Donald Trump has used
so-called free
media.

12:37.790 --> 12:43.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there a way to quantify the
value of that?
I mean, when you think about the
town hall

12:43.129 --> 12:49.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
meetings that these candidates
have done,
the debates, is there a way to
look at the

12:49.302 --> 12:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
value of that vs. the value of
paid advertising?

12:52.138 --> 12:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEN GOLDSTEIN: Very difficult.

12:54.073 --> 12:56.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We clearly know it's more than
the $18 million
that he's actually spent. But
it's calling

12:57.043 --> 13:01.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
into news shows and calling into
local news
shows and national news shows
and cable news

13:01.481 --> 13:07.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shows. So, it's absolutely in
the hundreds
of millions of dollars, because,
listen, one

13:07.420 --> 13:12.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the main reasons why you use
paid advertising
is, if you folks in the media
aren't talking

13:12.158 --> 13:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it, you have to get an ad
to get the
-- to generate some media
conversation.

13:17.163 --> 13:22.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, Donald Trump doesn't seem
to need that
to generate conversation and to
generate people

13:22.101 --> 13:23.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talking about him and his ideas.

13:23.903 --> 13:25.438 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All he has to do
is tweet.

13:25.538 --> 13:27.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER: All he has to
do is tweet
once.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He probably gets more value out
of one tweet
than many of the candidates have
gotten out

13:31.077 --> 13:32.879 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of an ad this cycle.

13:32.979 --> 13:36.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we looked at
-- I think
he's done more than 35,000 or
36,000 tweets,

13:36.649 --> 13:38.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and maybe most of them in this
cycle.

13:38.651 --> 13:43.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How do you see the difference,
though, between
paid and free? Can you quantify
the value

13:43.523 --> 13:48.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of free media vs. news coverage
and social
media vs. paid ads?

13:48.928 --> 13:52.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER: Well, it's
really difficult,
as Ken said, to quantify the
value of it.

13:53.066 --> 13:56.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you're doing paid media, at
least you're
controlling the message that is
coming out.

13:56.602 --> 14:01.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So if you want all of your spots
to be positive,
they will all be positive. If
you want to

14:01.174 --> 14:03.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spend some of your money on
negative attacks,
you can do that.

14:04.010 --> 14:09.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With earned media or free media,
it's a mix.
It is what you get. And Trump
coasted on some

14:09.816 --> 14:14.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fairly positive media for a long
time. More
recently, and in Wisconsin, he
was having

14:14.787 --> 14:16.956 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to deal with more negative
media.

14:17.056 --> 14:22.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the last few weeks, the
coverage of
him has been more mixed and more
negative.

14:22.829 --> 14:26.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's interesting is, he hasn't
felt a need
to spend any more on TV because
of that, but

14:26.365 --> 14:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he may down the road need to
start doing that.

14:28.468 --> 14:29.869 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What...

14:29.969 --> 14:30.536 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

14:30.636 --> 14:31.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEN GOLDSTEIN: I'm sorry.

14:31.637 --> 14:33.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Go ahead, Ken,
yes.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN GOLDSTEIN: Focusing on my
old home state
of Wisconsin, I think that's an
example of

14:35.475 --> 14:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when it works. So it's not just
paid media.
It's not just earned media. But,
in Wisconsin,

14:40.046 --> 14:45.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what you had was free media,
which was conservative
talk radio, anti-Trump.

14:45.618 --> 14:50.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On top of that, you had paid
advertising.
And on top of that, you had
candidates and

14:50.890 --> 14:55.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their surrogates focused. So,
when advertising
works, it's often not a silver
bullet, but

14:55.795 --> 14:57.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it's when you have that echo
chamber of messages.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, what do you
say, Ken Goldstein,
to people who say, well, it
looks like paid

15:00.900 --> 15:03.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
advertising doesn't work
anymore? What do
you say?

15:03.503 --> 15:07.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KEN GOLDSTEIN: It depends what
you mean by
matter, right?

15:07.306 --> 15:11.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Listen, there's big fundamental
factors that
are obviously moving this
election that are

15:11.444 --> 15:16.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
going to move the general
election. But if
this race gets into field goal
range or 1

15:16.482 --> 15:24.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or 2 or 3 percentage points,
then focused
television advertising can
matter at the margin.

15:24.123 --> 15:28.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If this ends up being a 10
percent or 15 percentage
point race, no, it's not going
to matter.

15:28.361 --> 15:32.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, interestingly, folks might
be worried
about, oh, there's not going to
be any advertisings

15:32.431 --> 15:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the presidential race,
because maybe it
is going to be less competitive
than we think.

15:34.801 --> 15:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what is going to happen is,
you are going
to have more House races
competitive and more

15:38.171 --> 15:41.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Senate races are competitive,
and that money
is going to have to go
somewhere. And it's

15:42.074 --> 15:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to go on the air in those
local races.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.378 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have to remember, it's
not just the
presidential.

15:47.280 --> 15:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Elizabeth Wilner, finally,
if somebody
says to you, paid advertising is
history,

15:52.919 --> 15:54.420 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
what do you say?

15:54.520 --> 15:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER: Oh, well, I
can't laugh
right now, but I would laugh.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.857 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

15:57.957 --> 15:59.258 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER: It's always
effective at
the margins, as Ken has said.
And in a close

15:59.358 --> 16:01.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
race, it really does make a
difference if
it's done well.

16:01.794 --> 16:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because people
who don't see
Twitter and don't see the news
media are going

16:07.466 --> 16:11.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be seeing other television
and radio where
these paid spots will be.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELIZABETH WILNER: That's right.

16:13.272 --> 16:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there will be a number -- a
good portion
of people in a close race at the
end of the

16:15.608 --> 16:20.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day who are not online looking
for information,
who are not following tweets,
who are not

16:20.379 --> 16:24.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
necessarily watching the news,
but they might
be watching a baseball game or a
hockey game,

16:24.650 --> 16:28.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and they will see an ad, and
that might help
change their mind or make up
their mind.

16:28.120 --> 16:31.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's what makes
it all so
hard to predict.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WILNER: Yes.

16:33.359 --> 16:34.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Elizabeth Wilner,
Ken Goldstein,
we thank you.

16:34.827 --> 16:39.432 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KEN GOLDSTEIN: Thank you.

16:39.532 --> 16:42.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ELIZABETH WILNER: Thanks.

16:43.035 --> 16:50.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: a stinging
report on
police tactics in a city where
civic tensions

16:51.010 --> 16:52.478 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been running high.

16:52.578 --> 16:54.847 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has our story.

16:54.947 --> 17:02.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Chicago has seen
months of outcry
aimed at the nation's third
largest police

17:02.555 --> 17:09.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
force. Just this week,
demonstrators marched
after the latest fatal shooting
of a black

17:09.762 --> 17:11.831 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
teenager.

17:11.931 --> 17:17.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, after a four-month review,
a police accountability
task force has delivered a
damning assessment.

17:17.770 --> 17:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT, Chicago Task
Force on Police
Accountability: Many people said
that they

17:20.106 --> 17:23.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
believe that the police that
they encountered
were fundamentally racist.

17:23.776 --> 17:29.315 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The report says the
police department's
own data gives validity to "the
widely held

17:29.415 --> 17:35.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
belief the police have no regard
for the sanctity
of life when it comes to people
of color."

17:35.254 --> 17:41.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Exhibit A, 74 percent of those
shot by police
in recent years were
African-American, even

17:41.894 --> 17:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
though blacks make up just a
third of the
city's population. It all came
to a head last

17:47.233 --> 17:52.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fall, when police dash-cam video
showed a
white officer killing black
teenager Laquan

17:52.138 --> 17:54.740 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
McDonald in 2014.

17:54.840 --> 17:59.745 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Facing a firestorm, Mayor Rahm
Emanuel created
the task force, and sacked the
police superintendent.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAHM EMANUEL (D), Mayor of
Chicago: Congratulations.

18:01.614 --> 18:03.616 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EDDIE JOHNSON, Chicago Police
Superintendent:
Thank you, sir.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.685 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

18:05.785 --> 18:08.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Yesterday, the city
council unanimously
approved Chicago police veteran
Eddie Johnson

18:08.988 --> 18:10.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as the new superintendent.

18:10.990 --> 18:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EDDIE JOHNSON: I promise the
citizens of Chicago,
the elected officials and the
rank-and-file

18:17.163 --> 18:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police officers I will do my
best, my absolute
best, to regain the trust and to
resolve some

18:23.035 --> 18:24.937 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of this violence that we have
out here.

18:25.037 --> 18:31.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Both Johnson and
Emanuel say they're
now reviewing the task force's
recommendations.

18:31.177 --> 18:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're joined from Chicago by
Lori Lightfoot,
who headed the task force that
issued that

18:36.349 --> 18:40.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
report. She's a former federal
prosecutor
and now the president of the
Chicago Police

18:40.920 --> 18:43.356 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Board, an independent oversight
agency.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.057 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lori Lightfoot, thanks so much
for being with
us.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.026 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: Pleasure.

18:47.126 --> 18:51.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Your report really
pulled no punches.
It said at one point that the
community's

18:51.664 --> 18:55.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lack of trust in the Chicago
Police Department
is justified.

18:55.935 --> 19:01.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have seen that lack of
trust on full
public display. Was there
anything in what

19:02.008 --> 19:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you learned assembling this
report, anything
that surprised you?

19:06.445 --> 19:13.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: Well, I think
nothing specifically
surprised us, but the depth of
the anger and

19:13.552 --> 19:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the frustration across a wide
demographic
of folks, particularly within
the African-American

19:21.060 --> 19:22.928 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
community, really resonated with
us.

19:23.029 --> 19:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I won't say surprises, but
it absolutely
struck at the core of much of
our thinking

19:28.367 --> 19:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and how we knew we needed to
move forward
with some of the bolder
recommendations that

19:34.006 --> 19:35.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
made its way into the final
report.

19:35.908 --> 19:36.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

19:36.642 --> 19:37.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Sorry. Go ahead.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.078 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: No, go ahead.

19:39.178 --> 19:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was just going to say we heard
from a real
cross-section of folks, doctors,
lawyers,

19:44.483 --> 19:48.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
professionals, average
working-day folks,
that were speaking of their
frustration, and

19:48.854 --> 19:53.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with real personal experience
about the way
that they have been treated by
the police.

19:53.426 --> 19:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: At one point, the
report asked
how we got here, or how Chicago
and the Chicago

19:59.165 --> 20:00.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police got here.

20:01.067 --> 20:05.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a lot of it seemed to go to
the attitudes
of the officers on the street.
You talked

20:05.271 --> 20:11.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about in part racism. You talked
about the
mentality of ends justifying the
means. A

20:11.577 --> 20:15.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of the recommendations in
this report
-- and there are many of them --
go to policy

20:15.548 --> 20:18.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
changes, new procedures, new
offices.

20:19.018 --> 20:23.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you get at, though, the
attitudes of
the cops on the street?

20:23.255 --> 20:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: Well, look, I
want to make
-- be very clear that what we
were reflecting

20:28.928 --> 20:30.830 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is what we heard from the
community.

20:30.930 --> 20:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a number of police
officers out
there every day who do their job
the right

20:35.468 --> 20:40.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
way. I hope that, if our
recommendations are
adopted, that it will actually
empower those

20:40.940 --> 20:46.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
officers who want to truly serve
and protect,
who want to have the support and
resources

20:46.679 --> 20:50.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of their supervisors, of the
leadership of
the department, so that they can
police in

20:50.583 --> 20:56.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a way that is both effective and
respectful
and understands and reflects the
nature of

20:56.122 --> 20:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a true partnership with members
of the community.

20:58.691 --> 21:04.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think if we get to that
place, and if
the recommendations that we have
made actually

21:04.230 --> 21:09.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adopted, I actually think that
this will empower
police officers who are out
there struggling

21:09.902 --> 21:13.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and looking for leadership on a
number of
different issues, particularly
in the area

21:13.806 --> 21:17.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of training, in procedural
justice, in cultural
literacy.

21:17.810 --> 21:21.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are a number of other
different things
that we found and that we
pointed out that

21:21.347 --> 21:28.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all go to engaging the community
in fighting
crime and addressing many of the
ills that

21:28.988 --> 21:32.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the police officers are called
upon to address
every single day.

21:32.825 --> 21:37.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: We reached out to
Mayor Emanuel's
office today, and he said that
-- the office

21:37.596 --> 21:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told us that he's not going to
be speaking
on this for a while. He wants to
digest it

21:41.700 --> 21:43.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and read the report.

21:43.502 --> 21:46.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I understand that the task force
did meet
with the mayor yesterday when
you presented

21:46.972 --> 21:49.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the report. What did you take
away from that
meeting?

21:49.975 --> 21:56.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: Well, what we
took away is
that he's going to take his own
measure of

21:56.315 --> 22:00.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the very detailed findings that
we have made,
the specific recommendations.

22:01.053 --> 22:05.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a very dense document,
and we did
a very deep dive on a range of
different issues.

22:05.357 --> 22:10.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, certainly, it was our
expectation that
he would take the time that he
needed to both

22:10.763 --> 22:16.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
understand what we were saying,
what the recommendations
were, and then think about the
best path forward

22:16.769 --> 22:18.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the city and for the
department.

22:18.637 --> 22:22.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: What are you hearing
from the public
and from the police department
today?

22:22.274 --> 22:25.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: I think we're
hearing a range
of things.

22:25.644 --> 22:30.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People have a diversity of views
and reactions
to what is in the task force in
terms of its

22:31.016 --> 22:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finding and its recommendations.
I think we
stood up in an environment in
which there

22:37.423 --> 22:43.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was tremendous skepticism about
all forms
of government, and certainly
anything with

22:43.429 --> 22:45.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the current political structure.

22:45.764 --> 22:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People told us time after time
that they wish
us luck, but they didn't believe
it would

22:49.835 --> 22:53.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really make any difference. And,
frankly,
what we have heard from a lot of
folks that

22:54.006 --> 22:58.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaged us with that level of
skepticism is
that they are pleasantly
surprised by the

22:58.911 --> 23:03.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way in which we addressed hard
truths that
reflected the things that have
been said in

23:03.849 --> 23:08.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many neighborhoods going back
decades and
that we presented a reasonable,
but bold and

23:08.988 --> 23:10.789 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aggressive path forward.

23:10.889 --> 23:14.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: That skepticism,
everything -- all
the recommendations require
action either

23:14.760 --> 23:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the mayor, the city council,
or the department
itself. There's a Justice
Department investigation.

23:20.299 --> 23:22.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you think is going to
happen? What
do you hope is going to happen?

23:22.635 --> 23:26.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: Well, what I
hope is going
to happen is that the feeling in
the community

23:26.672 --> 23:32.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that really cuts across the
entirety of Chicago,
that this is a moment for bold
action and

23:32.378 --> 23:38.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for change, my hope is that that
sentiment
in the community will help
inform, frankly,

23:38.684 --> 23:43.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the political stakeholders to
empower them
to do what is necessary to move
the department

23:43.689 --> 23:45.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
forward.

23:45.658 --> 23:49.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The police department is one of
the most critical
and essential departments and
institutions

23:49.528 --> 23:55.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
really in our city, as it is in
all large
urban areas. We need them to be
successful

23:55.134 --> 23:59.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in their mission, because there
are people
in crime-ravaged neighborhoods
who need the

23:59.305 --> 24:01.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
police every single day.

24:01.440 --> 24:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so creating a path forward,
speaking truth
as to what has happened at an
individual and

24:07.846 --> 24:11.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
institutional level was
absolutely essential
for us to be able to move
forward. But there

24:11.550 --> 24:13.485 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a path forward.

24:13.585 --> 24:17.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we need to focus on how we
heal the rift
between the police department
and the communities

24:17.890 --> 24:19.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it's sworn to serve and
protect.

24:19.491 --> 24:21.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lori Lightfoot,
thanks for joining
us.

24:21.727 --> 24:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LORI LIGHTFOOT: My pleasure

24:41.380 --> 24:53.425 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to

24:53.525 --> 24:55.260 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
be here.

24:55.361 --> 25:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first, it
couldn't get
any simpler. All the financial
advice you

25:01.767 --> 25:06.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
really need can fit on a
four-by-six index
card.

25:06.205 --> 25:10.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the next eight minutes,
our economics
correspondent, Paul Solman, will
fill you

25:10.743 --> 25:15.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in and let you know what the
secret is. It's
part of our weekly Making Sense
report, which

25:16.048 --> 25:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airs every Thursday on the
"NewsHour."

25:18.517 --> 25:24.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Use Fidelity's analytics
to spot trends,
gain insights and figure out
what you want

25:24.123 --> 25:25.824 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to do next.

25:25.924 --> 25:30.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: On TV, financial
advice abounds.
But the best advice is: Ignore
it.

25:30.329 --> 25:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK, Co-Author, "The
Index Card:
Why Personal Finance Doesn't
Have to Be Complicated":

25:33.232 --> 25:35.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hey, Paul, come on in.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So says University
of Chicago
health policy Professor Harold
Pollack, who

25:38.871 --> 25:43.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lives in Flossmoor, Illinois 20
miles from
campus.

25:43.242 --> 25:46.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
About personal finance, until
recently, he
knew squat.

25:46.412 --> 25:50.082 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HAROLD POLLACK: I sort of
figured it would
all work out, and I didn't have
to think about

25:50.182 --> 25:51.984 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
it too much. And so I didn't.

25:52.084 --> 25:58.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Until, that is, he
had to, when,
in 2003, his mother-in-law died
suddenly,

25:58.290 --> 26:01.093 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
leaving her disabled son in the
Pollacks'
hands.

26:01.193 --> 26:05.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: The expenses of
caring for
someone who is quite disabled,
you know, are

26:06.098 --> 26:11.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
very frightening. When Vincent
moved into
our home, he was about 340
pounds, and we

26:11.336 --> 26:15.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
needed to get furniture that
would fit him.
One time, we had to go out and
just buy a

26:15.741 --> 26:17.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recliner, and it was something
like $900.

26:17.643 --> 26:23.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And there were
hospitalizations,
medical bills. Pollack needed
advice. So,

26:23.282 --> 26:26.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he started reading and had what
he calls an
epiphany.

26:26.518 --> 26:31.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HAROLD POLLACK: All the
financial experts
actually had a pretty simple set
of things

26:31.490 --> 26:36.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they suggested that you do,
and basically
all of them would say tune out
all the other

26:36.528 --> 26:38.330 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stuff.

26:38.430 --> 26:42.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Like the TV ads.
So, to be useful
to others, Pollack started
chronicling his

26:42.568 --> 26:49.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
financial education in a blog,
and, in 2013,
interviewed financial self-help
writer Helaine

26:49.408 --> 26:50.809 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Olen over Skype.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.644 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
At one point, he said,
off-handedly:

26:52.744 --> 26:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: The really good
advice is
a -- can fit on a three-by-five
index card

26:57.616 --> 26:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and is available for free in the
library.

26:59.685 --> 27:04.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This time around,
Helaine Olen
joined virtually once again,
stuck at home

27:04.223 --> 27:06.124 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with the flu.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HELAINE OLEN, Co-Author, "The
Index Card:
Why Personal Finance Doesn't
Have to Be Complicated":

27:07.693 --> 27:09.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People began to write to Harold
and ask him
to do an index card.

27:09.528 --> 27:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So Pollack put 10
items on an
index card, took a snapshot and
posted it

27:14.166 --> 27:20.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
online. It promptly went viral,
touted on
The Washington Post's Wonkblog,
on Web sites

27:20.239 --> 27:22.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BoingBoing and Lifehacker.

27:22.708 --> 27:28.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And thus was born Pollack and
Olen's short
new book: "The Index Card," a
few simple rules.

27:28.580 --> 27:31.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: And that just
seemed much
more doable to a lot of people.

27:31.617 --> 27:37.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, what's on the
card? Rule
one: Strive to save 10 to 20
percent of your

27:37.289 --> 27:42.528 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
income, which means slashing
your spending
on what you don't much care
about.

27:42.628 --> 27:48.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are other things that I do
spend money
on. I go on vacations. I go to
things. Take

27:48.834 --> 27:53.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my wife to Bruce Springsteen, so
-- but I
try to spend my money on things
that I enjoy.

27:53.872 --> 27:59.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I really just am apathetic
about my car,
so I shouldn't spend any money
on it.

27:59.278 --> 28:05.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Though rule one is
easier advised
than accomplished, Helaine Olen
acknowledges.

28:05.117 --> 28:08.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HELAINE OLEN: I mean, how on
earth are you
supposed to save between 10 and
20 percent

28:08.787 --> 28:14.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of your income if you're making
$20,000 a
year? And the answer is, you
probably won't.

28:14.526 --> 28:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My position is that everybody is
helped, if
at all possible, to just even
get a little

28:21.033 --> 28:22.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bit of money aside.

28:22.901 --> 28:29.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Rule two: Pay your
credit card
balance in full every month,
obvious, yet

28:29.374 --> 28:31.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less than a third of Americans
follow this
rule.

28:31.743 --> 28:36.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: One of the great
things that
you can do is try to pay cash
more often for

28:36.648 --> 28:37.616 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stuff.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And if you must use
credit cards:

28:39.551 --> 28:43.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: Figure out the
one that has
the highest interest rate, and
stop using

28:43.155 --> 28:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that one, and pay off as much as
you can on
that credit card. Pay the
minimum on all your

28:48.360 --> 28:51.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other credit cards. Don't ever
avoid a credit
card payment.

28:51.496 --> 28:57.169 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Three: Max out your
401(k) and
other tax-advantaged savings
accounts. To

28:57.269 --> 29:02.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this day, only 12 percent of
Americans do
this. When Pollack started
working, he wasn't

29:03.075 --> 29:04.910 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one of them.

29:05.010 --> 29:06.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: It's too much
trouble. It
was boring. It was -- you know,
it was something

29:06.912 --> 29:13.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that was really far off in the
future, and,
you know, the stock market was
like one-tenth

29:13.685 --> 29:15.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of what it is right now, and,
boy, I wish
I could have that back.

29:15.621 --> 29:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Rule four: Never
buy or sell
individual stocks, because less
than 1 percent

29:21.393 --> 29:24.930 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of us have the ability to
consistently outperform
the market.

29:25.030 --> 29:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: It turns out
that the individual
people are not good at picking
winners and

29:28.433 --> 29:31.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
losers in the stock market, and
financial
professionals aren't that great
at picking

29:32.037 --> 29:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
winners and losers either.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No matter what they
tell you.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JIM CRAMER, Host, "Mad Money":
Other people
want to make friends. I'm just
trying to make

29:37.542 --> 29:39.444 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
you some money.

29:39.544 --> 29:43.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: According to
Pollack, a PBS show
from the '70s and '80s bears
some responsibility

29:43.448 --> 29:45.417 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for our faith in stock-picking.

29:45.517 --> 29:48.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LOUIS RUKEYSER, "Wall Street
Week": Good evening.
I'm Louis Rukeyser. This is
"Wall Street Week."

29:48.320 --> 29:51.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The show returned
to TV on FOX
Business News last month.

29:51.957 --> 29:55.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HAROLD POLLACK: They were
pushing people away
from what they should be
thinking about, which

29:56.061 --> 30:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is I'm not going to be able to
pick which
stocks are good. I shouldn't
even try to do

30:00.332 --> 30:04.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. And what I really care
about is what
the stock market is going to be
in 20 or 30

30:04.770 --> 30:08.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years, not what it's going to be
next year.

30:08.140 --> 30:14.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Or next week or
tomorrow. So,
rule five: Buy inexpensive,
well-diversified

30:14.312 --> 30:20.018 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mutual funds and exchange traded
funds, index
funds, that is, and hold them.

30:20.118 --> 30:22.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: Many, many
people believe
that their financial adviser is
free

30:23.021 --> 30:28.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Rule six is related
to five,
but it's more subtle: Insist
your investment

30:28.727 --> 30:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
adviser, if you have one,
commits to a fiduciary
standard, putting the client
first, instead

30:35.300 --> 30:40.038 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the suitability standard,
which requires
no such commitment.

30:40.138 --> 30:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To illustrate, Pollack posted a
video with
cakes.

30:43.241 --> 30:50.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Thanks for sharing your
cake, Jim.
It was suitable. From now on, I
will keep

30:51.016 --> 30:54.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
my cake for myself. That's
fiduciary.

30:54.386 --> 31:01.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: If you put your
money into
sensible index funds and save
for your retirement,

31:01.393 --> 31:06.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and did everything properly, you
would end
up with this whole cake. If you
invested in

31:06.431 --> 31:10.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
basically the same types of
investments, but
the sorts of things that people
recommend

31:10.869 --> 31:16.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the suitability standard,
which have higher
fees, you would end up with less
cake. And

31:16.675 --> 31:19.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there'd be this slice missing,
which could
be significant.

31:19.277 --> 31:25.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: That missing slice
costs American
investors about $17 billion a
year in fees,

31:25.784 --> 31:31.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says Pollack. And just last
week, the Obama
administration proposed a new
rule that would

31:31.423 --> 31:34.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hold all investment advisers to
this higher
standard.

31:35.026 --> 31:40.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
OK, let's zip through to the
end. Rule seven:
Buy a home only when you are
financially ready.

31:40.532 --> 31:45.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: You can stop
going to Starbucks.
You can buy a cheaper car the
next time around.

31:45.237 --> 31:50.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can't do much about your
30-year mortgage.
You're kind of stuck with that.
So, it's important

31:50.609 --> 31:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, in these big things, you
know, that
you are appropriately modest in
what you can

31:54.846 --> 31:56.047 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
afford.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Eight: Insurance.
Make sure you're
protected.

31:58.250 --> 32:02.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: Get the largest
deductible
that you can. You want your
insurance for

32:02.587 --> 32:08.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the $50,000 problem, not for the
$500 problem,
and you can save yourself a lot
of money if

32:08.894 --> 32:12.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you get a higher deductible on
your homeowners
and your auto insurance.

32:12.164 --> 32:16.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Nine, the most
controversial
on the card: Do what you can to
support the

32:17.035 --> 32:18.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
social safety net.

32:18.970 --> 32:26.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: To me, it's
incredibly important
to appreciate that we all have
to protect

32:26.244 --> 32:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each other against some of the
risks in life
that would just crush any one of
us if we

32:31.082 --> 32:38.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had to face it alone. And when
Vincent moved
into our house, we would have
absolutely been

32:38.356 --> 32:43.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bankrupted without Medicare, and
Medicaid,
and Social Security, and all the
programs

32:43.528 --> 32:44.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that helped our family.

32:44.830 --> 32:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And finally, 10:
Remember the
index card.

32:48.333 --> 32:55.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HAROLD POLLACK: The idea is, you
have to be
methodical and stick to this,
and, you know,

32:55.407 --> 32:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the advice that we give is good,
but it's
the execution that's really
going to matter.

32:59.845 --> 33:04.149 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," this
is Paul Solman, an economic
correspondent

33:04.249 --> 33:10.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for 39 years now, here to tell
you, if Harold
Pollack and Helaine Olen have it
wrong, I

33:10.322 --> 33:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have learned nothing over all
this time.

33:15.360 --> 33:26.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A major health
announcement
in the U.S. today.

33:26.972 --> 33:32.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Food and Drug Administration
said it will
permit one of the B vitamins,
folic acid,

33:32.377 --> 33:38.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be added to corn masa flour,
used in making
tortillas and other favorites of
Hispanic

33:38.216 --> 33:43.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
households, this to help prevent
neural tube
birth defects, such as spina
bifida.

33:43.855 --> 33:49.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Folic acid has been in fortify
wheat flour
since 1996, and is credited with
preventing

33:49.694 --> 33:56.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
some 1,300 birth defects a year.
Health advocates
have long petitioned to include
it in corn

33:56.434 --> 33:58.203 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flour as well.

33:58.303 --> 34:03.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more, Dr. Jose Cordero joins
us. He is
professor at the University of
Georgia, former

34:03.208 --> 34:07.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
director of the National Center
on Birth Defects.
He is currently on the board of
the March

34:07.545 --> 34:11.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Dimes, which is one of the
groups that
pressed for the change.

34:11.216 --> 34:13.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Dr. Cordero, thank you for being
with us.

34:13.485 --> 34:15.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What's your reaction to this
announcement?

34:15.387 --> 34:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. JOSE CORDERO, University of
Georgia: Well,
it was tremendous joy.

34:21.693 --> 34:27.465 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is just a tremendous
occasion, that,
finally, after 10 years of
asking for having

34:27.565 --> 34:35.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
folic acid included in corn masa
flour, finally,
it's here. And it is very
important, because,

34:35.640 --> 34:41.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now, not only in Hispanic
households,
but we all in the country are
eating more

34:41.446 --> 34:44.449 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tortilla chips than we are
eating potato chips.

34:44.549 --> 34:49.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it is an important source of
having folic
acid that could help us prevent
some very

34:50.088 --> 34:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
serious birth defects like spina
bifida.

34:52.057 --> 34:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What difference
do you think
it's going to make? Can you
quantify? We talked

34:56.194 --> 34:59.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
about the number of birth
defects that have
been prevented because of adding
it to wheat

34:59.965 --> 35:03.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
flour. What difference do you
think it's going
to make going forward?

35:03.668 --> 35:10.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOSE CORDERO: Well, the
difference it
is going to make, it is going to
reduce the

35:10.542 --> 35:15.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
number of babies that are going
to be born
with spina bifida and
anencephaly to serious

35:15.513 --> 35:17.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
neural tube defects.

35:17.482 --> 35:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is going to be maybe 40
or a year more,
but it could be even more. But
the important

35:24.522 --> 35:28.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
thing is that we have known that
folic acid
can prevent these serious birth
defects. I

35:28.660 --> 35:32.664 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think we are at a point that
even one would
be too many.

35:32.764 --> 35:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Cordero, we
know that the
company that makes so much of
this corn flour

35:37.869 --> 35:45.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
already fortifies corn flour
sold in Mexico.
But it is only now able to do it
in the United

35:45.777 --> 35:50.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
States. How do you explain the
Food and Drug
Administration taking this long
to make it

35:50.849 --> 35:54.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- to allow it to be fortified
here in the
U.S.?

35:54.619 --> 36:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. JOSE CORDERO: Well, it is
something that's
hard to explain, but the Food
and Drug Administration

36:04.129 --> 36:11.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
follows some rules on how to
process and apply
even the citizens petition.

36:11.169 --> 36:16.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think that the good point
is finally
it is here, and no longer we
will have this

36:16.741 --> 36:23.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
contrast, and I would say
disparity, where
you can get corn masa flour in
Mexico and

36:23.982 --> 36:26.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Venezuela and Costa Rica, but
not here.

36:26.818 --> 36:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Gruma, the company that
makes these products,
it is -- was part of the group
and will be

36:34.426 --> 36:36.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
getting this product into the
market very
soon.

36:36.694 --> 36:40.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, the Food
and Drug Administration
says the reason has to do with
needing evidence,

36:41.099 --> 36:45.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but, as you say, the evidence
has been there
for many years.

36:45.870 --> 36:50.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's hard for people to
understand
why so many years have been
allowed to go

36:50.308 --> 36:55.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by, and why, presumably, you
know, women have
been allowed to give birth to
some babies

36:55.380 --> 37:01.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with these birth defects, and
this hasn't
taken place, and especially in
the Hispanic

37:01.553 --> 37:02.454 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
community.

37:02.554 --> 37:08.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. JOSE CORDERO: Yes, that's
the case.

37:08.393 --> 37:13.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have that among Hispanics.
The rate of
these serious defects is about
twice as high

37:14.099 --> 37:22.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as it is in African-Americans or
whites. So
there's been a disparity. And
the FDA was

37:22.373 --> 37:24.676 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
asking for additional
information.

37:24.776 --> 37:29.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And thanks to March of Dimes, we
were able
to get the studies done,
demonstrate that

37:29.581 --> 37:35.487 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in fact the product will
continue to have
sufficient folic acid through
the shell life.

37:35.587 --> 37:37.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that that's what
made the difference.

37:37.555 --> 37:43.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm so glad that we could move
forward and
celebrate that actually corn
masa flour, tortilla

37:43.962 --> 37:48.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chips, or your tortillas when
you go to a
Mexican restaurant will have
folic acid.

37:48.399 --> 37:59.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Dr. Jose Cordero,
now on the
board of the March of Dimes, we
thank you.

37:59.744 --> 38:11.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau
introduced legislation to
legalize physician-assisted

38:11.923 --> 38:13.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
suicide in that country.

38:13.992 --> 38:18.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last year, the Canadian Supreme
Court overturned
a criminal ban against the
practice.

38:18.463 --> 38:23.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we take a moment to
revisit a story
we brought you last year from
special correspondent

38:23.801 --> 38:28.239 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John Larson, who introduced us
to the patient
at the center of the court case.

38:28.339 --> 38:32.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELAYNE SHAPRAY, Suffers From
Multiple Sclerosis:
My pain or discomfort is
virtually constant.

38:33.044 --> 38:38.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: When medically
assisted death
was argued before the Canadian
Supreme Court,

38:38.116 --> 38:40.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Elayne Shapray's statement was
exhibit A.

38:41.085 --> 38:47.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELAYNE SHAPRAY: I cannot move or
turn over
in bed. In effect, I am a
prisoner of my own

38:47.859 --> 38:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
body. I no longer consider my
life worth living
unless I possess the means to
leave it at

38:55.300 --> 38:57.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the time of my choosing.

38:57.202 --> 39:03.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: Shapray was a
nurse, an active
mother of two, until multiple
sclerosis struck.

39:03.274 --> 39:08.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now 68 years old, she can no
longer do much
of anything without help,
including -- and

39:08.980 --> 39:12.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is why she's exhibit A --
take her own
life.

39:13.051 --> 39:18.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How far away are you from that
point where
you would no longer be able to
end your own

39:18.823 --> 39:19.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life?

39:19.791 --> 39:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ELAYNE SHAPRAY: I can see it
from here.

39:21.693 --> 39:25.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: The question of
whether doctors
should be allowed to help people
like Elayne

39:25.463 --> 39:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
die was at the center of the
Canadian Supreme
Court decision.

39:29.567 --> 39:35.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The court ruled that laws making
physician-assisted
death illegal violated
Canadians' constitutional

39:35.974 --> 39:42.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rights in cases where an adult
clearly consents
to the termination of life and
has a grievous

39:42.280 --> 39:49.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and irremediable medical
condition. The most
recent polls show 86 percent of
the Canadian

39:49.254 --> 39:51.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
general public approve.

39:51.222 --> 39:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID LEMON, Canada: There's no
question there's
going to have to be some serious
thought about

39:56.227 --> 39:59.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
finding the right balance, but
it is something
whose time has come. It has to
be.

39:59.998 --> 40:04.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN WAGNER, Canada: I think
people do have
the right to decide for
themselves about the

40:04.168 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end of their life, and how --
the quality
of that.

40:06.337 --> 40:10.241 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN LARSON: The court's
decision left room
for interpretation, however. For
example,

40:10.341 --> 40:15.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a patient's condition must be,
among other
things, severe and incurable.
But that's not

40:15.380 --> 40:20.652 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the same as terminal. For
example, what if
a patient has severe arthritis?
Would they

40:20.752 --> 40:24.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be eligible? Or what if they're
disabled or
mentally ill?

40:25.023 --> 40:30.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Remember, Shapray suffers from
M.S., a debilitating,
but not life-ending disease.

40:30.695 --> 40:33.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not in the end stage of a
terminal
illness.

40:33.164 --> 40:35.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ELAYNE SHAPRAY: It's an
interminable illness.

40:35.833 --> 40:37.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: Interminable.

40:37.769 --> 40:41.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ELAYNE SHAPRAY: Interminable.
How do you weigh
that? How do you measure that,
unless you're

40:41.706 --> 40:43.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sitting in my wheelchair?

40:43.741 --> 40:46.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. WILL JOHNSTON, Euthanasia
Prevention Coalition:
Well, it seems clear from what
the Supreme

40:46.311 --> 40:50.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Court has said that you need not
be terminally
ill to qualify.

40:50.381 --> 40:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: Dr. Will Johnston,
an outspoken
opponent of physician-assisted
death, says

40:55.787 --> 41:02.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the court's liberal language,
that the patient
may suffer from an disease or
disability,

41:02.327 --> 41:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and that suffering is only
defined as intolerable
to the individual, leaves the
door open for

41:08.733 --> 41:10.535 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
abuse.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. WILL JOHNSTON: You do not
even need to
be physically ill, because they
specifically

41:13.671 --> 41:16.941 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stated that psychological
suffering would
qualify as well.

41:17.041 --> 41:20.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRACE PASTINE, British Columbia
Civil Liberties
Association: So what the court
said was that

41:20.144 --> 41:24.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right to assisted dying
should be available
only in narrow circumstances.

41:24.782 --> 41:29.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: Grace Pastine of
the British
Columbia Civil Liberties
Association, which

41:29.287 --> 41:34.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successfully brought the case to
the Supreme
Court, says the specifics of
exactly who will

41:34.425 --> 41:40.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be eligible for assisted dying
have yet to
be determined, but should be
narrowly defined.

41:40.131 --> 41:45.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRACE PASTINE: The court made it
very clear
that physician-assisted dying
would only be

41:45.436 --> 41:50.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an option for individuals who
are mentally
competent and able to make a
fully informed

41:50.842 --> 41:57.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
voluntary choice. I think, for
example, someone
who suffered from a type of
severe mental

41:57.382 --> 42:02.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
illness wouldn't be able to
qualify because
they wouldn't be able to meet
the consent

42:02.653 --> 42:04.555 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
requirements.

42:04.655 --> 42:07.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: Opponents like Dr.
Johnston hope
pain management, palliative
care, will be

42:07.925 --> 42:10.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
sufficient for most patients and
doctors.

42:10.128 --> 42:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. WILL JOHNSTON: We can do
that without
turning our 2,400 years of
medical ethical

42:14.966 --> 42:19.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
history on its head, without
crossing that
bright line between attempting
to treat the

42:19.871 --> 42:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
symptoms of the patient and
intending to kill
the patient.

42:23.341 --> 42:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LESLIE LAFOREST, Suffers From
Cancer: But
many, many people do not, in
fact, have that

42:26.911 --> 42:28.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
painless death.

42:28.780 --> 42:33.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: Leslie Laforest was
diagnosed
three years ago with a
recurrence of her stage

42:33.851 --> 42:39.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
four anal cancer. But although
her cancer
is in remission, she knows, if
it returns,

42:39.724 --> 42:41.826 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
her death could be prolonged and
painful.

42:41.926 --> 42:47.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LESLIE LAFOREST: I have
absolutely the strongest
will that I will not go through
that final

42:47.231 --> 42:49.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
chapter, whenever that comes.

42:49.133 --> 42:53.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: Laforest testified
in the case
that went to the Supreme Court
that current

42:53.337 --> 42:59.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
law would force her to take her
life early,
while she could still do it
herself, a point

42:59.444 --> 43:01.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that the high court referenced
in its decision.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Here's your medicine,
Elayne.

43:03.681 --> 43:08.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: When the case went
to the Supreme
Court, lawyers requested Elayne
Shapray be

43:08.186 --> 43:13.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
given special consideration, a
waiver that
would allow a doctor to end her
life while

43:13.891 --> 43:19.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the government writes a new law.
The court
turned her down, meaning Elayne
will have

43:19.664 --> 43:23.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to wait a full year before a
doctor could
legally end her life.

43:23.534 --> 43:25.436 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: You feel like you
have a year?

43:25.536 --> 43:33.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELAYNE SHAPRAY: I think I would
rather not
answer that question.

43:33.211 --> 43:35.646 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN LARSON: For "NewsHour,"
John Larson in
Vancouver, British Columbia.

43:35.746 --> 43:41.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

it is not far-reaching enough.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, another
installment
in our Brief But Spectacular
series, where

44:01.839 --> 44:04.642 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we ask interesting people to
describe their
passions.

44:04.742 --> 44:10.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from actor and
writer Danny
Strong. He's written such films
as "The Butler,"

44:10.548 --> 44:17.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HBO's "Recount," "Game Change,"
and the popular
FOX TV series "Empire," which he
co-created.

44:18.055 --> 44:23.094 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Strong is about to direct a
feature film called
"Rebel in the Rye" starring
Kevin Spacey,

44:23.194 --> 44:24.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
which he also wrote.

44:25.096 --> 44:28.499 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
DANNY STRONG,
Actor/Writer/Director: I think
there's a common saying that to
write what

44:28.599 --> 44:30.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you know.

44:30.501 --> 44:36.240 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that that is good
advice for an
amateur writer. But a
professional writer

44:36.340 --> 44:40.578 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
should write what they're
passionate about.

44:40.678 --> 44:49.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I was a full-time actor, my
entire existence
was based on waiting for my
agent to call.

44:49.754 --> 44:54.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wrote a script for me to star
in as an actor,
which is a very common thing in
Hollywood,

44:54.458 --> 44:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it was going to turn me into
the Sylvester
Stallone of my time. I was
convinced that

44:58.763 --> 45:00.665 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this was my "Rocky."

45:00.765 --> 45:04.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I gave it to a few producer
friends. And
they read it, and they all said
the same thing:

45:04.235 --> 45:08.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"We really love this. Can we try
and get this
movie made without you
attached?"

45:08.973 --> 45:11.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I thought, no, this is my
"Rocky."

45:11.609 --> 45:14.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By the way, that film has still
never been
made, so probably not the best
decision.

45:14.512 --> 45:20.985 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I had written several
scripts over several
years. And these scripts were
all really high-concept

45:21.085 --> 45:26.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comedies like "Liar Liar" or
"Bruce Almighty,"
because those were the movies
that were really

45:26.657 --> 45:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
big hits at that time. Nobody
would buy them,
let alone make the movie.

45:31.295 --> 45:36.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And after five years of that, I
started to
get pretty despondent. I
realized that I was

45:36.734 --> 45:42.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
writing movies that I would
never go see.
And I decided literally in that
moment that

45:42.373 --> 45:47.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I wasn't going to write another
script unless
it was a movie that I would
actually want

45:47.345 --> 45:49.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to go see.

45:49.280 --> 45:53.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I went to go see this play
called "Stuff
Happens" about the buildup to
the Iraq War.

45:53.284 --> 45:59.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Seeing the audience respond to
this play,
I thought to myself, this is why
I went into

45:59.156 --> 46:04.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the arts in the first place. And
within 30
seconds of me making that
decision, the idea

46:04.695 --> 46:06.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the Florida recount popped
into my head.

46:06.797 --> 46:13.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, lo and behold, four months
later, I find
myself at HBO in the lobby ready
to go pitch

46:13.904 --> 46:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president of HBO Films. And
I'm sitting
with my producer, Len Amato, and
I said to

46:18.776 --> 46:23.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, "I can't believe that I
actually made
it here, that I'm actually in
the lobby of

46:23.347 --> 46:24.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HBO about to pitch this
project."

46:25.049 --> 46:28.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he looked at me and he said,
"It's a better
story if you sell it."

46:28.919 --> 46:34.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every script I have written,
"Recount," and
"Game Change," and "The Butler,"
and "Empire,"

46:34.392 --> 46:39.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all of those projects had
nothing to do with
my life. So, I have no insider
knowledge.

46:39.397 --> 46:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have no professional
background.

46:41.866 --> 46:47.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They all have the same thing in
common, which
is, I'm really interested and
passionate about

46:47.638 --> 46:49.473 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the subject matter.

46:49.573 --> 46:54.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
My name is Danny Strong and that
was by Brief
But Spectacular take on writing
what you don't

46:54.812 --> 46:56.580 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know.

46:56.681 --> 47:00.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

to build the world's tallest
building, with

47:09.627 --> 47:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
two towers expected in the
coming years that
will upstage Dubai's famous Burj
Khalifa,

47:16.000 --> 47:21.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
but history suggests
differently. And that's
on our home page.
