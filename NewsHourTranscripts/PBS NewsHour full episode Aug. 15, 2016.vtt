On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Louisiana underwater.

00:11.378 --> 00:19.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At least six are dead and 20,000
rescued from
flooding, as ongoing rains
threaten more damage.

00:19.386 --> 00:25.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead: Hillary Clinton and
Donald Trump
sharpen their focus on key
battleground states,

00:25.225 --> 00:32.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Trump's campaign chief is
alleged to have
accepted secret cash payments
from pro-Russian

00:32.099 --> 00:33.934 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Ukraine.

00:33.967 --> 00:39.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Syria's hospitals become
killing grounds,
as airstrikes target the few
medical facilities

00:40.007 --> 00:41.875 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
left in that ravaged country.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WIDNEY BROWN, Director of
Programs, Physicians
for Human Rights: When you
target a hospital,

00:44.711 --> 00:48.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you don't just destroy that
brick-and-mortar
structure.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You destroy actually a safe
place that people
can go for lifesaving aid.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more

JUDY WOODRUFF: Swathes of
Southern Louisiana
are still underwater after a
weekend of historic

01:13.473 --> 01:14.908 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
flooding.

01:14.942 --> 01:18.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At least six people died and
thousands have
had to leave their homes.

01:18.278 --> 01:23.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As far as the eye could see,
there was water.

01:23.116 --> 01:27.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The rising floodwaters took many
in Louisiana
by surprise.

01:27.721 --> 01:34.361 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Whole neighborhoods were
submerged, and more
than 20,000 people were forced
to evacuate.

01:34.394 --> 01:38.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By today, many had managed to
make it to makeshift
shelters on higher ground.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TORINA HEBERT, Flood Victim: My
house was
underwater.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I have three children.

01:40.901 --> 01:46.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My sister lives in the Sherwood
Forest area,
and she was on top of her roof.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she has five children.

01:48.508 --> 01:51.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KATHRYN SAPPE, Flood Victim: It
was pretty
scary because we didn't know how
high the

01:51.178 --> 01:53.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
waters were going to rise or how
fast they
were going to rise.

01:53.914 --> 01:56.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We just got out of there before
it was too
late.

01:56.316 --> 02:00.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Since Friday, the
state has
been battered by an onslaught of
torrential

02:00.854 --> 02:02.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rain.

02:02.656 --> 02:08.261 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Baton Rouge and the
surrounding area, the
Amite River surged to more than
40s feet.

02:08.295 --> 02:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lafayette and its suburbs were
inundated as
well.

02:12.566 --> 02:16.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Louisiana Governor John Bel
Edwards visited
Lafayette Parish today.

GOV.

02:18.338 --> 02:19.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BEL EDWARDS (D), Louisiana:
We're going
to transition into a recovery
phase as we

02:19.172 --> 02:20.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
can here.

02:20.974 --> 02:25.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to make every bit of
assistance
available to you as soon as we
possibly can.

02:25.212 --> 02:27.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's my commitment as
governor.

02:27.147 --> 02:32.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Rescue operations
are still
under way, and crews worked all
weekend to

02:32.919 --> 02:37.391 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pull stranded victims from their
homes.

02:37.424 --> 02:44.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others rescued trapped drivers
as water surged
into their cars.

02:44.131 --> 02:48.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's unclear when evacuees will
be allowed
to go home.

02:48.068 --> 02:52.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 10,000 people are
being housed in
local shelters.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Others are relying on the
kindness of their
neighbors.

02:55.108 --> 02:59.513 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: They are the most kind,
amazing people
ever.

02:59.546 --> 03:02.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I owe them so much.

03:02.082 --> 03:08.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Louisiana's
insurance commissioner
estimates 75 percent of those
affected by

03:08.088 --> 03:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the flooding do not have flood
insurance.

03:12.492 --> 03:16.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Turning to the campaign for the
White house,
the candidates showed up in
hard-fought states,

03:16.930 --> 03:22.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where the race is closest,
focusing on national
security, while slamming shots
at each other.

Lisa Desjardins reports.

LISA DESJARDINS: To the campaign
battleground
of Youngstown, Ohio, Donald
Trump brought

03:29.109 --> 03:34.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his outline of a more protective
America,
generally less involved
overseas, but more

03:34.281 --> 03:36.416 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
focused on fighting the Islamic
State.

03:36.450 --> 03:41.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
If I become president, the era
of nation-building

03:41.555 --> 03:45.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will be brought to a very swift
and decisive
end.

(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:47.227 --> 03:50.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The Republican
nominee outlined
three broad points.

03:50.764 --> 03:54.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would hold joint military
operations with
any country fighting ISIS.

03:54.901 --> 03:59.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The campaign confirmed that
could include
current U.S. adversary and
Syrian leader Bashar

03:59.940 --> 04:01.341 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
al-Assad.

04:01.374 --> 04:04.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He would ask law enforcement
here to find
new ways to I.D. radicals.

04:04.878 --> 04:10.684 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he would freeze immigration
from regions
where background checks are too
difficult,

04:10.717 --> 04:12.486 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
while adding a new test.

04:12.519 --> 04:19.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: The time is
overdue to develop
new screening test for the
threats we face

04:19.626 --> 04:21.695 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

04:21.728 --> 04:25.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I call it extreme vetting.

04:25.098 --> 04:30.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I call it extreme, extreme
vetting.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our country has enough problems.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't need more.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these are problems like we
have never
had before.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.746 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%

04:43.717 --> 04:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump's national security
credentials with
his own words.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Putin did call me
a genius.

04:48.388 --> 04:49.689 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARRY MCCAFFREY (RET.), U.S.
Army: His comments
are impulsive.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.459 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're unsettling.

04:52.492 --> 04:58.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The anti-Trump
theme dominated,
as Clinton took the stage in
Scranton, Pennsylvania,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with native son and Vice
President Joe Biden.

05:00.700 --> 05:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN, Vice President of
the United
States: I was proud.

05:03.537 --> 05:08.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My son Beau served for a year in
Iraq, came
back highly decorated soldier.

05:08.875 --> 05:10.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

05:10.677 --> 05:14.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSEPH BIDEN: I must tell you, I
must tell
you, had Donald Trump been
president, I would

05:14.214 --> 05:16.550 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have thrown my body in front of
him.

05:16.583 --> 05:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, I really mean it, to keep
him from going,
if the judgment was based on
Trump's decision.

05:23.490 --> 05:26.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Clinton
repeated her attack
on Trump's preparedness.

05:26.693 --> 05:30.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Sometimes, he says won't tell
anyone what

05:30.964 --> 05:34.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he will do because he wants to
keep his plan
-- quote -- "secret."

05:34.534 --> 05:35.936 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

05:35.969 --> 05:40.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And then
it turns
out secret is, he has no plan.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

05:41.841 --> 05:43.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: And that
was very
clear when he said, "I know more
about ISIS

05:43.143 --> 05:44.177 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than the generals."

05:44.211 --> 05:46.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No, no, Donald, you don't.

candidates
have insisted the other is not
fit to be president.

05:51.818 --> 05:57.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

after a second night of protests
in a Milwaukee
neighborhood.

06:08.001 --> 06:14.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

a stolen handgun.

We have issues
in this city.

06:28.788 --> 06:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We know there are issues.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's too much poverty, there
are housing
issues, there are public safety
issues, there

06:33.960 --> 06:35.595 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are education issues.

06:35.629 --> 06:43.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
None of those issues get
addressed if your
intent is to inflict property or
personal

06:43.870 --> 06:46.706 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
damage in this great

It's one of 11 major fires
burning across

Major hotel chains in 10 states
and the District

hackers.

08:16.229 --> 08:23.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Malware was installed on the

back as March
of 2015.

08:26.873 --> 08:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company that manages the
hotels insists
the security breach has been

There's no immediate word how
many customers
were affected.

08:37.183 --> 08:43.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A banner day on Wall Street: All
three major
stock indexes closed at record
highs, driven

08:43.757 --> 08:47.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in part by gains in the chemical
and the mining
sectors.

08:47.227 --> 08:53.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average

09:00.006 --> 09:05.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And at the Summer Olympic Games,
U.S. gymnast
Laurie Hernandez won silver in

09:05.879 --> 09:07.781 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
new revelations

chair to Ukraine's

09:30.904 --> 09:38.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pro-Russian party; on Politics
Monday, Hillary
Clinton's edge in key swing
states; doctors

09:38.378 --> 09:48.421 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
desperately trying to save lives

09:48.421 --> 09:55.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
desperately trying to save lives
amid Syrian
airstrikes; and much more.

09:55.762 --> 10:00.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how political unrest in
Ukraine has made
its way into the race for
president of the

10:00.433 --> 10:02.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
United States.

10:02.402 --> 10:08.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before becoming Donald Trump's
campaign manager,
Paul Manafort consulted for
Viktor Yanukovych,

10:08.074 --> 10:14.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the former Ukrainian president
who fled to
Russia in 2014 and later faced
charges in

10:14.180 --> 10:16.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the deaths of civilian
protesters.

10:16.749 --> 10:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yanukovych's removal exposed a
political system
in Kiev rife with corruption.

10:22.021 --> 10:28.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, The New York Times
reports of a -- quote
-- "black ledger" that allegedly
links Manafort

10:28.461 --> 10:32.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to millions of dollars in secret
cash payments.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has the story.

10:34.000 --> 10:39.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The papers were
discovered by Ukraine's
newly formed National
Anti-Corruption Bureau.

10:39.239 --> 10:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some 400 pages of handwritten
notes, Paul
Manafort's name appears 22 times
over the

10:45.812 --> 10:51.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
course of five years, totaling
$12.7 million.

10:51.317 --> 10:55.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times' Moscow
correspondent,
Andrew Kramer, is one of the
reporters who

10:55.121 --> 10:58.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wrote the story, and he joins us
now from
Moscow.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Andrew, thanks for being with
us.

11:00.727 --> 11:04.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Andrew, first of all, tell us
exactly what
it was that they found.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What were these ledgers?

11:06.099 --> 11:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where was the money coming from?

11:07.734 --> 11:09.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What were the payments for?

11:09.135 --> 11:11.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANDREW KRAMER, The New York
Times: Those are
all very good questions.

11:11.170 --> 11:12.939 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

11:12.972 --> 11:18.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The ledger is called in Ukraine
the black
ledger, and it's a collection of
papers, perhaps

11:18.177 --> 11:23.082 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
400 pages, as you mentioned,
with handwritten
notes describing payments from
the Party of

11:23.116 --> 11:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Regions, which is a pro-Russian
political
party that Paul Manafort worked
for before

11:28.121 --> 11:33.560 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
becoming manager of the
Republican campaign
this year in the United States.

11:33.593 --> 11:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The outlays described in this
ledger included
legitimate campaign expenses,
such as advertising,

11:39.866 --> 11:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
travel for candidates, and also
illegal activities
under any definition, such as
payments to

11:46.940 --> 11:51.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the electoral commission of
Ukraine, members
of the electoral commission
receiving money

11:51.311 --> 11:53.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from this same fund.

11:53.846 --> 11:59.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to the ledger, there
is also mention
of Paul Manafort.

11:59.185 --> 12:05.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, at the same time, you have a
payment for
a campaign consultant, there are
outlays to

12:05.091 --> 12:08.161 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
potentially illegal activities
like bribing.

12:08.194 --> 12:10.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Where the money came from, also
a very good
question.

12:10.830 --> 12:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke with a senior member of
the Party
of Regions who described using
the system

12:14.968 --> 12:16.936 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
before he left the party.

12:16.970 --> 12:22.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said that the money was,
in part, undocumented
campaign contributions to the
Party of Regions

12:23.009 --> 12:27.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also money extorted from
business owners
in Ukraine by the party.

12:27.714 --> 12:30.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Why is this
significant?

12:30.049 --> 12:37.190 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why is the fact that Manafort's
name is on
this ledger at this sum of $12.7
million,

12:37.223 --> 12:38.992 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
why is this significant?

12:39.025 --> 12:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANDREW KRAMER: Well, I think
it's significant
because the Trump campaign has
made Russia

12:42.996 --> 12:45.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an issue this year.

12:45.431 --> 12:49.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump has spoken favorably
of President
Vladimir Putin.

12:49.302 --> 12:54.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There was a hack of the
Democratic National
Committee e-mail system, which
has been blamed

12:54.240 --> 12:57.110 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the U.S. security services on
Russia.

12:57.143 --> 13:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And many members of his campaign
staff have
experience in this part of the
world, most

13:02.315 --> 13:04.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
notably Mr. Manafort.

13:04.317 --> 13:10.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is why we spent time to
look into Mr.
Manafort's business dealings and
political

13:10.390 --> 13:12.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
activities in Ukraine over the
past decade.

13:12.659 --> 13:17.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And remind us of
Viktor Yanukovych,
the former president of Ukraine,
who was one

13:17.697 --> 13:21.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Manafort's clients, as well
as the party.

13:21.634 --> 13:26.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remind us of who he is, what he
did and his
relationship with Vladimir
Putin.

13:26.172 --> 13:28.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW KRAMER: Certainly.

13:28.074 --> 13:35.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Yanukovych was prime
minister and then
president of Ukraine with a
generally pro-Russian

13:35.448 --> 13:42.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
line to his politics, although
he did also
negotiate with the European
Union to join

13:42.822 --> 13:47.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a trade agreement, eventually,
instead of
choosing that agreement,
choosing the alternative

13:47.860 --> 13:53.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade agreement with Russia,
which was the
cause of a large popular
uprising in Ukraine

13:53.399 --> 13:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in 2014 that led to his ouster.

13:56.602 --> 13:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia,
where he's
still living.

13:59.639 --> 14:04.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And we should point
out that Mr.
Manafort said -- quote -- "The
suggestion

14:04.677 --> 14:09.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I accepted cash payments is
unfounded,
silly and nonsensical."

14:09.482 --> 14:13.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He also included in his
statement that all
of his political payments are
all-inclusive.

14:13.653 --> 14:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They go for paying for staff,
for polling,
for research and advertising.

14:18.725 --> 14:24.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does that jibe -- what he
said in his
statement, how does that jibe
with what the

14:24.363 --> 14:26.165 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
anti-corruption unit found?

14:26.199 --> 14:30.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANDREW KRAMER: The
anti-corruption found his
name mentioned in this ledger,
according to

14:30.203 --> 14:33.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a statement from the
Anti-Corruption Bureau.

14:33.039 --> 14:37.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They could not prove that he
actually received
the money, because they don't
know the signatures

14:37.143 --> 14:39.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
beside these line items in the
ledger.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's conceivable that somebody
else may have
taken this money, for example,
and deposited

14:43.449 --> 14:49.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it into a company that sent the
money to Mr.
Manafort.

14:49.355 --> 14:52.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
This is clearly an
under-the-table payment
in any case.

14:52.658 --> 14:57.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And from what I understand of
his statement,
he doesn't dispute the sum
involved or that

14:57.063 --> 15:01.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was paid for his work in
Ukraine, but,
rather, the nature of the
payment, that it

15:01.634 --> 15:03.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was an under-the-table payment.

15:03.469 --> 15:07.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And your story also
talked about
some of the other business
dealings that Paul

15:07.440 --> 15:14.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Manafort had in Ukraine and
their connections
with people connected to
Yanukovych.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.082 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANDREW KRAMER: That's right.

15:16.115 --> 15:19.919 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, it's said you can do
good while
doing well.

15:19.952 --> 15:26.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while he was doing what was
said to be
a good deed of promoting
democracy in Ukraine,

15:26.592 --> 15:28.661 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he was also doing well.

15:28.694 --> 15:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The -- there -- several
opportunities open
for lucrative side deals during
his period

15:33.966 --> 15:35.768 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Ukraine.

15:35.802 --> 15:39.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We examined one of them in
particular involving
the purchase of a cable
television station

15:39.272 --> 15:45.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Southern Ukraine, in Odessa,
that was orchestrated
through a series of offshore
shell companies.

15:45.178 --> 15:49.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These same companies were used
by members
of the inner circle of the
Yanukovych government

15:50.016 --> 15:54.987 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to launder money obtained
through corrupt
means from Ukraine.

15:55.021 --> 16:00.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The indication is that Mr.
Manafort was doing
business with or intended to do
business with

16:00.059 --> 16:05.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this venal and corrupt group of
people who
led that country for about a
decade.

16:05.398 --> 16:09.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Andrew Kramer of The
New York Times,
thanks for joining us to talk
about your reporting.

16:09.502 --> 16:12.605 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANDREW KRAMER: Thank you very
much.

16:12.638 --> 16:17.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now for much
more on the
twists and turns of this
presidential race,

16:17.910 --> 16:25.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we turn to Politics Monday with
Tamara Keith
of NPR and Susan Page of USA
Today.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And welcome to you both.

16:26.586 --> 16:30.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Tam Keith, we have been
listening to this
report.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How significant is this?

16:31.891 --> 16:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: It's
unclear that this is going to
dramatically

16:34.060 --> 16:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change anything for the Trump
campaign.

16:36.729 --> 16:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some ways, the idea of some
connection
to Russia or something has long
existed, especially

16:45.838 --> 16:52.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
around Paul Manafort, who has a
relatively
long career of working for not
just Yanukovych,

16:52.812 --> 16:58.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but other, you would say,
unsavory characters
or people who have fallen out of
political

16:58.284 --> 17:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
favor with the U.S. government
over the decades.

17:01.287 --> 17:05.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan Page,
I mean, we
heard some pretty strong
language there from

17:05.892 --> 17:11.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The New York Times reporters
speaking about
venal corruption.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a pretty picture.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
You got 84 days until the
campaign, and every

17:15.201 --> 17:19.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
day you spend talking about
anything except
Hillary Clinton's record or what
your own

17:19.138 --> 17:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vision of the country is, is a
day that's
lost.

17:22.909 --> 17:27.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In addition, I think this opens
the doors
to more queries about Donald
Trump's own financial

17:27.914 --> 17:29.682 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arrangements with interests in
Russia.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's something that we have
heard something
about.

17:31.517 --> 17:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't have a lot of details.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We may learn more about that in
the next couple
of months.

17:35.087 --> 17:39.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, there was
another newspaper
today writing about Donald
Trump, Tamara Keith,

17:39.525 --> 17:41.394 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The Wall Street Journal
editorial page.

17:41.427 --> 17:46.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is a consistently
conservative newspaper,
usually very strong language in
support of

17:46.732 --> 17:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conservative causes.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Today, they laid it on the line.

17:49.802 --> 17:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said, Donald Trump, you
either get your
act together, in so many words,
by Labor Day,

17:53.606 --> 17:56.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is three weeks from now,
or turn it
over to Mike Pence.

17:56.609 --> 18:01.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: There is a lot of
frustration
that is expressed in this
editorial that I

18:01.280 --> 18:03.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hear a lot talking to
Republicans.

18:03.349 --> 18:06.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I talked to a Republican
pollster today.

18:06.585 --> 18:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, he worked for Marco Rubio,
but he told
me that expecting Donald Trump
to change is

18:12.792 --> 18:16.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
like marrying someone and then
hoping they
will change later.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, generally, he said, that
doesn't work
out very well.

18:19.598 --> 18:24.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I talked to another Republican
today who said,
well, that teleprompter speech
he gave about

18:24.637 --> 18:26.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
foreign policy, that was solid.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which he gave
today in Ohio.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Exactly.

18:29.408 --> 18:31.477 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's done several of these
teleprompter speeches.

18:31.510 --> 18:34.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what this Republican said
was, let's see
how long it lasts.

18:34.380 --> 18:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's see if he can stay on
message a day,
two days, seven days, two weeks.

18:39.919 --> 18:44.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this person was calling for
cutting him
loose, for moving millions of
dollars to focus

18:44.690 --> 18:49.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on congressional races, and not
spend that
money on a presidential race.

18:49.495 --> 18:53.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, is there
particular
weight, though, that this come
from The Wall

18:53.165 --> 18:55.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Street Journal editorial page?

18:55.034 --> 18:58.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: It's one more sign
of the fracturing
of the traditional Republican
coalition.

18:58.270 --> 19:03.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's the media side, the
editorial page side
that's been the strongest voice
for Republicanism

19:03.876 --> 19:07.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and especially conservatism in
the United
States.

19:07.213 --> 19:12.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in addition, you see the
foreign policy
establishment associated with
Republican presidents

19:12.585 --> 19:14.320 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
breaking away.

19:14.353 --> 19:17.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You see senator after senator, a
half-dozen
Republican sitting senators,
saying they may

19:17.990 --> 19:19.925 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
not vote for Donald Trump.

19:19.959 --> 19:23.629 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is a party that is
imploding.

19:23.662 --> 19:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's a sign of a civil war
that we're
going to see when this election
is over.

19:27.700 --> 19:31.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tamara, one of
the things that
the Journal editorial said was,
they basically

19:31.170 --> 19:34.040 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
called the Trump campaign
incompetent.

19:34.073 --> 19:38.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do the experts see the
campaign compared
to Hillary Clinton's effort?

19:38.044 --> 19:43.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, experts I
have spoken
to say that this is basically
campaign malpractice.

19:43.149 --> 19:48.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not a fully functioning
campaign, like
you would expect a campaign to
function, like

19:49.021 --> 19:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a campaign that would win would
function.

19:51.390 --> 19:54.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Donald Trump doesn't want
that.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not like he necessarily
can't put it
together.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.031 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He doesn't want to put it
together.

19:59.065 --> 20:05.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He over the weekend tweeted
repeatedly that
he's not changing, there is no
pivot.

20:05.805 --> 20:09.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People just want him to change,
but he's not
changing.

20:09.575 --> 20:13.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, in some ways, it's kind of
like, you have
to listen to him.

20:13.979 --> 20:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He doesn't want to run ads.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He thinks he can do free media.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's doing -- he's running this
the way he
wants it.

20:19.819 --> 20:24.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, the
Trump campaign,
you ask them, and they say, yes,
we do have

20:24.690 --> 20:26.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
an effort under way, we have a
plan, we have
a strategy.

20:26.692 --> 20:30.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: So, they don't have
the historic
vision of a campaign that we're
all accustomed

20:30.129 --> 20:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to, but I will tell you one
number that I
think is of great concern to
Republicans.

20:33.599 --> 20:38.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is, since we started
with polling
in 1952, the candidate who is
ahead at this

20:38.671 --> 20:44.877 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point two weeks after the
conventions are
over, has invariably won the
popular vote.

20:44.910 --> 20:48.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you're getting to a point
where the election
starts to get cooked.

20:48.147 --> 20:54.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not quite baked yet, but it
is like concrete
getting set, getting harder and
harder.

20:54.420 --> 21:00.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it takes -- it takes more
and more power
to change what's been laid as
you go forward.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is really -- even though
we're still
in the summer, we're still in
August, this

21:03.496 --> 21:06.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is a pretty critical period if
you look at
elections historically.

21:06.565 --> 21:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I do want to
get to Hillary
Clinton.

21:08.434 --> 21:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the polls, Tamara Keith, are
showing that
it's not just in the
battleground states where

21:12.838 --> 21:18.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton is ahead, but
it's in states
that Mitt Romney and John McCain
won where

21:18.077 --> 21:19.979 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump is having
difficulty right now.

21:20.012 --> 21:24.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Or where the
demographics have
changed a little bit since Mitt
Romney and

21:24.416 --> 21:26.785 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
John McCain ran.

21:26.819 --> 21:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a state like Georgia, where
it's suddenly
looking a little bit more
competitive, it

21:31.490 --> 21:35.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- I think that to say that
Hillary Clinton
can compete in Georgia at this
point still

21:35.661 --> 21:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seems like a bridge farther than
a lot of
people are willing to go.

21:40.866 --> 21:46.605 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But North Carolina, for
instance, is a state
certainly where the Clinton
campaign believes

21:46.639 --> 21:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that they have a chance to win
this.

21:49.175 --> 21:51.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they can, that would be a
huge problem
for Donald Trump.

21:51.777 --> 21:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, just
quickly, your
newspaper had a poll today
looking at millennials

21:55.814 --> 21:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that vote, young voters under
35.

21:57.550 --> 22:02.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And the historic
weakness by Donald
Trump among these younger
voters.

22:02.154 --> 22:05.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's only getting 20 percent of
the vote of
millennials.

22:05.224 --> 22:07.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, they are the least reliable
voters by
age.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Older people are more likely to
turn out to
the polls.

22:10.029 --> 22:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we have never seen a
candidate in modern
times have that poor a showing
of millennials.

22:14.633 --> 22:18.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if that trend continues, it
will be the
third consecutive election where
Democrats

22:18.871 --> 22:22.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will have beaten the Republican
by double
digits among younger voters.

22:22.775 --> 22:27.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you look at the long-term
future of
this party, that starts to set
partisan preferences

22:27.046 --> 22:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in a way that's really dangerous
for the GOP.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Hillary
Clinton, Tamara
Keith, was out on the trail
today with Vice

22:32.184 --> 22:38.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Biden, working-class
Scranton, Pennsylvania,
on a day when Donald Trump is
out hammering

22:38.123 --> 22:40.326 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away on national security, on
ISIS.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is she as vulnerable as Donald
Trump makes
her out to be?

22:43.462 --> 22:47.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He at one point said, she's not
capable of
handling ISIS.

22:47.333 --> 22:51.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: He also implied
that she may
not be healthy enough to handle
ISIS.

22:51.937 --> 22:55.374 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was a little bit of that
in there.

22:55.407 --> 23:01.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an area where sometimes
she doesn't
talk about it with the urgency
that he talks

23:01.847 --> 23:05.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about it, and that might give
him a little
bit of space.

23:05.651 --> 23:12.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But many polls are now showing
that people
believe Hillary Clinton does
have the temperament

23:12.057 --> 23:15.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on foreign policy in a way that
some voters
have concerns about Donald
Trump.

23:15.995 --> 23:19.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But he does come
back to that
language, Susan, time and again,
suggesting

23:19.565 --> 23:23.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that she just -- she wouldn't be
capable,
she wouldn't be strong enough to
stand up

23:23.636 --> 23:25.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to something like ISIS.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: And if you want to
look at the
biggest problem Hillary Clinton
has, it's

23:27.406 --> 23:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that this is an electorate that
wants change,
wants change in terms of the
battle against

23:31.310 --> 23:36.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorism, wants change in terms
of the growing
equality in the U.S. system.

23:37.016 --> 23:41.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there is an argument to
be made against
Hillary Clinton, who is, as
Donald Trump would

23:41.420 --> 23:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say, a third term of Barack
Obama.

23:43.589 --> 23:48.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question is, is Donald Trump
the person
who can prosecute the case
against Hillary

23:48.260 --> 23:49.461 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Clinton?

23:49.495 --> 23:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Tamara, what
do we think
about that?

23:51.263 --> 23:57.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is -- because if he does -- say
he gives a
speech about ISIS every other
day between

23:57.569 --> 23:59.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
now and the election.

23:59.872 --> 24:01.974 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can that -- is that the kind of
thing that
can move voters?

24:02.007 --> 24:05.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, I mean, he
would have
to do just those.

24:05.411 --> 24:07.212 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Speeches.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: He would have to
do just the
teleprompter, and not the big
raucous rallies

24:09.682 --> 24:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where he gets -- that, really,
they fuel him
and they give him a ton of
energy.

24:14.119 --> 24:20.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But at those raucous rallies, a
more nuanced
argument about whether the Iraq
pullout should

24:20.092 --> 24:26.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have happened at the pace that
it did becomes
Barack Obama founded ISIS, and
then becomes,

24:26.131 --> 24:31.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you know, a day of doubling
down, and then
a day of tweeting about sarcasm.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, just
quickly, Susan, it's
not just that.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.742 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's -- he will keep coming back
to the e-mails,
the 30,000 e-mails.

24:36.775 --> 24:38.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He brings it up every chance he
gets.

24:38.444 --> 24:39.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: That's right.

24:39.445 --> 24:42.014 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is a vulnerability for
Hillary Clinton.

24:42.047 --> 24:47.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But her attack on him is that he
doesn't have
the temperament or the
disposition to handle

24:47.286 --> 24:49.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the job of president.

24:49.054 --> 24:52.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And especially when it comes to
the issue
of commander in chief, that is
an argument

24:52.758 --> 24:54.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that has gotten some traction
with American
voters.

24:54.960 --> 25:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Page,
Tamara Keith, thank
you both very much, 85 days to
go.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.136 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

25:04.169 --> 25:10.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Countdown clock.

25:10.142 --> 25:13.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

25:13.979 --> 25:19.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": Are
we safer
now than we were on 9/11?; and
photography

25:19.985 --> 25:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that makes us rethink privacy in
a world full
of cameras.

25:24.857 --> 25:32.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: The years-long fight
to control
Syria's largest city, Aleppo,
grinds on, with

25:32.097 --> 25:35.901 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
civilians stuck between rebel
and government
forces.

25:35.934 --> 25:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last week, more than two dozen
Syrian physicians
there wrote a letter to
President Obama urging

25:41.473 --> 25:44.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him to take action to end the
carnage.

25:44.309 --> 25:48.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Only 35 physicians remain to
serve more than
300,000 people.

25:48.447 --> 25:54.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They wrote, in part, because
they themselves
are under attack, the people
whose mission

25:54.253 --> 25:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is to help the civilians
caught in the
crossfire.

25:58.157 --> 26:04.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they are hit in the places
that should
be safest, hospitals and other
medical facilities.

26:04.196 --> 26:09.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Special correspondent Marcia
Biggs reports
now from Southern Turkey near
the Syrian border.

26:09.868 --> 26:14.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: This story
contains images
that may upset some viewers.

26:14.440 --> 26:21.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It is a war crime
to target
medical facilities, but, in
Syria, bombs rain

26:21.280 --> 26:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down on hospitals, doctors and
patients.

26:25.117 --> 26:30.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just in the last few weeks,
pro-government
forces bombed a maternity
hospital in Idlib,

26:30.189 --> 26:31.990 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
supported by Save the Children.

26:32.024 --> 26:35.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And airstrikes hit six hospitals
around Aleppo.

26:35.594 --> 26:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nurses gathered babies from
their incubators,
the strike narrowly missing
their ward.

26:41.934 --> 26:44.970 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rami Kalazi is no stranger to
airstrikes like
these.

26:45.003 --> 26:46.638 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI, Forced to Leave
Syria: I was
sleeping here, and my colleague
is here.

26:48.207 --> 26:50.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And the attack happened.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.777 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We came out alive.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.145 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't know how.

26:53.178 --> 26:56.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Kalazi was one of
Aleppo's last
remaining doctors.

26:56.915 --> 26:58.784 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We caught up with him in Turkey.

26:58.817 --> 27:01.487 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said he believes these
hospitals were targeted.

27:01.520 --> 27:02.654 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

27:02.688 --> 27:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: They are the artery
of life in
the city.

27:05.057 --> 27:07.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you imagine a life in city
without hospitals?

27:07.326 --> 27:09.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who will treat your kids?

27:09.428 --> 27:13.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Who will make the surgeries for
the injured
people?

27:13.365 --> 27:18.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they are targeting these
hospitals because
they know, if these hospitals
were completely

27:18.904 --> 27:21.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
destroyed, the life will be
completely destroyed.

27:21.607 --> 27:27.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Eastern Aleppo had
already suffered
a massive blow in April, when Al
Quds Hospital,

27:27.346 --> 27:32.584 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
supported by Doctors Without
Borders, and
the city's main pediatric
hospital, was destroyed

27:32.618 --> 27:34.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by two consecutive airstrikes.

27:34.086 --> 27:35.053 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: It was a very hard
night.

27:37.122 --> 27:42.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every one or two hour, we had an
airstrike,
and we had to treat some injured
people.

27:42.327 --> 27:48.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Soon he realized
the full extent
of the damage, more than 50
people dead, including

27:48.567 --> 27:50.302 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
six members of hospital staff.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.303 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.804 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: They were all
friends.

27:52.838 --> 27:57.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, it was emotionally so hard,
because you
are treating your friend.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You know how hard is that.

27:59.978 --> 28:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you see that he is in
danger, he may not
live, he may not survive.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a horrible night.

28:07.119 --> 28:12.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: One of them,
35-year-old Waseem
Maaz, seen here on that fateful
night, was

28:12.124 --> 28:16.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a beloved pediatrician, one of
only two in
the entire city.

28:16.828 --> 28:19.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He was just beginning his shift.

28:19.264 --> 28:20.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Moments later, disaster.

28:20.899 --> 28:23.001 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What has Syria lost there?

28:23.035 --> 28:24.803 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

28:24.836 --> 28:28.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: Can you imagine,
when you have
more than 300,000 people in your
city, and

28:28.740 --> 28:32.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you have only two pediatricians,
and you have
lost one?

28:32.611 --> 28:36.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Can you imagine how much the
loss is big?

28:36.481 --> 28:41.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: According to
Physicians for
Human Rights, there have been
over 375 strikes

28:41.720 --> 28:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against medical facilities and
doctors in
Syria since the revolution
began.

28:45.857 --> 28:49.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their report stipulates that
over 90 percent
of those came at the hands of
the Syrian regime

28:50.028 --> 28:51.964 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and its allies.

28:51.997 --> 28:53.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WIDNEY BROWN, Director of
Programs, Physicians
for Human Rights: Syria had a
very sophisticated

28:53.799 --> 28:58.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care infrastructure,
hospitals that
are multistoried, very
well-equipped, very

28:58.804 --> 29:00.672 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
large, very well-marked.

29:00.706 --> 29:04.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't make a mistake of just
hitting that
hospital, and you certainly
don't do it multiple

29:04.476 --> 29:05.844 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

29:05.877 --> 29:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is absolutely a deliberate
strategy by
the Syrian government.

29:08.246 --> 29:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Widney Brown is
director of
programs for the Physicians for
Human Rights,

29:12.651 --> 29:17.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
which maintains that the
destruction of hospitals
by President Assad is being used
as a weapon

29:18.023 --> 29:19.758 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of war.

29:19.791 --> 29:23.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WIDNEY BROWN: When you target a
hospital,
you don't just destroy that
brick-and-mortar

29:23.095 --> 29:24.596 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
structure.

29:24.630 --> 29:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You destroy actually a safe
place that people
can go for lifesaving aid.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.570 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you kill a doctor, you
don't just kill
that one individual.

29:31.603 --> 29:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You actually kill all the people
he or she
would have saved.

29:34.840 --> 29:40.412 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Brown says medical
professionals
are specifically targeted for
detention, torture,

29:40.445 --> 29:47.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and even murder by the Syrian
regime; 750
have been killed in the last
five years, like

29:47.786 --> 29:52.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
46-year-old cardiologist Hasan
al-Araj, whose
car was hit by an airstrike.

29:52.190 --> 29:56.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WIDNEY BROWN: We believe that
they are being
persecuted because they can
actually give

29:56.361 --> 30:00.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
eyewitness testimony about all
of the crimes
being committed by the Syrian
government.

30:00.766 --> 30:05.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When they say a chemical weapon
was used,
they are incredibly credible.

30:05.771 --> 30:10.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Hospitals are
often hit multiple
times as part of what is called
a double-tap

30:10.409 --> 30:12.310 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
strategy.

30:12.344 --> 30:15.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Planes will circle back after
hitting a target,
once first-responders have
arrived on scene,

30:15.781 --> 30:23.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as shown on this video, to
target those delivering
aid to the wounded.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.725 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Despite the risks, hospitals
still continue
to run.

30:26.758 --> 30:33.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here, Dr. Kalazi sweeps up after
one of the
more than 20 strikes his
hospital suffered,

30:33.131 --> 30:36.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
creating a new normal for an
already ravaged
community.

30:36.601 --> 30:38.136 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: All the hospitals
in Aleppo City
have been bombed, all of them.

30:40.839 --> 30:42.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no exceptions.

30:42.240 --> 30:47.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first thing you will think
in is looking
for your colleagues.

30:47.479 --> 30:50.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are they still alive or dead?

30:50.348 --> 30:58.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will I see, for example, of an
arm for my
colleague or a leg, or I will
see a body,

30:58.457 --> 31:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or half of a body, or will I see
him alive?

31:03.395 --> 31:05.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You don't know.

31:05.263 --> 31:11.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We announce among the patients
that it's now
risky to stay in the hospital,
so please find

31:11.303 --> 31:14.873 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
safe places or go as fast as you
can to your
homes.

31:14.906 --> 31:16.675 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: What about the
critical patients?

31:16.708 --> 31:17.676 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.677 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: They stay in the
hospital.

31:18.710 --> 31:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And some of them died during
these attacks.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: So there's just
really nowhere
to go?

31:23.782 --> 31:24.750 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:24.783 --> 31:26.585 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
RAMI KALAZI: No.

31:26.618 --> 31:28.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: You would think
that the hospital
would be the safe place, the
safe zone.

31:28.386 --> 31:29.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: But, in Syria,
there is nothing
safe.

31:31.323 --> 31:36.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Kalazi told us the
memory that
haunts him the most is of a
family of seven

31:36.161 --> 31:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
pulled from under the rubble.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WIDNEY BROWN: Only one survived,
only one
child.

31:40.999 --> 31:43.368 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He was 3 years old.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was completely freezed.

31:45.804 --> 31:48.640 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I just cried.

31:48.673 --> 31:53.445 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I see a child, it's so
hard, because
he's a child.

31:53.478 --> 31:54.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He's innocent.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.515 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's made nothing to be punished
for.

31:56.548 --> 32:02.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Amidst so much
despair, Dr.
Kalazi's wife gave birth to a
baby boy just

32:02.154 --> 32:03.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over a year ago.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.689 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

32:04.723 --> 32:08.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: We decided to have
a baby, because
it's like a new hope, you know?

32:08.894 --> 32:17.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we decided to stay in
Aleppo, because
we have a mission to complete.

32:17.502 --> 32:18.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We are physicians.

32:18.637 --> 32:20.272 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We are humans.

32:20.305 --> 32:22.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And this is our city.

32:22.040 --> 32:27.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: A few months ago,
his hospital
and his home were hit on the
same day.

32:27.612 --> 32:34.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here he is in this video with
his wife and
infant son surveying the damage.

32:34.119 --> 32:41.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kalazi was on R&amp;R outside the
city last month
when government forces blocked
the last road

32:41.459 --> 32:47.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Aleppo, making it not only
impossible for
him to return, but for the
people to get desperately

32:47.499 --> 32:49.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
needed food and medical aid.

32:49.034 --> 32:53.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WIDNEY BROWN: What we have in
Syria are two
stories.

32:53.238 --> 32:59.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's quick deaths by being
bombed when you're
a civilian, and it's the slow
death of starvation.

32:59.044 --> 33:03.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they are facing this as the
U.N. Security
Council does nothing.

33:03.081 --> 33:05.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Do you ever feel
abandoned?

33:05.417 --> 33:06.384 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: From the world,
yes.

33:08.119 --> 33:14.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
From the international
community, yes, because
they can do, but they don't want
to.

33:14.292 --> 33:17.863 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
No one wants to help us from the
governments.

33:17.896 --> 33:19.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We don't know why.

33:19.564 --> 33:22.968 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: But halfway around
the world,
these American doctors do want
to help.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.803 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAHER SAHLOUL, Syrian American
Medical Society:
So, you have doctors who send,
for example,

33:26.972 --> 33:28.673 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
X-rays.

33:28.707 --> 33:33.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Drs. Zaher Sahloul
and Samer
Attar represent the Syrian
American Medical

33:33.678 --> 33:39.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Society, which connects doctors
in the U.S.
with Kalazi's hospital and
others all over

33:39.484 --> 33:40.452 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

33:40.485 --> 33:42.320 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:42.354 --> 33:45.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ZAHER SAHLOUL: They can move the
camera from
a patient to patient, and
describe the patient

33:45.290 --> 33:46.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to me.

33:46.992 --> 33:48.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They can look at -- put the
camera on the
monitor, so I can see the vital
signs.

33:48.660 --> 33:52.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I can communicate with the
doctor also, and
they will tell me what's
happening.

33:52.597 --> 33:56.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, that way, you are there, but
through this
very simple technology.

33:56.067 --> 33:57.569 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

33:57.602 --> 34:01.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: You are not alone
in treating
your person -- your patients.

34:01.339 --> 34:04.209 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you have this emotional
support.

34:04.242 --> 34:10.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Sahloul and Attar
traveled last
month to Aleppo to show
solidarity with their

34:10.215 --> 34:11.182 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Syrian colleagues.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.717 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:12.751 --> 34:13.818 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAMER ATTAR, Syrian American
Medical Society:
You definitely feel targeted.

34:13.852 --> 34:15.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everyone feels targeted.

34:15.687 --> 34:21.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A missile lands somewhere within
the vicinity
of the hospital, and you feel
the foundations

34:21.626 --> 34:23.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the hospital shake.

34:23.361 --> 34:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was one moment I was
knocked off my
feet, and your ears are ringing,
but people

34:26.631 --> 34:28.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
just get back up and go back to
work.

34:28.600 --> 34:34.606 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're staying out of a sense
of obligation
and duty to help the helpless.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.909 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They are heroically and
selflessly risking
their lives.

34:37.943 --> 34:42.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: They say some
hospitals have
even moved their emergency rooms
underground

34:42.714 --> 34:44.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to protect the patients, who
come in droves.

34:44.816 --> 34:45.784 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:45.817 --> 34:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMER ATTAR: There were just so
many people.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was just child after child
after child
after child.

34:50.588 --> 34:56.061 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you just keep saying to
yourself, just,
please, God, when will this
trail of injured

34:56.094 --> 34:57.262 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
end?

34:57.295 --> 34:58.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: Are you angry by
the lack of
response?

34:58.697 --> 34:59.664 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.199 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
SAMER ATTAR: Well, of course
you're angry.

35:01.232 --> 35:04.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's five years on, close to
half-a-million
killed and 12 million displaced.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And those numbers are still
rising.

35:06.071 --> 35:10.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now we have a city of
300,000 people that
are being sieged and starved and
bombed to

35:10.642 --> 35:14.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
death, with the international
community sitting
idly by.

35:14.179 --> 35:18.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have children who are
burning tires
to create their own no-fly zone.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's embarrassing.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.952 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's shameful.

35:20.986 --> 35:24.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: The doctors
testified last week
at a U.N. special session on
Aleppo, where

35:24.456 --> 35:29.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they conveyed messages from
their Syrian colleagues,
treating babies exposed to
chlorine gas and

35:29.794 --> 35:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
toddlers with spines shredded
decimated by
shrapnel, wrapping tiny bodies
in white shrouds.

35:35.834 --> 35:40.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After five long years, one
21-year-old nurse
knows now not to ask for too
much.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.806 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

35:41.840 --> 35:45.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAMER ATTAR: I expected her to
talk about
no-fly zone, or peace, or all of
these things.

35:45.443 --> 35:46.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And she said: I have a patient.

35:46.945 --> 35:47.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Her name is Shahed.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She is 10 years old.

35:49.814 --> 35:54.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there any way that they can
intervene to
evacuate the patient, so her
life can be saved?

35:54.319 --> 35:57.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because her mom comes every day,
and she tells
her, and she tells her, I would
like to take

35:57.188 --> 36:00.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you home, so you can ride your
bicycle.

36:00.458 --> 36:02.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this is what she wanted from
the Security
Council.

36:02.494 --> 36:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: While the siege on
Aleppo was
partially broken by rebel
soldiers just over

36:07.899 --> 36:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a week ago, the last road in and
out of the
city is still far too dangerous
to travel.

36:12.971 --> 36:19.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Rami Kalazi remains on the
outside looking
in, desperate to get back to his
beloved hometown.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:21.846 --> 36:29.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: And any time Aleppo
is not besieged,
I will go back to Aleppo, even
for a visit.

36:29.287 --> 36:32.057 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's my lovely place.

36:32.090 --> 36:34.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: It's still your
lovely place.

36:34.159 --> 36:35.994 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

36:36.027 --> 36:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAMI KALAZI: Yes, it's my lovely
place, because
I feel that I'm born to be here
to help these

36:41.866 --> 36:43.501 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

36:43.535 --> 36:49.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA BIGGS: A place where no
one is safe
and saving lives can get you
killed.

36:49.741 --> 36:58.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Marcia Biggs in
Gaziantep, Southern Turkey.

36:58.516 --> 37:12.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And now a look at
the current
state of security inside the
U.S.

37:12.997 --> 37:18.436 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
As we approach the 15th
anniversary of 9/11,
journalist Steven Brill spent
the past year

37:18.470 --> 37:23.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking into how the country has
changed since
that terrible day, what's been
spent and what

37:23.775 --> 37:25.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
gaps still exist.

37:25.410 --> 37:30.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His article, "Are We Any
Safer?", appears
in the latest issue of "The
Atlantic."

37:30.215 --> 37:32.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I recently sat down with him
and asked
him what he learned.

37:32.917 --> 37:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN BRILL, "The Atlantic": In
a nutshell,
what I concluded was, the way we
have responded

37:38.756 --> 37:44.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the terrorist attacks, to
9/11, which,
you know, changed everything, is
sort of a

37:44.762 --> 37:47.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
microcosm of what we are as a
country today.

37:47.966 --> 37:57.175 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A lot of it was heroic,
ingenious, people
going beyond the cause of duty,
doing really

37:57.208 --> 37:59.043 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
great things.

37:59.077 --> 38:03.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then a lot of it was
actually quite the
opposite, a lot of Beltway
boondoggles, billions

38:03.848 --> 38:09.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of dollars wasted because
government contractors
promised technology and
solutions that they

38:09.854 --> 38:11.589 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
couldn't produce.

38:11.623 --> 38:17.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have struggled as a
country with dealing
with the notion of this new kind
of risk.

38:17.929 --> 38:23.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea, as President Bush
explained, after
9/11, of never again, we're
never going to

38:23.134 --> 38:28.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a terrorist attack again,
that's just
unrealistic in today's world.

38:28.039 --> 38:33.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You clearly give
the government
-- and it spans several
administrations, two

38:33.378 --> 38:36.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administrations -- credit for
getting some
things right, as you just said,
but...

38:36.881 --> 38:40.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN BRILL: A lot of things
right, and a
lot of unsung people, tens of
thousands of

38:40.852 --> 38:47.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people going to work every day
at the Department
of Homeland Security, the FBI,
places like

38:47.625 --> 38:54.032 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TSA, the Border Patrol, really
obsessed with
the job of keeping us safe.

38:54.065 --> 38:58.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the only time we notice them
is when something
goes wrong.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that makes it a tough job.

38:59.604 --> 39:05.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the other hand, a lot of it
went back to
politics as usual.

39:05.944 --> 39:13.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every small town that you can
think of made
a request for government grants
for homeland

39:13.518 --> 39:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
security, for everything ranging
from routine
fire trucks to fish tanks in a
police station.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, there are a lot of abuses.

39:20.925 --> 39:26.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was struck
because, early
on in the piece, you say, yes,
we are safer

39:26.264 --> 39:31.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than we were on 9/11, safer
against the kind
of threat we faced on 9/11.

39:31.569 --> 39:32.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN BRILL: Right.

39:32.570 --> 39:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But the threat
has changed.

39:33.571 --> 39:35.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN BRILL: Right.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's what
the government
is -- all of us are grappling
with right now.

39:37.742 --> 39:43.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN BRILL: We have done a lot
to batten
down the hatches, to make us
safer, at the

39:43.214 --> 39:47.418 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
airports, at the ports, all over
the place.

39:47.452 --> 39:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the threats have multiplied,
the threats
around the world.

39:51.422 --> 39:54.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Our defenses are much stronger.

39:54.959 --> 39:57.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The offense has multiplied and
is much stronger.

39:57.795 --> 40:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's more difficult because,
unlike the
kind of coordinated,
orchestrated attack that

40:02.867 --> 40:09.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we faced on 9/11, where people
were communicating,
money was exchanging hands, that
kind of stuff

40:09.140 --> 40:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which we can now track, if some
lone wolf
in his basement is online...

40:14.345 --> 40:16.114 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

40:16.147 --> 40:20.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN BRILL: ... and he can go
into a gun
store in this country and buy an
assault weapon,

40:20.852 --> 40:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and he shoots up a shopping mall
and yells
out, you know, something in
Arabic, that makes

40:27.058 --> 40:30.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him a terrorist, and it scares
us mightily.

40:30.995 --> 40:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's not something we can
really prevent,
other than doing something about
assault weapons.

40:35.633 --> 40:41.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how -- that's
what interested
me so much in this piece was you
look at one

40:42.006 --> 40:45.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thing after another that the
government did,
some of it successfully.

40:45.143 --> 40:52.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, still, you have this
undefined threat
out there, some of which, as you
say, it's

40:52.216 --> 40:53.951 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a lone wolf.

40:53.985 --> 40:58.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's somebody who may be just
mentally unstable
who decides to adopt the
terrorism...

40:58.122 --> 40:59.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

40:59.123 --> 41:00.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN BRILL: Exactly.

41:00.858 --> 41:03.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there are some non-lone wolf
threats,
some kind of more orchestrated
threats, that

41:03.728 --> 41:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were in the headlines right
after 9/11 that
basically fell out of the
headlines, and therefore

41:09.133 --> 41:13.805 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
fell off our radar, and,
frankly, that the
government hasn't paid enough
attention to.

41:13.838 --> 41:17.542 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The best example is the
bioterror attack.

41:17.575 --> 41:19.243 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bioterrorism.

41:19.277 --> 41:22.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN BRILL: Right after 9/11,
with the anthrax
attacks, that's all we thought
of.

41:22.947 --> 41:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The technology that we tried to
develop 15
years ago still hasn't been
developed that

41:29.120 --> 41:33.157 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would warn us in the right way
of a bio attack.

41:33.191 --> 41:37.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have not done enough to
protect ourselves
from dirty bombs.

41:37.995 --> 41:43.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can still go to hospitals
and other industrial
sites all over this country, and
maybe have

41:43.668 --> 41:49.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to break a tiny little padlock,
if that, to
get ahold of radiological
material that you

41:49.440 --> 41:53.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can mix with an easily available
explosive
and create a dirty bomb.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But why hasn't
something like
that been addressed?

41:56.247 --> 42:00.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN BRILL: Because we tend to
go after
yesterday's headline.

42:00.985 --> 42:03.321 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Our attention shifts.

42:03.354 --> 42:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we don't -- when you say
that everything's
a priority, if you have 10 or 12
high priorities,

42:10.795 --> 42:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
none of them becomes a priority,
except if
it's in the news, if it's in the
headlines,

42:16.234 --> 42:19.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if it's part of a congressional
hearing, maybe.

42:19.370 --> 42:26.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, we haven't done the job we
need to do
of really assessing all the
threats rationally

42:26.844 --> 42:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and having a discussion with the
American
people that says, we can't deal
with everything,

42:32.016 --> 42:37.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have to have priorities, and
some things
are going to slip through the
cracks, and,

42:37.355 --> 42:44.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by the way, there are going to
be terrorist
attacks, not of the kind we had
on 9/11.

42:44.362 --> 42:50.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are never going to be
able to hijack
a plane because of the TSA,
because we have

42:50.468 --> 42:52.503 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
fortified cockpit doors in
airlines.

42:52.537 --> 42:58.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have done a lot of things to
deal with
that, but we haven't done much
to deal with

42:58.576 --> 43:00.611 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
trains or ferry boats, for
example.

43:00.645 --> 43:06.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Because of our
political system,
as you say, it's hard for our
leaders to -- political

43:06.250 --> 43:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
leaders to say candidly to the
American people
that there will always be a
threat out there,

43:13.057 --> 43:14.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that you cannot completely...

43:14.659 --> 43:16.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STEVEN BRILL: President Obama
has tried to
do that.

43:16.494 --> 43:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every time he's even in a
subtle way tried
to do that, where he has said --
and, indeed,

43:22.900 --> 43:30.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his Department of Homeland
Security has implemented
really important mitigation
measures, really

43:30.308 --> 43:34.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important, you know, recovery
measures if
there's an attack.

43:34.045 --> 43:39.484 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a drill in Boston just
a few months
before the bombing there.

43:39.517 --> 43:44.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when they did a report about
that drill
and how that had really helped
to save lives

43:44.288 --> 43:51.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after the marathon bombing, he
was attacked
by Senator Coburn for putting
too much emphasis

43:51.629 --> 43:54.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on mitigation, and not enough on
prevention.

43:54.899 --> 44:00.738 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, that, to me, is the
equivalent of saying,
why do you have ambulances on
call?

44:00.771 --> 44:04.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why don't you do something about
crime and
traffic safety?

44:04.041 --> 44:08.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, you try to prevent crime
and you try
to prevent car accidents, but
you have emergency

44:08.679 --> 44:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rooms, you have ambulances.

44:10.648 --> 44:13.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You acknowledge the fact that
you're not going
to prevent all traffic
accidents.

44:13.751 --> 44:20.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are not going to prevent all
terrorism,
especially if you define it as
someone being

44:20.358 --> 44:26.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
able to get an assault weapon,
which you can
do in this country, and claim to
be loyal

44:26.130 --> 44:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to ISIS or some organization
like that.

44:28.499 --> 44:32.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What would you
say to the next
leader of this country, the next
president

44:32.236 --> 44:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about what most needs to be done
to make this
country...

44:35.506 --> 44:37.275 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

44:37.308 --> 44:39.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEVEN BRILL: Well, the first
thing that needs
not to be done is to declare war
on Muslims

44:39.944 --> 44:44.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or Islam, because that's exactly
what those
terrorists want.

44:44.081 --> 44:51.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They want this to be the
apocalyptic, end-of-all-worlds
war between them and us.

44:51.255 --> 44:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Bush didn't take
the bait, and
President Obama has resisted
taking that bait.

44:57.028 --> 44:58.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Donald Trump campaigns on that.

44:58.729 --> 45:05.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it almost makes you think --
in fact,
it makes me think that ISIS
would love to

45:05.403 --> 45:10.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have someone like Trump be
president, because
they would get the fulfillment
of their dream,

45:10.441 --> 45:15.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is to have the great
confrontation with
Western civilization.

45:15.212 --> 45:19.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The second thing is to keep
educating the
country.

45:19.884 --> 45:25.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While doing everything we can to
prevent terrorism,
keep educating the country to
the reality

45:25.423 --> 45:31.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there are going to be some
attacks, and
that doesn't mean it's the
apocalypse.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It doesn't mean we're weak.

45:33.731 --> 45:39.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Saying there are going to be
attacks doesn't
mean you're throwing in the
towel, but it

45:39.437 --> 45:40.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
means we have to be realistic.

45:40.972 --> 45:44.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's
certainly a provocative
piece.

45:44.709 --> 45:51.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's one that reminds us of how
complex the
challenges are, and they don't
get any simpler

45:51.449 --> 45:52.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as time goes by.

45:52.450 --> 45:53.417 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STEVEN BRILL: Thanks.

45:53.451 --> 45:54.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Steven Brill.

45:54.452 --> 45:58.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Are we any safer than we were on
9/11?

45:58.055 --> 46:03.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

46:03.561 --> 46:09.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STEVEN BRILL: You're welcome.

46:09.033 --> 46:17.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A photography
museum is reopening
in a sleek new home in New York
City, with

46:17.575 --> 46:22.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an exhibition to make you think
twice about
all the cameras that surround
us.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.415 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

46:24.448 --> 46:29.787 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A stark message
stops visitors
in their tracks at the threshold
of the International

46:29.820 --> 46:35.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Center of Photography's new
home: "By entering
this area, you consent to being
photographed,

46:36.027 --> 46:41.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
filmed and/or otherwise
recorded, and surrender
the right to the use of such
material throughout

46:41.399 --> 46:43.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the universe in perpetuity."

46:43.267 --> 46:48.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's what the museum's
first exhibition
in its brand-new space in Lower
Manhattan

46:48.239 --> 46:53.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
explores, the changing role of
privacy in
a world inundated with
surveillance and oversharing.

46:53.844 --> 46:56.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULINE VERMARE, Associate
Curator, Public,
Private, Secret: What is your
secret life?

46:56.647 --> 46:58.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How can you keep it secret?

46:58.516 --> 47:04.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's one of the keys
of this exhibition
is really that, keeping your
privacy, but

47:04.355 --> 47:07.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also making sure that your
secret life remains
your secret life.

47:07.358 --> 47:12.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Pauline Vermare
is the associate
curator of Public, Private,
Secret, a mix

47:12.363 --> 47:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of visual media, modern and
historical.

47:15.199 --> 47:21.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's this 1946 Yale Joel
photograph of
a couple through a two-way
mirror for a series

47:21.405 --> 47:27.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in "LIFE" magazine, and more
contemporary
surveillance art by Jill Magid,
who captured

47:27.344 --> 47:32.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
herself on surveillance cameras,
and Merry
Alpern, who secretly shot
through the bathroom

47:32.917 --> 47:37.088 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
window of a seedy sex club for
her "Dirty
Windows" series.

47:37.121 --> 47:43.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The museum itself has come a
long way from
its 1974 beginnings in a
Manhattan mansion

47:43.360 --> 47:47.431 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
under the direction of famed
Hungarian photographer
Cornell Capa.

47:47.465 --> 47:49.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Since then, the world of
photography has changed.

47:49.400 --> 47:52.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARK LUBELL, Director,
International Center
of Photography: It is the most
Democratic

47:52.336 --> 47:53.504 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
format.

47:53.537 --> 47:55.072 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is in the hands of all of us.

47:55.106 --> 47:58.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We all are now visually
communicating.

47:58.042 --> 48:02.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Mark Lubell is
the current
director of the museum, known as
the ICP.

48:02.680 --> 48:07.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's overseen an institutional
shift, from
photojournalism and art
photography to an

48:07.852 --> 48:12.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
embrace of today's digital media
landscape,
where cell phone cameras are
ubiquitous.

48:12.790 --> 48:18.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK LUBELL: The big difference
is, it used
to be a few people taking images
that went

48:18.395 --> 48:20.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out to millions.

48:20.297 --> 48:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now it's millions and
millions of people
going out to millions and
millions of people.

48:23.300 --> 48:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that's a seismic shift
in the medium,
and it's something that we
should be looking

48:28.472 --> 48:30.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at and exploring.

48:30.307 --> 48:34.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the inaugural
exhibition,
that means a sometimes jarring
juxtaposition

of images.

48:36.046 --> 48:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAULINE VERMARE: We start with
historical
precedents, and everything is
thrown together.

48:38.816 --> 48:40.951 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not like there's a
hierarchy.

48:40.985 --> 48:42.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everything is at the same level.

48:42.787 --> 48:47.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A lineup of
mid-20th century
mug shots taken by unknown
photographers sits

48:47.358 --> 48:52.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just beneath portraits of four
Muslim women,
prisoners in a concentration
camp during the

48:52.396 --> 48:53.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Algerian War.

48:53.731 --> 48:56.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They were forced to pose without
their veils.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In our own time, people expose
themselves.

48:58.769 --> 48:59.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I'm not gay.

48:59.770 --> 49:00.738 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: I am gay.

49:00.771 --> 49:02.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I am so gay.

49:02.606 --> 49:07.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Offering up
private thoughts
online, in the form of video
diaries available

49:07.178 --> 49:18.789 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to anyone.

49:18.823 --> 49:23.694 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Artist Natalie Bookchin sifted
through hundreds
of those and created an
installation titled

49:23.727 --> 49:25.529 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
"Testament."

49:25.563 --> 49:27.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE BOOKCHIN, Artist: I'm
choreographing
these moments and organizing
them to try to

49:27.932 --> 49:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make some sense out of them.

49:29.733 --> 49:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that there's a sense,
first of all,
that this stuff is junk, right,
that it's

49:33.204 --> 49:36.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
throwaway, that we shouldn't
watch it, that
it's all just narcissistic, and
that it's

49:36.607 --> 49:38.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kids that are doing silly things
with their
phone.

49:38.909 --> 49:42.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I'm trying to show in
this work,
that it's not just kids, that
it's like -- it's

49:42.246 --> 49:43.681 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sort of people.

49:43.714 --> 49:48.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, people are doing this,
old people,
young people, men, women.

49:48.853 --> 49:58.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We see and hear
some subjects
alone, others in a kind of
chorus focused

49:59.029 --> 50:01.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on a particular theme.

50:01.732 --> 50:04.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of her pieces examined
people who had
lost their jobs in the
recession.

50:04.802 --> 50:10.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NATALIE BOOKCHIN: I wanted in
the work to
both show the way that sort of
people were

50:10.407 --> 50:17.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
alone, in some way trying to
engage in a political
discussion or a social
discussion, something

50:17.281 --> 50:21.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that just happened that's really
bad, because
the economy is crashing and
people are losing

50:21.785 --> 50:23.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their jobs.

50:23.721 --> 50:26.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then, at the same time,
people are isolated
and alone, and they're speaking
to themselves.

50:26.957 --> 50:32.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The culture of
celebrity is
also on display in many
different forms.

50:32.096 --> 50:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Patrick McMullan's Facebook
collage from this
year's New York Fashion Week.

50:36.267 --> 50:42.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A series of Andy Warhol
Polaroids framed on
mirrors, so you're part of the
subject's 15

50:42.339 --> 50:44.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
minutes of fame too.

50:44.208 --> 50:49.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then there's the placement
of this untitled
self-portrait by famed art
photographer Cindy

50:49.413 --> 50:50.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sherman.

50:50.414 --> 50:51.382 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is art.

50:51.415 --> 50:52.483 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's shown in every museum in
the world.

50:52.516 --> 50:53.484 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAULINE VERMARE: Yes.

50:53.517 --> 50:55.052 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

50:55.085 --> 50:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And then you have
Kim Kardashian
selfies, a book about selfies.

50:58.322 --> 51:01.859 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Somehow, they belong together,
you're saying,
in our world?

51:01.892 --> 51:05.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAULINE VERMARE: Well,
specifically, this
image, in fact, by Cindy
Sherman, because

51:05.329 --> 51:12.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she's pretending to be a star,
you know, hunted
by the paparazzo, this is what
we're talking

51:12.102 --> 51:14.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about, that tension and the
resistance.

51:14.138 --> 51:20.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is -- our show -- this
show is generally
about the resistance, or the
opposite of resistance,

51:20.110 --> 51:21.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is what Kim Kardashian
does.

51:21.445 --> 51:22.646 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Which is, take my
picture.

51:22.680 --> 51:24.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAULINE VERMARE: Just take it,
and here it
is for you.

51:24.748 --> 51:29.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The museum also
wants us to
question the very definition of
photography

51:29.219 --> 51:30.387 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and who's a photographer.

51:30.421 --> 51:35.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK LUBELL: What I do on my
phone is not
photography.

51:35.492 --> 51:36.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am creating images.

51:36.694 --> 51:38.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We're not taking
photos on
our phones?

51:38.796 --> 51:39.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are we doing?

51:39.830 --> 51:41.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK LUBELL: Well, we're
communicating.

51:41.365 --> 51:42.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're communicating.

51:42.366 --> 51:43.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we're communicating using
the image.

51:43.934 --> 51:46.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I want to look at where society
is today.

51:46.670 --> 51:50.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The thematic of sort of
understanding the
world that we are today, and
looking at it,

51:50.441 --> 51:54.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and examining it, and debating
it is central
to ICP's DNA.

51:54.645 --> 51:57.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that's why the show
makes a lot
of sense.

51:57.247 --> 52:03.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The exhibition
Public, Private,
Secret is on view through early
January 2017.

which he says give all the tax
benefits of

52:27.277 --> 52:33.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
charitable giving, without any
