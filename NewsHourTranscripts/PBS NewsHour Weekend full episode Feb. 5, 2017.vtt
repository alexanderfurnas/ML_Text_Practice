PARTS.

15:02.900 --> 15:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST, IT PUTS A MORATORIUM ON

ALL REFUGEES COMING TO THIS

15:07.233 --> 15:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY FOR 1250 DAYS, IT TELLS

15:09.167 --> 15:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM COUNTRIES.

15:20.533 --> 15:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:52.000 --> 15:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

INTERNATIONAL TREATIES INCLUDING

15:55.867 --> 15:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CONVENTION AGAINST TORTURE

15:57.633 --> 15:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

16:04.033 --> 16:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

16:05.600 --> 16:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUSLIM BAN?

16:07.800 --> 16:08.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ABSOLUTELY.

16:08.267 --> 16:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR.

16:09.567 --> 16:11.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SEVEN COUNTRIES THEY PICKED,

PREDOMINANTLY MUSLIM COUNTRIES.

16:13.533 --> 16:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BROADCAST RADIO.

16:21.433 --> 16:22.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT HE WANTED TO

PROTECT CHRISTIANS.

16:24.000 --> 16:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S CLEARLY A MUSLIM BAN.

16:27.733 --> 16:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S CLEARLY MEANT TO TARGET

16:29.667 --> 16:31.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DOESN'T GO AFTER THE SAUDIS.

16:31.367 --> 16:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DISCRIMINATING.

16:55.733 --> 16:57.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THESE SEVEN HAVE LARGE MUSLIM

16:57.533 --> 16:58.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POPULATIONS.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRIES NOT ON THE LIST,

17:00.100 --> 17:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS A QUESTION BETTER PUT TO

17:01.633 --> 17:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION.

17:02.833 --> 17:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY NOT THE SAUDIS, FOR

17:05.100 --> 17:06.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTANCE, MOST OF THE 9/11

17:06.967 --> 17:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ATTACKERS WERE OF SAUDI DESCENT

17:09.167 --> 17:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR SAUDI ORIGIN.

17:10.533 --> 17:11.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> TELL ME ABOUT HOW THIS IS

17:11.633 --> 17:12.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO RECONCILE?

17:12.767 --> 17:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE GOT A DECISION IN

17:13.633 --> 17:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROOKLYN.

17:14.533 --> 17:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE GOT A DECISION IN BOSTON.

17:16.067 --> 17:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE ANOTHER ONE IN

17:18.000 --> 17:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARLINGTON, OR VIRGINIA.

17:18.933 --> 17:19.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WHAT HAPPENS?

17:19.867 --> 17:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BASICALLY IS THERE A

17:21.133 --> 17:22.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECONCILIATION PROCESS.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THIS HAVE TO GET APPEAL TO

17:23.400 --> 17:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO TO THE SUPREME COURT?

17:25.033 --> 17:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THERE IS ALSO FROM WHAT I

17:26.533 --> 17:28.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERSTAND CASES IN SEATTLE

17:28.067 --> 17:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON AS OF THIS MORNING.

17:30.533 --> 17:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CASE IN BROOKLYN, THE ONE WE

17:32.133 --> 17:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FILED ON LATE LAST NIGHT AND

17:34.867 --> 17:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING AND THE

17:36.367 --> 17:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDGE RULED LATE LAST NIGHT IS A

17:38.333 --> 17:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLASS ACTION SUIT IT COVERS ALL

17:40.733 --> 17:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE BANNED ENTRY

17:42.533 --> 17:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THE

17:44.433 --> 17:45.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE THINK THAT WILL BE THE

17:47.567 --> 17:49.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRIMARY VEHICLE BY WHICH THE

17:49.533 --> 17:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COURTS ADJUDICATE THE

17:51.533 --> 17:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTIONALITY, THE LEGALITY

17:52.333 --> 17:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER.

17:53.933 --> 17:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ULTIMATELY MAY BE

17:56.000 --> 17:58.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSOLIDATED.

17:58.167 --> 17:59.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPENDS ON WHICH, HOW FAR, WHICH

17:59.300 --> 18:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDGE GETS OUT IN FRONT.

18:00.200 --> 18:01.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ALL WILL BE DETERMINED IN

18:01.567 --> 18:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COURSE OF THE NEXT SEVERAL

18:03.100 --> 18:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEKS.

18:03.533 --> 18:04.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE

18:04.967 --> 18:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE THAT

18:06.933 --> 18:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL HAVE AN

18:08.300 --> 18:09.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABILITY TO NOMINATE THIS WEEK?

18:09.567 --> 18:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD THAT BE THE TIE-BREAKING

18:11.133 --> 18:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE IF THIS HAS TO GO TO THE

18:12.500 --> 18:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPREME COURT.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> COULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE A LONG WAY AWAY FROM THE

18:16.167 --> 18:17.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPREME COURT.

18:17.100 --> 18:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY FROM THE LEVEL T COULD

18:19.733 --> 18:21.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEALS

18:21.667 --> 18:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS THE TYPE OF CASE THAT

18:23.133 --> 18:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD ULTIMATELY COME BEFORE THE

18:25.133 --> 18:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPREME COURT.

18:25.733 --> 18:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M HOPEFUL.

18:28.800 --> 18:30.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THAT EVEN WITH

18:30.267 --> 18:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:11.967 --> 20:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT-- HOW SIGNIFICANT OF A

POLITICAL WEEK HAS THIS BEEN?

20:15.633 --> 20:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, YOU'RE QUITE RIGHT

20:16.900 --> 20:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THAT, LEGALLY SOME PEOPLE

20:18.200 --> 20:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ARGUED THAT THE PRESIDENT

20:19.933 --> 20:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS VERY WIDE LATITUDE TO

20:21.333 --> 20:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DETERMINE WHO DOES AND WHO DOES

20:22.867 --> 20:24.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT GAIN ENTRY TO THE UNITED

THIS PLAN AT ALL.

20:29.133 --> 20:31.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAYS IT MIGHT BE LEGAL.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHERS SAID IT VIOLATES THE 1965

20:33.267 --> 20:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMMIGRATION REFORM.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHATEVER THE LEGALITIES,

20:36.133 --> 20:37.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICALLY, IT'S A DIFFERENT

20:37.267 --> 20:38.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY.

20:38.167 --> 20:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ONE THAT I THINK REQUIRES

20:39.533 --> 20:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME SUBTLE DISTINCTIONS.

20:42.467 --> 20:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

20:51.600 --> 20:53.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEING PUT IN HANDCUFFS.

20:53.267 --> 20:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS NOT THE MESSAGE THE

20:54.400 --> 20:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE HOUSE WANTED NOR DOES IT

20:56.100 --> 20:58.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE THE FACT THAT A FAIR NUMBER

20:58.800 --> 21:00.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS,

21:00.167 --> 21:01.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERTS WHO

21:01.267 --> 21:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERVED IN BOTH REPUBLICAN AND

21:03.633 --> 21:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC ADMINISTRATIONS ARE

21:04.400 --> 21:06.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAYING THIS IS ALMOST A

21:06.067 --> 21:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECRUITING MESSAGE FOR ISIS.

21:07.933 --> 21:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE THE ABU GHRAIB PRISON

21:09.900 --> 21:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SCANDAL.

21:10.533 --> 21:11.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK THE OTHER PART OF

21:11.867 --> 21:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS THAT TO TRUMP'S CORE

21:15.533 --> 21:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTERS WHAT THIS SIGNALS IS

21:16.700 --> 21:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE ARE GOING TO DO WHAT WE

21:18.533 --> 21:19.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROMISED YOU WE WERE GOING TO

21:19.600 --> 21:20.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO.

21:20.367 --> 21:21.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE GOING TO CRACK DOWN VERY

21:21.267 --> 21:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARD ON ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE

21:23.367 --> 21:24.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEEKING TO COME INTO THIS

21:24.367 --> 21:24.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY.

21:24.967 --> 21:26.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WANT TO PROTECT YOU EVEN IF

21:26.267 --> 21:28.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT MEANS BARRING A STUDENT FROM

21:28.133 --> 21:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING HOME OR SEPARATING

21:31.000 --> 21:31.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILIES.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK WHEN YOU ASK THE

21:33.633 --> 21:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICS OF IT, IT IS THE

21:35.367 --> 21:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE

21:36.800 --> 21:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRADITIONAL POLITICAL

21:38.300 --> 21:40.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ESTABLISHMENT, IF YOU WILL, IS

21:40.067 --> 21:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEARING AND WHAT TRUMP

21:41.600 --> 21:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORTERS ARE HEARING.

21:43.533 --> 21:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY HAVE A DEPARTURE FROM

21:45.100 --> 21:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT TRADITION AND THE NORMS IS

21:47.133 --> 21:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS?

21:47.533 --> 21:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE

21:50.000 --> 21:50.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIGGER STORY.

21:50.967 --> 21:53.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS NOT

21:53.167 --> 21:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VETTED TO USE THE PRESIDENT'S

21:54.600 --> 21:58.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERM ABOUT REFUGEES WITH

21:58.667 --> 21:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE-- LEGAL COUNSEL IL, WAS NOT

21:59.800 --> 22:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WALKED PAST THE DEPARTMENT OF

22:01.100 --> 22:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOMELAND SECURITY OR THE STATE

22:02.300 --> 22:04.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEPARTMENT TO ASK WHAT ARE THE

22:04.667 --> 22:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPERCUSSIONS OF THIS GOING TO

22:05.767 --> 22:06.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE.

22:06.267 --> 22:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ADDITION, IF THE PRESS

22:07.533 --> 22:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPORTS ARE RIGHT, HOMELAND

22:09.167 --> 22:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECURITY PUSHED BACK ON THE IDEA

22:10.333 --> 22:11.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT YOU WILL AFFECT PEOPLE WITH

22:11.367 --> 22:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREEN CARDS.

22:12.300 --> 22:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE ARE LEGAL RESIDENTS OF

22:14.367 --> 22:15.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES AND THE WHITE

22:15.367 --> 22:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOUSE SAID NOPE T APPLIES TO

22:16.700 --> 22:17.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM TOO.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I THINK THE BROADER POINT IS

22:19.533 --> 22:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS TELLING US ONCE AGAIN

22:22.033 --> 22:23.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW THE TRUMP WHITE HOUSE

22:23.767 --> 22:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTENDS TO GOVERN WHICH IS WHY I

22:25.533 --> 22:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THE NEWS ABOUT THE

22:26.800 --> 22:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL

22:28.767 --> 22:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESHUFFLING MAY BE A MUCH BIGGER

22:30.800 --> 22:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STORY ULTIMATELY THAN THE TRAVEL

22:33.533 --> 22:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BAN.

22:34.100 --> 22:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> AND THEY DID WALK BACK THE

22:35.433 --> 22:36.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GREEN CARD THING EARLIER TODAY

LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT SHUFFLE IN

THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY IS THAT SO SIGNIFICANT?

22:43.167 --> 22:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE CHAIR OF THE JOINT

PRECEDENT FOR THAT.

23:15.633 --> 23:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

23:22.433 --> 23:24.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT SEEMS TO SAY ONCE AGAIN,

23:24.867 --> 23:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THIS WHITE HOUSE IS NOT
