I'M VERY GOOD AT THIS.

03:10.300 --> 03:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS CALLED CONSTRUCTION.

03:11.933 --> 03:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

03:35.100 --> 03:37.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GRACIOUS TONE, BUT THIS IS AN

03:37.367 --> 03:39.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UGLY CAMPAIGN SEASON AND SEEMS

03:39.167 --> 03:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE PASSION IS TAKING A LITTLE

03:40.100 --> 03:40.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIT OF A BREAK.

03:40.967 --> 03:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO BE

03:42.900 --> 03:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PASSIONS AND UGLINESS WILL

03:47.233 --> 03:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUBBLE UP AGAIN?

03:48.400 --> 03:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

AND HILLARY CLINTON HAD GRACIOUS

03:52.667 --> 03:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATEMENTS BUT OUT GOING SENATE

FUELED HIS CAMPAIGN WITH BIGOTRY

04:02.033 --> 04:03.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HEAT.

04:03.967 --> 04:05.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KELLYANNE CONWAY SAID THERE

04:05.767 --> 04:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT BE A LAWSUIT AT THAT ONE.

THAT THEY HAVE AND IT'S ALSO

04:13.067 --> 04:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TRANSITION MAY GET UGLY OR EVEN

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY

04:19.000 --> 04:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE OF SOME HARD FEELINGS.

04:21.133 --> 04:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRUMP HAS REACHED OUT TO SPEAKER

04:24.933 --> 04:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SUPPOSED TO PLAY A ROLE IN THIS

04:34.967 --> 04:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE TRANSITION, PRETTY HARD

04:37.333 --> 04:39.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEELINGS NOT JUST BETWEEN

04:39.033 --> 04:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS, BUT

04:41.133 --> 04:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN AMONG REPUBLICANS THAT I'M

KIND OF ADMINISTRATION THE NEW

PRESIDENT WANTS TO BRING,

05:05.400 --> 05:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THAT IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IN

05:14.467 --> 05:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS CASE BECAUSE TRUMP'S

05:16.267 --> 05:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN WAS SO MUCH OF AN

05:18.800 --> 05:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSURGENT CAMPAIGN.

05:20.733 --> 05:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

05:41.433 --> 05:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BE BIG TAX CUTS, MOST OF WHICH

05:45.767 --> 05:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL GO TO THE AFFLUENT, AND

IF THEY HAVE CONTROL THEY HAVE

06:08.967 --> 06:10.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS

>> IT'S NOT OFTEN APPRECIATED

06:19.667 --> 06:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAYBE IT IS NOW HOW MUCH A

06:21.867 --> 06:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISASTER THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY

06:23.367 --> 06:25.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS ENDURED AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF

VOTE.

06:28.833 --> 06:31.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY LOST 11 SENATE SEATS,

06:31.033 --> 06:33.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UPWARDS OF 60 HOUSE SEATS, THEY

CONTROL STATE GOVERNMENT IN SIX

IT IN 24.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICANS HAVE I THINK

06:39.167 --> 06:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWO-THIRDS OF THE GOVERNORSHIPS

06:40.567 --> 06:44.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND DEMOCRATS HAVE LOST 900

LEGISLATIVE SEATS.

06:45.033 --> 06:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S BEEN A TERRIBLE EIGHT YEARS

FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

06:49.367 --> 06:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONLY HOPE THEY, SINCE THE

06:52.400 --> 06:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MID TERMS HAVE BAD FOR THE PARTY

06:59.800 --> 07:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN POWER, I SUPPOSE THEY WOULD

07:02.467 --> 07:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE HEART BY WINNING THE

07:17.533 --> 07:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS IT TIME FOR SOME OF THE

07:20.433 --> 07:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THE PROTESTERS, PEACEFUL

07:22.633 --> 07:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTEST IS FINE BUT ASSAULTING

IS IT TIME FOR SOMEBODY OFTEN

07:28.300 --> 07:30.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RIGHT TO SAY, YOU KNOW WHAT

07:30.633 --> 07:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE WON THIS ELECTION BUT THERE

07:32.433 --> 07:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS NO TIME FOR BIGOTRY AND

07:35.333 --> 07:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BE CIVIL.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK BOTH THOSE MESSAGES

07:43.200 --> 07:44.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL.

07:44.967 --> 07:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN PEOPLE ARE BREAKING WINDOWS

07:47.000 --> 07:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN DOWNTOWN CITIES BECAUSE THEIR

07:48.967 --> 07:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATE LOST THE RACE AND THEY

07:50.833 --> 07:52.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY DON'T LIKE THE NEW

07:52.033 --> 07:53.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:53.567 --> 07:54.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGURE OUT WHAT MESSAGE THAT

07:54.700 --> 07:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENDS.

07:55.300 --> 07:56.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW I THINK TRUMP COULD

07:56.767 --> 08:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE A NOTE FROM BOB DOLE, 20

08:01.767 --> 08:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS AGO, IN HIS ACCEPTANCE

SPEECH, ANYBODY SUPPORTING ME,

08:07.633 --> 08:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIGOTS OR RACISTS, THERE'S THE

08:11.433 --> 08:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOOR.

08:12.100 --> 08:15.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF TRUMP WAS ASKED, CAN SOME OF

08:15.067 --> 08:16.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS LANGUAGE HE REGRETS, HE SAID

08:16.767 --> 08:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NO, I WON.

08:18.433 --> 08:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH SUGGESTS HE REGARDS SOME

08:21.000 --> 08:23.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE RHETORIC TRANSITIONAL.

08:23.267 --> 08:24.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF IT WORKED IT WORKED.

08:24.667 --> 08:26.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT HE'S ABOUT TO BECOME

08:26.267 --> 08:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES

08:27.000 --> 08:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE COULD REALLY USE A SIGN FROM

08:28.333 --> 08:29.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM THAT HE UNDERSTANDS THAT

08:29.567 --> 08:31.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN A PRESIDENT SPEAKS EVERY

08:31.367 --> 08:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORD WEIGHS A TON AND THERE'S

08:34.100 --> 08:35.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOT TO BE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN

08:35.667 --> 08:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT SOME OF HIS SUPPORTERS

08:37.700 --> 08:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBRACE AND WHAT HE REALLY

08:39.233 --> 08:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVES.

COLLEAGUE MOLLIE HIBERMAN,

11:42.200 --> 11:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP A COUPLE OF TIMES

11:43.933 --> 11:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST SPRING, AND HE TALKED ABOUT

11:45.433 --> 11:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOREIGN POLICY, NATO BEING ONE

11:48.033 --> 11:59.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THEM.

11:59.167 --> 12:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> HIS VIEW THAT NATO OUGHT TO

12:04.833 --> 12:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE FOCUSED TOTALLY ON TERRORISM.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE FEELS IT'S AN OBSOLETE

12:11.067 --> 12:13.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ORGANIZATION, AND HE SAID NEARLY

12:13.267 --> 12:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOTHING ABOUT ITS ROLE ABOUT

12:15.700 --> 12:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELPING TO CONTAIN RUSSIA, ONCE

12:19.700 --> 12:21.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SOVIET UNION.

12:21.967 --> 12:26.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I ASKED HIM IF SOME OF THE NEWER

12:26.367 --> 12:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEMBERS OF NATO THAT WERE

12:30.200 --> 12:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREVIOUSLY SOVIET STATES IF THEY

12:31.833 --> 12:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE INVADED WOULD HE COME TO

12:34.633 --> 12:36.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR DEFENSE WHICH IS REQUIRED

12:36.567 --> 12:38.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDER THE NATO TREATY.

12:38.867 --> 12:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAID FIRST, I WOULD BE CHECK

12:41.233 --> 12:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THEIR LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTION

12:42.767 --> 12:44.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD BEEN TO NATO.

12:44.367 --> 12:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S QUITE A DEPARTURE,

12:47.667 --> 12:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THE COMMITMENT OF THE

12:48.700 --> 12:50.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES AND OTHER MEMBERS

12:50.067 --> 12:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ARE BASICALLY AN ATTACK ON

12:51.600 --> 12:53.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE IS AN ATTACK ON ALL.

12:53.267 --> 12:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE QUESTION IS, IS THIS A

12:55.567 --> 12:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEGOTIATING TACTIC OR DOES THIS

12:57.200 --> 12:57.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDICATE A FUNDAMENTAL

12:57.967 --> 13:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RETHINKING OF WHAT NATO SHOULD

13:00.600 --> 13:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE?

13:01.467 --> 13:02.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: IT'S INTERESTING

13:02.367 --> 13:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE GOALS OF NATO FOR ITS

13:05.033 --> 13:07.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
28 MEMBERS IS THAT EACH WILL

13:07.067 --> 13:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTEND 2% OF ITS GDP ON DEFENSE

13:09.700 --> 13:12.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS OF 2015 ONLY FIVE OF THE

13:12.267 --> 13:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
28 COUNTRIES HAD DONE SO THE

13:13.633 --> 13:14.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES BEING ONE OF THEM.

13:14.900 --> 13:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IN HIS MIND IS THIS

13:17.867 --> 13:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSACTIONAL, YOU HAVEN'T

13:19.400 --> 13:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONTRIBUTED AND SO IF YOU ARE

13:21.000 --> 13:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO DEPEND ON US WE EXPECT

13:22.933 --> 13:23.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING FROM YOU?

13:23.867 --> 13:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL ALISON I THINK YOU HAVE

13:27.333 --> 13:29.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOTTEN TO THE CORE OF WHAT ONE

13:29.167 --> 13:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

13:30.833 --> 13:32.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRUMP WORLD VIEW AND THE

13:32.567 --> 13:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVENTIONAL WORLD VIEW

13:33.400 --> 13:34.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCLUDING HIS OWN PARTY'S THAT

13:34.900 --> 13:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE YEARS OR THE DECADES

13:37.400 --> 13:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SINCE WORLD WAR II AND SINCE THE

13:39.333 --> 13:41.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATION OF NATO, MORE THAN 50

13:41.267 --> 13:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS AGO, THE CONCEPT HAS BEEN

13:44.100 --> 13:47.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT ALLIANCES ARE ABOUT MORE

13:47.733 --> 13:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN ANY INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTION.

13:49.100 --> 13:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY ARE BUILDING A

13:50.033 --> 13:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP, BUILDING A EXON

13:53.233 --> 13:56.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFENSE -- A COMMON DEFENSE AND

13:56.367 --> 13:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT RELATIONSHIP YOU WORK ON

13:57.833 --> 14:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EACH YEAR AND YOU DON'T KEEP A

14:00.000 --> 14:01.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRICT LEDGER BOOK.

14:01.167 --> 14:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS VIEW BOTH IN EUROPE AND IN

14:02.533 --> 14:03.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ASIA IS QUITE DIFFERENT.

14:03.967 --> 14:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S THAT THESE ARE

14:06.633 --> 14:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSACTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS,

14:07.633 --> 14:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IF THE UNITED STATES IS

14:08.633 --> 14:11.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUNNING A TRADE DEFICIT WITH A

14:11.367 --> 14:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY WHICH IS ALSO PROVIDING

14:13.033 --> 14:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTION, THAT THAT TRADE

14:14.333 --> 14:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEFICIT OUGHT TO GET IN LINE, SO

14:16.167 --> 14:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE ARE NOT LOSING MONEY.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HE SET THAT HE WOULD BE

14:21.200 --> 14:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLING TO PULL AMERICAN TROOPS

14:23.300 --> 14:25.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF JAPAN AND SOUTH KOREA, IT

14:25.267 --> 14:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS BECAUSE IN HIS VIEW, THEY

14:26.900 --> 14:30.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEREN'T PAYING ALL OF THE COST,

14:30.467 --> 14:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY PAID JAPAN'S CASE ABOUT

14:34.800 --> 14:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HALF THE COST OF KEEPING TROOPS

14:37.000 --> 14:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE.

14:37.333 --> 14:39.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WASN'T A CONCEPT THAT KEEPING

14:39.767 --> 14:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TROOPS FORWARD-DEPLOYED WAS IN

14:41.967 --> 14:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICA'S OWN INTEREST AS WELL

14:42.900 --> 14:44.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS IN THE INTEREST OF ITS

14:44.633 --> 14:45.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLIES.

14:45.567 --> 14:47.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: I WANT TO READ ONE

14:47.167 --> 14:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE LINE FROM THAT OP ED THAT

14:50.033 --> 14:51.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.N. SECRETARY GENERALLY WROTE,

WHAT'S THE SUBTEXT OF THAT?

14:59.367 --> 15:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT RUSSIA, ARE

15:01.133 --> 15:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE TALKING ABOUT SYRIA?

15:03.100 --> 15:04.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

15:04.967 --> 15:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOTH.

15:05.700 --> 15:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN RUSSIA WILL BE ONE OF THE

15:08.167 --> 15:10.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRST GREAT TESTS AND IT WILL BE

15:10.067 --> 15:11.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TEST IN THE DEBATE OVER NATO

15:11.900 --> 15:15.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT WILL BE A TEST IN THE

15:15.267 --> 15:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEBATE OVER SYRIA.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT ELECT TRUMP GAVE AN

15:18.833 --> 15:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ON

15:21.667 --> 15:23.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIDAY IN WHICH HE SAID THAT HE

15:23.500 --> 15:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD RE-THINK ONE OF THE

15:25.467 --> 15:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNDAMENTAL TENETS OF THE

15:27.600 --> 15:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICAN POLICY TOWARDS SYRIA

15:29.033 --> 15:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH HAS BEEN TO HELP ARM AND

15:32.200 --> 15:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRAIN OPPOSITION GROUPS, TO

15:36.167 --> 15:37.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT ASSAD.

15:37.367 --> 15:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN MR. TRUMP'S VIEW AND THIS

15:39.400 --> 15:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS CONSISTENT BACK TO THE

15:40.600 --> 15:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERVIEWS WE DID WITH HIM IN

15:42.467 --> 15:44.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCH AND AGAIN IN JULY, THE

15:44.333 --> 15:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES SHOULD NOT BE

15:45.933 --> 15:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO KNOCK ASSAD OUT OF

15:48.467 --> 15:51.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OFFICE, OR EVEN ENCOURAGING A

15:51.167 --> 15:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATION IN WHICH HE WOULD GET

15:53.200 --> 15:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVERTHROWN, DESPITE THE FACT

15:54.167 --> 15:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

15:56.200 --> 15:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEATHS OF NEARLY HALF A MILLION

15:57.600 --> 15:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF HIS OWN CITIZENS.

15:59.400 --> 16:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IN HIS VIEW, THE ONE

16:01.633 --> 16:03.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOAL IN THE MIDDLE EAST SHOULD

16:03.033 --> 16:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE FIGHTING ISIS.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IF ASSAD IS ALSO FIGHTING

16:07.433 --> 16:08.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS WE OUGHT TO GET

16:08.467 --> 16:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOGETHER WITH HIM AND THE

16:09.233 --> 16:10.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS.

16:10.267 --> 16:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE HAVEN'T HEARD HIM FULLY

16:11.967 --> 16:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPLAIN HERE IS, THAT WOULD PUT

16:14.400 --> 16:16.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
US ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE FIGHT

16:16.633 --> 16:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE IRANIANS AS WELL AND AS

16:18.733 --> 16:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW HE'S GOT PRETTY STRONG

16:20.767 --> 16:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OPINIONS ABOUT IRAN.

16:22.300 --> 16:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: AT ONE POINT DAVID

16:25.233 --> 16:29.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATE TRUMP SAID, DISMANTLE

16:29.600 --> 16:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DISASTROUS DEAL WITH IRAN.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW COULD HE DO THAT?

16:32.700 --> 16:35.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> ONE RAILWAY HE COULD DO THAT

16:35.200 --> 16:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS SIMPLY ANNOUNCE THAT THE

16:36.200 --> 16:38.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNITED STATES WAS REIMPOSING

16:38.667 --> 16:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SANCTION HE IN IRAN, NOTHING IN

16:40.867 --> 16:44.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE NUCLEAR SPHERE, IN FACT, THE

16:44.567 --> 16:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRANIANS HAVE ABIDED TO THE

16:47.300 --> 16:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL, BUT PUTTING SANCTION HE ON

16:48.833 --> 16:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF

16:50.433 --> 16:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRORISM, FOR THEIR SUPPORT OF

16:52.233 --> 16:53.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEZBOLLAH, THEIR ACTION HE IN

16:53.667 --> 16:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIA AND SO FORTH.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THEY DID THAT THE IRANIANS

16:57.233 --> 16:58.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIGHT SAY HEY LOOK THIS IS NOT

16:58.667 --> 17:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF THE

17:00.200 --> 17:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGREEMENT, YOU TOOK SANCTIONS

17:01.767 --> 17:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WE REMOVED FROM THE NUCLEAR

17:03.833 --> 17:06.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL AND SIMPLY REIMPOSED THEM

17:06.367 --> 17:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH ANOTHER EXCUSE.

17:07.367 --> 17:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S SOMETHING THE UNITED

17:09.167 --> 17:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES SAID IT WOULD NOT DO

17:11.200 --> 17:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DURING THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.

17:12.233 --> 17:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD PROBABLY SERVE TO

17:15.033 --> 17:16.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNRAVEL THE DEAL, THAT IT IS

17:16.900 --> 17:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROBABLY THE IRANIANS WHO WOULD

17:18.833 --> 17:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DO THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS DOING

17:21.633 --> 17:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNRAVELING IN THAT CASE.

17:25.533 --> 17:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

TRUMP CAPTURED THE WHITE HOUSE

17:36.600 --> 17:38.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY WINNING 29 STATES-- 30 IF YOU

17:38.167 --> 17:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNT MICHIGAN, WHERE HE'S

17:39.633 --> 17:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AHEAD-- AND THE MOST ELECTORAL

17:41.100 --> 17:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTES, AT LEAST 290, 20 MORE

17:42.767 --> 17:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN NEEDED.

17:44.300 --> 17:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HILLARY CLINTON WON THE MOST

17:46.100 --> 17:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUAL VOTES NATIONWIDE-- THE

17:47.367 --> 17:48.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONAL POPULAR VOTE.

17:48.467 --> 17:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE'S CURRENTLY AHEAD BY 630-

17:49.700 --> 17:51.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOUSAND VOTES, BUT THAT GAP IS

17:51.167 --> 17:52.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROJECTED TO DOUBLE WHEN ALL THE

17:52.567 --> 17:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTES ARE COUNTED.

SCIENCE PROFESSOR JOSHUA TUCKER

17:58.000 --> 17:59.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID THIS:

17:59.467 --> 18:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IF TRUMP WINS THE ELECTION,

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A SMALL BUT NON-TRIVIAL

18:03.000 --> 18:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANCE THAT HE WOULD WIN THE

18:04.633 --> 18:06.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION WITHOUT HAVING RECEIVED

18:06.467 --> 18:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A MAJORITY OF THE POPULAR VOTE.

18:09.533 --> 18:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITHOUT EVEN SEEING A PLURALITY.

18:12.233 --> 18:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF HE WAS ELECTED WHERE HE WON

18:14.300 --> 18:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE BUT LOST

18:16.067 --> 18:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POPULAR VOTE, I THINK IT

18:17.533 --> 18:18.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD GIVE A STRONG IMPETUS TO

18:18.900 --> 18:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS MOVE TO NATIONAL POPULAR

18:20.033 --> 18:21.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE

18:21.867 --> 18:22.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: PROFESSOR TUCKER

18:22.767 --> 18:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOINS ME NOW FOR FURTHER

18:23.967 --> 18:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCUSSION OF THE POPULAR VOTE

18:25.333 --> 18:28.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERSUS THE ELECTORAL VOTE.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROFESSOR IN THAT PIECE WE

18:30.167 --> 18:32.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALKED ABOUT A DIFFERENT SYSTEM,

18:32.467 --> 18:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A COMPACT BETWEEN STATES, AS A

18:34.333 --> 18:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY TO MAKE THE POPULAR VOTE

18:36.000 --> 18:36.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNT MORE.

18:36.433 --> 18:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN YOU HELP US UNDERSTAND THAT

18:37.800 --> 18:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LITTLE BIT MORE?

18:38.733 --> 18:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE WAY THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE

18:40.567 --> 18:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS SET UP IS THAT IT IS IN THE

18:43.200 --> 18:44.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTION THAT THE ELECTORAL

18:44.567 --> 18:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COLLEGE SELECTS THE PRESIDENT OF

18:45.333 --> 18:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES.

18:46.467 --> 18:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER, IT'S ALSO IN THE

18:47.700 --> 18:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTION HOW THE ELECTORS

18:49.333 --> 18:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE ALLOCATED TO THE STATES.

18:50.700 --> 18:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HOW THE STATES PICK THE

18:53.233 --> 18:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTORS IS STATUTE LAW.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S NOT SET BY THE

18:57.367 --> 18:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTION, THAT IS SET BY THE

18:58.933 --> 19:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDIVIDUAL STATES THEMSELVES.

19:00.833 --> 19:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO NOW WHAT WE IS THIS WINNER

19:03.633 --> 19:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAKE ALT SYSTEM, 48 OF THE

19:08.800 --> 19:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE.

19:09.400 --> 19:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WOULD SEE TRUMP WOULD GET

19:12.900 --> 19:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
50% AND CLINTON WOULD GET 50%.

19:15.233 --> 19:17.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE HAVE IN 48 OF THE 50

19:17.367 --> 19:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES IS WHOEVER GETS ONE MORE

19:19.333 --> 19:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTE THAN ALL OF THE CANDIDATES

19:22.033 --> 19:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETS ALL OF THE ELECTORS.

19:23.333 --> 19:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT LAST

19:24.833 --> 19:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEKEND IS A PLAN THAT TRY TO

19:26.533 --> 19:28.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE THE WAY THAT STATES

19:28.167 --> 19:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOCATE THEIR ELECTORS AND THE

19:30.333 --> 19:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IDEA WOULD BE TO CHANGE THE

19:31.533 --> 19:32.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RULES SO THAT STATES WOULD

19:32.967 --> 19:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE THEIR ELECTORS NOT TO THE

19:34.433 --> 19:36.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERSON WHO GOT THE MOST VOTES IN

19:36.767 --> 19:38.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR STATE BUT TO THE CANDIDATE

19:38.267 --> 19:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT GOT THE MOST VOTES

19:39.500 --> 19:40.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATIONALLY.

19:40.367 --> 19:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STATES HAVE THE POWER TO DO

19:42.267 --> 19:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN FACT, THERE ARE 11 TASTES

19:45.967 --> 19:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAVE PASSED LAWS TO DO

19:48.333 --> 19:50.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXACTLY THIS, CONDITIONED ON THE

19:50.267 --> 19:51.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FACT THAT ENOUGH OTHER STATES

19:51.633 --> 19:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PASSING THE LAWS THAT WOULD

19:52.900 --> 19:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALLOW SOME TOTAL OF THE STATES

19:54.100 --> 19:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO BE 270 OR HIGHER OR ENOUGH TO

19:56.133 --> 19:56.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECT THE PRESIDENT.

19:56.667 --> 19:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS HAS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES,

19:59.433 --> 20:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TWICE IN THE PAST 16 YEARS.

20:01.133 --> 20:03.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT HAS THAT TOLD YOU AS A

20:03.267 --> 20:04.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL SCIENCE?

20:04.267 --> 20:06.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I'VE BEEN TEACHING ABOUT THIS

20:06.667 --> 20:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR YEARS.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU SAY THIS IS A HYPOTHETICAL

20:09.633 --> 20:11.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBILITY THAT IN THE 1800S

20:11.167 --> 20:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS HAPPENED A NUMBER OF TIMES,

20:12.400 --> 20:13.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT?

20:13.267 --> 20:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IT'S A HYPOTHETICAL

20:16.167 --> 20:17.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSSIBILITY, YOU COULD

20:17.667 --> 20:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCEIVABLY HAVE THIS BUT IT'S

20:19.467 --> 20:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN OVER 100 YEARS THAT THIS

20:22.333 --> 20:22.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED.

20:22.867 --> 20:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT

20:23.967 --> 20:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESONATES WITH PEOPLE.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN AFTER 2000, THERE WAS A LOT

20:27.333 --> 20:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF TALK, THAT PEOPLE MIGHT WANT

20:29.900 --> 20:32.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO CHANGE THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GEORGE BUSH GOT HE ELECTED,

20:35.133 --> 20:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVING HALF A MILLION FEWER

20:37.100 --> 20:38.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTES THAN AL GORE.

20:38.267 --> 20:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A LIGHTNING SHOT, REALLY

20:40.900 --> 20:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNLIKELY, SOMETHING THAT HASN'T

20:42.567 --> 20:43.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENED FOR 100 YEARS, MAYBE

20:43.967 --> 20:45.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULDN'T HAVE FOR 100 MORE YEARS

20:45.767 --> 20:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE COUNTRY MOVED ON AND

20:48.367 --> 20:50.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE FORGOT ABOUT IT.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS TWICE IN 16 YEARS AND

20:52.600 --> 20:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE IMPORTANTLY IT IS TWICE IN

20:53.900 --> 20:55.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
16 YEARS WITH THE SAME PARTY

20:55.267 --> 20:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFITING.

20:56.167 --> 20:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT LEGITIMACY,

20:59.133 --> 21:01.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THIS HAPPENED TO RUTHERFORD

21:01.433 --> 21:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
B. HAYES AND IT WAS DECIDED IN

21:03.433 --> 21:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS UNDER POLITICAL

21:04.133 --> 21:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HE WOULD BE

21:06.933 --> 21:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT, HE WAS REFERRED TO AS

21:10.467 --> 21:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE FRAUD B. HAYES.

21:13.800 --> 21:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THIS SYSTEM ALMOST UNFAIR TO

21:16.700 --> 21:18.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WINNER IN SOME WAYS?

21:18.067 --> 21:20.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION.

21:20.067 --> 21:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAIN THIS IS HYPOTHETICAL UNTIL

21:21.067 --> 21:23.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT 16 YEARS AGO, DIDN'T SEEM

21:23.067 --> 21:23.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REAL.

21:23.900 --> 21:24.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW IT SEEMS REAL.

21:24.833 --> 21:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS ANOTHER ISSUE OF

21:29.000 --> 21:30.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGITIMACY ALSO, THAT THE UNITED

21:30.333 --> 21:33.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES HAS BEEN AT THE FOREFRONT

21:33.067 --> 21:34.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DEMOCRACY PROPOSITION WORLD

21:34.333 --> 21:35.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER.

21:35.267 --> 21:37.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE BEEN OUT THERE TALK

21:37.567 --> 21:38.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING

21:38.667 --> 21:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FREE AND FAIR DEMOCRATIC

21:39.600 --> 21:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOW WHEN YOU HAVE GOVERNMENTS

21:41.600 --> 21:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WANT TO PUSH BACK AND SAY

21:43.400 --> 21:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HEY WE DON'T NEED THIS FREE AND

21:45.833 --> 21:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAIR --

21:46.467 --> 21:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Stewart: I READ ABOUT THIS,

21:48.300 --> 21:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A TALK POINT IN CHINA TO SAY

21:49.933 --> 21:51.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK WHAT THE AMERICANS DID.

21:51.233 --> 21:52.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> OH YES.

21:52.567 --> 21:54.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ISSUE IS WHEN YOU HAVE

21:54.067 --> 21:56.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE AGITATING OR PUSHING FOR

21:56.100 --> 21:57.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
