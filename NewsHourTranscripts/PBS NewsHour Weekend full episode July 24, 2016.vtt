PUT THIS IN CONTEXT FOR US AT

02:06.400 --> 02:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EVE OF THE MAJOR EVENT FOR

02:08.133 --> 02:09.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POLITICAL PARTY, THE

02:09.700 --> 02:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEADERSHIP CHANGES?

02:11.933 --> 02:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YEAH, LIKE THEY SAY ABOUT THE

02:13.333 --> 02:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECRET OF GOOD COMEDY, TIMING IS

02:14.400 --> 02:15.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYTHING.

02:15.167 --> 02:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS A HEAT WAVE HITTING

02:16.833 --> 02:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE BUT THAT IS NOTHING

02:17.533 --> 02:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPARED TO THE POLITICAL HEAT

02:18.933 --> 02:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAS RISING AROUND THE DNC

02:20.900 --> 02:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN IN THE

02:22.533 --> 02:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAKE OF THOSE REVELATIONS FROM

02:24.033 --> 02:24.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WIKILEAKS.

02:24.633 --> 02:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE SANDERS PEOPLE HAD LONG

02:26.400 --> 02:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUSPECTED THAT THE DNC WAS IN

02:27.833 --> 02:29.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAGUE WITH THE CLINTONS AND

02:29.467 --> 02:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE LEAKED DOCUMENTS SEEM TO

02:31.100 --> 02:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNDERMINE THAT OR SUPPORT IT

02:31.933 --> 02:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WAS NO WAY THE DEMOCRATS

02:33.700 --> 02:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COULD CONDUCT A WEEK LONG

02:35.433 --> 02:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONVENTION WITH THE CONSTANT

02:36.167 --> 02:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DRUM BEAT OF ANGER AND

02:38.200 --> 02:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMANDS THAT DEBBIE

02:40.733 --> 02:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASSERMAN-SCHULTZ STEP DOWN, SO

02:42.133 --> 02:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHE FELL ON HER SWORD.

02:43.100 --> 02:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WE KNOW THE

02:44.300 --> 02:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTENT OF THE PARTY'S DECISION

02:45.433 --> 02:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE, TO TRY TO MAKE THIS

02:47.700 --> 02:49.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PERHAPS A HEALING MOMENT WHERE

02:49.067 --> 02:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY CAN GET OVER THIS Z BUT

02:52.200 --> 02:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THIS POTENTIALLY ADD MORE

02:53.300 --> 02:55.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUEL TO THOSE BERNIE SANDERS WHO

02:55.500 --> 02:57.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FEEL SLIGHTED THROUGHOUT THE

02:57.633 --> 02:59.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENTIRE PROCESS?

02:59.167 --> 03:00.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> LOOK, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY

03:00.300 --> 03:01.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THAT HAVING SCORED ONE

03:01.867 --> 03:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KILL, THEY MAY START RATCHETING

03:03.833 --> 03:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UP DEMANDS, MAYBE TRYING TO

03:06.133 --> 03:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFOCUS ON THE SUPERDELEGATE

03:08.300 --> 03:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUE.

03:08.800 --> 03:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE OTHER PART IS THAT THE

03:10.533 --> 03:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE MUCH SPORT

03:12.133 --> 03:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT OF ALL THE STUMBLES ON THE

03:14.600 --> 03:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN CAMPAIGN, THE

03:16.000 --> 03:17.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAGIARISM, THE TED CRUZ BLOWUP,

03:17.800 --> 03:18.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THAT STUFF.

03:19.133 --> 03:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S VERY HARD FOR THE

03:20.700 --> 03:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATS TO ARGUE, WE KNOW HOW

03:22.633 --> 03:23.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO RUN A CAMPAIGN.

03:23.167 --> 03:24.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE KNOW HOW TO RUN A CONVENTION,

03:24.733 --> 03:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEREFORE WE KNOW HOW TO RUN THE

03:26.100 --> 03:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY.

03:26.633 --> 03:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK WE'RE NOT LIKELY TO

03:28.300 --> 03:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THE END OF THE TURMOIL BUT

03:30.933 --> 03:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT LEAST THE MOST VISIBLE

03:33.500 --> 03:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TARGET HAS NOW BEEN REMOVED.

03:35.033 --> 03:37.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ARE THE

03:37.200 --> 03:38.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS, DOES IT

03:38.167 --> 03:39.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFECT THE SPEAKER LINE-UP.

03:39.300 --> 03:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THERE LIKELY TO BE A CHANGE

03:40.867 --> 03:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE AUDIENCE AT HOME SEES?

03:45.133 --> 03:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> NO.

03:46.300 --> 03:47.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE CONVENTION WILL GO

03:47.933 --> 03:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON AS PLANNED.

03:48.933 --> 03:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE GOT THEIR 60 PLUS

03:50.333 --> 03:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPEAKERS.

03:51.133 --> 03:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE

03:52.633 --> 03:53.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMOVAL OF SCHULTZ SHOULD CAUSE

03:53.867 --> 03:54.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANY CHANGE IN THAT.

03:54.933 --> 03:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE QUESTION, AND YOU RAISED IT

03:56.733 --> 03:58.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARLIER, IS THIS GOING TO

03:58.167 --> 03:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBOLDEN THE SANDERS PEOPLE TO

03:59.700 --> 04:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRY TO MAKE FLOOR FIGHTS OUT OF

04:01.667 --> 04:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES THAT THEY IN THE PAST

04:03.000 --> 04:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE SAID OKAY, WE'LL SETTLE

04:04.633 --> 04:05.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IN COMMITTEE.

04:05.433 --> 04:06.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WISH I COULD TILL THE ANSWER

04:06.467 --> 04:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO THAT BUT AS I OFTEN SAID, IF
