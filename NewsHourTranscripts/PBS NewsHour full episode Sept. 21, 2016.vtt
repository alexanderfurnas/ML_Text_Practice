GWEN IFILL: Good evening.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.473 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm Gwen Ifill.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

00:08.375 --> 00:11.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: Protests
erupt in Charlotte, North
Carolina,as the

00:11.712 --> 00:15.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
city attempts to get to the
bottom of how
a black man was killed by
police.

00:15.415 --> 00:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday,
we sit down with Libertarian
presidential

00:19.686 --> 00:25.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate Gary Johnson on what
it means to
his campaign to be left off the
first debate

00:25.559 --> 00:27.294 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stage.

00:27.327 --> 00:30.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Plus, a deep dive
into Donald
Trump's overseas businesses, and
how those

00:30.864 --> 00:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
entanglements could affect his
foreign policy.

00:33.267 --> 00:39.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And a look at the
historical
gems inside the new National
Museum of African

00:39.139 --> 00:42.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American History and Culture
sitting in the
country's front yard.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE Bunch, Director, National
Museum of
African American History and
Culture: I hope

00:45.545 --> 00:51.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this museum will continue to
evolve, continue
to change, because it really has
to be a place

00:51.418 --> 00:56.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that is the great convener, that
can bring
anybody and everybody into a
conversation

00:56.657 --> 00:57.891 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around race.

00:57.925 --> 01:04.364 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.398 --> 01:06.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:06.767 --> 01:17.678 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's an all-too-
familiar story,
in a new setting.

01:17.711 --> 01:22.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This time, the city of Charlotte
is on edge,
awaiting a second night of
protests over the

01:22.649 --> 01:24.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
police killing of a black man.

01:24.751 --> 01:29.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The drama began with a Tuesday
confrontation
that sparked a night of trouble.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.425 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham begins our
coverage.

01:31.458 --> 01:37.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Within hours
of the fatal
shooting, protests boiled over
in North Carolina's

01:37.130 --> 01:38.098 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
largest city.

01:38.131 --> 01:41.368 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The victim was 43-year-old Keith
Lamont Scott.

01:41.401 --> 01:44.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his sister, who didn't give
her name,
said he was unarmed.

01:44.438 --> 01:48.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: They said, hands up, he
got a gun,
he got a gun.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Pow, pow, pow, pow.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.011 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's it.

01:51.044 --> 01:52.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He had no gun.

01:52.713 --> 01:55.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Another woman,
claiming
to be Scott's daughter, went on
Facebook,

01:55.615 --> 02:00.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying he'd had a book, not a
gun, and also
had an unspecified disability.

02:00.654 --> 02:05.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In short order, a crowd blocked
traffic on
Interstate 85, throwing rocks,
and destroying

02:05.993 --> 02:07.127 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police cars.

02:07.160 --> 02:10.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Some looted a tractor-trailer
and set it on
fire.

02:10.731 --> 02:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Others broke into a nearby
Wal-Mart.

02:13.100 --> 02:17.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police eventually used tear gas
to quell the
violence, but 16 officers were
injured.

02:17.771 --> 02:21.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This morning, police chief Kerr
Putney urged
people to step back and be calm.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.643 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
KERR PUTNEY,
Charlotte-Mecklenburg, North
Carolina, Police Chief: It's
time to change

02:23.677 --> 02:30.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the narrative, because I can
tell you from
the facts that the story is a
little bit different

02:31.018 --> 02:34.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as to how it's been portrayed so
far, especially
through social media.

02:34.421 --> 02:38.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As Putney told
it, officers
had been at an apartment
complex, searching

02:38.625 --> 02:41.661 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for a suspect, when they saw
Scott get out
of a car.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say he did have a gun, and
refused to
put it down.

02:44.865 --> 02:52.406 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KERR PUTNEY: In spite of the
verbal commands,
Mr. Scott, as I said, exited his
vehicle armed

02:52.439 --> 02:58.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a handgun, as the officers
continued
to yell at him to drop it.

02:58.945 --> 03:06.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He stepped out, posing a threat
to the officers,
and officer Brentley Vinson
subsequently fired

03:06.119 --> 03:08.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
his weapon, striking the
subject.

03:08.088 --> 03:12.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The officer,
who is also
black, was placed on
administrative leave,

03:12.159 --> 03:14.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which is standard procedure in
such cases.

03:14.528 --> 03:18.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, local activists and
ministers called
for an economic boycott of
Charlotte.

03:18.732 --> 03:23.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN BARNETT, Civil Rights
Attorney: Across
the country, we are being shot
down, shot

03:24.004 --> 03:24.971 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Very few cops go to jail for
that.

03:26.573 --> 03:30.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And by late
this afternoon,
protests were starting up again.

03:30.110 --> 03:34.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This incident came just a day
after graphic
video from Tulsa, Oklahoma, that
showed an

03:35.015 --> 03:37.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer shooting an unarmed
black man.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.719 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

03:39.753 --> 03:44.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: We will hear from
the mayor of
Charlotte after the news
summary.

03:44.057 --> 03:48.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
Federal Reserve held fast on
keeping a key

03:48.462 --> 03:51.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
short-term interest rate near
record lows.

03:51.998 --> 03:57.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Fed Chair Janet Yellen said
economic activity
has picked up, but there's no
need yet to

03:57.437 --> 03:59.206 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
put on the brakes.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANET YELLEN, Federal Reserve
Chair: We're
not seeing strong pressures on
utilization,

04:02.909 --> 04:08.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suggesting overheating, and my
assessment
would be, based on this
evidence, that the

04:08.882 --> 04:15.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
economy has a little more room
to run Than
might have been previously
thought.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's good news.

04:16.957 --> 04:21.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yellen did
suggest an interest
rate increase is likely before
year's end.

04:21.361 --> 04:24.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Fed's action
sent Wall Street
higher.

04:24.664 --> 04:30.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 163
points to close at 18293.

04:31.004 --> 04:35.108 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 54
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added 23.

04:35.142 --> 04:40.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The crisis in
Syria took center
stage today at the U.N. Security
Council.

04:40.881 --> 04:46.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. and Russia clashed over
the failure
of the latest cease-fire, and
Monday's deadly

04:46.219 --> 04:48.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
attack on an aid convoy.

04:48.488 --> 04:54.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov denied
responsibility and offered other
explanations.

04:54.361 --> 04:59.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Secretary of State John
Kerry shot back,
"This is not a joke," and he
condemned what

04:59.666 --> 05:01.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he called word games.

05:01.468 --> 05:06.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY, U.S. Secretary of
State: Now,
this attack has dealt a very
heavy blow to

05:06.139 --> 05:11.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our efforts to bring peace to
Syria, and it
raises a profound doubt about
whether Russia

05:11.044 --> 05:16.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the Assad regime can or will
live up to
the obligations that they agreed
to in Geneva.

05:16.349 --> 05:22.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Kerry called for
grounding
all aircraft flying over routes
for humanitarian

05:22.322 --> 05:23.924 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deliveries.

05:23.957 --> 05:28.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, another airstrike hit
a mobile
medical unit outside Aleppo
overnight.

05:28.862 --> 05:32.032 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Activists reported at least 13
people died.

05:32.065 --> 05:37.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: President Obama and
Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had
a final meeting

05:37.804 --> 05:41.074 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today at the U.N., after years
of testy relations.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.710 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This time, the two leaders were
all smiles.

05:43.743 --> 05:50.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president said a new $38
billion military
aid package will let Israel cope
with -- quote

05:50.050 --> 05:52.586 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- "enormous uncertainty in the
region."

05:52.619 --> 05:57.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The cost of the
emergency allergy
shot EpiPen and the company that
makes it

05:57.757 --> 06:01.228 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
drew bipartisan scorn today from
Congress.

06:01.261 --> 06:07.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a House hearing, Heather
Bresch, CEO of
drugmaker Mylan, defended
raising the price

06:07.567 --> 06:11.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 500 percent since
2007.

06:11.137 --> 06:14.674 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It now costs $608 for a
two-pack.

06:14.708 --> 06:20.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
She said Mylan will soon
introduce a generic
version at half the cost, but
lawmakers were

06:20.180 --> 06:21.147 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
unimpressed.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.882 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

06:22.916 --> 06:23.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SCOTT DESJARLAIS (R), Tennessee:
A mother
would cut off her right arm to
get that dose

06:23.817 --> 06:25.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of drug.

06:25.685 --> 06:28.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You decided to charge $600,
instead of cutting
off her arm, and now you're
saying you're

06:28.088 --> 06:31.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dropping it to $300 and that
should make us
all feel better, when, in fact,
that's probably

06:31.858 --> 06:33.693 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about 10 times what the drug
should cost.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HEATHER BRESCH, CEO, Mylan:
Congressman, we
want everyone who needs an
EpiPen to have

06:36.730 --> 06:38.531 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
an EpiPen.

06:38.565 --> 06:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the programs that we put in
place, from
the generic, to the higher
patient assistant

06:43.737 --> 06:50.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
program, to the co-pay card, so
trying to
address every facet of patient
to make sure

06:50.176 --> 06:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they can have access to EpiPen
is what we
will remain focused on.

06:54.214 --> 06:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Bresch went on to
say the company
makes $50 profit from each
EpiPen.

06:58.918 --> 07:04.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And outside the
Capitol today,
construction crews started work
on the platform

07:04.324 --> 07:09.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for January's inauguration of
the 45th president
of the United States.

07:09.195 --> 07:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican and Democratic
leaders hammered
in the ceremonial first nails
for the massive

07:14.401 --> 07:20.140 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
10,000-square-foot structure;
1,600 people
will have to fit on the stage.

07:20.173 --> 07:24.911 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
we sit down with libertarian
presidential

07:24.944 --> 07:31.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidate Gary Johnson; Donald
Trump's foreign
business dealings as potential
conflicts of

07:31.251 --> 07:41.294 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interest; police robots being
used to detonate
and defuse bombs; and much more.

07:41.294 --> 07:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
interest; police robots being
used to detonate
and defuse bombs; and much more.

07:49.803 --> 07:54.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We return now to the fatal
police shooting
in Charlotte, North Carolina
late yesterday

07:54.974 --> 07:57.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the violent street protests
that followed.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here with me now is the city's
mayor, Jennifer
Roberts.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, Mayor Roberts.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

08:04.184 --> 08:07.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're hearing two different
versions upon
what happened.

08:07.187 --> 08:13.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there any new information to
come forward
late today that lends credence
to either version?

08:13.727 --> 08:16.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER ROBERTS (D), Mayor of
Charlotte,
North Carolina: Well, we have
heard from our

08:16.196 --> 08:20.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
police chief that we do have
video footage
of the incident.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.902 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are still analyzing it.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's from different angles.

08:24.804 --> 08:30.343 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have heard that a gun was
found on the
scene, that there was no book
found on the

08:30.377 --> 08:38.184 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
scene, and that we are
corroborating different
witness views as well to make
sure that we

08:38.218 --> 08:40.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have all the facts in hand.

08:40.186 --> 08:44.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we are hearing a very
different story
from within the city.

08:44.057 --> 08:48.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mean from
within the community,
from the relative, or apparently
the daughter

08:48.661 --> 08:54.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the victim, and from an
eyewitness who
said she saw a book fall out of
his lap when

08:54.467 --> 08:56.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
he got out of the car.

08:56.636 --> 09:01.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER ROBERTS: We want to
make sure that
we have a thorough
investigation.

09:01.408 --> 09:06.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a history in Charlotte
of being very
transparent, and we absolutely
want the community

09:06.946 --> 09:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to know that this investigation
will have
the highest integrity.

09:10.817 --> 09:15.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We want the community to be
patient as we
put together all the facts.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know there are different
versions of the
story out there.

09:18.825 --> 09:24.197 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And we are calling for a
peaceful protest
while we put everything
together, while we

09:24.230 --> 09:25.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get the evidence clear.

09:25.665 --> 09:31.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Will the gun that
was found
be publicly released?

09:31.938 --> 09:33.473 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Will it be shown to the public?

09:33.506 --> 09:37.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And will that video that we
understand that's
available be shown?

09:37.877 --> 09:43.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER ROBERTS: Well, I have
asked to see
the video footage as soon as
possible.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The chief, at his discretion,
can show it
to leaders in the community.

09:46.686 --> 09:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are working with our officers
to help get
that information to some key
people.

09:53.827 --> 10:01.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And absolutely, evidence, once
the investigation
is completed and that we are
sure we have

10:01.434 --> 10:06.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all of it, and it is accurate, I
want us to
be as transparent as possible.

10:06.673 --> 10:13.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We absolutely need to show folks
that this
is an investigation that is
transparent with

10:13.313 --> 10:15.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the highest integrity.

10:15.215 --> 10:18.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, does that
mean that all
of this material will ultimately
be made available?

10:18.718 --> 10:22.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JENNIFER ROBERTS: Well, there
are some legal
issues around that.

10:22.755 --> 10:30.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our policy has been that while
the investigation
is still active, that that is
not made public.

10:30.230 --> 10:36.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But once the investigation is
concluded, whatever
that conclusion is, then it will
be accessible.

10:36.803 --> 10:40.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In terms of what extent, again,
there are
some legal procedures to go
through.

10:40.874 --> 10:46.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But my goal is to make it as
clear as possible
as soon as possible.

10:46.479 --> 10:52.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you have any
more information,
Mayor Roberts, about who the
victim was?

10:52.252 --> 10:56.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that the woman who said
she was his
daughter said that he had a
disability.

10:56.189 --> 10:57.991 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do we know any more about that?

10:58.024 --> 11:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JENNIFER ROBERTS: I have not
been able to
confirm any more information
about the victim.

11:03.696 --> 11:09.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know that there are many folks
in the community
who are stepping up, our faith
leaders, our

11:09.536 --> 11:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
community leaders, who are
calling for peace,
who are calling for patience.

11:14.974 --> 11:20.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Absolutely want people to
express their views,
express their frustration,
perhaps, with the

11:20.413 --> 11:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
slowness of information coming
out.

11:22.448 --> 11:26.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we are calling for peace and
hoping that
people will wait until it all
becomes clear

11:26.886 --> 11:28.721 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we can get that information
out.

11:28.755 --> 11:32.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We reported just
a few moments
ago that there appeared to be
demonstrations

11:32.559 --> 11:36.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
forming this afternoon in
Charlotte.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the state of what's
going on in the
community right now?

11:38.665 --> 11:41.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER ROBERTS: We have had
some gatherings.

11:41.601 --> 11:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We had a small gathering of
people in our
uptown area of people very
peacefully, very

11:45.972 --> 11:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
quietly holding up signs, Black
Lives Matter.

11:50.376 --> 11:55.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a gathering of the faith
community
and some faith leaders who are
gathering in

11:56.015 --> 11:59.085 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a park who have made it very
clear this is
peaceful.

11:59.118 --> 12:06.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They want to express their
concern with a
story that, again, has played
out all around

12:06.893 --> 12:08.761 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the country.

12:08.795 --> 12:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And folks are very skeptical, to
be honest,
of some of the investigations
that have happened.

12:15.501 --> 12:17.737 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we want people to express
that frustration.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We want to work with our
community.

12:19.639 --> 12:24.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a long tradition of our
faith leaders,
of our business and community
leaders coming

12:24.143 --> 12:26.579 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
together to work through these
things.

12:26.613 --> 12:28.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we have had numerous
dialogues.

12:28.448 --> 12:34.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have a community relations
committee that
the city has that has a process
where we can

12:34.153 --> 12:35.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have these constructive
dialogues.

12:35.888 --> 12:40.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally, just
quickly,
we understand President Obama
telephoned you

12:40.126 --> 12:41.094 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

12:41.127 --> 12:42.095 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

12:42.128 --> 12:43.096 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What did he say?

12:43.129 --> 12:44.998 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JENNIFER ROBERTS: Absolutely.

12:45.031 --> 12:50.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have spoken to President
Obama, and he certainly
offered any help the federal
government could

12:50.169 --> 12:52.005 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
provide.

12:52.038 --> 12:55.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are folks in the Justice
Department,
others who have worked with
community policing

12:55.908 --> 12:59.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
strategies who know how to work
with communities.

12:59.746 --> 13:02.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I was grateful for the call.

13:02.515 --> 13:09.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, this is something our
country is
facing, and we absolutely do
need to know

13:09.756 --> 13:12.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that there are racial
disparities still in
our country.

13:12.158 --> 13:17.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it is in our best interests
and in our
community's best interest to
work together,

13:17.096 --> 13:23.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to continue to be a country that
is more equal
and where everyone is treated
with dignity

13:23.302 --> 13:24.270 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and respect.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we pledge to do that here in
Charlotte.

13:26.072 --> 13:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mayor Jennifer
Roberts, the
mayor of the city of Charlotte,
thank you

13:29.308 --> 13:30.276 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

13:30.309 --> 13:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JENNIFER ROBERTS: Thanks for
having me.

13:35.748 --> 13:48.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Issues of race and
justice were
also the candidates' focus on
the campaign

13:48.294 --> 13:49.562 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
trail today.

13:49.595 --> 13:50.863 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang reports.

13:50.897 --> 13:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a warning: It includes
language that may
be offensive.

13:54.200 --> 14:01.340 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Donald Trump, the
self-proclaimed
law and order candidate, raised
questions

14:01.374 --> 14:06.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
today about the actions of a
white police
officer whose shooting of an
unarmed black

14:06.045 --> 14:10.616 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
man last week is being
investigated by the
Justice Department.

14:10.650 --> 14:15.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I watched the shooting, in
particular, in

14:15.154 --> 14:21.561 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tulsa, and that man was hands
up.

14:21.594 --> 14:27.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That man went to the car, hands
up, put his
hand on the car.

14:27.667 --> 14:33.139 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, to me, it looked like he
did everything
you're supposed to do.

14:33.172 --> 14:38.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this young officer, I don't
know what
she was thinking.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.613 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know what she was
thinking.

14:40.646 --> 14:43.049 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I'm very, very troubled by
that.

14:43.082 --> 14:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump was speaking
during a conference
of pastors at a black church in
a Cleveland

14:48.121 --> 14:51.958 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
suburb.

14:51.991 --> 14:55.495 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was introduced by boxing
promoter Don King.

14:55.528 --> 15:00.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
King recalled counseling Michael
Jackson about
the realities of how blacks are
viewed in

15:00.700 --> 15:04.103 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
America, and appeared to
accidentally use
the N-word.

15:04.137 --> 15:09.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DON KING, Founder, Don King
Productions: if
you are rich, you are a rich
Negro.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.510 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If you are intelligent,
intellectual, you're
an intellectual Negro.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you are a dancing and sliding
and gliding
nigger -- I mean Negro.

15:12.945 --> 15:14.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

15:14.213 --> 15:22.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DON KING: You are a dancing and
sliding and
gliding Negro.

15:22.188 --> 15:29.695 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So dare not alienate because you
cannot assimilate.

15:29.729 --> 15:35.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In a town hall airing
tonight on
FOX News, Trump said he wants to
see more

15:35.601 --> 15:39.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
use of stop and frisk, a
practice a federal
judge has called
unconstitutional.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Hello, Orlando!

15:42.875 --> 15:46.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: In Orlando, Hillary
Clinton also
weighed in on race and policing.

15:46.979 --> 15:51.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: We have
two more names
to add to a list of
African-Americans killed

15:51.484 --> 15:54.654 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by police officers in these
encounters.

15:54.687 --> 15:55.655 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's unbearable.

15:55.688 --> 15:58.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And it needs to become
intolerable.

15:58.391 --> 16:05.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to come together, work
together, white,
black, Latino, Asian, all of us,
to turn the

16:05.898 --> 16:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
tide, stop the violence, build
the trust.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

16:10.736 --> 16:15.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: As the campaign heads
into the
homestretch, Clinton has a big
financial advantage

16:15.441 --> 16:16.843 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over Trump.

16:16.876 --> 16:22.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In August, she raised $60
million, her biggest
one-month haul yet.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump raised just over $40
million.

16:24.884 --> 16:28.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Much of Clinton's money has been
going into
TV ads.

16:28.120 --> 16:33.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since mid-August, according to
one analysis,
Clinton has outspent Trump on TV
by more than

16:33.726 --> 16:35.494 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2-1.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

16:37.897 --> 16:42.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Only five days until
the first
presidential debate, but
Libertarian nominee

16:42.768 --> 16:48.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gary Johnson won't be on that
stage, after
saying it was his only path to
victory.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's where Governor Johnson
and I began
our conversation earlier today.

16:51.844 --> 16:56.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON, Libertarian
Presidential Candidate:
Interestingly, something that I
didn't know

16:56.716 --> 17:02.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is that I am polling higher than
Ross Perot
was polling before he was
admitted into those

17:02.588 --> 17:03.556 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
debates.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The rules were
different.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.392 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: The rules were
different.

17:06.425 --> 17:09.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, the rules were
really adopted
to make sure that a third party
would never

17:09.528 --> 17:10.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be on the stage again.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, what do you do?

17:12.465 --> 17:14.934 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, you just
keep plugging
away.

17:14.967 --> 17:19.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, I'm representing, I
think, the majority
of voters in this country.

17:19.472 --> 17:25.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The majority of voters in this
country don't
know that, but, you know, that's
my task,

17:25.278 --> 17:32.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, speaking broadly, fiscally
conservative,
socially inclusive, skeptical
when it comes

17:32.218 --> 17:40.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to our military interventions,
regime change,
and free market, devoid of crony
capitalism,

17:40.092 --> 17:41.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
devoid of pay-to-play.

17:41.794 --> 17:45.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But you have just
described for
me a rock and a hard place,
classic.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you don't get known, you
can't get on the
debate stage.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

17:49.402 --> 17:50.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: It's a catch-22,
yes.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No, it's totally a catch-22.

17:52.138 --> 17:55.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, there is, as we
have seen
in lots of polls, evidence that
there are

17:55.775 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of voters out there who
don't much like
Donald Trump, don't much like
Hillary Clinton,

18:00.446 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who are curious about you.

18:02.214 --> 18:03.449 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you get them to find out?

18:03.482 --> 18:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, I have never
had an issue
with 15 percent.

18:07.219 --> 18:10.690 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which is the barrier
to get on
the debate stage.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: Yes.

18:12.458 --> 18:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But here it is, is that my name
has never
appeared in one national poll as
the first

18:17.330 --> 18:20.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
question, Johnson, Trump, or
Clinton, not
one.

18:20.232 --> 18:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why should it?

18:21.534 --> 18:24.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, that I'm on
the ballot
in all 50 states.

18:24.470 --> 18:27.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm the only third party on
the the ballot
in all 50 states.

18:27.873 --> 18:33.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have maintained, tongue in
cheek, that if
Mickey Mouse were the third name
on that top

18:33.145 --> 18:35.047 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
line, Mickey would be at 30
percent.

18:35.081 --> 18:37.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mickey is a known commodity.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Mickey is not on the ballot
in all 50
states either.

18:39.652 --> 18:45.825 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: How do you
capitalize on the unpopularity
of the other candidates, and
maybe make the

18:45.858 --> 18:48.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
support that you have, which
might be soft,
if it doesn't look like you're
going to be

18:48.995 --> 18:50.062 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the debate stage?

18:50.096 --> 18:51.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do you harden that up?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, actually, I
think the
support is really hard.

18:53.866 --> 18:59.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, there was a poll
released that
I'm number one among
independents right now.

18:59.071 --> 19:03.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's something I would
want to point
out also, is, is that the
largest group of

19:03.042 --> 19:08.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the voting population is
independents at about
45 percent now of the
population.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where's their representation?

19:10.649 --> 19:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, as of last night, I'm
leading in that
group, which I think speaks
volumes.

19:15.087 --> 19:18.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I'm going to now
give you an opportunity
to get past polls and talk about
governing

19:18.591 --> 19:19.525 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and leadership.

19:19.558 --> 19:20.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: Yes.

19:20.559 --> 19:22.361 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, this week, we
have seen a
series of attacks in New York
and New Jersey,

19:24.764 --> 19:27.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attempted attacks in Minnesota.

19:27.099 --> 19:30.169 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It never seems to go away.

19:30.202 --> 19:33.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have advocated eliminating
the Department
of Homeland Security.

19:33.939 --> 19:35.975 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that something you would
still do, giving
what we are facing?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.843 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: Yes.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No, I just think that it's an
added layer
of bureaucracy that really
hasn't accomplished

19:40.713 --> 19:42.515 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
anything.

19:42.548 --> 19:47.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But talking about governing,
this was what
I really enjoyed being -- what I
really enjoyed

19:47.953 --> 19:53.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being governor of New Mexico, is
really being
at the center, in this case, if
I were president

19:53.125 --> 19:54.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the United States.

19:54.960 --> 19:59.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clearly, what we're doing is
working up to
a certain point, but, clearly,
right now,

20:00.032 --> 20:01.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
there's a breakdown.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I'm talking about the
shooter in Orlando,
the fact that they did know
about this guy

20:05.671 --> 20:06.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in New York.

20:06.739 --> 20:09.809 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At least, you know, he was on
the radar screen.

20:09.842 --> 20:12.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is it an issue of more
resources?

20:12.044 --> 20:18.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have found that those in law
enforcement,
you know, they really do know
their jobs.

20:18.417 --> 20:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But you would break
apart the
Department of Homeland Security.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That wouldn't make our ability
to fight these
people or track those people
weaker?

20:25.558 --> 20:27.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: No.

20:27.493 --> 20:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Keep in mind, these are 22
agencies that were
brought together under the
Department of Homeland

20:31.430 --> 20:33.199 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Security.

20:33.232 --> 20:36.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In my opinion, they left their
homes that
they had existed in for a long
time, and that

20:36.869 --> 20:42.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now we just have an added
layer of bureaucracy
that really isn't accomplishing
anything.

20:42.308 --> 20:48.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't know what armed homeland
security
officers, uniformed officers
armed walking

20:48.647 --> 20:50.316 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the streets are doing in this
country.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have no idea what they're
doing.

20:51.917 --> 20:55.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: How about the
unarmed people who
actually track these terrorists?

20:55.821 --> 20:57.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: The unarmed
people.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The unarmed people,
the regular...

20:59.391 --> 21:03.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, these are
agencies that,
like I say, were doing this
prior.

21:03.162 --> 21:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, nothing new was created with
the Department
of Homeland Security.

21:06.899 --> 21:10.169 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just think that this should be
a function
of the FBI.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.004 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I mean, this should be the FBI.

21:12.037 --> 21:16.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Let's talk a little
bit about
leadership again, as we have
seen this week

21:16.442 --> 21:22.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Charlotte and Tulsa and
around the country
unrest, racial unrest.

21:22.548 --> 21:25.217 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How would you lead on that
issue?

21:25.251 --> 21:30.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Well, in this
case, black lives
do matter, blacks getting shot
at six times

21:30.856 --> 21:32.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rate of whites.

21:32.758 --> 21:38.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been more outspoken than
any politician
in the country on the war on
drugs, recognizing

21:38.397 --> 21:44.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that, if you are of color and
you are arrested
on a drug-related crime, there's
a four times

21:44.069 --> 21:47.072 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more likelihood that you will go
to prison
than have not.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.874 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have the highest...

21:48.908 --> 21:51.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: I want to ask you to
focus on
police -- what is alleged to be
police misconduct,

21:51.877 --> 21:52.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
though.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What does that have to do with
the war on
drugs?

21:54.213 --> 21:57.149 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: I think it has its
roots in
the war on drugs.

21:57.183 --> 22:05.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think the roots of
discrimination does exist
in the war on drugs, when it
comes to police

22:05.891 --> 22:12.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
recognizing that this is
happening, that,
when I'm pulled over, I'm not --
I'm not pulled

22:12.731 --> 22:14.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out of the car.

22:14.567 --> 22:20.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I am not provoked to point that
I get angry,
and I have cuffs put on me
because I'm white.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: What does a
president do?

22:22.541 --> 22:27.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GARY JOHNSON: That the
president, number one,
recognizes it, and is able to
engage in the

22:27.646 --> 22:28.881 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
dialogue.

22:28.914 --> 22:33.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secondly, the president controls
the Department
of Justice.

22:33.485 --> 22:39.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are the threads that exist
in communities
where there is the least amount
of discrimination?

22:39.992 --> 22:44.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What are the threads that exist
in communities
where there's thee least amount
of police

22:44.630 --> 22:46.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
violence, conversely, the worst?

22:46.966 --> 22:52.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president of the United
States being to
articulate this, being able to
bring about

22:52.905 --> 22:54.607 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
change.

22:54.640 --> 23:04.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
High-profile shootings in
Albuquerque, my
state, my Albuquerque, my --
where I grew

23:04.250 --> 23:08.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
up, Department of Justice came
in, made recommendations.

23:08.487 --> 23:10.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were good recommendations.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're being followed.

23:11.890 --> 23:15.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, that's a role that the
federal government
can and should play in all of
this.

23:15.828 --> 23:19.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Gary Johnson,
Libertarian candidate
for president, thank you very
much.

23:19.064 --> 23:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GARY JOHNSON: Gwen, thank you
very much.

23:21.033 --> 23:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Why do third-party
candidates
do better in certain election
cycles?

23:27.039 --> 23:32.077 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take a look at history to
explain America's
on-again/off-again love affair.

23:38.784 --> 23:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Turning to the
Republican Party
nominee, Donald Trump, he
highlights his business

23:49.228 --> 23:52.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
record as an important reason to
vote for
him.

23:52.097 --> 23:56.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But a number of his dealings
reach beyond
the borders of the United
States, and questions

23:56.769 --> 24:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have been raised about whether
any would present
conflicts of interest if he
becomes president.

24:02.374 --> 24:08.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm joined now by "Newsweek"'s
Kurt Eichenwald,
whose recent cover story details
Trump's extensive

24:08.747 --> 24:11.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
global business connections.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kurt Eichenwald, welcome.

24:13.385 --> 24:19.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First of all, tell us, how
exactly did you
gain access to information about
Donald Trump's

24:19.425 --> 24:22.027 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
business holdings, because we
know he hasn't
released his tax returns?

24:22.061 --> 24:24.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KURT EICHENWALD, "Newsweek":
It's not easy.

24:24.063 --> 24:31.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, a lot of it came down to
calling businesspeople,
financiers all over the world,
tracking down

24:31.670 --> 24:37.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who had done business
with Donald Trump,
finding the names of entities
disclosed in

24:37.109 --> 24:44.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his financial disclosure, but
that have no
description of what they are,
and, from that,

24:44.783 --> 24:50.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
figuring out who the partners
were, what their
entities were, who the people
who were in

24:50.489 --> 24:52.358 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
charge, and then linking
everybody together.

24:52.391 --> 24:58.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, you write
that never before
has an American candidate for
president had

24:58.297 --> 25:04.737 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so many financial ties with
America's allies
and enemies.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How extensive is it?

25:06.338 --> 25:08.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KURT EICHENWALD: It's huge.

25:08.307 --> 25:17.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it basically traces into
virtually
every major non-European area of
the world.

25:17.416 --> 25:24.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you have someone who
has conflicts
of interest in India and
Azerbaijan, in Russia,

25:24.857 --> 25:31.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in China, in Turkey, in -- you
know, the list
just keeps going on and on and
on -- in the

25:31.230 --> 25:32.965 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Philippines.

25:32.998 --> 25:36.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there was a point where
I just had
to stop, because I couldn't keep
-- you know,

25:36.502 --> 25:42.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I only had 5,000 words to tell
this story,
and the number of conflicts
would go on -- fill

25:42.708 --> 25:43.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
an a entire issue of "Newsweek."

25:43.909 --> 25:46.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, what's an
example of
a conflict?

25:46.545 --> 25:49.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, among other things, you
say Donald
Trump is not a builder.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.017 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You call him a licenser.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does that mean?

25:53.952 --> 25:59.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KURT EICHENWALD: Well, for the
last decade
or so, Donald Trump hasn't been
building anything.

25:59.057 --> 26:04.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been on "The Apprentice"
and he's been
selling his name, sort of like
Hilton Hotels

26:04.129 --> 26:05.998 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sells its name.

26:06.031 --> 26:13.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so he's been basically
selling his name
out to people who will pay him,
without, apparently,

26:13.272 --> 26:17.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of due diligence into who
these people
are.

26:17.042 --> 26:23.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, a great example is, he
has a deal
right now with a fellow in
Azerbaijan whose

26:23.582 --> 26:30.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
father is a major government
official who
has been identified by American
intelligence

26:30.122 --> 26:33.859 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as money laundering for the
Iranian military.

26:33.892 --> 26:40.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you have now Donald Trump,
if he's president
of the United States, he's got
conflicts in

26:40.132 --> 26:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Azerbaijan, and he is somebody
who his business
partner's father is linked to
some pretty

26:46.839 --> 26:48.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
bad things.

26:48.907 --> 26:49.875 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What does he do?

26:49.908 --> 26:50.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's his interest?

26:50.909 --> 26:52.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does he approach it?

26:52.978 --> 26:57.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You also write
about a businessman
in Turkey who is very close to
Turkey's president,

26:57.783 --> 26:59.651 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Erdogan.

26:59.685 --> 27:05.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KURT EICHENWALD: Yes, and that
created a serious
problem, because that developer
was able to

27:05.624 --> 27:11.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
bring Erdogan out for a
dedication of the
Trump building.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.131 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Trump was there.

27:13.165 --> 27:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then Donald Trump got up and
insulted
Muslims around the world.

27:19.004 --> 27:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There was basically protests in
Turkey.

27:22.040 --> 27:29.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Turkish president, who was
already on
the verge of facing a coup, was
getting pressured.

27:29.147 --> 27:31.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He came out, condemned Donald
Trump.

27:31.183 --> 27:34.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He condemned the person who was
doing business
with him.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That individual has been
indicted.

27:37.556 --> 27:44.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what I have been told is
that the Turkish
president is saying that, if
Donald Trump

27:44.630 --> 27:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is president, the United States,
because of
this whole episode, the United
States will

27:49.868 --> 27:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not be allowed to have access to
a Turkish
air base that's a major staging
area for the

27:56.909 --> 27:58.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bombings of ISIS.

27:58.744 --> 28:02.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, the Trump
campaign says
-- and you make note of this in
your updated

28:02.381 --> 28:07.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
story -- they say, if he becomes
president,
he's going to cut all ties with
the Trump

28:07.386 --> 28:08.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Organization.

28:08.921 --> 28:13.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why doesn't that alleviate any
concern about
a conflict of interest?

28:13.859 --> 28:18.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KURT EICHENWALD: Trump's too
smart a businessman
not to know that he's lying on
this one.

28:18.864 --> 28:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, you start off, he's
had three explanations.

28:21.767 --> 28:25.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One is that he's going to put
the company
in a blind trust.

28:25.737 --> 28:30.108 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A blind trust is something where
you take
a portfolio of investments, give
it to an

28:30.142 --> 28:36.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
independent person, who then
handles your
trading and your transactions,
and you never

28:36.114 --> 28:37.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know what's in it.

28:37.583 --> 28:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, Trump is saying: I will
put this one
company in a blind trust.

28:42.087 --> 28:43.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He knows what's in it.

28:43.589 --> 28:45.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's that one company.

28:45.157 --> 28:47.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's nobody independent
managing it.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's his children.

28:49.094 --> 28:53.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he says he will sever all
ties to it,
you can't have a company where
you're getting

28:53.432 --> 28:58.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
financial benefits, your
children are getting
financial benefits, and your
children are

28:58.937 --> 29:04.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running the company and say, I
have severed
my ties on it.

29:04.142 --> 29:11.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Third, Trump is going into this
-- he's not
going to suddenly lose all his
memory.

29:11.183 --> 29:13.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump knows who his business
partners are.

29:13.619 --> 29:17.456 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rest of the world doesn't,
but Trump knows
who all his business partners
are.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he knows what the conflicts
are.

29:19.558 --> 29:24.830 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when -- if he gets into
office, he will
be sitting there fully aware of
every conflict

29:24.863 --> 29:31.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that exists and what decision
will lead to
profits for his family, even to
the detriment

29:31.169 --> 29:33.405 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the United States' national
security.

29:33.438 --> 29:37.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, assuming
all this still
exists, if he's elected, what
would he have

29:37.542 --> 29:39.878 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to do then to eliminate a
conflict of interest?

29:39.911 --> 29:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KURT EICHENWALD: The only option
is, you have
to sell the Trump Organization.

29:43.949 --> 29:52.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If he sells -- if he is truly
dedicated to
what he's saying, he can sell
the Trump Organization.

29:52.691 --> 29:58.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His family can take the money
and start a
new real estate empire, should
they choose,

29:58.363 --> 30:00.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and all the conflicts are gone.

30:00.065 --> 30:04.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they have made it very clear
that they
are not going to do that.

30:04.369 --> 30:09.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, Trump's daughter, who
is now going
to be a major official there,
has said, you

30:09.574 --> 30:14.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
know, we will decide not to make
deals that
might present national security
or foreign

30:14.980 --> 30:19.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
policy problems, which, of
course, raises
the question, how are they going
to know?

30:19.718 --> 30:23.655 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is Donald Trump going to share
classified
information with his family?

30:23.689 --> 30:26.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Is he going to share foreign
policy plans?

30:26.591 --> 30:31.663 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, even worse, are they saying
they could
have figured out that their
business partner

30:31.697 --> 30:37.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Azerbaijan was connected
through family
to money laundering for Iran?

30:37.803 --> 30:39.538 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Of course they couldn't.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're not going to know where
they're having
problems and where they aren't.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is a
significant piece
of reporting.

30:45.310 --> 30:48.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kurt Eichenwald from "Newsweek,"
we thank
you.

30:48.213 --> 30:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KURT EICHENWALD: Thanks for
having me.

30:53.652 --> 31:02.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

Coming up on the "NewsHour": how
to parse
truth from lies in the digital

31:08.166 --> 31:13.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
inside look at the brand-new

Miles O'Brien

31:15.340 --> 31:19.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: In the aftermath of
this week's
bombings in New York and New
Jersey, science

31:19.111 --> 31:25.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
correspondent Miles O'Brien
looks at the ways
police departments are coming to
rely on bomb-disarming

31:25.484 --> 31:26.451 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
robots.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's part of our weekly Leading
Edge series.

31:28.854 --> 31:31.957 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Everybody, get off the
street!

31:31.990 --> 31:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: As the pipe and
pressure cooker
bomb plot unfolded and unraveled
in New York

31:37.696 --> 31:43.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and New Jersey, police deployed
some remotely
operated tools aimed at saving
the lives of

31:43.335 --> 31:48.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
civilians and bomb squad
technicians alike.

31:48.173 --> 31:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In New Jersey, a reminder of the
hair-trigger
risk they face in harm's way.

31:54.312 --> 32:02.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At NYPD bomb squad headquarters
on City Island
a few years ago, Lieutenant Mark
Torre gave

32:02.387 --> 32:08.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me a demo using the same robot,
the Remotec
ANDROS F6A, built by Northrop
Grumman.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
LT.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK TORRE, New York Police
Department: Its
primary mission is to put
distance between

32:12.397 --> 32:15.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our technicians and something of
a hazardous
nature, because distance in this
business

32:15.767 --> 32:17.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is always your friend.

32:17.536 --> 32:22.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In this scenario,
it is believed
there may be an explosive in
this car.

32:22.874 --> 32:25.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it is much more than a
hypothetical.

32:25.343 --> 32:30.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's what happened in Times
Square on May
1 of 2010.

32:30.515 --> 32:36.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A street vendor discovered a
smoldering, abandoned
car filled with propane tanks,
fertilizer,

32:36.955 --> 32:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
gasoline and firecrackers.

32:39.991 --> 32:45.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a Saturday evening, the
busiest time
of the week, in one of the
busiest, and most

32:45.163 --> 32:47.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
iconic, intersections in the
world.

32:47.098 --> 32:50.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH SILBER, Former NYPD
Director of Intelligence
Analysis: Between the scenery,
the symbolism,

32:50.869 --> 32:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the congestion and it being be
just media
central for New York City, you
can't get much

32:58.410 --> 33:00.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
better of a background for
terrorists.

33:00.145 --> 33:06.484 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Mitch Silber was
NYPD's director
of intelligence analysis at the
time.

33:06.518 --> 33:11.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He shudders to think what would
have happened
if the car bomb, built by
Pakistani American

33:11.356 --> 33:14.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Faisal Shahzad, had not been a
dud.

33:14.559 --> 33:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MITCH SILBER: It would ripped
the car in half,
and this is a very busy
intersection.

33:21.700 --> 33:27.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Depending on the congestion of
people right
around the car, it would
certainly kill people,

33:27.038 --> 33:29.374 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
injured and maimed many others.

33:29.407 --> 33:34.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it would have been the first
big terrorist
attack in New York City since
9/11, since

33:34.579 --> 33:36.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2001, nine years earlier.

33:36.348 --> 33:39.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, if he had
just been a better
bomb-maker, it would have been a
horrible

33:39.551 --> 33:40.518 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
event?

33:40.552 --> 33:42.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MITCH SILBER: Absolutely.

33:42.487 --> 33:48.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In fact, a few
months later,
the FBI built an identical car
bomb and detonated

33:48.460 --> 33:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it to see what could have
happened, a scary
thought.

33:55.133 --> 34:02.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, in Times Square, the
NYPD bomb squad
deployed its ANDROS robot and
did pretty much

34:02.207 --> 34:03.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what you are about to see.

34:03.408 --> 34:04.776 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DET.

34:04.809 --> 34:06.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES SCHUTTA, New York Police
Department:
Bomb squad is called.

34:06.645 --> 34:11.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A perimeter is set up, and we
are now going
to use this robot to approach
this vehicle

34:11.583 --> 34:13.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and take a look at what's
inside.

34:13.919 --> 34:20.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Detective James
Schutta operated
the robot from a safe distance.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.126 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DET.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES SCHUTTA: We are not in
sight of the
vehicle.

34:23.061 --> 34:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The key to successful robot
operation is that
he can do the entire job without
ever seeing

34:27.899 --> 34:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what the robot is actually
doing.

34:29.301 --> 34:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's all done remotely via the
cameras.

34:31.937 --> 34:36.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But this robot is
more than
just a remote-controlled eye.

34:36.574 --> 34:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is able to get inside the car
to take a
closer look.

34:43.715 --> 34:47.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The robot fired a .12-gauge
blast through
both windows.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.286 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DET.

34:48.320 --> 34:50.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES SCHUTTA: And that's what
we call a perfect
shot.

34:50.055 --> 34:54.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is sort of just a game of
manipulation
now, where he's going to
maneuver the robot

34:54.693 --> 34:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until we get a better view of
what's inside.

34:56.761 --> 34:59.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He took out both windows.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now we have an opportunity to
look in both
sides.

35:01.433 --> 35:07.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In this scenario,
the robot
discovered there is indeed a
bomb inside the

35:07.906 --> 35:08.873 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
car.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.375 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DET.

35:10.408 --> 35:13.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES SCHUTTA: We always try to
put ourselves
in the mind of the bomber.

35:13.178 --> 35:15.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We want to stay one step ahead
of them.

35:15.380 --> 35:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bomb itself really has sort
of remained
the same throughout the years.

35:19.117 --> 35:22.253 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's what sets them off that
sets them apart.

35:22.287 --> 35:27.592 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The more sophisticated
triggering systems,
they're difficult to defeat, and
that's a

35:27.625 --> 35:30.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
concern to us, but, again, we
always try to
stay one step ahead.

35:30.762 --> 35:38.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Remotec robots
are also used
by the military to defuse bombs,
but also

35:38.636 --> 35:43.975 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to kill insurgents hiding in
alleys.

35:44.009 --> 35:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Dallas in July, that same
tactic was used
by police.

35:48.313 --> 35:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A robot blew up a cornered
sniper who had
taken aim at white police
officers, killing

35:54.152 --> 35:55.687 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
five of them.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.424 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was unprecedented in U.S. law
enforcement
history.

35:59.457 --> 36:02.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Dallas Police Chief David
Brown said he
had no regrets.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROWN, Dallas Police
Chief: I would
do it again.

36:04.929 --> 36:07.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would do it again to save our
officers'
lives.

36:07.832 --> 36:12.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But experts who
track the evolution
of technology used by the
military and law

36:12.937 --> 36:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enforcement worry an important
threshold has
been crossed, without a national
debate on

36:18.810 --> 36:20.645 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the ethical issues.

36:20.678 --> 36:25.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER W. SINGER, Robotics
Expert: The question
is, is it going to be viewed as
an anomaly,

36:25.350 --> 36:28.787 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or is it a precedent that will
be followed
more widely?

36:28.820 --> 36:34.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Peter W. Singer
is an expert
on unmanned and robotic weapons
systems.

36:34.626 --> 36:39.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says it is inevitable local
police will
increase their use of robots.

36:39.230 --> 36:44.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER W. SINGER: The question is
not, are
police going to be using robotic
systems?

36:44.035 --> 36:45.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's, how?

36:45.537 --> 36:46.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
In what manner?

36:46.805 --> 36:48.306 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How will they be trained to use
them?

36:48.339 --> 36:50.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How will they be regulated?

36:50.208 --> 36:51.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Will they be armed or not?

36:51.743 --> 36:55.480 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they're armed, will they be
lethally armed
or with non-lethal weapons?

36:55.513 --> 37:01.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The issue has to involve not
just the police,
but also the populace, the
people that are

37:01.219 --> 37:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be protected and served by
the police and
the tools, including the robotic
ones, that

37:07.092 --> 37:08.827 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
they use.

37:08.860 --> 37:13.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The devices used
in New York,
New Jersey and Dallas all still
have human

37:13.231 --> 37:17.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
beings in the loop driving the
robot, making
the decisions.

37:18.002 --> 37:23.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But as robots become more
autonomous, defining
some clear rules of engagement
will become

37:23.274 --> 37:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a more urgent concern for law
enforcement
and the public.

37:28.246 --> 37:34.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," New York.

37:34.285 --> 37:47.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We all realize we
are inundated
by electronic data, whether we
are at work,

37:47.832 --> 37:51.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
school, home or play, but how to
make sense
of it all?

37:51.503 --> 37:55.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the focus of the latest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown leads the way.

37:56.875 --> 38:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: "It ain't what
you don't know
that gets you into trouble.

38:00.545 --> 38:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's what you know for sure that
just ain't
so."

38:03.681 --> 38:05.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mark Twain said that.

38:05.483 --> 38:08.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And imagine what he would make
of the Internet,
when everything is available and
we're sure

38:08.820 --> 38:09.854 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we know so much.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But do we?

38:11.589 --> 38:16.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Twain quote appears at the
beginning of
a new book titled "A Field Guide
to Lies:

38:16.094 --> 38:18.229 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Critical Thinking in the
Information Age."

38:18.263 --> 38:23.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our guide is Daniel Levitin, a
neuroscientist
and bestselling author of books,
including

38:23.468 --> 38:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"This Is Your Brain on Music"
and "The Organized
Mind."

38:26.738 --> 38:28.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, Dan, welcome to you.

38:28.473 --> 38:32.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Your starting point, we're
bombarded with
information, but it's harder
than ever to

38:32.076 --> 38:33.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
know what's true.

38:33.778 --> 38:34.913 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN, Author, "A Field
Guide to
Lies: Critical Thinking in the
Information

38:34.946 --> 38:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Age": We're making more and more
decisions
every day.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.949 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think a lot of us feel
overloaded by the
process.

38:37.982 --> 38:43.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as you say, it's getting
harder and harder
to know, when you find things on
the Internet,

38:43.254 --> 38:44.722 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what you can believe and what
you can't.

38:44.756 --> 38:47.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there isn't really anybody
doing it for
us.

38:47.358 --> 38:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And you see this
everywhere.

38:49.661 --> 38:54.432 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You go through both data,
numbers, and -- and,
well, everything, right?

38:54.465 --> 38:56.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Yes.

38:56.100 --> 39:00.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, it's in Facebook and in
statistics
and in things that politicians
say.

39:00.838 --> 39:03.174 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's in headlines.

39:03.208 --> 39:05.843 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's in representations that a
salesman might
make to you.

39:05.877 --> 39:07.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's everywhere.

39:07.278 --> 39:08.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's clearly
annoying you,
right, as a scientist.

39:08.479 --> 39:10.248 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't -- you just don't like
this world.

39:10.281 --> 39:12.050 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:12.083 --> 39:17.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Well, I like a
world where
each of us has the tools to be
able to make

39:17.121 --> 39:19.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
able to make our own decisions.

39:19.057 --> 39:23.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think I'm always right,
but I would
like to empower people to come
to sound conclusions

39:23.361 --> 39:26.965 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
using a systematic way of
looking at things.

39:26.998 --> 39:30.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, so a
very simple
-- you give a bunch of examples
in your book.

39:30.168 --> 39:34.806 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A very simple one is the pie
chart, right,
of polling that we're hit with a
lot of the

39:34.839 --> 39:35.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

39:35.840 --> 39:37.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Yes.

39:37.675 --> 39:38.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is from --
this happens
to be FOX News, but it could --
in 2012 -- and

39:38.810 --> 39:41.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it could be probably from any
time and any
network.

39:41.946 --> 39:42.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Yes.

39:42.947 --> 39:43.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, look at this.

39:43.948 --> 39:45.717 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Tell us what we're seeing here.

39:45.750 --> 39:49.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Well, the first
rule of pie
charts, Jeff, is that you're
taking a pie,

39:49.120 --> 39:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you're dividing it up into
pieces.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.590 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The pieces have to add up to 100
percent.

39:52.624 --> 39:53.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right.

39:53.625 --> 39:54.692 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's the idea.

39:54.726 --> 39:55.693 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: And, as you see
here, they
don't.

39:55.727 --> 39:57.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, you can imagine how this
happens.

39:57.462 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The kind of people who become
graphic artists
may not be mathematically
inclined.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're artists, artistically
inclined.

40:04.435 --> 40:06.237 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you end up with things
like this.

40:06.271 --> 40:10.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But the missing
information
-- you could also look at that
and say -- I'm

40:10.074 --> 40:14.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to imagine what -- maybe
people were
asked -- they were told they
could they could

40:14.679 --> 40:16.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
favor several candidates, right?

40:16.814 --> 40:18.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Well, that's
right.

40:18.283 --> 40:19.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But, somehow,
that's not shown
in what we're looking at.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.785 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Right.

40:20.818 --> 40:23.788 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who would you support for the
upcoming election?

40:23.821 --> 40:25.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you're allowed to name more
than one.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.892 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you get something like
this that adds
up to 100.

40:27.925 --> 40:30.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in that case, you shouldn't
use a pie
chart.

40:30.595 --> 40:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's really visually deceptive,
which might
lead you to conclude the wrong
thing.

40:34.866 --> 40:38.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right,
another example
you give, sometimes one truth
hiding another,

40:38.803 --> 40:40.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a less favorable truth.

40:40.672 --> 40:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is showing Apple,
right, and Tim
Cook, the CEO, talking about
sales that actually

40:47.812 --> 40:48.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
went down, right?

40:48.813 --> 40:49.914 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Yes.

40:49.947 --> 40:50.782 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But he didn't
want us to know
that.

40:50.815 --> 40:51.783 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

40:51.816 --> 40:53.618 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: This is one of
my favorite.

40:53.651 --> 40:56.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what do you do when you have
got something,
a case like this, where the
sales have gone

40:56.654 --> 40:58.656 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
down, and a graph would clearly
show it?

40:58.690 --> 41:03.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, you create a cumulative
sales graph,
where, as long as you sold only
one unit,

41:03.895 --> 41:06.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the graph is going to appear to
go up.

41:06.664 --> 41:10.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if your sales for the
quarter are down,
you can hide it this way.

41:10.535 --> 41:12.270 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's what he did.

41:12.303 --> 41:15.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now, the biggest
source of
information, of course, for all
of -- in our

41:15.239 --> 41:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
own lives now is the Internet,
right?

41:17.108 --> 41:22.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you write about a -- I think
you call
it an anti-skepticism bias.

41:22.347 --> 41:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We believe so much of what comes
to us on
the Internet.

41:27.151 --> 41:28.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now, I wonder why.

41:28.953 --> 41:30.555 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're a neuroscientist.

41:30.588 --> 41:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, what's going on to make
us not skeptical
enough?

41:34.559 --> 41:37.195 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: You know, I
don't really know.

41:37.228 --> 41:38.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:39.030 --> 41:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: I mean, part of
it is that,
when we have learned something,
there's this

41:42.367 --> 41:44.335 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
thing called belief
perseverance.

41:44.369 --> 41:49.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having learned something, we
tend to cling
to that belief, even in the face
of overwhelming

41:49.540 --> 41:51.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
evidence to the contrary.

41:51.809 --> 41:57.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New information comes in all
time, and the
thing we ought to be thinking
about doing

41:57.281 --> 42:00.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is changing our beliefs as that
new information
comes in.

42:00.385 --> 42:01.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's what
critical thinking
means.

42:02.019 --> 42:03.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: I think so.

42:03.721 --> 42:07.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need to take a step back, and
realize that
not everything we encounter is
true.

42:07.692 --> 42:12.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You don't want to be gullibly
accepting everything
as true, but you don't want to
be cynically

42:12.263 --> 42:14.031 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
rejecting everything as false.

42:14.065 --> 42:16.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You want to take your time to
evaluate the
information.

42:16.634 --> 42:21.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the end of the
day, don't
people -- don't we have to trust
institutions

42:21.906 --> 42:23.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or trust somebody?

42:23.107 --> 42:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Well, we do.

42:24.308 --> 42:25.843 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Of course, science is based on
this.

42:25.877 --> 42:29.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have never seen a proton or
electron spinning
around it.

42:29.414 --> 42:31.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have never actually seen a
chromosome.

42:31.816 --> 42:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I trust that they exist because
people who
I trust tell me they do.

42:35.953 --> 42:36.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

42:36.954 --> 42:38.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: It does come
down to that.

42:38.790 --> 42:43.895 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we can be skeptical,
suitably skeptical,
and we can trust news outlets,
some more than

42:43.928 --> 42:44.896 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
others.

42:44.929 --> 42:46.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: We -- I mean,
society functions
because we trust one another.

42:48.666 --> 42:51.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I trust that my plumber knows
what he's doing,
right?

42:51.235 --> 42:56.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, though, that we need to
be armed
with the critical thinking
skills that lawyers

42:56.874 --> 42:59.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and scientists and journalists
such as yourself
have.

42:59.777 --> 43:03.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all need to have those as we
make our way
through the day.

43:03.247 --> 43:04.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they're not that hard to
acquire.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think they can be acquired in
a couple hours.

43:07.151 --> 43:10.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, before
I let you
go, we have to go back to that
Mark Twain

43:10.354 --> 43:11.422 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
quote.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.257 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want to put that back up,
because I read
it.

43:13.291 --> 43:15.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I started it -- our segment.

43:15.126 --> 43:16.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You start your book with it.

43:16.928 --> 43:20.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then you tell us in the end
of your book
-- and I'm going to tell our
audience -- that

43:20.631 --> 43:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wasn't said by Mark Twain.

43:21.866 --> 43:22.834 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Right.

43:22.867 --> 43:24.268 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The quote ain't so.

43:24.302 --> 43:27.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a wonderful example of
how we believe
things that aren't so.

43:27.505 --> 43:32.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, I agree with the
sentiment that
it's probably more dangerous to
believe some

43:32.977 --> 43:38.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
things that aren't so than to
not believe
something -- you know, to
believe in a lie.

43:38.783 --> 43:44.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in the fact-checking for
the book, I
went to find -- as you do, I
went to find

43:44.589 --> 43:45.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the original source.

43:45.890 --> 43:48.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it was nowhere to be found
in any of Twain's
writings.

43:48.659 --> 43:51.362 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, Mark Twain
didn't say it.

43:51.395 --> 43:52.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Daniel Levitin lied.

43:52.830 --> 43:53.798 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour" lied.

43:53.831 --> 43:56.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But we have now set the record
straight.

43:56.267 --> 43:57.435 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Which is how
things move forward.

43:57.468 --> 43:58.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right.

43:58.469 --> 43:59.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The book is "A Field Guide to
Lies."

44:00.004 --> 44:01.038 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Daniel Levitin, thanks very
much..

44:01.072 --> 44:08.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DANIEL LEVITIN: Thanks for
having me.

44:08.446 --> 44:19.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Finally tonight, the
jewel in
the Smithsonian Museum crown
opens this weekend

44:19.690 --> 44:21.659 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the National Mall.

44:21.692 --> 44:26.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Obama will be on hand
to dedicate
the National Museum of African
American History

44:26.564 --> 44:27.832 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Culture.

44:27.865 --> 44:31.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We take you on a tour and show
how it all
came to be.

44:31.035 --> 44:34.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOYCE BAILEY, Museum Donor: We
can see she
has her camera right there.

44:34.839 --> 44:37.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That was one of her photographic
days.

44:37.808 --> 44:41.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joyce Bailey's legacy turned out
to be worth
more than money.

44:41.512 --> 44:47.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her mother, Lois Alexander Lane
left her a
treasure trove from the museum
she created,

44:47.385 --> 44:54.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Harlem Institute of Fashion,
costumes,
dresses sewn and worn by slaves,
celebrities

44:54.458 --> 44:56.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and by civil rights icons.

44:57.028 --> 45:01.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the things I think people
are surprised
to know, or to remember, is that
Rosa Parks

45:01.132 --> 45:02.099 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was a seamstress.

45:02.133 --> 45:04.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOYCE BAILEY: Yes, she was.

45:04.068 --> 45:09.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was actually carrying the
dress that the
museum now has on the day that
she was arrested.

45:09.307 --> 45:14.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a beautiful yellow with
brown stripes
in it.

45:14.579 --> 45:15.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's beyond belief.

45:15.846 --> 45:17.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You really just have to see it.

45:17.782 --> 45:22.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Beginning this
weekend, thousands
of people will stream into the
brand-new National

45:22.420 --> 45:27.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Museum of African American
History and Culture
to see elements of Bailey's
collection and

45:27.692 --> 45:30.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
countless other priceless items.

45:30.361 --> 45:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is this, an airplane flown
cross-country
to the museum once piloted by
the all-black

45:35.967 --> 45:42.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tuskegee Airmen, the casket of
14-year-old
Emmett Till, lynched in 1955 for
whistling

45:42.740 --> 45:47.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at a white woman, the writings
of abolitionist
Frederick Douglass, shackles
discovered on

45:48.012 --> 45:54.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a sunken ship that brought
hundreds of slaves
to America, and from a South
Carolina plantation,

45:54.218 --> 46:00.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fully restored slave cabin,
the dress Marian
Anderson wore when she sang at
the Lincoln

46:00.891 --> 46:06.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Memorial, and costumes from "The
Wiz," the
all-black Broadway musical based
on "The Wizard

46:06.397 --> 46:10.234 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Oz," donated from Joyce
Bailey's collection.

46:10.267 --> 46:15.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is as an amazing place,
chockful of the
expected and the expected.

46:15.339 --> 46:19.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
One thing missing, major
artifacts from the
Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.

46:19.744 --> 46:25.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His family apparently decided to
hold onto
some of the most famous
memorabilia, including

46:25.149 --> 46:30.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the Bible that President Obama
used to take
the oath of office in 2013.

46:30.955 --> 46:36.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In any case, it fell to museum
director Lonnie
Bunch and his band of curators
to sort through

46:36.527 --> 46:38.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what turned into a rush of
donations.

46:38.596 --> 46:39.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH, Director, National
Museum of
African American History and
Culture: But,

46:39.930 --> 46:42.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
when I saw them, I said, we are
going to tell
that story.

46:42.500 --> 46:46.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just love, from "The Wiz,"
I just love
how they look.

46:46.103 --> 46:47.838 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I just think they're so
distinctive.

46:47.872 --> 46:50.408 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They obviously speak volumes
about Geoffrey
Holder.

46:50.441 --> 46:53.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The designer.

46:53.144 --> 46:54.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: The designer.

46:54.912 --> 46:55.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, plus, they're just so
beautiful.

46:55.880 --> 46:56.847 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It was a big moment
at the time.

46:56.881 --> 46:58.649 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: Absolutely.

46:58.683 --> 47:02.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From sobering
memorabilia like
rebellion leader Nat Turner's
Bible, to 20th

47:02.286 --> 47:08.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
century musical memories, Chuck
Berry's cherry
red Cadillac, and Parliament
Funkadelic's

47:08.125 --> 47:14.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
iconic Mothership, here lit up
and sheathed
in plastic in preparation for
the opening.

47:14.131 --> 47:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: During concerts,
it would come
down, and George Clinton would
get out.

47:18.235 --> 47:21.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it'd be this notion that he
was from another
planet.

47:21.205 --> 47:22.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:22.206 --> 47:23.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Which he kind of
was.

47:23.207 --> 47:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: Which he still is.

47:25.042 --> 47:29.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The $540 million
project, a century
in the making, and the first
green museum

47:29.180 --> 47:33.050 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the National Mall, captures
the sweep of
African-American history.

47:33.084 --> 47:34.919 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what do we have here?

47:34.952 --> 47:37.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: This is one of my
great treasures.

47:37.688 --> 47:41.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What I love is what my staff is
able to find.

47:41.158 --> 47:47.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a playbill from
Newcastle, England,
in 1857 that is from Ira
Aldridge's career.

47:48.032 --> 47:51.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ira Aldridge, the great black
thespian that
couldn't get jobs in the United
States as

47:51.936 --> 47:54.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a great actor, classical actor,
had to go
to Europe.

47:54.538 --> 47:58.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Othello, who
everyone now thinks
of as a character always played
by a black

47:58.075 --> 47:59.043 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
actor.

47:59.076 --> 48:00.044 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LONNIE BUNCH: Exactly.

48:00.077 --> 48:01.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But it was always in blackface.

48:01.645 --> 48:03.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Galleries are
devoted to breakthroughs
in sports and performance.

48:03.214 --> 48:08.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: The joy of Prince,
and I love
the Michael Jackson fedora.

48:08.452 --> 48:09.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just capture that.

48:09.787 --> 48:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, obviously, the "Soul Train"
costume.

48:11.088 --> 48:13.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: "Soul Train" costume
is a little
alarming.

48:13.991 --> 48:15.259 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:15.292 --> 48:16.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: Well, it is,
because we thought
that was cool.

48:16.494 --> 48:17.561 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: We.

48:17.595 --> 48:18.696 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't know about we.

48:18.729 --> 48:19.697 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:19.730 --> 48:20.698 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Speak for yourself.

48:20.731 --> 48:21.699 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

48:21.732 --> 48:23.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: This is cool.

48:23.667 --> 48:27.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bunch, a former president of the
Chicago Historical
Society, shepherded the project
to completion,

48:27.271 --> 48:33.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wooing Congress for half the
money, and soliciting
private donations from
millionaires like Oprah

48:33.043 --> 48:35.713 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Winfrey and philanthropist David
Rubenstein.

48:35.746 --> 48:42.686 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But he also appealed to
individuals, families,
churches, fraternities and
sororities, who

48:42.720 --> 48:49.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
handed over gems like James
Baldwin's inkwell
and Malcolm X's tape recorder.

48:49.059 --> 48:54.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Advance tickets flew out the
door, 5,000 of
them in 18 minutes one day.

48:54.565 --> 48:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On this journey you have been to
get to this
point with this museum, what has
been the

48:59.203 --> 49:00.971 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
biggest surprise for you along
the way?

49:01.005 --> 49:04.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: I think I have
been stunned
by the excitement and the way
people really

49:04.441 --> 49:06.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

49:06.277 --> 49:09.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are times I will walk in
an airport
and people will just sort of
give me the thumbs

49:09.914 --> 49:14.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up, or I will walk down the
street and church
ladies will come to me and say
they're praying

49:14.585 --> 49:16.420 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for me.

49:16.453 --> 49:19.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the fact that this
means so much
to so many people has been the
biggest surprise

49:19.957 --> 49:21.892 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for me.

49:21.926 --> 49:26.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: As with other
Smithsonian museums,
one building cannot begin to
hold its collection.

49:26.897 --> 49:31.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Conservator Antje Neumann has
helped preserve
the collection at the museum's
facility in

49:31.869 --> 49:33.671 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a Washington suburb.

49:33.704 --> 49:35.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTJE NEUMANN, Conservator,
National Museum
of African American History and
Culture: There's

49:35.472 --> 49:40.778 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
always the balance between
preservation and
exhibition, and allowing the
public to see

49:40.811 --> 49:46.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the national treasures, and then
also balancing
that with preserving it for
future generations.

49:46.450 --> 49:52.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's lovely to have a place to
highlight the
struggles, the causes and the
progression

49:52.590 --> 49:56.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that many people and the
contributions many
people have done in this
country.

49:56.560 --> 50:01.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It falls to Neumann
to repair
Shaquille O'Neal's size 20 shoe,
to prepare

50:01.599 --> 50:08.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a stool from Muhammad Ali's gym,
to restore
worn pages of the first book of
black poetry,

50:08.305 --> 50:12.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and to spiff up funk singer
Bootsy Collins'
bright yellow leather costume.

50:12.476 --> 50:17.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTJE NEUMANN: It just needs a
bit -- a little
bit of cleaning in order to make
it ready

50:17.081 --> 50:20.651 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for presentation, as it has been
used a lot
on stage.

50:20.684 --> 50:25.756 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Collins' outfit
occupies a place
of honor inside the new
building, which is

50:25.789 --> 50:27.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a work of art itself.

50:27.658 --> 50:34.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The corona, the signature
exterior feature,
is made of 230 tons of
bronze-colored aluminum

50:34.698 --> 50:38.168 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
panels, 3,600 in all.

50:38.202 --> 50:41.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lead architect Phil Freelon
oversaw the building's
striking design.

50:41.872 --> 50:46.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL FREELON, Lead Architect:
Many of the
buildings on the Mall are
marble, granite,

50:46.277 --> 50:48.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
concrete, lighter in color.

50:48.712 --> 50:52.149 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This building has a variation in
how it appears.

50:52.182 --> 50:57.121 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, on certain days, in certain
lighting conditions,
it can be very vibrant and
bright.

50:57.154 --> 51:01.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And other times of the day or in
the evening,
it is darker.

51:01.392 --> 51:06.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So there is this interesting
dynamic of changing
appearance of the building.

51:06.497 --> 51:12.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Within view, the
Washington Monument
and even a glimpse of the White
House, which

51:12.336 --> 51:17.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michelle Obama famously noted
was itself built
by slaves.

51:17.141 --> 51:21.245 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bunch says this makes race an
integral part
of the American experience.

51:21.278 --> 51:26.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in this country, we are so
nervous about
talking about race, about
engaging.

51:26.550 --> 51:30.821 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We keep having national
conversations about
race, and it seems that this
building itself

51:30.854 --> 51:33.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is a big conversation.

51:33.057 --> 51:36.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do you -- did you encounter
along the way
any resistance to the notion
that we talk

51:36.961 --> 51:39.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about Americans only by race?

51:39.263 --> 51:47.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: I think there was
fear that
we would be a place that might
be divisive,

51:47.204 --> 51:51.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that people wouldn't want to
talk about race,
and that we would force them to
talk about

51:51.942 --> 51:53.744 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
race.

51:53.777 --> 51:59.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there was a great
concern that, would
this just be a museum by black
people for

51:59.483 --> 52:01.251 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
black people?

52:01.285 --> 52:05.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think we had to counter
that, both by
the kind of stories we told, by
the way we

52:06.023 --> 52:10.794 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tried to say, this is a story of
America through
an African-American lens.

52:10.828 --> 52:15.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joyce Bailey's
mother could not
have foreseen this day, but she
did see the

52:15.232 --> 52:18.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
value of preserving black
history.

52:18.102 --> 52:24.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lois Alexander passed away in
2007, leaving
her daughter with a window into
history.

52:24.608 --> 52:27.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But didn't you feel a little
emotional about
letting it go?

52:27.378 --> 52:32.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOYCE BAILEY: I was very happy
about letting
it go, because I knew my
mother's legacy would

52:32.750 --> 52:33.717 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
continue.

52:33.751 --> 52:36.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Curators think about
legacy too.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.355 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lonnie Bunch is still looking
ahead.

52:38.389 --> 52:42.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LONNIE BUNCH: I want to make
sure that curators
50 years from now can tell the
story of today,

52:42.993 --> 52:44.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if that's what they want to
tell.

52:44.862 --> 52:50.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I hope this museum will
continue to evolve,
continue to change, because it
really has

52:50.834 --> 52:56.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a place that is the great
convener,
that can bring anybody and
everybody into

52:56.073 --> 52:58.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a conversation around race.

52:58.475 --> 53:10.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: From groundbreaking
in 2012 to
open doors this week, America
preserved, America

53:10.721 --> 53:15.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
celebrated, right in the
nation's front yard.

53:15.225 --> 53:20.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Online, you can watch our full
extended interview

Bunch.

53:20.264 --> 53:21.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

53:21.932 --> 53:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for

53:23.367 --> 53:24.334 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:24.368 --> 53:25.402 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

53:25.436 --> 53:27.371 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.

53:27.404 --> 53:37.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS

thank you, and good night.

53:37.448 --> 53:48.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For all of us here at the "PBS

thank you, and good night.
