JUDY WOODRUFF: More than 100,000
people turned
out for the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las

00:06.974 --> 00:13.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Vegas this week, the annual
showcase for the
latest in technology, devices
and high-end

00:13.380 --> 00:14.648 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
toys.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the big themes was the
rising interest
in health tech.

00:17.918 --> 00:22.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our science correspondent, Miles
O'Brien,
was there to explore the
potential benefits

00:22.389 --> 00:25.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and caveats around all of this.

00:25.225 --> 00:29.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His report is part of our
Breakthroughs series
on invention and innovation.

00:29.630 --> 00:35.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Wearing your
heart on your
sleeve is taking on a whole new
meaning.

00:35.836 --> 00:43.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the 2016 pilgrimage to Las
Vegas for gadget
geeks, CES, wearable health
tracking devices

00:43.277 --> 00:49.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broke into full stride, winning
much more
than a bit of flashy floor space
and heated

00:49.449 --> 00:55.155 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hype. Of course, for the growing
legions of
you keeping score at home on
your devices,

00:55.188 --> 00:56.924 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this is likely old data.

00:56.957 --> 00:58.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODY SCAL, Chief Business
Officer, Fitbit:
What is happening is, people are
taking more

00:58.992 --> 01:02.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
responsibility for their health
and fitness.
They're realizing that health
and fitness

01:02.729 --> 01:07.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
isn't just popping a pill. It's
actually what
they do that can really add up
to a healthy

01:07.334 --> 01:09.136 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
life.

01:09.169 --> 01:14.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Woody Scal is the
chief business
officer at market leader Fitbit,
a $4 billion

01:14.074 --> 01:19.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
company based in San Francisco
that began
selling glorified pedometers in
2007.

01:19.746 --> 01:24.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODY SCAL: Seven years ago,
when you talked
about fitness electronics,
people thought

01:24.084 --> 01:28.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about products for triathletes.
They didn't
realize that these products
could really address

01:28.789 --> 01:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the needs of everyday people.

01:30.624 --> 01:35.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: An estimated 500
million people
worldwide apparently now feel
the need to

01:35.696 --> 01:41.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
copiously log their steps,
leaps, strokes
and spins, while recording their
breathing,

01:41.835 --> 01:47.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
heart rate, blood pressure,
sleep patterns
and food intake, just to name a
few, and then,

01:47.741 --> 01:49.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of course, brag about it online.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY TURRENTINE, Editor in
Chief, CNET:
I think humans have always been
completely

01:51.912 --> 01:57.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
narcissistic. That has not
changed. The technology
has given us a constant virtual
mirror.

01:57.250 --> 02:02.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Lindsey
Turrentine is a sporadic
fitness logger and the editor in
chief of

02:02.756 --> 02:08.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CNET.com, where tracking the
technology of
fitness tracking has become a
big, important

02:09.029 --> 02:10.697 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beat.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.532 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY TURRENTINE: We're always
checking
on ourselves constantly. We're
checking on

02:12.566 --> 02:17.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether people have responded to
us, and then
we're also checking to see
whether our bodies

02:17.170 --> 02:20.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have responded to what we're
doing. It's just
another way to look at
ourselves.

02:20.173 --> 02:24.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But there is more
than the
psychology of self-obsession
driving this

02:24.277 --> 02:30.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sector to grow more than 200
percent a year.
There's a perfect storm of
technological advances

02:30.550 --> 02:37.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well. Sensors are rapidly
shrinking in
size and cost. Communications
between devices

02:37.057 --> 02:40.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has improved. And so has battery
life.

02:40.093 --> 02:46.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, of course, none of it could
happen without
the ubiquity of smartphones, our
mobile switchboard

02:46.366 --> 02:53.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for all things technological.
It's a ripe
convergence for the big players
upstairs and

02:53.140 --> 02:55.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the upstarts in the basement as
well.

02:55.876 --> 03:01.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's where we found Peter
Neilson, CEO of
a Denver start-up called
femtoScale.

03:01.148 --> 03:05.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems like there's no limit
to the amount
of data people want to get.
Right? Would you

03:05.118 --> 03:06.119 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
agree with that? What's going
on?

03:06.153 --> 03:07.621 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PETER NEILSON, CEO, femtoScale:
And wearables...

03:07.654 --> 03:09.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Yes.

03:09.456 --> 03:12.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEILSON: ... are blowing
up. That's
half of CES this year looks like
its wearable,

03:12.125 --> 03:13.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
trying to compute everything.

03:13.927 --> 03:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Neilson's company
is developing
a portable and eventually
wearable sensor

03:17.998 --> 03:23.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that can provide real-time
readings of air
quality by weighing airborne
particles much

03:23.303 --> 03:27.207 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too small to see. The scale is
just barely
visible.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I needed a jeweler's magnifying
glass to see
it.

03:29.976 --> 03:36.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER NEILSON: What we're really
trying to
do is look at, not just health
care, but wellness.

03:36.650 --> 03:40.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Can we use all this data we can
get from all
sorts of different things, not
only to keep

03:40.687 --> 03:44.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people healthy once they're in
the hospital,
but prevent them from getting
sick in the

03:44.958 --> 03:46.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
first place?

03:46.793 --> 03:51.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: San Jose-based
Stratio has
shrunk a spectrometer down to
palm size. The

03:51.665 --> 03:56.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
device shines a bright light on
food and medicine
to determine if they are what
they purport

03:56.536 --> 03:58.371 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be.

03:58.405 --> 04:04.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In this demonstration, CEO Jae
Hyung Lee compared
counterfeit, generic and genuine
Viagra to

04:04.611 --> 04:10.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the fingerprint-like
spectroscopic pattern
of the real McCoy. It was
instantly obvious

04:10.350 --> 04:12.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
which were the impostors.

04:12.152 --> 04:14.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAE HYUNG LEE, CEO, Stratio: So
far, people
were just interested themselves,
but now they

04:14.855 --> 04:18.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
want to know more about what
they're eating.
They want to know what they're
buying. They

04:18.358 --> 04:20.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
want to know what's going on
around them.

04:20.360 --> 04:25.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Clearly, exercise
and nutrition
tracking alone are not enough to
satisfy entrepreneurs

04:25.365 --> 04:28.869 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or consumers in the health
tracking space.

04:28.902 --> 04:35.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kaustubh Kale is CEO of a Boca
Raton start-up
called AventuSoft. They are
developing a wearable

04:35.609 --> 04:37.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
heart monitor and
electrocardiogram.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAUSTUBH KALE, CEO, AventuSoft:
There's not
a pushback anymore. People are
already aware

04:39.379 --> 04:48.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of Fitbit or any of the other
wearables, so
they're already accepting these
new technologies.

04:48.889 --> 04:52.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now, as the technology
improves, you can
now push it into the medical
grid domain.

04:52.559 --> 04:57.664 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's an
interesting development.
When you think about it, it
really is no less

04:57.697 --> 04:59.499 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than the democratization of
medicine, isn't
it?

04:59.533 --> 05:02.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAUSTUBH KALE: Absolutely, yes.
You're putting
the power in the consumer's
hands, and so

05:02.435 --> 05:09.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they can get the data whenever
they need,
where they need it and with the
accuracy that

05:09.109 --> 05:10.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the doctor needs.

05:10.877 --> 05:15.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: This is where the
government
steps in. In early 2015, the
Food and Drug

05:15.382 --> 05:20.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Administration released a
document offering
guidance to industry and its own
staff on

05:20.320 --> 05:25.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
regulating mobile medical
applications, declaring
it will only regulate apps that
are medical

05:25.892 --> 05:31.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devices and whose functionality
could pose
a risk to a patient's safety if
the mobile

05:31.531 --> 05:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
app were to not function as
intended.

05:33.533 --> 05:38.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAKUL PATEL, Food and Drug
Administration:
So, the risk to patients ranges
from misdiagnosis,

05:38.104 --> 05:44.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delay in diagnosis, or when you
get into the
discussion of false positives
and false negatives,

05:44.144 --> 05:47.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then you have therapeutic
devices that
can actually harm people.

05:47.914 --> 05:53.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Bakul Patel is
associate center
director for digital health at
FDA.

05:53.286 --> 05:57.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BAKUL PATEL: There are standards
of what an
EKG machine -- how it should
capture, what

05:57.624 --> 06:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
kind of wave forms, how it
should be managing
the signals that comes out of
your body and

06:02.162 --> 06:05.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
displaying it. Those are all
standards written
-- written for that.

06:05.398 --> 06:09.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're going to be in the
market as an
EKG machine, doctors better rely
on them,

06:09.469 --> 06:13.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and we ask for testing to
happen, so they
can actually make the same sort
of diagnosis

06:14.007 --> 06:15.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and treatment decisions.

06:15.875 --> 06:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The pull of
diagnostic tools
out of the doctor's toolbox and
into our pockets,

06:21.948 --> 06:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
our ears and onto our wrists is
a revolution
seed in part by this man, Larry
Smarr.

06:28.255 --> 06:33.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A scientist and professor at the
University
of California, San Diego, he
used the video

06:33.159 --> 06:38.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wall at the school's Qualcomm
Institute to
illustrate the power of what's
called the

06:38.398 --> 06:40.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
quantified self.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY SMARR, University of
California, San
Diego: Big data, as it's called.
And this

06:42.369 --> 06:49.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is about me. Every one of the
points on these
graphs are a different blood
test or a stool

06:49.809 --> 06:54.514 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
test in which I got a data point
over a decade.

06:54.547 --> 07:01.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Dr. Smarr began
his fantastic
data voyage back in 2000 with a
desire to

07:01.054 --> 07:07.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lose some weight. And so his
self-prescribed
testing began. He never looked
back, and,

07:07.427 --> 07:12.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
before long, he spotted trouble.
His self-diagnosis,
Crohn's disease.

07:12.666 --> 07:15.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he brought the data to his
doctor, who
said:

07:15.935 --> 07:20.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LARRY SMARR: If you don't have
symptoms, why
are you here? I said, because I
got data.

07:20.573 --> 07:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he said, well, that's not
helpful. And
so I realized, as a lifetime
scientist, that

07:29.149 --> 07:35.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the practice of medicine and the
practice
of science, while they overlap
sometimes,

07:35.422 --> 07:37.257 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are generally different.

07:37.290 --> 07:42.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: So, he fired that
doctor and
found another. Indeed, so many
people generating

07:42.195 --> 07:49.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so much diagnostic data may
sound like a prescription
for a lot of bad diagnoses,
unneeded anxiety

07:49.135 --> 07:51.171 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
or even an epidemic of
hypochondria.

07:51.204 --> 07:55.975 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LINDSEY TURRENTINE: There is
such a thing
as too much data if you can't
deal with the

07:56.009 --> 07:57.811 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
data.

07:57.844 --> 08:00.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you don't have software that
will help
you interpret the data in a
smart and reliable

08:00.847 --> 08:06.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way, or if you get overwhelmed
and frustrated
and you don't know how to pick
it out of the

08:06.252 --> 08:11.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big needle in a haystack sort of
data pile
that's building up on your
phone, then it's

08:11.157 --> 08:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too much data. But it's sort of
up to you
and how much you can handle.

08:13.927 --> 08:19.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But a giant cloud
of real-time
data, really big data,
aggregated, analyzed

08:19.933 --> 08:25.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and compared with artificial
intelligence,
could lead to stunning
breakthroughs in preventive

08:25.438 --> 08:27.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
medicine.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOODY SCAL: Where you can figure
out, how
