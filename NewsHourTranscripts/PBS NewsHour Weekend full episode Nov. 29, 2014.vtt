00:11.445 --> 00:13.580

00:13.580 --> 00:15.382
EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK

00:15.382 --> 00:17.017
HAS MURDER CHARGES AGAINST HIM

00:17.017 --> 00:18.652
DROPPED-- WHAT THE RULING MEANS

00:18.652 --> 00:20.687
FOR EGYPT AND THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.389
ALSO, THE LATEST ON THE FIGHT

00:22.389 --> 00:24.358
AGAINST ISIS IN IRAQ.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.326
AND IN OUR SIGNATURE SEGMENT,

00:26.326 --> 00:27.561
HOW THE BATTLE OVER TEACHER

00:27.561 --> 00:29.529
TENURE IN CALIFORNIA IS LEADING

00:29.529 --> 00:31.365
TO ACTION IN ANOTHER STATE.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.134
NEXT ON PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.774
FROM THE TISCH WNET STUDIOS IN

01:13.774 --> 01:15.575
LINCOLN CENTER IN NEW YORK,

01:15.575 --> 01:16.610
WILLIAM BRANGHAM.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.178
>> Brangham: GOOD EVENING.

01:18.178 --> 01:19.012
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

01:19.012 --> 01:20.380
I’M WILLIAM BRANGHAM IN FOR HARI

01:20.380 --> 01:21.415
SREENIVASAN.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.016
WE BEGIN WITH A MAJOR LEGAL

01:23.016 --> 01:24.351
VICTORY FOR OUSTED EGYPTIAN

01:24.351 --> 01:26.219
PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK.

01:26.219 --> 01:27.354
AN EGYPTIAN COURT TODAY

01:27.354 --> 01:28.956
DISMISSED CHARGES THAT MUBARAK

01:28.956 --> 01:30.223
WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING

01:30.223 --> 01:31.858
HUNDREDS OF DEMONSTRATORS DURING

01:31.858 --> 01:33.360
THE ARAB SPRING UPRISING IN

01:33.360 --> 01:34.728
2011.

01:34.728 --> 01:35.996
THE 86-YEAR-OLD APPEARED IN

01:35.996 --> 01:37.297
COURT ON A STRETCHER.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.832
THE COURTROOM ERUPTED IN CHEERS

01:38.832 --> 01:40.200
WHEN THE VERDICT WAS READ.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.435
MUBARAK AND HIS TWO SONS WERE

01:41.435 --> 01:42.703
ALSO ACQUITTED OF CORRUPTION

01:42.703 --> 01:43.670
CHARGES.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.172
THE VERDICT MEANS MUBARAK COULD

01:45.172 --> 01:46.773
GO FREE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE

01:46.773 --> 01:48.408
HE WAS REMOVED FROM OFFICE THREE

01:48.408 --> 01:49.476
YEARS AGO.

01:49.476 --> 01:50.644
HE’S ALSO APPROACHING THE END OF

01:50.644 --> 01:51.745
HIS SENTENCE IN A SEPARATE

01:51.745 --> 01:53.180
CORRUPTION CASE.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.815
THE JUDGE SAID THE DECISION HAD

01:54.815 --> 01:56.616
"NOTHING TO DO WITH POLITICS."

01:56.616 --> 01:57.951
FAMILY MEMBERS OF THE PROTESTERS

01:57.951 --> 01:59.653
WHO WERE KILLED EXPRESSED ANGER

01:59.653 --> 02:00.787
AT THE RULING.

02:00.787 --> 02:01.989
ONE CRITIC SAID THE COURTS HAVE

02:01.989 --> 02:03.357
NOW ACQUITTED THE OFFICERS WHO

02:03.357 --> 02:04.958
KILLED THE DEMONSTRATORS AND THE

02:04.958 --> 02:07.661
MAN THEY SAY GAVE THE ORDERS.

02:07.661 --> 02:08.662
FOR MORE ON TODAY’S RULING, WE

02:08.662 --> 02:10.063
TURN TO SAMER SHEHATA.

02:10.063 --> 02:11.264
HE IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF

02:11.264 --> 02:12.632
MIDDLE EASTERN POLITICS AT THE

02:12.632 --> 02:14.034
UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.402
HE JOINS US NOW FROM NORMAN,

02:15.402 --> 02:16.236
OKLAHOMA.

02:16.236 --> 02:18.071
PROFESSOR, HOW IMPORTANT IS THIS

02:18.071 --> 02:19.940
RULING FOR EGYPT?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.641
>> IT HAS VERY LITTLE POLITICAL

02:21.641 --> 02:23.510
SIGNIFICANCE FOR EGYPT’S FUTURE

02:23.510 --> 02:24.911
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.613
IT’S UNLIKELY THAT THIS IS GOING

02:26.613 --> 02:28.081
TO AFFECT THE COURSE OF EVENTS

02:28.081 --> 02:29.983
IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT POLICY OR

02:29.983 --> 02:31.585
EVEN IN TERMS OF OPPOSITION

02:31.585 --> 02:32.386
PROTEST.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.287
MUBARAK IS, IN MANY WAYS,

02:34.287 --> 02:35.922
YESTERDAY’S NEWS.

02:35.922 --> 02:37.190
IT’S IMPORTANT IN OTHER WAYS,

02:37.190 --> 02:39.026
BUT NOT FOR EGYPT’S POLITICAL

02:39.026 --> 02:39.893
FUTURE.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.161
>> Brangham: AND ARE THERE

02:41.161 --> 02:42.896
LARGER IMPLICATIONS, IF NOT IN

02:42.896 --> 02:44.064
EGYPT, THEN FOR THE REST OF THE

02:44.064 --> 02:44.965
MIDDLE EAST?

02:44.965 --> 02:47.000
>> WELL, I THINK MUBARAK’S

02:47.000 --> 02:48.435
ACQUITTAL TODAY IS, OF COURSE,

02:48.435 --> 02:50.070
SYMBOLICALLY VERY IMPORTANT.

02:50.070 --> 02:52.072
I MEAN, MUBARAK WAS EGYPT’S

02:52.072 --> 02:53.407
PRESIDENT, REALLY AN

02:53.407 --> 02:55.275
AUTHORITARIAN PRESIDENT FOR 29

02:55.275 --> 02:56.877
AND A HALF YEARS.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.578
IT’S ALSO THE CASE, I THINK,

02:58.578 --> 03:02.849
THAT OVER 860 PEOPLE, 6,000

03:02.849 --> 03:03.950
PEOPLE WERE INJURED DURING THE

03:03.950 --> 03:05.819
18 DAYS OF THE UPRISING.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.989
SO TO NOT TRY MR. MUBARAK IN A

03:08.989 --> 03:09.956
FAIR WAY AND HOLD HIM

03:09.956 --> 03:11.792
ACCOUNTABLE, AT LEAST COMPLICIT

03:11.792 --> 03:13.760
FOR SOME OF THOSE DEATHS NOT TO

03:13.760 --> 03:15.095
MENTION THOSE IN THE MINISTRY OF

03:15.095 --> 03:16.596
THE INTERIOR, IS REALLY A

03:16.596 --> 03:17.931
TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.800
SO SYMBOLICALLY, OF COURSE, IT’S

03:19.800 --> 03:22.269
AN ABSURD OUTCOME.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.737
AND I THINK IT IS QUITE TELLING

03:23.737 --> 03:25.939
IN TERMS OF WHERE EGYPT IS RIGHT

03:25.939 --> 03:28.375
NOW IN COMPARISON TO THE GOALS

03:28.375 --> 03:31.311
OF THE 2011 REVOLUTION OR

03:31.311 --> 03:32.379
UPRISING.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.949
MR. MUBARAK IS FOUND NOT GUILTY.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.819
HE IS LIKELY TO BECOME A FREE

03:38.819 --> 03:41.488
PERSON IN A FEW MONTHS, WHEREAS

03:41.488 --> 03:43.623
THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF POLITICAL

03:43.623 --> 03:45.325
PRISONERS IN EGYPT TODAY,

03:45.325 --> 03:47.294
INCLUDING MANY OF THE

03:47.294 --> 03:49.062
REVOLUTIONARIES, THE YOUTH WHO

03:49.062 --> 03:52.132
INITIATED THE JANUARY 25

03:52.132 --> 03:53.100
UPRISING.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.101
>> Brangham: SO FOR THE

03:54.101 --> 03:55.869
AVERAGE EGYPTIAN WHO MAY HAVE

03:55.869 --> 03:57.137
SEEN MUBARAK’S OVERTHROW AS

03:57.137 --> 03:58.438
HUGELY IMPORTANT FOR THE ARAB

03:58.438 --> 03:59.940
SPRING, WHAT DOES IT MEAN, THAT

03:59.940 --> 04:01.708
HE MIGHT SOON BE A FREE MAN?

04:01.708 --> 04:02.876
>> WELL, I THINK IT TELLS US

04:02.876 --> 04:04.811
LARGELY ABOUT THE FATE OF THE

04:04.811 --> 04:07.514
ARAB SPRING-- QUOTE, UNQUOTE--

04:07.514 --> 04:09.649
NEARLY FOUR YEARS AFTER IT BEGAN

04:09.649 --> 04:11.852
IN A SMALL TOWN IN THE INTERIOR

04:11.852 --> 04:15.722
OF TUNISIA IN DECEMBER OF 2010.

04:15.722 --> 04:17.090
MANY OF THE HOPES AND

04:17.090 --> 04:19.893
ASPIRATIONS THAT MANY OF US HAD

04:19.893 --> 04:21.394
FOR THE ARAB WORLD, A

04:21.394 --> 04:23.330
RENAISSANCE, POLITICAL

04:23.330 --> 04:24.998
DEMOCRACY, HUMAN RIGHTS, RULE OF

04:24.998 --> 04:27.501
LAW, A NEW ERA OF PARTICIPATION

04:27.501 --> 04:30.403
AND SO ON, THAT LARGELY THAT HAS

04:30.403 --> 04:33.273
NOT BEEN FULFILLED WITH THE

04:33.273 --> 04:35.275
PARTIAL EXCEPTION, QUITE A

04:35.275 --> 04:37.477
HOPEFUL EXCEPTION, OF TUNISIA.

04:37.477 --> 04:39.880
BUT IF WE LOOK AT EGYPT, IF WE

04:39.880 --> 04:41.848
LOOK AT LIBYA, IF WE LOOK AT

04:41.848 --> 04:43.884
SYRIA, CERTAINLY, IF WE LOOK AT

04:43.884 --> 04:46.286
BAHRAIN, VERY LITTLE PROGRESS

04:46.286 --> 04:47.420
HAS BEEN MADE.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.556
AND AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES-- IN

04:49.556 --> 04:51.158
SOME CASES VERY BLOODY AND

04:51.158 --> 04:53.059
BRUTAL AUTHORITARIAN REGIMES--

04:53.059 --> 04:54.427
WERE REALLY THE ABSENCE OF THE

04:54.427 --> 04:56.796
RULE OF LAW, AND CHAOS ARE THE

04:56.796 --> 04:57.864
ORDER OF THE DAY.

04:57.864 --> 04:58.932
>> Brangham: OKAY, PROFESSOR

04:58.932 --> 05:00.066
SAMER SHEHATA, THANK YOU VERY

05:00.066 --> 05:01.401
MUCH FOR JOINING US.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.502
>> YOU’RE WELCOME.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.304
>> Brangham: IN SYRIA, ISIS

05:04.304 --> 05:05.805
REPORTEDLY ORCHESTRATED FOUR

05:05.805 --> 05:07.307
SUICIDE BOMBINGS WITHIN JUST A

05:07.307 --> 05:08.575
MATTER OF HOURS TODAY IN THE

05:08.575 --> 05:09.843
TOWN OF KOBANI.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.211
ONE OF THE BOMBS WAS DETONATED

05:11.211 --> 05:12.412
AT A BORDER CROSSING BETWEEN

05:12.412 --> 05:13.747
TURKEY AND SYRIA.

05:13.747 --> 05:15.015
IT’S THE FIRST TIME AN ISIS

05:15.015 --> 05:16.249
ATTACK HAS ORIGINATED FROM

05:16.249 --> 05:17.450
WITHIN TURKEY.

05:17.450 --> 05:18.552
TURKISH LEADERS HAVE DENIED

05:18.552 --> 05:20.053
SUPPORTING THE JIHADISTS.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.354
KURDISH MILITIA HAVE BEEN

05:21.354 --> 05:22.522
BATTLING ISIS FIGHTERS ON THE

05:22.522 --> 05:23.890
SYRIAN SIDE OF THE BORDER FOR

05:23.890 --> 05:25.225
THE PAST TWO MONTHS, WITH THE

05:25.225 --> 05:27.060
HELP OF U.S.-LED AIR STRIKES.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.094
AN INTERNATIONAL MONITORING

05:28.094 --> 05:29.629
GROUP SAYS AT LEAST 30 KURDISH

05:29.629 --> 05:30.864
FIGHTERS HAVE DIED IN THE RECENT

05:30.864 --> 05:31.798
BATTLES.

05:31.798 --> 05:32.766
WE’LL HAVE MORE ON WHAT’S AT

05:32.766 --> 05:33.867
STAKE IN THE FIGHTING LATER IN

05:33.867 --> 05:35.268
THE PROGRAM.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.636
AND THE DEATH TOLL FROM FRIDAY’S

05:36.636 --> 05:37.804
ATTACK ON A MOSQUE IN THE

05:37.804 --> 05:39.940
NIGERIAN CITY OF KANO IS NOW

05:39.940 --> 05:41.775
OVER 120.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.043
MORE THAN 200 WERE REPORTEDLY

05:43.043 --> 05:43.877
INJURED.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.778
NO ONE HAS YET TAKEN

05:44.778 --> 05:46.246
RESPONSIBILITY FOR ATTACKING THE

05:46.246 --> 05:47.514
BUILDING WITH BOTH BOMBS AND

05:47.514 --> 05:48.448
GUNFIRE.

05:48.448 --> 05:50.016
OFFICIALS SAY THE OPERATION BORE

05:50.016 --> 05:51.284
THE HALLMARKS OF THE ISLAMIC

05:51.284 --> 05:53.486
REBEL GROUP BOKO HARAM.

05:53.486 --> 05:54.521
THE SUNNI JIHADISTS HAVE BEEN

05:54.521 --> 05:55.755
TARGETING TRADITIONAL ISLAMIC

05:55.755 --> 05:57.490
RELIGIOUS AUTHORITIES FOR NEARLY

05:57.490 --> 05:58.758
SIX YEARS NOW.

05:58.758 --> 05:59.960
THE EMIR OF KANO HAS BEEN A

05:59.960 --> 06:01.361
VOCAL CRITIC OF THE GROUP.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.796
HE WAS NOT AT THE MOSQUE DURING

06:02.796 --> 06:04.130
THE ATTACK.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.131
HERE IN THE U.S., MISSOURI

06:05.131 --> 06:06.600
GOVERNOR JAY NIXON IS CALLING

06:06.600 --> 06:07.667
FOR A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE

06:07.667 --> 06:09.069
STATE LEGISLATURE TO APPROVE

06:09.069 --> 06:10.070
ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE

06:10.070 --> 06:11.471
NATIONAL GUARD AND HIGHWAY

06:11.471 --> 06:12.839
PATROL, WHO ARE PROVIDING

06:12.839 --> 06:15.308
SECURITY IN AND AROUND FERGUSON.

06:15.308 --> 06:16.710
TODAY, ACTIVISTS ARE STAGING A

06:16.710 --> 06:19.012
120-MILE MARCH TO THE STATE

06:19.012 --> 06:20.747
CAPITAL IN JEFFERSON CITY TO

06:20.747 --> 06:22.249
PROTEST THE KILLING OF UNARMED

06:22.249 --> 06:23.750
TEEN MICHAEL BROWN.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.218
YESTERDAY, PROTESTERS FORCED A

06:25.218 --> 06:26.553
MALL NEAR FERGUSON TO

06:26.553 --> 06:28.622
TEMPORARILY SHUT DOWN BY LYING

06:28.622 --> 06:29.923
ON THE FLOOR FOR A MOMENT OF

06:29.923 --> 06:31.358
SILENCE.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.325
THE U.N. COMMITTEE AGAINST

06:32.325 --> 06:33.860
TORTURE HAS ISSUED A NEW REPORT

06:33.860 --> 06:35.862
SAYING U.S. LAW ENFORCEMENT

06:35.862 --> 06:37.264
DOESN’T FULLY COMPLY WITH AN

06:37.264 --> 06:38.798
INTERNATIONAL TREATY BANNING

06:38.798 --> 06:40.734
TORTURE AND CRUEL TREATMENT.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.935
THE PANEL RAISED CONCERNS OVER

06:41.935 --> 06:43.303
POLICE SHOOTINGS OF UNARMED

06:43.303 --> 06:45.038
AFRICAN-AMERICANS AS WELL AS

06:45.038 --> 06:46.172
OTHER ISSUES, INCLUDING THE

06:46.172 --> 06:47.474
FAILURE TO FULLY INVESTIGATE

06:47.474 --> 06:48.842
ALLEGATIONS OF TORTURE OF

06:48.842 --> 06:50.710
PRISONERS HELD ABROAD, AND THE

06:50.710 --> 06:52.479
USE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT IN

06:52.479 --> 06:54.080
U.S. PRISONS.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.082
AND IN HEALTH NEWS, NEW RESEARCH

06:56.082 --> 06:57.183
SHOWS AN INGREDIENT IN

06:57.183 --> 06:59.286
ANTIBACTERIAL SOAP, TOOTHPASTE,

06:59.286 --> 07:00.720
SHAMPOO AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD

07:00.720 --> 07:02.689
PRODUCTS MIGHT LEAD TO CANCER IN

07:02.689 --> 07:03.623
MICE.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.058
THE STUDY RECENTLY PUBLISHED BY

07:05.058 --> 07:06.559
SCIENTISTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

07:06.559 --> 07:08.161
CALIFORNIA-DAVIS, FOUND THAT

07:08.161 --> 07:09.696
EXPOSING MICE TO HIGH LEVELS OF

07:09.696 --> 07:11.264
TRICLOSAN MADE THEM MORE

07:11.264 --> 07:13.366
SUSCEPTIBLE TO LIVER TUMORS.

07:13.366 --> 07:14.434
RESEARCHERS SAY THE MICE IN THE

07:14.434 --> 07:15.802
STUDY WERE EXPOSED TO MUCH

07:15.802 --> 07:17.470
HIGHER CONCENTRATIONS OF THE

07:17.470 --> 07:18.872
MICROBIAL INGREDIENT THAN A

07:18.872 --> 07:20.573
TYPICAL PERSON WOULD ENCOUNTER.

07:20.573 --> 07:21.875
HOWEVER, THEY SAY PROLONGED

07:21.875 --> 07:23.610
EXPOSURE COULD BE A RISK AND

07:23.610 --> 07:24.678
MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO

07:24.678 --> 07:26.179
DETERMINE THE ACTUAL RISK TO

07:26.179 --> 07:27.180
HUMANS.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.258
>> Brangham: RETURNING NOW TO

07:38.258 --> 07:39.926
THE THREAT OF ISIS IN IRAQ AND

07:39.926 --> 07:40.860
SYRIA.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.295
JUST A FEW MONTHS AGO, SOME U.S.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.530
OFFICIALS WORRIED THAT ISIS

07:43.530 --> 07:45.031
FIGHTERS COULD ACTUALLY OVERTAKE

07:45.031 --> 07:47.033
BAGHDAD, BUT THERE ARE NEW SIGNS

07:47.033 --> 07:48.201
OF CONFIDENCE IN THE FIGHT

07:48.201 --> 07:49.836
AGAINST THE ISLAMIC JIHADISTS IN

07:49.836 --> 07:50.837
IRAQ.

07:50.837 --> 07:52.138
FOR MORE, WE ARE JOINED FROM

07:52.138 --> 07:53.406
GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN, BY

07:53.406 --> 07:55.008
DOUGLAS OLLIVANT, A PARTNER WITH

07:55.008 --> 07:56.376
MANTID INTERNATIONAL.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.310
DOUG, WELCOME BACK.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.244
I UNDERSTAND YOU SPENT A GOOD

07:58.244 --> 07:59.446
DEAL OF TIME IN BAGHDAD.

07:59.446 --> 08:00.480
WHAT IS IT LIKE IN BAGHDAD

08:00.480 --> 08:01.581
TODAY?

08:01.581 --> 08:03.650
>> THE ATMOSPHERE IN BAGHDAD WAS

08:03.650 --> 08:05.085
VERY POSITIVE, BOTH AMONG THE

08:05.085 --> 08:07.721
IRAQIS AND WITH MANY OF THE U.S.

08:07.721 --> 08:09.356
FORCES AT OUR EMBASSY.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.757
I THINK WHAT MOST STRUCK ME IN

08:10.757 --> 08:12.425
BAGHDAD WAS THE SENSE OF

08:12.425 --> 08:14.160
NORMALITY OF LIFE.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.128
PEOPLE ARE GOING ABOUT THEIR

08:15.128 --> 08:15.729
BUSINESS.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.664
THEY’RE SHOPPING.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.432
THERE ARE TRAFFIC JAMS BECAUSE

08:19.432 --> 08:20.900
EVERYONE IS OUT SHOPPING AND

08:20.900 --> 08:22.168
GOING TO WORK AND GOING TO

08:22.168 --> 08:24.537
WHERE THEY NEED TO GO.

08:24.537 --> 08:26.506
WHEN YOU GO TO BAGHDAD AIRPORT,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.174
THE SECURITY IS TIGHT, BUT YOU

08:28.174 --> 08:29.676
GET THERE, AND THERE ARE LINES.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.010
THERE ARE PEOPLE FLYING ALL OVER

08:31.010 --> 08:33.380
THE WORLD TO AND FROM BAGHDAD.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.815
JUST HOW MUCH LIFE IS GOING ON,

08:35.815 --> 08:37.384
EVEN THOUGH THE FRONT IN SOME

08:37.384 --> 08:39.152
PLACES IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.153
>> Brangham: PRESIDENT OBAMA

08:40.153 --> 08:41.721
RECENTLY APPROVED THE SENDING OF

08:41.721 --> 08:43.523
ANOTHER 1,500 TROOPS, WHICH IS

08:43.523 --> 08:44.791
BASIC A DOUBLING OF THE U.S.

08:44.791 --> 08:45.859
FORCE THERE.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.460
HOW MUCH OF THE RECENT CHANGES

08:47.460 --> 08:49.362
THAT YOU WITNESSED WOULD YOU

08:49.362 --> 08:50.764
CREDIT TO U.S. FORCES’

08:50.764 --> 08:52.265
INVOLVEMENT THERE?

08:52.265 --> 08:53.533
>> I THINK EXTERNAL FORCES, BOTH

08:53.533 --> 08:54.768
THE UNITED STATES AND-- WE

08:54.768 --> 08:56.102
HAVE TO BE CANDID-- IRAN’S

08:56.102 --> 08:58.104
INTERVENTION HAVE GREATLY

08:58.104 --> 08:59.439
ASSISTED THE IRAQIS IN PUSHING

08:59.439 --> 09:01.141
BACK THE ISLAMIC STATE.

09:01.141 --> 09:02.876
WITH COACHING FROM THESE OUTSIDE

09:02.876 --> 09:04.177
POWERS AND, OF COURSE, WITH

09:04.177 --> 09:06.079
U.S. AIR POWER IN SUPPORT,

09:06.079 --> 09:08.014
BOTH THE IRAQI ARMY AND THE

09:08.014 --> 09:09.916
KURDISH PESHMERGA, BOTH OF

09:09.916 --> 09:11.217
WHICH DID NOT LOOK VERY

09:11.217 --> 09:12.352
GOOD-- LET’S FACE IT-- IN THE

09:12.352 --> 09:13.787
INITIAL PUSH OF THE ISLAMIC

09:13.787 --> 09:15.855
STATE INTO IRAQ, HAVE MADE SOME

09:15.855 --> 09:17.557
FAIRLY SERIOUS GAINS OVER THE

09:17.557 --> 09:19.392
LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.261
IN SALAH AL-DIN AND DYALA, THE

09:21.261 --> 09:23.430
IRAQI ARMY HAS PUSHED FORWARD.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.131
THEY BROKE THE SIEGE AT BEIJI

09:25.131 --> 09:26.699
REFINERY, AND IN THE NORTH THE

09:26.699 --> 09:27.767
KURDS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PUSH

09:27.767 --> 09:29.436
A LITTLE FURTHER IN TOWARDS

09:29.436 --> 09:30.136
MOSUL.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.070
>> Brangham: I’M CURIOUS ABOUT

09:31.070 --> 09:32.472
THE IRAQI ARMY BECAUSE, YOU

09:32.472 --> 09:33.373
KNOW, WE SPENT YEARS AND

09:33.373 --> 09:34.240
BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO

09:34.240 --> 09:35.608
CREATE A RELIABLE FORCE, AND

09:35.608 --> 09:37.343
WHEN ISIS FIRST SHOWED UP, MUCH

09:37.343 --> 09:40.146
OF THAT FORCE WAS DEFEATED OR

09:40.146 --> 09:42.215
VANISHED INTO THIN AIR.

09:42.215 --> 09:43.349
BUT YOU SEEM TO FEEL THAT THEY

09:43.349 --> 09:44.818
ARE DOING A BETTER JOB NOW AND

09:44.818 --> 09:45.819
ARE ABLE TO STAND UP A LITTLE

09:45.819 --> 09:46.820
MORE EFFECTIVELY.

09:46.820 --> 09:47.954
>> WELL, I THINK SOME MORE

09:47.954 --> 09:48.988
RELIABLE TROOPS HAVE BEEN

09:48.988 --> 09:50.757
BROUGHT FROM THE SOUTH, TROOPS

09:50.757 --> 09:52.926
THAT ARE VERY DEVOTED TO THE

09:52.926 --> 09:54.093
IRAQI STATE.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.261
BUT PART OF THIS, I THINK, IS

09:55.261 --> 09:57.263
THE ARMY THAT WE BUILT FOR THE

09:57.263 --> 09:58.164
IRAQI ARMY.

09:58.164 --> 09:59.232
THIS WAS AN ARMY THAT WAS BUILT

09:59.232 --> 10:01.434
TO BE A POLICE GARRISON FORCE.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.269
AND THAT’S WHAT WE BUILT IT FOR.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.138
AND THEN WHEN IT FACED THIS

10:05.138 --> 10:07.740
ISLAMIC STATE ARMY THAT CAME IN

10:07.740 --> 10:09.209
AND PUSHED THROUGH IT, THIS WAS

10:09.209 --> 10:10.343
AN OPPONENT FOR WHICH THEY WERE

10:10.343 --> 10:11.377
NOT PREPARED.

10:11.377 --> 10:12.612
NOW, WE DON’T WANT TO DOWNPLAY

10:12.612 --> 10:13.713
THE VERY REAL PROBLEMS WITH THE

10:13.713 --> 10:16.282
IRAQI ARMY-- THE CORRUPTION, THE

10:16.282 --> 10:18.451
LACK OF TRAINING, THE SIPHONING

10:18.451 --> 10:19.185
OFF OF MONEY.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.453
THERE ARE VERY REAL PROBLEMS

10:20.453 --> 10:21.888
WITH THE IRAQI ARMY THAT WE

10:21.888 --> 10:23.122
DON’T WANT TO DOWNPLAY.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.091
BUT THERE IS SOME THOUGHT THAT

10:25.091 --> 10:27.527
IF WE FOCUS THIS NEW IRAQI ARMY

10:27.527 --> 10:29.496
ON THIS NEW PROBLEM SET THAT

10:29.496 --> 10:30.864
THEY’RE FACING, THAT WE COULD

10:30.864 --> 10:32.432
HAVE SOME DIFFERENT RESULTS IN

10:32.432 --> 10:34.234
THE NOT-TOO-DISTANT FUTURE.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.235
NOW, WE DON’T WANT TO GET AHEAD

10:35.235 --> 10:35.768
OF OURSELVES.

10:35.768 --> 10:36.569
THEY’RE NOT GOING TO BEAT THE

10:36.569 --> 10:37.770
ISLAMIC STATE NEXT MONTH.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.206
THIS IS STILL A 12-30-MONTH

10:40.206 --> 10:42.141
ENDEAVOR, BUT THE SIGNS RIGHT

10:42.141 --> 10:43.042
NOW ARE GOOD.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.010
>> Brangham: A LOT OF OUR

10:44.010 --> 10:45.311
FIGHT IN IRAQ, OBVIOUSLY, IS

10:45.311 --> 10:46.779
AGAINST ISIS.

10:46.779 --> 10:47.847
THEY’RE NOT JUST IN IRAQ BUT

10:47.847 --> 10:49.482
THEY’RE ALSO IN SYRIA.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.885
DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE, ANY SENSE

10:51.885 --> 10:53.219
THAT THE SUCCESSES THAT YOU’VE

10:53.219 --> 10:55.321
SEEN IN IRAQ COULD POSSIBLY

10:55.321 --> 10:57.423
TRANSLATE TO SUCCESS IN SYRIA?

10:57.423 --> 10:58.725
>> UNFORTUNATELY, NO.

10:58.725 --> 11:01.995
IN IRAQ, WE HAVE THE BASIS OF A

11:01.995 --> 11:03.396
POLITICAL SOLUTION.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.664
NOW, THERE’S A HUGE UPHILL CLIMB

11:04.664 --> 11:07.267
IN IRAQ TO GET RECONCILIATION

11:07.267 --> 11:09.202
WITH THE KURDS, WITH THE IRAQI

11:09.202 --> 11:10.470
SUNNIS IN THE NORTH, AND WE

11:10.470 --> 11:12.539
CAN’T DOWNPLAY HOW DIFFICULT

11:12.539 --> 11:13.172
THAT IS.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.641
BUT THERE’S A VERY REAL

11:14.641 --> 11:16.042
POSSIBILITY THAT THAT COULD

11:16.042 --> 11:17.977
HAPPEN IF EVERYONE PLAYS THEIR

11:17.977 --> 11:18.912
CARDS RIGHT.

11:18.912 --> 11:21.247
IN SYRIA, THERE’S NO WAY THAT I

11:21.247 --> 11:23.416
CAN TELL YOU A STORY, HOWEVER

11:23.416 --> 11:25.385
IMPLAUSIBLE, ABOUT HOW THE

11:25.385 --> 11:27.587
POLITICS IN SYRIA MIGHT COME

11:27.587 --> 11:30.123
BACK TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT

11:30.123 --> 11:31.758
PRODUCES AN OUTCOME THAT WOULD

11:31.758 --> 11:33.126
BE OKAY WITH US.

11:33.126 --> 11:34.227
I MEAN, LET’S BE CANDID.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.162
THE MOST LIKELY OUTCOME WORTHY

11:36.162 --> 11:37.564
OF ASSAD REGIME TO FALL IN SYRIA

11:37.564 --> 11:40.466
IS THE TAKEOVER OF SYRIA BY THE

11:40.466 --> 11:43.269
ISLAMIC STATE AND/OR THE NUSRA

11:43.269 --> 11:45.238
FRONT, THE OFFICIAL AL QAEDA

11:45.238 --> 11:47.173
AFFILIATE IN SYRIA, WHICH

11:47.173 --> 11:50.276
SOMETIMES GETS LOST IN THE TALK

11:50.276 --> 11:51.544
ABOUT THE ISLAMIC STATE, BUT IS

11:51.544 --> 11:53.212
NONETHELESS A VERY REAL,

11:53.212 --> 11:54.747
OFFICIAL AL QAEDA AFFILIATE IN

11:54.747 --> 11:55.548
THE COUNTRY.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.183
SO THE POLITICS IN SYRIA ARE

11:57.183 --> 11:58.618
JUST MUCH, MUCH MORE DIFFICULT.

11:58.618 --> 11:59.452
>> Brangham: DOUGLAS OLLIVANT,

11:59.452 --> 12:00.420
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

12:00.420 --> 12:02.355
US.

12:02.355 --> 12:03.723
>> THANK YOU, WILLIAM.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.500
>> Brangham: AND NOW IN

12:14.500 --> 12:15.835
TONIGHT’S SIGNATURE STORY, THE

12:15.835 --> 12:17.570
NATIONWIDE CONTROVERSY OVER

12:17.570 --> 12:19.238
TEACHERS AND TENURE.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.607
SUPPORTERS SAY TENURE PROVIDES

12:20.607 --> 12:22.542
IMPORTANT JOB PROTECTIONS, BUT

12:22.542 --> 12:23.876
OPPONENTS SAY TENURE MAKES IT

12:23.876 --> 12:25.812
HARD TO FIRE BAD TEACHERS AND

12:25.812 --> 12:27.180
DIFFICULT TO KEEP GOOD TEACHERS

12:27.180 --> 12:29.215
WITH LESS TIME ON THE JOB.

12:29.215 --> 12:30.717
LAST SPRING, THE NEWSHOUR

12:30.717 --> 12:32.185
TRAVELED TO CALIFORNIA TO TALK

12:32.185 --> 12:33.353
TO STUDENTS, PARENTS AND

12:33.353 --> 12:35.088
ADVOCATES WHO WENT TO COURT TO

12:35.088 --> 12:36.456
CHANGE THEIR STATE’S TENURE

12:36.456 --> 12:37.390
LAWS.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.591
TONIGHT, WE LOOK AT THE OUTCOME

12:38.591 --> 12:40.560
OF THAT LEGAL FIGHT AND HOW

12:40.560 --> 12:41.794
CHALLENGES TO SIMILAR TENURE

12:41.794 --> 12:43.296
LAWS ARE SPREADING TO ANOTHER

12:43.296 --> 12:44.197
STATE.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.798

12:47.233 --> 12:48.167

NORTHERN LOS ANGELES.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.808
THE GIRLS ARE AIMING FOR COLLEGE

12:55.808 --> 12:56.976
AND WOULD BE THE FIRST IN THE

12:56.976 --> 12:59.012
FAMILY WITH HIGHER DEGREES.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.713
BUT THE VERGARA SISTERS SAY THAT

13:00.713 --> 13:02.448
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, THEY FACED

13:02.448 --> 13:03.616
OBSTACLES IN PURSUING THEIR

13:03.616 --> 13:05.918
EDUCATION-- CHAOTIC CLASSROOMS

13:05.918 --> 13:08.287
AND LITTLE TO NO INSTRUCTION.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.089
ELIZABETH, NOW A SENIOR, AND

13:10.089 --> 13:12.859
BEATRIZ, A JUNIOR, SAY BACK IN

13:12.859 --> 13:14.894
SEVENTH GRADE, THEY BOTH HAD A

13:14.894 --> 13:16.462
PARTICULARLY BAD HISTORY

13:16.462 --> 13:17.430
TEACHER.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.032
>> HE WOULD JUST BE AT HIS DESK,

13:19.032 --> 13:21.467
LIKE, JUST USING HIS COMPUTER OR

13:21.467 --> 13:22.135
SLEEPING.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.470

MARIJUANA IN CLASS?

13:27.540 --> 13:29.008
>> YEAH.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.843
I KNOW, IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.178
>> Reporter: BEATRIZ ALSO SAYS A

13:32.178 --> 13:34.380
SCIENCE TEACHER WAS OFFENSIVE.

13:34.380 --> 13:36.182
>> SHE WOULD CALL THIS GIRL

13:36.182 --> 13:38.985
"WHORE" AND "SLUT, GO OVER THERE

13:38.985 --> 13:39.519
THERE."

13:39.519 --> 13:40.253
>> Reporter: WHAT WENT THROUGH

13:40.253 --> 13:41.621
YOUR MIND WHEN YOU HEARD THAT?

13:41.621 --> 13:43.156
>> I WAS SCARED TO ASK QUESTIONS

13:43.156 --> 13:44.257
BECAUSE I DIDN’T WANT HER TO,

13:44.257 --> 13:46.325
LIKE... I DIDN’T WANT HER TO

13:46.325 --> 13:47.293
OFFEND ME.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.133
SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR ABOUT THE

13:54.133 --> 13:56.769
TWO TEACHERS, AND TWO OTHERS.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.572
BUT, SHE SAYS, NOTHING HAPPENED.

ANYTHING TO ADDRESS THE

SITUATION.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.311
THEY DIDN’T TAKE ME SERIOUSLY.

CALIFORNIA’S TWO-YEAR

17:07.293 --> 17:08.561
IN THE NATION.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.329

17:10.329 --> 17:12.598

17:12.598 --> 17:14.734
FORMER SUPERINTENDENT DEASY SAYS

17:14.734 --> 17:16.602
THAT PERMANENT STATUS MEANS THE

A DECADE.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.512
IT CAME OUT DURING THE TRIAL

WHO ARE... WHO WERE EVALUATED

17:29.949 --> 17:32.551
LAST YEAR WERE BELOW STANDARD.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.820
SO WE... SHOULD WE OVERHAUL THE

17:34.820 --> 17:36.522
SYSTEM TO TAKE CARE OF WHAT

17:36.522 --> 17:37.957
MIGHT JUST BE A FEW BAD APPLES?

17:48.367 --> 17:49.302
ABSOLUTELY.

17:57.009 --> 18:01.380

18:34.080 --> 18:35.181

18:35.181 --> 18:37.316
NATIONALLY IS THAT WE CAN’T KEEP

18:37.316 --> 18:38.784
TEACHERS IN THE PROFESSION.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.486
CLASSES ARE OVERCROWDED.

18:40.486 --> 18:41.821
THERE AREN’T ENOUGH RESOURCES.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.522
SO, THAT REALLY IS THE BIGGER

18:43.522 --> 18:45.391
ISSUE IN PUBLIC EDUCATION, AND

18:45.391 --> 18:47.026
THAT’S CREATING CONDITIONS THAT

18:47.026 --> 18:49.495
MAKE IT ATTRACTIVE FOR PEOPLE TO

KNOWS FIRSTHAND HOW PRECARIOUS

19:00.840 --> 19:02.308
HER JOB CAN BE.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.743
BECAUSE SHE DOESN’T HAVE ENOUGH

PERMANENT STATUS FOR TEACHERS

19:24.230 --> 19:25.965
AFTER TWO YEARS.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.466
SHE SAYS THAT PROVISION ACTUALLY

19:27.466 --> 19:29.535
HELPS HER ADVOCATE FOR STUDENTS

19:29.535 --> 19:31.203
WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING FIRED.

19:49.155 --> 19:50.556
DON’T NECESSARILY CONNECT WITH
