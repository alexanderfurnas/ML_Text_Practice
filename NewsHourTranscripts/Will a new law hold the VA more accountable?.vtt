ABOUT MILITARY VETERANS AND THE

SCANDAL THAT STARTED THIS.

01:05.765 --> 01:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, THIS WAS IN PHOENIX.

01:06.733 --> 01:07.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAS A FEW YEARS AGO, IT

01:07.634 --> 01:08.735 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVEN CAUSED ERIC SHINSEKI HIS

01:08.735 --> 01:10.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOB.

01:10.170 --> 01:11.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REFRESH US A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT

01:11.638 --> 01:13.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAUSED THIS.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.241 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, IT WAS UNCOVERED THAT

01:15.241 --> 01:17.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AT THE V.A. MEDICAL CENTER IN

01:17.043 --> 01:19.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

KEEPING SEPARATE WAITING LISTS

01:22.649 --> 01:23.716 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF VETERANS THAT WERE WAITING

FOR APPOINTMENTS.

01:25.251 --> 01:26.352 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WERE TRYING TO COVER UP THE

01:26.352 --> 01:28.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG WAITS THAT WERE-- THAT IT

01:28.354 --> 01:30.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS TAKING FOR VETERANS TO GET

01:30.423 --> 01:31.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR APPOINTMENTS WITH THEIR

01:31.357 --> 01:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOCTORS.

01:32.659 --> 01:34.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DATA WAS BEING FALSIFIED, AND

01:34.461 --> 01:36.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THROUGHOUT A LOT OF THIS, IT WAS

01:36.162 --> 01:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOUND THAT SOME VETERANS

01:37.263 --> 01:38.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY DIED WHILE THEY WERE

01:38.364 --> 01:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAITING FOR CARE.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT COST ERIC SHINSEKI HIS JOB AS

01:42.435 --> 01:43.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE V.A. SECRETARY, AS YOU

01:43.703 --> 01:46.139 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MENTIONED, AND CAUSED CONGRESS

01:46.139 --> 01:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO START THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO

01:48.274 --> 01:50.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSFORM THE V.A. AND TO HELP

01:50.677 --> 01:52.545 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GET VETERANS THE CARE THAT THEY

01:52.545 --> 01:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED AND TO GET IT FASTER.

>> Sreenivasan: AND THIS LAW

01:55.215 --> 01:56.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO OFFERS SOME PROTECTIONS FOR

01:56.483 --> 01:57.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHISTLE BLOWERS?

01:57.183 --> 01:58.618 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN THE WAY THAT

01:58.618 --> 02:00.086 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE EVEN HEAR ABOUT THESE THINGS,

02:00.086 --> 02:01.421 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THESE PROBLEMS IN THE V.A., ARE

02:01.421 --> 02:03.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EITHER FROM VETERANS WHO ARE THE

02:03.857 --> 02:05.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VICTIMS OF POOR CARE OR LACK OF

02:05.592 --> 02:08.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CARE, OR PEOPLE INSIDE WHO WANT

02:08.094 --> 02:09.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO SEE SOMETHING CHANGE.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> RIGHT, IT DOES OFFER SOME NEW

02:11.431 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROTECTIONS FOR WHISTLEBLOWERS.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS ALSO CREATING

02:16.436 --> 02:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A COMPLAINT HOT LINE AT THE

02:18.204 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHITE HOUSE, WHICH IS UNDERGOING

02:19.439 --> 02:21.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME TESTING RIGHT NOW, FOR

02:21.541 --> 02:23.276 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VETERANS AND OTHERS TO CALL IN

02:23.276 --> 02:24.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH COMPLAINTS AND THAT KIND OF

02:24.911 --> 02:25.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THING.

02:25.478 --> 02:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, HE'S PUTTING A LITTLE BIT OF

02:26.779 --> 02:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A PREMIUM ON PROTECTING

02:28.314 --> 02:29.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHISTLEBLOWERS AND THE KIND OF

02:29.816 --> 02:31.651 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE WHO BRING THESE

02:31.651 --> 02:33.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITUATIONS TO LIGHT.

LONG DID SOME OF THESE EMPLOYEES

HAVE THIS SORT OF PROTECTION,

02:37.257 --> 02:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHO WAS OPPOSED TO THIS KIND

02:38.691 --> 02:39.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF LEGISLATION?

02:39.459 --> 02:40.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I MEAN, IS IT THE... IS IT THE

02:40.760 --> 02:42.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF UNIONS THAT ARE... THESE

02:42.729 --> 02:44.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF, OR

02:44.664 --> 02:45.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF CAREER SERVICE

INDIVIDUALS?

02:47.367 --> 02:49.335 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> MOSTLY, IT'S BEEN THE

02:49.335 --> 02:51.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMPLOYEE UNIONS, THE UNIONS THAT

02:51.204 --> 02:53.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SOME OF THE CHANGES UNDER THIS

02:58.244 --> 03:01.281 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW WOULD DO TWO THINGS: ONE,

03:01.281 --> 03:03.349 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD ALLOW THE V.A. SECRETARY

03:03.349 --> 03:05.285 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND OTHER TOP OFFICIALS IN THAT

PERFORMANCE ISSUES, WHICH IS

03:13.493 --> 03:14.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE

ABOUT.

03:15.495 --> 03:16.763 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE OTHER ISSUE THAT

03:16.763 --> 03:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCERNS A LOT OF THE UNIONS IS

03:19.332 --> 03:21.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FACT THAT THEY SEE WHAT'S

03:21.234 --> 03:22.502 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING OR WHAT IS ABOUT TO

03:22.502 --> 03:25.305 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SHRINK THE SIZE OF THE FEDERAL
