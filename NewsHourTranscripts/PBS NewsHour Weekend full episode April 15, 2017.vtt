04:23.096 --> 04:24.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT'S NOT A MATTER OF

04:24.931 --> 04:26.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER IT WILL HAPPEN.

04:26.699 --> 04:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT IT

04:27.900 --> 04:29.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILL HAPPEN AT SOME POINT.

04:29.235 --> 04:30.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORTH KOREA HAS MADE IT VERY

04:30.236 --> 04:31.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLEAR THAT THEY ARE GOING TO

04:31.437 --> 04:34.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

04:58.398 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SOME WAYS, SOUTH KOREANS,

05:00.700 --> 05:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS DRILL

05:01.768 --> 05:03.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH KOREA ARE

05:06.306 --> 05:07.273 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LARGELY UNFAZED.

05:07.273 --> 05:08.841 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WOULD BE HARD PRESSED ON THE

05:08.841 --> 05:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STREETS OF SEOUL TODAY TO TELL

05:11.844 --> 05:12.979 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE WAS THIS KIND OF A

05:12.979 --> 05:15.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRISIS GOING ON.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT A

POLITICAL UPHEAVAL RIGHT NOW.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.187 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY IMPEACHED THEIR PRESIDENT.

05:21.187 --> 05:22.288 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE GOT A PRESIDENTIAL

05:22.288 --> 05:23.456 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION COMING UP IN A FEW

05:23.456 --> 05:24.157 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEKS.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ACTUALLY, THEY WERE OUT IN

05:25.091 --> 05:25.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE STREETS TODAY.

05:25.792 --> 05:26.693 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST

05:26.693 --> 05:28.127 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEAUTIFUL SPRING DAYS.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SAID, CERTAINLY WITHIN THE

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES THERE

05:33.666 --> 05:36.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT SOME

05:36.235 --> 05:37.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE LANGUAGE COMING FROM

05:37.103 --> 05:39.038 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON, PARTICULARLY

05:39.038 --> 05:41.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT TRUMP SAYING THAT THE

05:41.274 --> 05:43.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. WOULD DEAL WITH NORTH KOREA

05:43.242 --> 05:44.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON ITS OWN IF CHINA DIDN'T JUMP

05:44.377 --> 05:44.977 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN.

05:44.977 --> 05:46.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS THE TYPE OF LANGUAGE

05:46.612 --> 05:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT SOUTH KOREA DOES NOT WANT

05:47.914 --> 05:50.183 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO HEAR, AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF

05:50.183 --> 05:51.451 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

05:51.451 --> 05:53.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDRESSED THIS AND SAID THE U.S.

05:53.553 --> 05:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY NEEDS TO CONSULT WITH

05:54.821 --> 05:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTH KOREA.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY NEED TO BE IN THE LOOP ON

05:58.591 --> 06:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYTHING TO DO WITH NORTH KOREA

06:00.059 --> 06:01.427 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THIS IS THE COUNTRY THAT

06:01.427 --> 06:03.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULD BEAR THE BRUNT OF ANY KIND

06:03.062 --> 06:04.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MILITARY ACTION.

06:04.230 --> 06:04.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: VICE PRESIDENT

06:04.931 --> 06:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PENCE IS ON HIS WAY TO THE

06:06.466 --> 06:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGION STARTING TOMORROW.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.470 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS YOU MENTIONED, IF THE SOUTH

06:10.470 --> 06:11.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KOREAN GOVERNMENT IS KIND OF IN

06:11.671 --> 06:13.172 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A STATE OF FLUX, WHO DOES HE

06:13.172 --> 06:14.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEET WITH?

06:14.006 --> 06:15.608 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DOES THE REGION RESOLVE

06:15.608 --> 06:18.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUES WITH THE LEADERSHIP IN

06:18.211 --> 06:19.445 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTH KOREA, KNOWING THAT THAT'S

06:19.445 --> 06:22.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO CHANGE IN A FEW WEEKS?

06:22.048 --> 06:23.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THIS CERTAINLY PUTS SEOUL AT

06:23.683 --> 06:25.385 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A DISADVANTAGE TO HAVE THIS TYPE

06:25.385 --> 06:26.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF A POLITICAL VACUUM AT SUCH A

06:26.886 --> 06:29.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CRUCIAL TIME WHEN THE TRUMP

06:29.856 --> 06:31.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADMINISTRATION IS DEVELOPING ITS

06:31.391 --> 06:32.792 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NORTH KOREAN POLICY.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT PART OF WHAT HE WANTS TO DO

06:35.094 --> 06:37.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS REASSURE SEOUL AND TOKYO AND

06:37.697 --> 06:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER PARTNERS IN THE REGION

06:38.965 --> 06:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE U.S. STANDS FIRM,

06:40.767 --> 06:42.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESPITE SOME OF THE LANGUAGE

06:42.802 --> 06:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND HE WILL BE MEETING WITH THE

06:45.805 --> 06:47.673 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTING PRESIDENT ON MONDAY.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.275 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO HE IS TRYING TO MAKE A POINT

06:49.275 --> 06:50.877 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT, YES, THEY REALIZE THAT

06:50.877 --> 06:52.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTH KOREA IS IN POLITICAL

06:52.578 --> 06:54.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRANSITION, BUT THAT THEY

06:54.147 --> 06:56.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REMAIN-- THEY REMAIN COMMITTED

06:56.516 --> 06:57.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

07:03.790 --> 07:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF MILITARY ACTION FROM NORTH

07:05.057 --> 07:07.260 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KOREA WE ARE ALSO SEEING REPORTS

07:07.260 --> 07:08.995 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT JAPAN IS, IN A WAY, TRYING

07:08.995 --> 07:10.363 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO TAKE MEASURES AND TRYING TO

07:10.363 --> 07:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGURE OUT CONTINGENCY PLANS.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> JAPAN IS NERVOUS AS WELL.

07:15.034 --> 07:16.436 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT ONE OF

07:16.436 --> 07:18.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RECENT BALLISTIC MISSILE

07:18.438 --> 07:20.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAUNCHES WAS TARGETED TOWARD

07:20.640 --> 07:21.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAPAN.

07:21.641 --> 07:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A NUMBER OF THESE BALLISTIC

07:23.309 --> 07:25.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MISSILES LANDED WITHIN A FEW

07:25.244 --> 07:26.813 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUNDRED MILES FROM THE JAPANESE

SHORES.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THIS IS CERTAINLY SENT TO--

07:29.115 --> 07:31.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS MEANT TO SEND A MESSAGE TO

07:31.117 --> 07:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAPAN BUT HAS TOKYO NERVOUS AS

07:33.519 --> 07:35.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WELL, SO I DID SEE THOSE REPORTS

07:35.488 --> 07:38.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:08.380 --> 19:09.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:09.548 --> 19:11.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ODDS THEY'LL PASS ONE OF THE

19:11.450 --> 19:12.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

19:16.255 --> 19:17.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUBSTANTIAL MOVEMENT IN PLACES

19:17.623 --> 19:19.191 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKE MASSACHUSETTS, CONNECTICUT

19:19.191 --> 19:19.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ELSEWHERE AROUND THE

COUNTRY.

19:20.325 --> 19:20.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT IS THE

19:20.993 --> 19:22.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LIKELIHOOD, EVEN IF ONE OF THESE

19:22.094 --> 19:24.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAWS ARE PASSED, THAT THE

19:24.196 --> 19:25.531 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT ACTUALLY HAS TO DO

19:25.531 --> 19:26.598 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS?

19:26.598 --> 19:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE THERE

19:27.533 --> 19:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE SOME INTERESTING

19:28.367 --> 19:29.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGES.

19:29.868 --> 19:31.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE ONE HAND, I THINK IT'S

19:31.503 --> 19:33.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT

19:33.205 --> 19:35.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES CAN ADD QUALIFICATIONS TO

19:35.474 --> 19:36.175 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.042 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH THOSE

19:37.042 --> 19:38.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUALIFICATIONS-- YOU HAVE TO BE

19:38.210 --> 19:40.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
35 YEARS OLD, A NATURAL-BORN

19:40.112 --> 19:42.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE UNITED STATES.

19:43.482 --> 19:44.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROPONENTS ARE SAYING WE'RE NOT

19:44.616 --> 19:45.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ADDING QUALIFICATIONS.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.085 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL WE'RE DOING IS REGULATING

19:47.085 --> 19:48.787 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACCESS TO THE BALLOT AND I THINK

19:48.787 --> 19:50.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A CHALLENGE AS WELL.

19:50.689 --> 19:53.926 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A LOT OF CASES THAT HANDLE

19:53.926 --> 19:56.094 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALLOT ACCESS, THEY SAY, LOOK,

19:56.094 --> 19:57.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

19:57.196 --> 19:58.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALLOT SEPARATES SERIOUS FROM

19:58.997 --> 19:59.932 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIVOLOUS CANDIDATES.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KEEPING FRIVOLOUS CANDIDATES OFF

20:01.333 --> 20:03.202 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE BALLOT REQUIRES THEM TO,

20:03.202 --> 20:06.672 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY, GET 500 SIGNATURES ON A

20:06.672 --> 20:08.006 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETITION, TO GET 1% OF OF THE

20:08.006 --> 20:09.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATE'S REGISTERED VOTERS TO

20:09.274 --> 20:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGN A PETITION.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND NO COURT HAS EVER SORT OF

20:12.144 --> 20:14.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTHORIZED THE USE OF THE BALLOT

20:14.479 --> 20:16.248 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS SORT OF A TOOL TO ACHIEVE

20:16.248 --> 20:18.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PREFERRED POLICY OUTCOME.

20:18.083 --> 20:18.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I THINK THERE'S A REAL

20:18.917 --> 20:20.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO SOME

20:20.319 --> 20:21.353 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THESE ISSUES THAT I THINK

20:21.353 --> 20:22.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROPONENTS WOULD FACE, IF SUCH

20:22.821 --> 20:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BILLS ARE ENACTED.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: YOU ALSO ARGUED

20:24.289 --> 20:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A RECENT OP-ED THAT IT

20:25.757 --> 20:26.892 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOULDN'T HAPPEN AS SORT OF A

20:26.892 --> 20:27.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BLUNT INSTRUMENT.

20:27.826 --> 20:28.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE COULD BE UNINTENDED

20:28.727 --> 20:29.962 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSEQUENCES.

20:29.962 --> 20:30.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, I THINK WE FORGET THAT FOR A

20:32.831 --> 20:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT OF CANDIDATES THEY HAVEN'T

20:34.066 --> 20:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

HIS TAXES.

20:39.638 --> 20:40.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE DISPUTES ABOUT WHETHER

20:40.572 --> 20:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANDIDATES' WIVES SHOULD

20:41.707 --> 20:43.041 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCLOSE THEIR TAX RETURNS.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN KERRY DIDN'T DISCLOSE HIS

AND THERE ARE DISPUTES HOW MANY

20:47.879 --> 20:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAX RETURNS SHOULD BE DISCLOSED.

30 TAX RETURNS.

20:52.017 --> 20:53.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN McCAIN AND MITT ROMNEY EACH

20:53.652 --> 20:56.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDED TO ONLY DISCLOSE TWO.

20:56.655 --> 20:57.623 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THERE ARE A LOT OF POLITICAL

20:57.623 --> 20:59.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGHTS WE'VE HAD ABOUT THIS AND

20:59.625 --> 21:00.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER THE YEARS IT'S SORT OF

21:00.525 --> 21:03.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EBBED AND FLOWED AND REACHED AN

21:03.362 --> 21:04.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EQUILIBRIUM WHERE WE EXPECT IT.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.064 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS

21:06.064 --> 21:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT MET THE

21:07.666 --> 21:09.668 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTATIONS OF MANY PEOPLE AND

21:09.668 --> 21:11.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT'S A QUESTION ABOUT

21:11.203 --> 21:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER OR NOT WE WANT TO CODIFY

21:12.471 --> 21:14.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IN TO A STATUTE FOR 2020

21:14.640 --> 21:15.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND GOING FORWARD.

21:15.540 --> 21:16.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: ARE THERE

21:16.174 --> 21:18.310 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER WAYS TO RESOLVE THIS AND

21:18.310 --> 21:20.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CREATE AN INCENTIVE FOR HIM OR

21:20.579 --> 21:22.881 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANYONE TO REVEAL THEIR TAXES?

21:22.881 --> 21:24.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THE POLITICAL PROCESS

21:24.816 --> 21:26.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS WHERE THAT USUALLY HAPPENS

21:26.084 --> 21:28.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THE POLITICAL PROCESS HAS

21:28.186 --> 21:28.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ITS LIMITATIONS.

21:28.987 --> 21:31.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN TRY TO ASK QUESTIONS OF

21:31.256 --> 21:32.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CANDIDATES.

21:32.491 --> 21:34.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN ASK AT TOWN HALL

21:34.793 --> 21:36.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEETINGS OR PUBLIC FORUMS.

21:36.762 --> 21:38.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN MEDIA SORT OF PRESS THE

21:38.397 --> 21:40.032 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISSUE, BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY

21:40.032 --> 21:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT IS REALLY LEFT TO THE VOTERS

21:40.966 --> 21:42.234 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DECIDE HOW MUCH IT MATTERS

21:42.234 --> 21:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, AND

21:43.769 --> 21:45.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEW JERSEY, I'M SURE IT HURT

21:45.671 --> 21:46.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MR. TRUMP.

21:46.438 --> 21:49.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IN PLACES LIKE THE MIDWEST,

21:49.074 --> 21:50.942 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT APPEARED THAT VOTERS DIDN'T

21:50.942 --> 21:52.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PARTICULARLY CARE.

21:52.077 --> 21:53.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE HAVE A POLITICAL PROCESS

21:53.879 --> 21:55.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WOULD ALLOW THIS TO PLAY

21:55.013 --> 21:55.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT.

21:55.681 --> 21:56.882 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAIN, MAYBE SOME PEOPLE ARE

21:56.882 --> 21:58.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST NOT AS HAPPY WITH HOW IT

21:58.817 --> 22:00.152 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PLAYED OUT IN 2016.

22:00.152 --> 22:00.852 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
