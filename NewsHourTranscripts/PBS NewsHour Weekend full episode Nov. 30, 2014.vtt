UNDERESTIMATION.

03:46.693 --> 03:48.228
AND TODAY MARKS THE OFFICIAL END

03:48.228 --> 03:49.963
OF WHAT'S BEEN A RELATIVELY

03:49.963 --> 03:51.665
MELLOW HURRICANE SEASON.

03:51.665 --> 03:53.400
IN FACT, IT'S BEEN A RECORD-

03:53.400 --> 03:55.168
BREAKING NINE YEARS SINCE A

03:55.168 --> 03:57.304
CATEGORY THREE OR STRONGER

03:57.304 --> 03:58.839
HURRICANE MADE LANDFALL ALONG

03:58.839 --> 04:01.141
THE U.S. COASTLINE.

04:01.141 --> 04:02.676
THAT WAS 2005 WHEN HURRICANES

04:02.676 --> 04:04.044
KATRINA AND WILMA HIT THE GULF

04:04.044 --> 04:06.446
COAST AND FLORIDA.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.048
METEOROLOGISTS DON'T COUNT

04:08.048 --> 04:09.483
SUPERSTORM SANDY, SINCE IT WAS

04:09.483 --> 04:10.784
NOT A HURRICANE WHEN IT MADE

04:10.784 --> 04:23.997
LANDFALL IN 2012.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.799
>> Stewart: EXPERTS EXPECT

04:25.799 --> 04:27.300
TOMORROW'S SO-CALLED CYBER

04:27.300 --> 04:28.502
MONDAY SALES TO SEE AN UPTICK

04:28.502 --> 04:29.970
OVER LAST YEAR.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.438
BUT WILL IT BE ENOUGH FOR

04:31.438 --> 04:32.506
BUSINESSES TO CONSIDER THE

04:32.506 --> 04:33.840
EXTENDED SHOPPING WEEKEND A

04:33.840 --> 04:34.875
SUCCESS?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.843
FOR SOME INSIGHT WE ARE JOINED

04:36.843 --> 04:38.178
NOW BY SHELLY BANJO OF THE "WALL

04:38.178 --> 04:40.347
STREET JOURNAL."

04:40.347 --> 04:41.781
SHELLY, LET'S JUST TALK ABOUT

04:41.781 --> 04:43.150
THE NUMBERS, THE SHEER NUMBERS.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.451
WHAT KIND OF SPENDING WENT ON

04:44.451 --> 04:45.452
AND WHEN DID IT HAPPEN GIVEN SO

04:45.452 --> 04:46.286
MANY STORES OPENED ON THURSDAY?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.387
>> SURE.

04:47.387 --> 04:48.555
SO WE'RE SEEING SPENDING ON-LINE

04:48.555 --> 04:50.524
SKYROCKET.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.791
JUST UP DOUBLE DIGITS, JUST THE

04:51.791 --> 04:53.293
SAME AS LAST YEAR.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.596
REALLY GOING ABOVE YEARS PAST.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.131
AND BOTH THANKSGIVING AND ON

04:58.131 --> 04:59.933
FRIDAY AND THROUGHOUT THE

04:59.933 --> 05:01.535
WEEKEND.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.969
DIFFERENT NUMBERS HAVE COME

05:02.969 --> 05:04.304
OUT VERSUS, YOU KNOW, HOW

05:04.304 --> 05:06.006
THE BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS

05:06.006 --> 05:07.274
HAVE FAIRED, BUT PRETTY MUCH ON

05:07.274 --> 05:08.842
PAR WITH LAST YEAR.

05:08.842 --> 05:09.943
>> Stewart: LET'S TALK ABOUT

05:09.943 --> 05:11.444
THAT BRICK AND MORTAR VERSUS

05:11.444 --> 05:12.879
ON-LINE DEBATE.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.080
FOR AWHILE IT SEEMED THAT BRICK

05:14.080 --> 05:15.215
AND MORTARS WERE A THING OF THE

05:15.215 --> 05:16.116
PAST, EVERYONE WAS SHOPPING ON-

05:16.116 --> 05:17.450
LINE, IS THAT THE CASE FOR THIS

05:17.450 --> 05:18.351
YEAR?

05:18.351 --> 05:19.519
>> I THINK THE ON-LINE PEOPLE

05:19.519 --> 05:21.054
DEFINITELY ARE SHOPPING MORE BUT

05:21.054 --> 05:21.955
PEOPLE STILL WENT OUT TO THE

05:21.955 --> 05:23.857
STORES.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.258
I WENT OUT TO I A WAL-MART ON

05:25.258 --> 05:26.293
THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER

05:26.293 --> 05:27.227
THANKSGIVING AND LINES WERE

05:27.227 --> 05:27.994
OUT THE DOOR SO MUCH THAT I

05:27.994 --> 05:28.795
COULDN'T EVEN GET IN.

05:28.795 --> 05:29.629
SO OBVIOUSLY THAT IS ANECDOTAL

05:29.629 --> 05:30.463
EVIDENCE.

05:30.463 --> 05:31.431
BUT YOU ARE DEFINITELY STILL

05:31.431 --> 05:32.532
SEEING PEOPLE SHOW UP AND GO

05:32.532 --> 05:34.467
THE TO STORES.

05:34.467 --> 05:35.802
>> Stewart: DID THE THURSDAY

05:35.802 --> 05:36.903
OPENINGS HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

05:36.903 --> 05:39.639
BLACK FRIDAY SALES ON SATURDAY

05:39.639 --> 05:41.174
>> I THINK IT JUST SHIFTS IT.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.442
SO I THINK WHAT IS STARTING TO

05:42.442 --> 05:43.410
HAPPEN IS YOU CAN'T REALLY JUST

05:43.410 --> 05:45.011
LOOK AT THE BLACK FRIDAY

05:45.011 --> 05:46.079
NUMBERS.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.514
BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE HAVING

05:47.514 --> 05:49.416
SALES ALL WEEK, ESPECIALLY ON

05:49.416 --> 05:50.917
MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,

05:50.917 --> 05:52.185
THURSDAY, YOU CAN'T JUST LOOK AT

05:52.185 --> 05:53.486
THE BLACK FRIDAY NUMBERS IN

05:53.486 --> 05:54.821
ISOLATION.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.523
>> Stewart: SO THIS HAS BECOME

05:56.523 --> 05:57.791
MORE OF A MARATHON RATHER THAN

05:57.791 --> 06:00.594
ACTUALLY A SPRINT ON FRIDAY.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.263
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.

06:03.263 --> 06:04.564
>> Stewart: SO INTERESTING.

06:04.564 --> 06:06.099
I WANT YOUR TAKE ON THE IDEA OF

06:06.099 --> 06:06.866
THE SORT OF PACKAGING OF THIS

06:06.866 --> 06:07.801
WEEKEND.

06:07.801 --> 06:08.902
AS YOU HAVE BLACK FRIDAY AND

06:08.902 --> 06:09.836
THEN SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY AND

06:09.836 --> 06:11.271
THEN TODAY IS GOOD SHOPPING

06:11.271 --> 06:12.305
SUNDAY WHERE SOME STORES ARE

06:12.305 --> 06:13.306
OFFERING A PERCENTAGE TO

06:13.306 --> 06:14.274
CHARITIES, AND TOMORROW IS

06:14.274 --> 06:17.477
CYBERMONDAY.

06:17.477 --> 06:18.612
IS THIS ACTUALLY REFLECT

06:18.612 --> 06:19.779
PEOPLE'S BEHAVIORS AND THEIR

06:19.779 --> 06:20.947
WANTS OR IS THIS JUST A

06:20.947 --> 06:21.982
MARKETING PLOY TO HAVE RETAILERS

06:21.982 --> 06:22.849
JUST CONTINUE TO HAVE PEOPLE

06:22.849 --> 06:23.850
FOCUSED ON SHOPPING.

06:23.850 --> 06:24.851
>> RIGHT, I THINK IT'S PROBABLY

06:24.851 --> 06:25.919
A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.287
I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE

06:27.287 --> 06:29.189
ARE COMING TO EXPECT DEALS.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.423
BUT I ASKED ONE OF THE WAL-MART

06:30.423 --> 06:31.591
EXECUTIVES THIS QUESTION AND HE

06:31.591 --> 06:33.226
SAID, YOU KNOW, LET'S JUST CALL

06:33.226 --> 06:34.327
IT NOVEMBER AT THIS POINT, YOU

06:34.327 --> 06:37.130
KNOW.

06:37.130 --> 06:38.665
BECAUSE IT'S LIKE EVERY SINGLE

06:38.665 --> 06:39.899
DAY THERE ARE SOME SORT OF

06:39.899 --> 06:41.668
SALES, MARKETING GIMMICK.

AND NOT ONLY SALES BUT ALSO

06:43.470 --> 06:45.005

06:45.005 --> 06:46.773
TO COME IN, GET AN EXTRA 10% OFF

06:46.773 --> 06:54.014
SO IT IS JUST ABOUT MESSAGING

06:54.014 --> 06:55.248
AND HAMMERING DOWN TO THE

06:55.248 --> 06:56.316
CONSUMERS, TO GET A DEAL TO COME

06:56.316 --> 06:57.584
IN THE STORES AND SHOPPING.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.785
>> Stewart: THERE IS ALSO AN

06:58.785 --> 06:59.886
INTERESTING STATISTIC OUT THERE

06:59.886 --> 07:01.021
THAT PEOPLE ARE SHOPPING FOR

07:01.021 --> 07:05.959
THEMSELVES INITIALLY.

07:05.959 --> 07:06.993
THAT THEY ARE SELF-GIFTING, IS

07:06.993 --> 07:07.994
THIS GOOD NEWS FOR THE ECONOMY,

07:07.994 --> 07:08.995
GOOD NEWS FOR THE SHOPPING

07:08.995 --> 07:10.030
SEASON OR IS IT JUST AN EFFECT

07:10.030 --> 07:11.131
OF THE ECONOMY THAT PEOPLE ARE

07:11.131 --> 07:12.399
WAITING TO BUY THINGS THEMSELVES

07:12.399 --> 07:13.400
SO THEY GO ON SALE?

07:13.400 --> 07:14.334
>> I THINK PEOPLE ARE ALL

07:14.334 --> 07:15.201
WAITING TO BUY THINGS FOR

07:15.201 --> 07:16.069
THEMSELVES TO GO ON SALE, THINGS

07:16.069 --> 07:17.170
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE LAPTOPS,

07:17.170 --> 07:20.907
TELEVISION, SEEING A TON OF

07:20.907 --> 07:22.175
CONSUMER ELECTRONICS THIS YEAR.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.376
WHICH IS RARE AND INTERESTING

07:23.376 --> 07:24.344
BECAUSE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

07:24.344 --> 07:25.412
HAVEN'T ACTUALLY BEEN DOING THAT

07:25.412 --> 07:27.013
WELL.

07:27.013 --> 07:28.248
SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

07:28.248 --> 07:29.182
BUYING THESE THINGS FOR

07:29.182 --> 07:29.983
THEMSELVES AND WAITING BECAUSE

07:29.983 --> 07:30.917
THEY KNOW THE DISCOUNT IS GOING

07:30.917 --> 07:31.851
TO COME TO YOU.

07:31.851 --> 07:32.585
>> Stewart: TRADITIONALLY, THERE

07:32.585 --> 07:33.320
IS A LULL AFTER THIS FIVE DAY

07:33.320 --> 07:34.054
PERIOD.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.021
WHAT IS THE FORECAST?

07:35.021 --> 07:36.456
>> I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A

07:36.456 --> 07:37.524
STRUGGLE FOR RETAILERS TO KEEP

07:37.524 --> 07:38.725
SHOPPERS COMING IN.

07:38.725 --> 07:40.160
THEY'VE GOT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS

07:40.160 --> 07:41.294
NOW UNTIL CHRISTMAS.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.729
AND THERE IS GENERALLY A HUGE

07:42.729 --> 07:43.763
BLACK FRIDAY WEEKEND AND THEN

07:43.763 --> 07:46.633
THE SATURDAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.600
AND IN BETWEEN, THAT'S WHEN

07:47.600 --> 07:48.635
THE REAL FIGHT IS GOING TO

07:48.635 --> 07:50.036
BE.

07:50.036 --> 07:50.970
>> Stewart: YOU SAID 10 AND 15%

07:50.970 --> 07:51.905
DOESN'T CUT IT ANY MORE?

07:51.905 --> 07:52.906
>> YEAH, YOU SEE THESE SIGNS

07:52.906 --> 07:53.940
NOW, 40% OFF, 50% OFF, IN

07:53.940 --> 07:56.376
OCTOBER.

07:56.376 --> 07:57.677
SO WHY AM I GOING TO BE EXCITED

07:57.677 --> 08:00.146
ABOUT 10 OR 15% AT A STORE?

08:00.146 --> 08:01.881
>> Stewart: SHELLY BANJO FROM

08:01.881 --> 08:03.016
"THE WALL STREET JOURNAL," THANK

08:03.016 --> 08:03.983
YOU FOR BEING WITH US.

08:03.983 --> 08:14.594
>> THANKS.

08:14.594 --> 08:15.895
>> Stewart: STUDENT DEBT IS

08:15.895 --> 08:16.996
SOMETHING MILLIONS OF AMERICANS

08:16.996 --> 08:18.164
LIVE WITH FOR YEARS, EVEN

08:18.164 --> 08:19.532
DECADES, AFTER THEY GRADUATE

08:19.532 --> 08:20.900
FROM COLLEGE.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.168
NOW, TWO OF THE NATION'S LARGEST

08:22.168 --> 08:23.436
PRIVATE STUDENT LENDERS ARE

08:23.436 --> 08:24.738
ROLLING OUT OPTIONS THAT WILL

08:24.738 --> 08:27.073
ALLOW BORROWERS TO MODIFY THE

08:27.073 --> 08:28.942
TERMS ON THEIR LOANS.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.978
FOR MORE ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE

08:31.978 --> 08:33.480
OF THIS, EARLIER HARI

08:33.480 --> 08:34.914
SREENIVASAN SAT DOWN WITH MARIAN

08:34.914 --> 08:37.951
WANG, A REPORTER WITH

08:37.951 --> 08:39.018
"PRO PUBLICA" AND ANNA MARIA

08:39.018 --> 08:39.919
ANDRIOTIS OF THE "WALL STREET

08:39.919 --> 08:41.354
JOURNAL."

08:41.354 --> 08:42.155
>> Sreenivasan: SO ANNAMARIA,

08:42.155 --> 08:45.458
LET ME START WITH YOU.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.359
EXPLAIN THE CHANGE, WHAT KINDS

08:46.359 --> 08:47.360
OF MODIFICATIONS ARE WE TALKING

08:47.360 --> 08:48.261
ABOUT?

08:48.261 --> 08:49.195
WHO DOES THIS APPLY TO?

08:49.195 --> 08:50.130
>> SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

08:50.130 --> 08:51.131
DECLINES IN THE INTEREST RATES

08:51.131 --> 08:52.365
THAT STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS ARE

08:52.365 --> 08:52.999
PAYING.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.000
AND THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CAME OUT

08:54.000 --> 08:55.101
OF WELLS FARGO THIS PAST WEEK.

08:55.101 --> 08:55.969
WELLS FARGO IS THE SECOND

08:55.969 --> 08:57.070
LARGEST PRIVATE STUDENT LENDER,

08:57.070 --> 08:58.772
AND WHAT THEY HAVE DECIDED TO

08:58.772 --> 09:00.140
START DOING IS TO LOWER THE

09:00.140 --> 09:01.875
MONTHLY PAYMENT BY ESSENTIALLY

09:01.875 --> 09:03.777
LOWERING THE INTEREST RATE TO AS

09:03.777 --> 09:04.944
LOW AS ONE PERCENT FOR

09:04.944 --> 09:07.647
BORROWERS.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.449
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE

09:09.449 --> 09:10.617
ACTUALLY MANY BORROWERS HAVE

09:10.617 --> 09:11.584
PRIVATE STUDENT LOANS WITH

09:11.584 --> 09:12.519
INTEREST RATES THAT ARE 10% OR

09:12.519 --> 09:14.287
HIGHER THAN THAT.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.722
SO WHAT THEY'RE STARTING TO SEE

09:15.722 --> 09:17.090
IS SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN WHAT

09:17.090 --> 09:18.358
THEY'RE PAYING MONTHLY.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.459
>> Sreenivasan: AND BANKS DIDN'T

09:19.459 --> 09:20.226
WANT TO DO THIS.

09:20.226 --> 09:20.994
WHY DID THEY GO FORWARD WITH

09:20.994 --> 09:21.928
THIS?

09:21.928 --> 09:23.463
>> THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT

09:23.463 --> 09:24.731
TURNAROUND, AND THERE'S A LOT OF

09:24.731 --> 09:25.465
DISCUSSION AS TO WHAT HAS LED TO

09:25.465 --> 09:26.466
IT.

09:26.466 --> 09:27.534
WHAT WE KNOW IS THAT OVER THE

09:27.534 --> 09:28.468
PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE

09:28.468 --> 09:29.569
CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION

09:29.569 --> 09:30.603
BUREAU HAS BEEN APPLYING A LOT

09:30.603 --> 09:31.805
OF PRESSURE ON PRIVATE LENDERS,

09:31.805 --> 09:33.573
BASICALLY TELLING THEM THAT THEY

09:33.573 --> 09:34.607
NEED TO START OFFERING REPAYMENT

09:34.607 --> 09:35.875
OPTIONS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE

09:35.875 --> 09:36.943
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFERS ON ITS

09:36.943 --> 09:41.047
LOANS.

09:41.047 --> 09:43.082
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFERS A

09:43.082 --> 09:45.418
LOT OF FLEXIBILITY FOR

09:45.418 --> 09:46.820
BORROWERS, IN PARTICULAR THOSE

09:46.820 --> 09:48.955
WHO DON'T HAVE HIGH SALARIES.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.890
SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF BACK

09:50.890 --> 09:52.325
AND FORTH BETWEEN THE C.F.P.B.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.427
AND PRIVATE LENDERS.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.728
IN ADDITION, FROM THE PRIVATE

09:55.728 --> 09:57.864
LENDER SIDE, WHAT WE HAVE

09:57.864 --> 09:59.566
STARTED HEARING IS THAT THERE

09:59.566 --> 10:01.000
HAVE BEEN A LOT OF INTERNAL

10:01.000 --> 10:02.302
DISCUSSIONS AT BANKS ABOUT HOW

10:02.302 --> 10:03.203
DO WE INCREASE LOAN REVENUE

10:03.203 --> 10:04.437
GOING FORWARD?

10:04.437 --> 10:06.072
IF WE ALIENATE STUDENT

10:06.072 --> 10:07.607
BORROWERS, PEOPLE WHO ARE RIGHT

10:07.607 --> 10:11.277
NOW IN THEIR 20S AND EARLY 30S,

10:11.277 --> 10:13.046
DOWN THE ROAD WHEN IT COMES TIME

10:13.046 --> 10:15.248
FOR THEM TO GET A MORTGAGE OR

10:15.248 --> 10:17.183
WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING TO

10:17.183 --> 10:19.652
ESTABLISH SOME TYPE OF BANKING

10:19.652 --> 10:20.987
RELATIONSHIP, WE MIGHT NOT GET

10:20.987 --> 10:22.455
THOSE BORROWERS.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.057
THEY MIGHT GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.024
>> Sreenivasan: RIGHT, RIGHT,

10:25.024 --> 10:26.025
RIGHT.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.060
SO MARIAN, PUT THIS POPULATION

10:27.060 --> 10:28.228
IN PERSPECTIVE FOR US, BECAUSE

10:28.228 --> 10:29.095
AS SHE MENTIONED, THE FEDERAL

10:29.095 --> 10:30.096
LOANS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DOING

10:30.096 --> 10:31.197
SOME OF THIS IN THE PAST.

10:31.197 --> 10:32.232
AND HOW MUCH CAN AN AVERAGE KIND

10:32.232 --> 10:34.467
OF BORROWER SAVE IF THEY QUALIFY

10:34.467 --> 10:36.569
FOR THIS MODIFICATION, DO YOU

10:36.569 --> 10:38.071
THINK?

10:38.071 --> 10:39.939
>> WELL, JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE

10:39.939 --> 10:42.242
MORE CONTEXT, THE POOL OF

10:42.242 --> 10:43.676
PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN BORROWERS

10:43.676 --> 10:45.044
IS VASTLY OUTNUMBERED BY THE

10:45.044 --> 10:46.145
POOL OF FEDERAL STUDENT LOAN

10:46.145 --> 10:46.980
BORROWERS.

10:46.980 --> 10:47.680
AND THE FEDS ORIGINATE A VAST

10:47.680 --> 10:50.016
MAJORITY OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT.

10:50.016 --> 10:51.651
AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT

10:51.651 --> 10:53.019
THE FEDS HAVE FOR A LONG TIME

10:53.019 --> 10:55.054
OFFERED INCOME-BASED REPAYMENT

10:55.054 --> 10:56.723
PLANS, THINGS THAT WILL HELP YOU

10:56.723 --> 10:57.924
SORT OF SCALE YOUR MONTHLY

10:57.924 --> 11:00.293
PAYMENTS TO SOMETHING THAT'S

11:00.293 --> 11:01.661
REASONABLE FOR YOU IF YOU

11:01.661 --> 11:02.762
QUALIFY FOR THOSE PROGRAMS.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.030
>> Sreenivasan: RIGHT.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.565
SO IS THERE AN IDEA, IS THERE

11:05.565 --> 11:06.666
KIND OF A BENCHMARK THAT THEY

11:06.666 --> 11:08.301
KNOW ABOUT WHAT INCOME LEVEL

11:08.301 --> 11:10.136
THIS IS GOING TO HIT SOMEONE AT,

11:10.136 --> 11:11.104
AND IF THEY GO FROM 10% TO ONE

11:11.104 --> 11:12.405
PERCENT, THAT'S OBVIOUSLY A

11:12.405 --> 11:13.439
SIGNIFICANT SAVING, BUT IT ALSO,

11:13.439 --> 11:14.574
I GUESS, DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH

11:14.574 --> 11:15.742
THEY HAVE IN DEBT, RIGHT?

11:15.742 --> 11:17.577
>> SURE, SO WHAT WELLS FARGO, AT

11:17.577 --> 11:19.045
LEAST, HAS SAID IS IT'S GOING TO

11:19.045 --> 11:20.313
LOOK AT THEIR OVERALL DEBT BY

11:20.313 --> 11:21.581
LOOKING AT THE BORROWERS CREDIT

11:21.581 --> 11:23.383
REPORTS AND THEY'RE LOOKING AT

11:23.383 --> 11:25.485
THEIR INCOME, AND THEY'RE HOPING

11:25.485 --> 11:26.719
TO COME TO SOMETHING LIKE A

11:26.719 --> 11:28.421
MONTHLY PAYMENT THAT EQUALS

11:28.421 --> 11:30.757
ABOUT 10 TO 15% OF THEIR INCOME.

11:30.757 --> 11:32.592
NOW, WHAT'S ALSO INTERESTING IS

11:32.592 --> 11:34.527
THAT DISCOVER, WHICH IS THE

11:34.527 --> 11:36.362
THIRD LARGEST PRIVATE STUDENT

11:36.362 --> 11:37.997
LENDER IN THE COUNTRY, IS ALSO

11:37.997 --> 11:39.532
PLANNING ON ROLLING OUT LOAN

11:39.532 --> 11:40.967
MODIFICATIONS EARLY NEXT YEAR.

11:40.967 --> 11:42.535
WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THEM IS

11:42.535 --> 11:44.304
THERE ARE POTENTIALLY EVEN MORE

11:44.304 --> 11:45.271
SIGNIFICANT BREAKS THAT ARE

11:45.271 --> 11:47.006
BEING CONSIDERED.

11:47.006 --> 11:48.541
FOR INSTANCE, LOAN FORGIVENESS,

11:48.541 --> 11:49.976
WHICH IS SOMETHING TOTALLY

11:49.976 --> 11:51.177
UNHEARD OF THAT A PRIVATE LENDER

11:51.177 --> 11:52.345
WOULD HAVE NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED

11:52.345 --> 11:54.447
UP UNTIL RECENTLY.

11:54.447 --> 11:55.682
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT

11:55.682 --> 11:57.083
THAT PRIVATE STUDENT BORROWERS,

11:57.083 --> 11:58.351
THOUGH DEALING WITH A LOT OF

11:58.351 --> 11:59.586
DIFFICULTIES, AS MARIAN POINTED

11:59.586 --> 12:01.054
OUT, ARE A SMALL SHARE OF THE

12:01.054 --> 12:03.256
OVERALL BORROWERS OUT THERE.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.958
SO PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN DEBT

12:04.958 --> 12:05.892
ACCOUNTS FOR ABOUT EIGHT PERCENT

12:05.892 --> 12:11.698
OF OUTSTANDING STUDENT LOANS.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.967
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF BACK AND

12:13.967 --> 12:16.169
FORTH BETWEEN LENDERS AND THE

12:16.169 --> 12:18.037
C.F.P.B. LENDERS ARE SAYING, WHY

12:18.037 --> 12:19.739
ARE YOU PICKING ON US WHEN THE

12:19.739 --> 12:21.341
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTS FOR

12:21.341 --> 12:25.244
THE MAJORITY OF THAT OUT THERE.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.646
>> Sreenivasan: ALL RIGHT, SO

12:26.646 --> 12:28.081
MARIAN, WHAT ABOUT THE ROLE THAT

12:28.081 --> 12:29.582
PARENTS PLAY IN THIS?

12:29.582 --> 12:30.617
A LOT OF PARENTS TAKE OUT

12:30.617 --> 12:32.251
PRIVATE PERSONAL LOANS ON TOP OF

12:32.251 --> 12:33.586
WHATEVER THE FINANCIAL AID

12:33.586 --> 12:34.854
PACKAGE IS THAT THE UNIVERSITY

12:34.854 --> 12:35.722
CAN GIVE, RIGHT?

12:35.722 --> 12:36.990
>> WELL, YEAH, AND THERE'S

12:36.990 --> 12:38.324
ACTUALLY A FEDERAL PROGRAM

12:38.324 --> 12:39.425
THAT'S SPECIFICALLY GEARED AT

12:39.425 --> 12:40.593
PARENTS THAT I DID A REPORT ON A

12:40.593 --> 12:41.828
COUPLE YEARS AGO.

12:41.828 --> 12:42.996
IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE FEDERAL

12:42.996 --> 12:44.464
STUDENT LOANS TO STUDENTS IN

12:44.464 --> 12:46.132
PARTICULAR ARE CAPPED AT A

12:46.132 --> 12:47.700
CERTAIN LEVEL.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.202
YOU CAN ONLY BORROW SO MUCH IN A

12:49.202 --> 12:50.937
YEAR.

12:50.937 --> 12:53.106
AND SO, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF

12:53.106 --> 12:54.207
UNDERWRITING AND THAT'S WHY

12:54.207 --> 12:55.742
THERE'S A CAP.

12:55.742 --> 12:57.644
THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM FOR

12:57.644 --> 12:59.145
BORROWING SPECIFICALLY GEARED

12:59.145 --> 13:00.246
TOWARD PARENTS, ACTUALLY IT'S

13:00.246 --> 13:01.948
CALLED THE PARENT PLUS PROGRAM,

13:01.948 --> 13:03.116
AND THAT'S AN INTERESTING

13:03.116 --> 13:03.950
PROGRAM BECAUSE THOSE PROGRAMS

13:03.950 --> 13:04.684
AREN'T CAPPED.

13:04.684 --> 13:05.585
YOU CAN TAKE AS MUCH OUT AS YOU

13:05.585 --> 13:07.253
NEED.

13:07.253 --> 13:08.521
THERE'S VERY LIMITED

13:08.521 --> 13:09.756
UNDERWRITING FOR THOSE LOANS.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.424
AND THAT PROGRAM IS INTERESTING

13:11.424 --> 13:12.692
BECAUSE YOU SEE A LOT OF THE

13:12.692 --> 13:13.693
FINANCIAL STRAIN THAT FAMILIES

13:13.693 --> 13:14.560
FACE THROUGH THAT PROGRAM

13:14.560 --> 13:15.862
BECAUSE IT'S NOT CAPPED.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.096

13:17.096 --> 13:17.964

13:17.964 --> 13:19.265

13:19.265 --> 13:22.568
PROGRAM OVER TIME.

13:22.568 --> 13:23.403

13:23.403 --> 13:24.737
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

13:24.737 --> 13:25.938

13:25.938 --> 13:27.240
LOANS THROUGH THE PARENT PLUS

13:27.240 --> 13:28.741
PROGRAM AT GREATER RISK FOR

13:28.741 --> 13:29.976

13:29.976 --> 13:31.310
PARENT MAY NOT HAVE A STEADY

13:31.310 --> 13:32.412
INCOME COMING IN BUT THEY STILL

13:32.412 --> 13:33.780
QUALIFY TO TAKE OUT A HUGE LOAN

13:33.780 --> 13:34.781
TO GET THEIR KIDS THROUGH

13:34.781 --> 13:36.816
SCHOOL.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.785
>> ABSOLUTELY.

13:38.785 --> 13:39.986
THAT'S SOMETHING WE LOOKED AT.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.187
THERE'S VERY LIMITED

13:41.187 --> 13:42.422
UNDERWRITING WHERE THEY DON'T

13:42.422 --> 13:43.956
LOOK AT YOUR DEBT-TO-INCOME

13:43.956 --> 13:45.291
RATIO, LIKE A PRIVATE LENDER

13:45.291 --> 13:46.759
WOULD.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.027
AND THEY CAN TAKE OUT VAST

13:48.027 --> 13:50.163
AMOUNTS OF MONEY, AS MUCH AS

13:50.163 --> 13:51.831
THEY NEED, ESSENTIALLY, TO HELP

13:51.831 --> 13:53.032
THEIR KID OUT, AND A LOT OF

13:53.032 --> 13:56.002
PARENTS DO.

13:56.002 --> 13:57.103
THAT'S ABSOLUTELY A THING THAT

13:57.103 --> 13:58.337
PARENTS CAN GET OVEREXTENDED IN

13:58.337 --> 14:00.973
DOING SO.

14:00.973 --> 14:02.175
>> Sreenivasan: AND WHAT ABOUT

14:02.175 --> 14:04.243
THE ROLES THAT COLLEGES AND

14:04.243 --> 14:06.079
UNIVERSITIES PLAY IN THIS TOO?

14:06.079 --> 14:07.180
I MEAN, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

14:07.180 --> 14:07.947
THAT MUCH TRANSPARENCY IN

14:07.947 --> 14:08.981
FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE

14:08.981 --> 14:09.882
FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE IS AND WHY

14:09.882 --> 14:10.950
ONCE STUDENT GOT THIS MUCH AND

14:10.950 --> 14:12.485
ANOTHER STUDENT GOT THIS MUCH,

14:12.485 --> 14:13.486
WHEN PERHAPS THEIR PARENTS MADE

14:13.486 --> 14:14.754
THE SAME, RIGHT?

14:14.754 --> 14:16.255
>> WELL, WHAT'S PLAYING OUT, THE

14:16.255 --> 14:17.623
REASON WHY WE'RE SEEING MORE

14:17.623 --> 14:18.658
BORROWERS, MORE STUDENTS COME

14:18.658 --> 14:19.859
OUT OF SCHOOL WITH MORE DEBT IS

14:19.859 --> 14:20.960
BECAUSE COLLEGE TUITION COSTS

14:20.960 --> 14:22.462
KEEP RISING, RIGHT?

14:22.462 --> 14:24.097
AND WHAT BECOME VERY CONFUSING

14:24.097 --> 14:25.531
FOR FAMILIES IS WHEN FINANCIAL

14:25.531 --> 14:27.500
AID PACKAGES GO OUT TO STUDENTS.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.869
AND MOST SCHOOLS, WHAT THEY DO

14:29.869 --> 14:31.738
IS THEY INCLUDE STUDENT LOANS AS

14:31.738 --> 14:34.040
PART OF THE FINANCIAL AID

14:34.040 --> 14:36.409
PACKAGE, FEDERAL STUDENT LOANS,

14:36.409 --> 14:38.444
THAT IS, BUT ONE WOULD ARGUE IS

14:38.444 --> 14:39.746
TO HOW MUCH OF AID IS A STUDENT

14:39.746 --> 14:40.980
LOAN WHEN A STUDENT LOAN IS

14:40.980 --> 14:43.549
SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO PAY BACK.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.551
IT'S NOT LIKE GRANTS OR

14:45.551 --> 14:47.019
SCHOLARSHIPS, FOR EXAMPLE.

14:47.019 --> 14:48.121
SO COLLEGES FOR SURE DO PLAY A

14:48.121 --> 14:49.455
LARGE ROLE HERE.

14:49.455 --> 14:51.157
AND THERE'S BEEN THIS ONGOING

14:51.157 --> 14:52.725
DEBATE ABOUT WHY SHOULD, FOR

14:52.725 --> 14:53.960
INSTANCE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

14:53.960 --> 14:54.827
KEEP GIVING OUT MORE AND MORE

14:54.827 --> 14:57.363
AID?

14:57.363 --> 14:58.831
IT'S ESSENTIALLY INCENTIVIZING

14:58.831 --> 15:00.600
THE COLLEGES TO CONTINUE

15:00.600 --> 15:01.801
INCREASING THEIR TUITION BECAUSE

15:01.801 --> 15:03.536
THEY'RE SAYING, WELL, THE

15:03.536 --> 15:04.904
MONEY'S GOT TO COME FROM

15:04.904 --> 15:05.805
SOMEWHERE, SOMEONE'S GOING TO

15:05.805 --> 15:06.506
PAY FOR IT.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.040
>> Sreenivasan: RIGHT.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.675
>> AND TO YOUR QUESTION, TOO, I

15:09.675 --> 15:11.110
THINK ABSOLUTELY, SCHOOLS NEED

15:11.110 --> 15:12.812
TO BE BROUGHT INTO THIS.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.013
SCHOOLS HAVE THEIR OWN POT OF

15:14.013 --> 15:15.548
FINANCIAL AID, ESSENTIALLY.

15:15.548 --> 15:16.949
AND THERE'S A STICKER PRICE, BUT

15:16.949 --> 15:18.851
THEY DISCOUNT IT HEAVILY

15:18.851 --> 15:20.253
DEPENDING ON WHAT KIND OF

15:20.253 --> 15:21.621
STUDENT YOU ARE.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.922
AND SO THEY HAVE YOUR FINANCIAL

15:22.922 --> 15:24.157
INFORMATION AND THEY ARE

15:24.157 --> 15:25.057
ESSENTIALLY MONEYBALLING

15:25.057 --> 15:26.125
FINANCIAL AID THESE DAYS.

15:26.125 --> 15:27.260
>> Sreenivasan: EXPLAIN THAT.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.261
>> THERE'S A WHOLE INDUSTRY

15:28.261 --> 15:30.396
CALLED ENROLLMENT MANAGEMENT.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.598
THERE DIDN'T USED TO BE

15:32.598 --> 15:34.767
ENROLLMENT MANAGERS AT SCHOOLS,

15:34.767 --> 15:36.569
YOU KNOW, TWO DECADES AGO.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.371
BUT THAT'S A POSITION THAT'S

15:38.371 --> 15:40.006
SORT OF BEEN CREATED,

15:40.006 --> 15:41.107
ESSENTIALLY TO USE DATA, TO

15:41.107 --> 15:42.275
REALLY CREATE DETAILED STUDENT

15:42.275 --> 15:43.242
PROFILES AND DO WHAT THEY CALL,

15:43.242 --> 15:44.076
THIS IS ALL JARGON, BUT IT'S

15:44.076 --> 15:45.244
FINANCIAL AID LEVERAGING.

15:45.244 --> 15:46.846
HOW DOES THE SCHOOL GET THE

15:46.846 --> 15:48.314
BIGGEST BANG FOR ITS FINANCIAL

15:48.314 --> 15:50.449
AID DOLLAR?

15:50.449 --> 15:51.851
AND SOMETIMES THAT MEANS THEY'RE

15:51.851 --> 15:53.319
ESSENTIALLY PICKING STUDENTS

15:53.319 --> 15:54.687
THAT THEY ARE OK HAVING OVER-

15:54.687 --> 15:56.622
BORROW, VERSUS STUDENTS WHOM

15:56.622 --> 15:57.890
THEY REALLY WANT AND WILL

15:57.890 --> 15:59.158
GENERALLY TRY TO PROTECT FROM

15:59.158 --> 16:00.526
HAVING TO BORROW.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.461
AND SO THEY'RE TRYING TO

16:02.461 --> 16:06.465
INCENTIVIZE CERTAIN STUDENTS

16:06.465 --> 16:09.101
COMING AND CERTAIN STUDENTS THEY

16:09.101 --> 16:11.003
CARE LESS ABOUT AND THEY'RE MORE

16:11.003 --> 16:12.705
COMFORTABLE, HONESTLY PACKAGING

16:12.705 --> 16:14.607
A STUDENT LOAN IN THAT FINANCIAL

16:14.607 --> 16:16.409
AID PACKAGE.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.877
AND THAT'S A DECISION THAT

16:17.877 --> 16:19.078
SCHOOLS ARE MAKING, PICKING

16:19.078 --> 16:20.446
WHICH STUDENTS ESSENTIALLY GET

16:20.446 --> 16:21.647
MORE, AND WHICH STUDENTS WILL

16:21.647 --> 16:23.683
HAVE TO BORROW MORE.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.117
AND I THINK THAT SHOULD

16:25.117 --> 16:26.886
DEFINITELY BE PUT ON SCHOOLS.

16:26.886 --> 16:28.321
THE OTHER THING I THINK IS

16:28.321 --> 16:29.889
REALLY IMPORTANT TO BRING UP IS

16:29.889 --> 16:31.090
THAT IT'S ON SCHOOLS TO MAKE

16:31.090 --> 16:32.191
SURE THAT KIDS ARE GRADUATING ON

16:32.191 --> 16:34.026
TIME WITH A MEANINGFUL DEGREE.

16:34.026 --> 16:35.862
AND THE SUREST WAY TO GET IN

16:35.862 --> 16:37.530
OVER YOUR HEAD WITH STUDENT DEBT

16:37.530 --> 16:38.998
IS TO DROP OUT AND HAVE DEBT FOR

16:38.998 --> 16:39.832
COLLEGE AND NOTHING TO SHOW FOR

16:39.832 --> 16:44.503
IT.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.339
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT CREDENTIAL.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.440
YOU DON'T HAVE THAT HIGHER

16:47.440 --> 16:48.875
EARNING POWER.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.009
THAT'S A HUGE SOURCE OF DEBT,

16:50.009 --> 16:50.877
AND THAT'S REALLY A TERRIBLE

16:50.877 --> 16:51.844
SITUATION FOR A STUDENT TO BE

16:51.844 --> 16:53.112
IN.

16:53.112 --> 16:54.080
THE OTHER THING IS GRADUATING ON

16:54.080 --> 16:55.848
TIME.

16:55.848 --> 16:56.849
IT'S A SURE WAY TO GET MORE DEBT

16:56.849 --> 16:57.917
IF YOU STAY SIX YEARS VERSUS

16:57.917 --> 16:58.784
