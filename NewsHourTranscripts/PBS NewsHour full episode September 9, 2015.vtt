17:26.279 --> 17:25.945
Welcome.

17:27.413 --> 17:27.346
DAVID O'SULLIVAN, European Union

17:40.593 --> 17:41.761
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: I think it's e

17:43.229 --> 17:46.132
I mean, you need to understand,
that this is basically a proposa

17:47.600 --> 17:51.270

18:03.416 --> 18:06.118
It's clear that these companies,
efforts though they have made --

18:07.586 --> 18:11.190
and Greek people have been extre
in their reaction -- it is more

18:21.233 --> 18:24.971
But this is not the only action
proposed, of course. We're also

But, as your report has shown, t
there is at breaking point, and

18:39.986 --> 18:42.188
of the push that the internation
will also need to address.

18:43.289 --> 18:44.623
GWEN IFILL: A lot at the breakin
emotions.

18:45.391 --> 18:45.191
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: Indeed.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.695
GWEN IFILL: I want to talk about
though, because you're saying th

18:50.696 --> 18:52.565
that's where you begin, not wher
end.

18:54.033 --> 18:58.671
And you're talking about enforci

19:02.241 --> 19:02.241
DAVID O'SULLIVAN: Indeed.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.178
Well, this would be adopted as E

19:16.989 --> 19:21.727

in decent conditions.

19:42.882 --> 19:46.085
I emphasize this is not to be co
conflated with the more general

hundreds of thousands of people

We are looking at the origins of

We're looking at...

seem like it took the E.U. so lo

I don't think it has taken us ve

21:49.375 --> 21:50.109
the interim.

21:51.577 --> 21:54.680
Why is the situation becoming so
I think there are two reasons. O

21:56.148 --> 21:59.785
breakdown of law and order in Li
allowed it to become a transit s

22:01.253 --> 22:06.058
any control over the exit of ref
into the hands of smugglers. And

22:07.526 --> 22:11.964
as I think your very interesting
heartrending report from the cam

22:13.432 --> 22:19.405
showed, the Syrian refugees are
four or five years in camps in L

22:20.105 --> 22:21.407
Jordan, and in Turkey.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.944
Those countries are doing their
a country like Lebanon, as we kn

22:26.412 --> 22:30.883
own problems, and to be asked to
one million or more refugees is

22:32.351 --> 22:36.822
you can ask of them. So then the
for these refugees have become i

22:38.290 --> 22:41.093
difficult. And, of course, they
and anxious to try and escape to

22:41.961 --> 22:42.294
life, which they hoped for in Eu

22:43.762 --> 22:46.565
GWEN IFILL: And, finally, is the
responsibility that goes beyond

22:48.033 --> 22:54.039
We saw today the U.S. was talkin
settlers being allowed here. Are

22:55.474 --> 22:57.009

more than they could be doing?

22:58.477 --> 22:59.712

I think the Gulf states, the Ara

a global problem. The E.U. is no

23:12.191 --> 23:15.494
to shirk its responsibilities. I
will step up to the plate and do

23:16.328 --> 23:16.762
and more than what is needed.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.166
But, frankly, the dimension of t
is such that we will need a glob

23:22.501 --> 23:23.769
as indeed the secretary-general
Nations has called for.

do it by veto or whether he is a

Would that throw a monkey wrench
either on the Iranian or on the

29:54.493 --> 29:58.296
And one vote that the president
was Ben Cardin, senator from Mar

29:59.765 --> 30:02.868
Democrat on the Foreign Relation
And one of his big concerns is t

30:04.336 --> 30:08.473
that it's going to free up for t
which he says are sure to be spe

30:09.341 --> 30:11.777
foment greater terrorism in the

What do you say to that? What co
do about that?

30:15.981 --> 30:17.716
WILLIAM BURNS: Well, I think, fi
say there are risks in any optio

30:19.184 --> 30:21.386
pursue with regard to the Irania
issue, and there are honest conc

30:22.254 --> 30:24.022
as those that Senator Cardin has

30:25.490 --> 30:29.127
The truth is that it's only a su
$140 billion that the Iranians w

30:30.595 --> 30:33.398
have access to that's not alread
whether it's to long-term projec

30:34.866 --> 30:37.569
Chinese or others, so it's maybe
or $55 billion. That's still an

30:38.070 --> 30:38.904
of money.

30:40.372 --> 30:42.741
And some of that money surely is
go to the kind of purposes the I

30:44.209 --> 30:49.114
demonstrated before, whether it'
for proxies in the region or eff

30:50.582 --> 30:54.519
other parts of the Middle East.
in the end that it's going to ha

30:55.987 --> 31:00.826
determinative effect on, you kno
the Iranians continue to pursue

31:02.294 --> 31:05.263
And, as I said before, there is
we and others can do to push bac

31:05.997 --> 31:06.665
that behavior over time.

31:07.666 --> 31:08.066
MARGARET WARNER: And more than w
now?

31:08.934 --> 31:09.401
WILLIAM BURNS: I think that's tr

MARGARET WARNER: Now, do you exp

you expect them to try to cheat,

31:19.311 --> 31:20.645
violate around the edges the act

31:22.114 --> 31:26.151
WILLIAM BURNS: Well, I think the
you know, any areas of ambiguity

31:27.619 --> 31:30.756
perceive, which is why I think i
to be very important, especially

31:32.224 --> 31:34.426
months, the first year of implem
that we and our partners are qui

31:35.293 --> 31:36.061
in the execution of this agreeme

31:37.529 --> 31:39.397
MARGARET WARNER: Now, when you s
they will test it, do you think

big fires have become the norm,

46:31.656 --> 46:34.291
the demands for firefighters and
resources.

46:35.159 --> 46:38.829
MAN: Evacuation levels are at le

CAROL CONNOLLY, Northwest Intera

46:57.715 --> 47:01.952
to mobilize and get our resource
they're needed as quickly as the

47:08.426 --> 47:13.464
everything, from camp supplies t

47:14.565 --> 47:16.734
fire crews, known as hotshots, a
in demand.

47:18.202 --> 47:21.572
CAROL CONNOLLY: We were told abo
week of August from our national

47:23.040 --> 47:26.143
we're not getting any more resou
we have inside our boundaries, t

47:27.611 --> 47:30.514
were getting. So that's when we
and we borrow crews. And two fir

47:31.982 --> 47:34.585
close together, one incident com
talk to the other and say, hey,

47:36.053 --> 47:38.956
of your hotshot crews for an ope
to do a burnout. And so they wil

47:39.957 --> 47:41.058
over and help, and send them bac
day.

47:42.526 --> 47:45.229
CAT WISE: In fact, the wildfire
Central Washington has been so i

47:46.330 --> 47:51.235

asked to.

47:52.703 --> 47:56.707
About 300 heavy equipment operat
special training so they could w

47:58.175 --> 48:01.979

program, the first of its kind f

48:03.147 --> 48:05.850
to enlist hundreds of locals wan
firefighters.

48:07.318 --> 48:10.688
One of those offering to help wa

firefighters protecting my nativ
look at all the people on the fr

48:27.238 --> 48:29.874
and they're doing their work, an
what really goes on behind the s

48:31.342 --> 48:33.778
that's kind of what I am taking
this, is that every link in a ch

48:51.796 --> 48:56.333
bad fire season in 2008. Costena
from Victoria, says he has a ver

48:57.501 --> 48:59.236
reason for wanting to help the f

49:00.704 --> 49:04.742
JOHN COSTENARO: In 2009, Victori
the Black Saturday fires, very s

49:06.210 --> 49:10.548
the worst in our history. And we
come over and assist us during t

49:12.016 --> 49:14.885
And I wanted to repay that favor
I -- they came to my hometown an

49:15.452 --> 49:15.586
a great deal.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.294

JOHN COSTENARO: The friendliness
Americans have shown me and my c

49:28.098 --> 49:30.568
is overwhelming. It's quite -- p
hands with you in the street, an

49:32.036 --> 49:33.838
you, and understanding you have
another country, and it's very a

49:34.939 --> 49:36.574
to be felt welcome in another co

49:53.324 --> 49:56.560
infamous Santa Ana winds start p

sense of service that she would

51:50.474 --> 51:55.079
TIM EWART: The queen's first sto
