WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On this
Independence Day, many Americans
will no doubt be enjoying a

00:03.733 --> 00:05.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beer or two.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of the essential
ingredients in beer is yeast.

00:07.633 --> 00:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for 600 years, only two
species of yeast, ale yeast
and lager yeast, have been used

00:13.366 --> 00:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for traditional brewing.

00:15.366 --> 00:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now a lab in North Carolina
may have found a third species,
and they found it in the

00:19.300 --> 00:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strangest of places,
on bees and wasps.

00:22.766 --> 00:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" science
producer Nsikan Akpan
and our "ScienceScope"
team reveal what the buzz

00:27.500 --> 00:29.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is all about.

00:29.500 --> 00:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: It feels like
beer brewers will do anything
to spice up their booze.

00:35.433 --> 00:38.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's pizza beer, banana
split chocolate stout, beer
with squid ink, and, of course,

00:40.433 --> 00:44.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Rocky Mountain oyster
stout, which is flavored
with bull testicles.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this fuss seems silly, when
the foundation of alcohol's
flavor is plain old yeast.

00:49.866 --> 00:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yeast, these little
microbes that take sugars
and ferment them into
alcohol, define a beer's

00:54.833 --> 00:57.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
character.

00:57.400 --> 01:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, for 10,000 years,
beers have essentially
relied on two types of
bland yeast that basically

01:00.766 --> 01:02.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
add no flavors.

01:02.800 --> 01:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a lab in North Carolina
has discovered a new yeast
species that produces an array

01:07.100 --> 01:09.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of flavors without
added ingredients.

01:09.866 --> 01:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where did they find it?

01:10.933 --> 01:14.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
On bees.

01:14.933 --> 01:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The story of bumblebeer
begins at North Carolina
State University, in
the lab of Rob Dunn.

01:24.900 --> 01:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once a tropical forest
ecologist, Dunn now explores the
jungle that surrounds us, the

01:29.400 --> 01:31.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one filled with
bugs and microbes.

01:31.400 --> 01:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB DUNN, North Carolina State
University: At some point,
my lab shifted to focusing

01:34.166 --> 01:38.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more on people's daily
lives, and that includes
food, and it includes
thinking about the biology

01:38.866 --> 01:41.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of food.

01:41.333 --> 01:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: One day three
years ago, a colleague
inquired if the lab
knew of any microbes in

01:44.600 --> 01:48.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the environment
capable of making beer.

01:48.300 --> 01:52.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dunn and company instantly
considered insect pollinators,
like bees and wasps.

01:52.966 --> 01:54.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's why.

01:54.900 --> 01:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yeast hang out in flower
nectar, where the microbes feast
on the boatloads of sugar.

01:58.766 --> 02:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They then produce or ferment
sweet aromas, which then
attract the buzzing bugs.

02:03.766 --> 02:08.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROB DUNN: We actually
think, based on some
work from colleagues in
Italy, that it's very

02:10.700 --> 02:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely that those first beers
and breads were relying on
yeasts from insects, too.

02:13.100 --> 02:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Back then, a bug
carrying a fermenting yeast
may have fallen into some

02:17.300 --> 02:18.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wet grain.

02:18.533 --> 02:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, boom, welcome
to the booze cruise.

02:20.800 --> 02:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, some scientists argue
human agriculture started just
to mass produce grains to make

02:26.266 --> 02:27.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beer.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The more beer we drink, the
more yeast we have to grow.

02:30.100 --> 02:34.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB DUNN: Unambiguously,
the most successful organism
in the world is yeast.

02:34.766 --> 02:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if you think about all
of the yeasts we make everywhere
for many of the products

02:38.933 --> 02:40.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we make, they won.

02:40.933 --> 02:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: But, today, where
would you even start looking
for a new beer-making yeast?

02:45.233 --> 02:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN, North Carolina
State University: Part of this
is science, and part of this

02:48.566 --> 02:50.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
feels more like an art
that's hard to describe.

02:50.966 --> 02:54.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Meet Anne Madden,
the Dunn lab's microbe wrangler.

02:54.733 --> 02:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To search for unknown yeast,
she started by catching a
wild bee and a wild wasp.

03:01.400 --> 03:04.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She then transferred
every microbe from their
bodies to a petri dish.

03:04.400 --> 03:05.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't fret.

03:05.633 --> 03:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She didn't commit
mass bug-icide.

03:07.600 --> 03:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN: To make bumblebeer
and all of the different
bumblebeers that we have made

03:11.300 --> 03:13.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since, we have killed two bugs.

03:13.733 --> 03:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have likely killed more
bugs on your way to a bar to get
beer than we did in the process

03:18.633 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of making it.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: A couple
days later, a forest of
microbes appear on the dish.

03:23.766 --> 03:27.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then, in four steps,
Madden combines her
senses with technology.

03:27.700 --> 03:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, she looks to separate the
yeast from bacteria or fungi.

03:31.733 --> 03:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN: It's about
understanding when something
glistens in a certain way.

03:35.566 --> 03:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Next, she picks
a handful of yeast candidates,
grows them on a new dish,

03:40.066 --> 03:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then follows her nose.

03:42.100 --> 03:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN: You can smell
the same smell both on that
plate and in that final beer.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Her third task
is running the DNA from these
candidates through a national

03:50.533 --> 03:53.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
database to ensure her
picks don't cause disease.

03:53.500 --> 03:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN: It's almost like
a Google search through all
other species that exist that

03:59.266 --> 04:01.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been documented.

04:01.466 --> 04:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The final step
is a chemical test, because
despite the long history of

04:04.433 --> 04:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brewing, the genes and enzymes
responsible for fermentation
are largely unknown.

04:10.866 --> 04:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The survivors of this gauntlet
land with John Sheppard at N.C.

04:13.533 --> 04:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
State's research brew house.

04:16.166 --> 04:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SHEPPARD, North
Carolina State University:
In traditional beers that
are lighter in character,

04:19.433 --> 04:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the traditional
American lager, for
example, you don't want to
overwhelm your taste, and

04:26.133 --> 04:29.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so what the yeast does
is very important.

04:29.500 --> 04:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of wild yeasts, which
are considered contamination
in a normal brewing process,

04:36.500 --> 04:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the reason why they're not
wanted is because they produce
a lot of off-flavors that are

04:39.866 --> 04:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not really desirable
in the beer.

04:42.133 --> 04:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to get a wild yeast
that doesn't produce these
off-flavors can be difficult.

04:49.100 --> 04:52.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we did a little testing
to see whether or not the
yeast strains would be able to

04:53.266 --> 04:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make beer, and we selected one.

04:56.033 --> 05:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It came from a wasp, because
this special yeast not only
makes ethanol, but makes acid,

05:02.766 --> 05:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, as a result of that,
we had a natural sour beer.

05:07.466 --> 05:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The bumblebeer
yeast makes other flavors too,
like a sweet honey taste without

05:12.166 --> 05:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the addition of actual honey.

05:13.866 --> 05:17.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Craft sour beers often take
months or years to make.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bumblebeer yeast can do the
same in a matter of weeks.

05:20.666 --> 05:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Local brewers have taken notice.

05:22.566 --> 05:27.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The first suds made with
bumblebeer yeast rolled
out earlier this year.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Until next time, I'm
Nsikan Akpan, and this
is "ScienceScope" from
the "PBS NewsHour."

05:32.366 --> 05:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Nsikan tasted
one of those beers and said
that it was quite delicious.

05:36.466 --> 05:41.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can read about how
scientists are using
this discovery to find
more beer-producing

05:41.200 --> 05:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
yeasts made in the wild.

05:43.366 --> 05:46.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.
