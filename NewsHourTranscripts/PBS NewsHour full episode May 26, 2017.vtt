HARI SREENIVASAN: Good evening.

00:05.572 --> 00:06.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

00:06.573 --> 00:08.308 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:08.341 --> 00:11.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

Gunmen in Egypt
attack a Christian group making
their way

00:11.745 --> 00:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a monastery, killing at least
28 members
of the targeted religious
minority.

00:16.916 --> 00:21.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead this Friday, Judy
Woodruff sits
down for an exclusive interview
with American

00:21.388 --> 00:26.593 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aya Hijazi and her husband,
charity workers
released from an Egyptian prison
after three

00:26.626 --> 00:28.428 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years.

00:28.461 --> 00:31.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI, Released Charity
Worker: It was
actually in the cage where the
judge acquitted

00:31.798 --> 00:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
us all, and it was -- it was
unbelievable.

00:36.002 --> 00:39.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, we prayed for it so much,
but we thought
it's far-reaching.

00:39.773 --> 00:43.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And President
Trump meets
with world leaders in Sicily for
his first

00:43.977 --> 00:45.111 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
G7 summit.

00:45.145 --> 00:49.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We wrap up the events of Trump's
first foreign
trip.

00:49.149 --> 00:51.017 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's Friday.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
give their take
on this week's news and the
president's first

00:54.888 --> 00:55.955 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
tour abroad.

00:55.989 --> 01:02.896 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:02.929 --> 01:05.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.732 --> 01:15.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Once again
tonight, Coptic
Christians in Egypt are under
attack.

01:15.241 --> 01:19.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This time, gunmen blasted a bus
packed with
men, women and children.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.248 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner has the story.

01:22.282 --> 01:27.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Hours after the
attack, the
bus sat on an unpaved desert
road.

01:27.887 --> 01:33.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shattered windows and blood
stains bore witness
to the ferocious assault.

01:33.460 --> 01:37.163 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Survivors told of being
overtaken by eight
to 10 gunmen in SUVs.

01:37.197 --> 01:39.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION (on camera): How many
people were
on the bus?

01:39.732 --> 01:41.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): We
were 40 people,
including children, in the bus.

01:41.634 --> 01:45.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION (through translator):
What did the
attackers look like?

01:45.105 --> 01:46.239 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): They
were masked.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
QUESTION (through translator):
What were they
wearing?

01:47.674 --> 01:49.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): Like
military
uniforms.

01:49.609 --> 01:54.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: It happened on
an isolated
road in Minya province, south of
Cairo.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Coptic Christians were on
their way to
a monastery.

01:57.817 --> 02:02.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Health Ministry says many of
the dead
and wounded were children.

02:02.555 --> 02:07.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was the latest in a series
of attacks
on Egypt's embattled Christian
minority since

02:07.560 --> 02:09.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
late last year.

02:09.496 --> 02:12.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Those claimed more than 75
lives.

02:12.265 --> 02:17.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the Islamic State group
claimed responsibility
for those earlier incidents.

02:17.337 --> 02:21.307 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In December, the main Coptic
cathedral in
Cairo was bombed.

02:21.341 --> 02:27.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then on Palm Sunday came twin
suicide attacks
on churches in Alexandria and
Tanta.

02:27.780 --> 02:32.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After that, Egyptian President
Abdel Fattah
El-Sisi declared a three-month
nationwide

02:32.385 --> 02:34.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state of emergency.

02:34.287 --> 02:36.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI, Egyptian
President (through
translator): I won't say those
who fell are

02:36.456 --> 02:37.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Christian or Muslim.

02:37.557 --> 02:39.259 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I will say that they're
Egyptian.

02:39.292 --> 02:43.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: The pope,
visiting Egypt
weeks later, condemned the
violence against

02:43.229 --> 02:45.031 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Copts.

02:45.064 --> 02:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
POPE FRANCIS, Leader of Catholic
Church (through
translator): God, the lover of
life, never

02:49.035 --> 02:50.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ceases to love man.

02:50.770 --> 02:55.909 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is essential that we reject
any absolutizing
that would justify violence, for
violence

02:55.942 --> 02:58.945 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
is the negation of every
authentic religious
expression.

02:58.978 --> 03:03.583 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Coptic
Christians make up
about 10 percent of Egypt's
population of

03:03.616 --> 03:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
93 million people, and they have
long been
a target for Islamist radicals.

03:07.754 --> 03:14.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2013, they largely supported
then-General
El-Sisi when he ousted the
Muslim Brotherhood

03:14.627 --> 03:16.996 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from power.

03:17.030 --> 03:21.501 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In return, he pledged to protect
the Christian
minority.

03:21.534 --> 03:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now Christians say El-Sisi has
failed to make
good on his promise, as his
government confronts

03:27.006 --> 03:29.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
an Islamist insurgency.

03:29.175 --> 03:34.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NPR reporter Jane Arraf, in
Cairo, said Christians
don't complain about El-Sisi
publicly.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JANE ARRAF, NPR: They don't want
to criticize
him.

03:36.783 --> 03:41.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know that's the case
because, after
these attacks, in hospitals in
Minya, where

03:41.821 --> 03:48.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people gathered to gather their
dead and comfort
the wounded, there were
protests, but the

03:48.194 --> 03:50.597 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
protests were against the attack
itself.

03:50.630 --> 03:52.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They weren't against the
government.

03:52.432 --> 03:56.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: And on a
day-to-day basis,
Christians must be ever more
watchful and

03:56.803 --> 04:02.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
circumspect about practicing
their religion,
fearing violence from terrorists
or their

04:02.775 --> 04:04.477 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
own Muslim neighbors.

04:04.510 --> 04:07.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JANE ARRAF: In one place,
Christians were
attacked and their houses burned
after they

04:07.814 --> 04:11.985 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gathered to pray for victims of
a suicide
bombing on Palm Sunday.

04:12.018 --> 04:15.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when I asked villagers there
what's the
problem you have with
Christians, they said,

04:15.888 --> 04:16.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we don't have a problem.

04:16.956 --> 04:18.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They just can't build churches.

04:19.025 --> 04:24.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's really very unsettled
for them in
places like that, and they're
not sure who

04:24.264 --> 04:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to turn to, to be perfectly
honest.

04:26.099 --> 04:31.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Today, as
family members
mourn the latest victims,
Egyptian jets struck

04:31.337 --> 04:33.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
militant bases in Eastern Libya.

04:33.973 --> 04:39.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And El-Sisi appealed to
President Trump to
take the lead in fighting
terrorism.

04:39.379 --> 04:42.582 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

04:42.615 --> 04:47.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This evening
at the G7 summit
in Sicily, President Trump
condemned the attack

04:47.353 --> 04:49.055 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Egypt.

04:49.088 --> 04:54.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He blamed what he called evil
organizations
of terror with a thuggish
ideology.

04:54.093 --> 04:58.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: An
activist group
reports U.S. coalition
airstrikes in Eastern

04:58.097 --> 05:01.134 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Syria killed more than 100
people overnight.

05:01.167 --> 05:05.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That word comes from the Syrian
Observatory
for Human Rights, based in
Britain.

05:05.505 --> 05:09.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It says the strikes hit a town
held by Islamic
State fighters.

05:09.108 --> 05:12.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Children and other relatives of
the militants
were among the victims.

05:12.812 --> 05:17.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Police in Manchester, England,
have made two
more arrests in the concert
bombing that killed

05:17.950 --> 05:19.686 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
22 people.

05:19.719 --> 05:24.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say they now have nine
people in custody,
including several they call key
players.

05:24.691 --> 05:28.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators also raided new
locations today,
and the police chief said that's
likely to

05:28.061 --> 05:29.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
continue through the weekend.

05:29.896 --> 05:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
IAN HOPKINS, Greater Manchester
Chief Constable:
We have hundreds of officers
that are working

05:32.665 --> 05:37.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on this investigation from
across the national
counterterrorism policing
network.

05:37.470 --> 05:42.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have seized thousands of
exhibits that
are now being assessed.

05:42.108 --> 05:45.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's fair to say that
there's been
enormous progress with the
investigation.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.880 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's still an awful lot of
work to do.

05:47.914 --> 05:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also today,
Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson said the
U.S. government

05:51.918 --> 05:57.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
takes full responsibility for
information
in the case that leaked to news
organizations.

05:57.357 --> 06:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Sri Lanka, monsoon rains
triggered floods
and mudslides today, killing 91
people.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.997 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At least 110 others are missing.

06:05.031 --> 06:10.036 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Swollen rivers washed over roads
and houses,
and 2,000 people were forced to
evacuate.

06:10.069 --> 06:13.940 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 60,000 have been
affected by the
rain.

06:13.973 --> 06:18.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, Hillary
Clinton delivered
a searing critique of President
Trump's policies

06:18.311 --> 06:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in a commencement address.

06:20.079 --> 06:23.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She spoke at her alma mater,
Wellesley College
in Massachusetts.

06:23.549 --> 06:28.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Without naming the president
directly, she
branded his budget an attack of
unimaginable

06:28.521 --> 06:30.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cruelty against the most
vulnerable.

06:30.923 --> 06:34.627 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She also charged there's a
full-fledged assault
on truth and reason.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, Former
U.S. Secretary
of State: When people in power
invent their

06:38.898 --> 06:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own facts and attack those who
question them,
it can mark the beginning of the
end of a

06:48.408 --> 06:50.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
free society.

06:50.176 --> 06:53.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Vice President
Pence also
addressed a graduation ceremony
at the Naval

06:53.179 --> 06:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.

06:55.481 --> 07:00.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told the 1,000 graduates the
era of budget
cuts of the armed forces is
over.

07:00.686 --> 07:06.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIKE PENCE, Vice President of
the United States:
We will not relent until we
rebuild our military,

07:06.092 --> 07:11.731 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
restore the arsenal of
democracy, and ensure
that our soldiers, sailors,
airmen, Marines,

07:11.764 --> 07:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Coast Guard have all the
resources that
you need to accomplish your
mission and come

07:17.804 --> 07:19.672 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
home safe.

07:19.705 --> 07:23.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
already signed
into law a large increase in
defense spending,

07:23.443 --> 07:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and he's calling for major new
outlays in
his budget.

07:26.646 --> 07:31.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president's son-in-law,
Jared Kushner,
says he will cooperate with an
FBI investigation

07:31.350 --> 07:34.520 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into ties between campaign aides
and Russia.

07:34.554 --> 07:36.522 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's according to a statement
from his lawyer.

07:36.556 --> 07:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
News accounts say the focus is
on Kushner's
meetings with Russian officials
in December.

07:41.494 --> 07:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say it doesn't mean he is
suspected of
a crime.

07:45.798 --> 07:50.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Greg Gianforte is
headed to Congress
from Montana, despite being
charged with assault.

07:50.736 --> 07:55.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He beat Democrat Rob Quist by
six points in
yesterday's special election for
the state's

07:55.107 --> 07:56.876 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
only U.S. House seat.

07:56.909 --> 08:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In his victory speech, Gianforte
apologized
for his altercation with a
reporter the night

08:01.714 --> 08:03.082 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
before.

08:03.115 --> 08:06.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GREG GIANFORTE (R), Montana
Congressman-Elect:
I made a mistake.

08:06.285 --> 08:10.723 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I took an action that I
can't take back.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.959 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm not proud of what
happened.

08:12.992 --> 08:18.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I shouldn't have responded in
the way that
I did, and, for that, I'm sorry.

08:19.031 --> 08:23.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not the person that I am,
and it's
not the way I will lead in this
state.

08:23.803 --> 08:27.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Trump cheered
the election result today,
telling reporters

08:27.406 --> 08:29.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- quote -- "Great win in
Montana."

08:29.075 --> 08:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Wall Street went quietly
into the Memorial
Day weekend.

08:32.445 --> 08:35.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost two
points to close at 21080 today.

08:35.915 --> 08:39.352 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose about five
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 edged up a fraction.

08:39.385 --> 08:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, the Dow and the
S&amp;P gained more
than 1 percent.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.092 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 2 percent.

08:46.125 --> 08:51.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
an exclusive
interview with Aya Hijazi, freed
after spending

08:51.063 --> 08:56.969 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
three years in an Egyptian
prison; what President
Trump accomplished on his first
trip abroad;

08:57.003 --> 09:04.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and David Brooks
analyze a full
week of news; and much more.

09:04.277 --> 09:15.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to Judy's
exclusive
interview with Aya Hijazi, the
Egyptian-American

09:15.955 --> 09:21.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aid worker released last month
from prison
in Egypt, along with her
husband, Mohamed

09:21.627 --> 09:23.029 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hassanein.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The 30-year-old Hijazi grew up
in the Washington
area and in Egypt.

09:26.799 --> 09:32.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In 2013, she and Mohamed founded
the Belady
Foundation, the goal, to help
impoverished

09:32.405 --> 09:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
street children in Cairo.

09:34.473 --> 09:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But they soon found themselves
in prison,
falsely accused of horrendous
crimes and the

09:39.679 --> 09:45.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subjects of international
efforts, including
by Presidents Trump and Obama,
to gain their

09:45.284 --> 09:46.385 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
release.

09:46.419 --> 09:48.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy spoke with Aya and Mohamed
earlier this
week.

09:48.487 --> 09:54.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The calm, mundane
routine of
daily life is something new and
special again

09:55.027 --> 09:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for Aya Hijazi and her husband,
Mohamed Hassanein.

09:59.098 --> 10:04.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The apartment they just moved
into outside
Washington is still sparsely
furnished, but

10:04.670 --> 10:10.576 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's a place to call their own,
and it's a
world away from the Egyptian
jail cells and

10:10.610 --> 10:15.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
crowded courtroom cages they
were kept in
for three years.

10:15.147 --> 10:20.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They had met in Tahrir Square in
the heady
days after Egypt's 2011
revolution.

10:20.353 --> 10:26.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI, Released Charity
Worker: Initially,
it seemed like the political
climate to allow

10:26.492 --> 10:28.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for political change.

10:28.361 --> 10:33.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But by 2013,
after the military
deposed the Muslim Brotherhood
government,

10:33.899 --> 10:35.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the picture darkened.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.570 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They looked to build a little
light.

10:37.603 --> 10:43.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: And so it seemed
like the only
venue to actually do change and
give hope

10:43.342 --> 10:48.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not be -- not vilify or be
vilified is
to work on humanitarian causes
that no other

10:48.848 --> 10:51.651 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
two people could differ on,
like, say, children.

10:51.684 --> 10:53.853 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Who would want a child to sleep
in the streets?

10:53.886 --> 10:59.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In an Orwellian
twist, the
organization they founded to
help those children

10:59.425 --> 11:04.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would lead to heinous unfounded
charges of
child abuse and human
trafficking.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: We still don't
really know what
happened.

11:06.832 --> 11:10.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, we know the picture, but
we don't not
why or how.

11:10.236 --> 11:14.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The kids started to love us and
really tell
each other about our
organization.

11:14.607 --> 11:20.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And everything was going on
smoothly, until
one day supposedly a father came
looking for

11:20.379 --> 11:27.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his son, whom we have never seen
and the children
have never seen, and we went
with him to file

11:27.787 --> 11:33.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a police report, because he was
quite abusive
with us and the NGO and the
children.

11:33.526 --> 11:37.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And instead of us filing a
report, we found
that we are charged with human
trafficking.

11:37.663 --> 11:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, there had
been no indication
before that of a problem?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AYA HIJAZI: No.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And were you
immediately taken
into custody?

11:44.203 --> 11:46.439 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: Yes, from that day
on.

11:46.472 --> 11:48.941 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How did you deal
with it?

11:48.974 --> 11:52.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You were separated pretty
immediately, is
that right?

11:52.111 --> 11:53.079 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AYA HIJAZI: Yes.

11:53.112 --> 11:54.613 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

11:54.647 --> 12:00.286 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we couldn't contact anyone,
but the word
got through very, very quickly.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so lawyers came, but they
weren't ours.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They were just volunteers.

12:05.091 --> 12:09.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I just thought that,
immediately, when
I talk to a prosecutor or a
judge, we will

12:09.361 --> 12:13.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be released within a day or a
few days.

12:13.199 --> 12:15.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it went on for three years.

12:15.868 --> 12:21.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Three years
shuttled from different
prisons to court appearances,
the newly married

12:21.807 --> 12:25.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
couple seeing each other only
fleetingly.

12:25.444 --> 12:29.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much were you able to be in
contact with
each other during the time you
were held?

12:29.281 --> 12:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: It was very hard to
get letters
across, through our families.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our families would visit us,
exchange letters.

12:36.522 --> 12:40.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Other than that, we would wait
for court sessions
to meet.

12:40.760 --> 12:45.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, it's like, a total of 18
months, we saw
each other only three times and
maybe only

12:45.131 --> 12:46.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for a minute, or less even.

12:46.732 --> 12:48.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tell me about
your experience.

12:48.467 --> 12:54.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: I wasn't tortured in
prison or
beaten or even -- I didn't
receive abusive

12:54.774 --> 12:56.442 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
words.

12:56.475 --> 13:00.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was very hard for me that I
was placed
with regular crimes.

13:00.146 --> 13:04.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, I wasn't even classified
inside the
prison as political prisoners.

13:04.383 --> 13:09.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I was like the charges were
very heinous,
like raping children.

13:09.522 --> 13:12.358 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so it was very hard just
coping with that.

13:12.391 --> 13:16.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMED HASSANEIN, Released
Charity Worker
(through translator): Prison
itself is against

13:16.562 --> 13:18.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
human nature.

13:18.430 --> 13:22.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The idea of prison is that it
takes away from
the person's humanity and the
person's ideas.

13:22.568 --> 13:27.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But if the person was able to
keep his or
her core ideas and humanity,
then the person

13:27.072 --> 13:28.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
has won.

13:28.874 --> 13:33.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Aya taught
herself French and
Spanish while in prison and she
learned to

13:33.779 --> 13:35.514 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
draw.

13:35.548 --> 13:40.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She showed me one pencil sketch
that reflected
what she said was her own
experience.

13:40.219 --> 13:41.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where are you in this drawing?

13:41.320 --> 13:45.558 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: I find myself in a
lot of those.

13:45.591 --> 13:50.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, I find myself here, like,
all right,
come, I'm ready to go to prison
just to prove

13:50.729 --> 13:52.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my point.

13:52.531 --> 13:56.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I find myself here looking at
the window,
seeing the streets and wishing
that I could

13:56.836 --> 13:58.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be part of it one day again.

13:58.737 --> 14:02.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is it true that
most of the
people in Egypt don't know
what's going on

14:02.675 --> 14:04.143 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inside prison?

14:04.176 --> 14:09.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: Yes, prisons are
largely a closed
place, and we suffered that.

14:09.615 --> 14:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: While they
endured, unbeknownst
to them, Aya and Mohamed had
many advocates

14:15.454 --> 14:18.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on the outside, and many in high
places.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.259 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCO RUBIO (R), Florida: I
would like to
raise the case of
Egyptian-American citizen

14:22.828 --> 14:24.597 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Aya Hijazi.

14:24.630 --> 14:28.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Were you aware
that President
Obama was trying to get you out
of prison?

14:28.467 --> 14:33.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: I know that the
administration
towards the end was involved and
did a lot.

14:33.405 --> 14:37.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was towards the end of our
imprisonment
and towards the end of their
administration

14:37.276 --> 14:42.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they have -- and I have to
give credit
where credit is due, so I am
thankful to them.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, that
happened.

14:43.816 --> 14:46.118 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then a new president comes
into office.

14:46.151 --> 14:50.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And how did you hear that he was
working on
this?

14:50.256 --> 14:53.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what we saw was, he said
something to
President El-Sisi.

14:53.158 --> 14:54.960 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, how did you hear about all
this?

14:54.994 --> 15:02.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: So, in Egypt, we --
in the prison,
we got to see some newspapers.

15:02.701 --> 15:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so Trump was saying that
they shouldn't
be discussing human rights
issues publicly.

15:10.342 --> 15:13.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed like it's being
discussed, but behind
closed doors.

15:13.412 --> 15:19.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then how did
you learn
that something might happen,
that you might

15:19.752 --> 15:21.587 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be freed?

15:21.620 --> 15:25.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: So, we knew that
there was American
interest, but up until the last
day, we had

15:25.891 --> 15:29.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no idea how it will go, until
the day of the
acquittal.

15:29.695 --> 15:30.663 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a surprise.

15:30.696 --> 15:31.664 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Until the final
day?

15:31.697 --> 15:32.665 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AYA HIJAZI: Yes.

15:32.698 --> 15:33.899 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, how did you
learn?

15:33.933 --> 15:35.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What -- how did you learn?

15:35.768 --> 15:44.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: It was actually in
the cage where
the judge acquitted us all, and
it was -- it

15:44.443 --> 15:46.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was unbelievable.

15:46.245 --> 15:50.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Like, we prayed for it so much,
but we thought
it's far-reaching, like the best
that could

15:50.616 --> 15:52.084 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be done is a pardon.

15:52.117 --> 15:54.119 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we were really hoping we
wouldn't reach
that.

15:54.153 --> 15:55.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it was a surprise.

15:56.021 --> 15:59.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You literally had
no preparation
for when you were -- the judge
told you, OK,

15:59.591 --> 16:00.559 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you are acquitted.

16:00.592 --> 16:01.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AYA HIJAZI: Yes.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.797 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We didn't know that he would say
acquitted,
in a sense.

16:04.830 --> 16:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was like the best moment of
our lives,
all of us.

16:07.566 --> 16:12.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That moment just
six weeks
ago came after President Trump's
meeting in

16:12.671 --> 16:17.242 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Washington with Egypt's
President Abdel Fattah
El-Sisi.

16:17.276 --> 16:22.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump has made a point of
befriending
Sisi and has been highly
complimentary of

16:22.214 --> 16:25.784 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him, following years of strained
relations
with the Obama administration.

16:25.818 --> 16:29.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
And I just want to say to you,
Mr. President,

16:29.388 --> 16:33.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that you have a great friend and
ally in the
United States and in me.

16:33.492 --> 16:38.931 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Aya's view of Mr.
Trump's praise
of the Egyptian leader are
complicated.

16:38.964 --> 16:46.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: This is difficult
for me, because
I don't share his view on Mr.
Sisi.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I could differ with Mr. Trump.

16:49.408 --> 16:56.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I would like to actually
direct this to
Mr. Sisi, if he listens.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't just us who were
imprisoned, unjustly
imprisoned.

16:59.918 --> 17:05.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Mr. Sisi had a role, or
if -- I would
tell you, Mr. Sisi, if you had a
role then,

17:05.691 --> 17:09.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then that's good, but there are
thousands
and thousands of wrongly
imprisoned people.

17:09.995 --> 17:14.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Almost
immediately upon her
release, a U.S. government plane
whisked Aya

17:14.833 --> 17:21.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Mohamed to the United
States, where Aya
soon sat with the president in
the Oval Office,

17:21.673 --> 17:26.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the same chair in which
President Sisi had
sat a few weeks earlier.

17:26.245 --> 17:32.951 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: We are happy to
have Aya back
home, and it's a great honor to
have her in

17:32.985 --> 17:34.219 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Oval Office.

17:34.253 --> 17:36.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How was your
meeting with President
Trump?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.425 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AYA HIJAZI: He was very
hospitable.

17:39.458 --> 17:43.429 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He made us feel very welcome,
and he admired
our strength.

17:43.462 --> 17:45.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I work for the children.

17:45.264 --> 17:46.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, I was glad.

17:46.498 --> 17:48.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What did he ask
you?

17:48.700 --> 17:53.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: Oh, one of the
questions he asked
was about the time of my arrest.

17:53.405 --> 17:58.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he like -- I'm not sure, but
it seemed
like he had this idea that -- or
a conviction

17:58.043 --> 17:59.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that it was at the time of the
Muslim Brotherhood.

17:59.878 --> 18:01.580 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Which was before
President
El-Sisi.

18:01.613 --> 18:03.115 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: Which was before
Sisi.

18:03.148 --> 18:05.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, he was like, "So was your
arrest -- be
at the time of the Brotherhood?"

18:05.150 --> 18:06.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I said, no.

18:06.552 --> 18:09.755 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then he said, "Oh, it was at
the time
of Sisi."

18:09.788 --> 18:12.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he was taken aback.

18:12.691 --> 18:14.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It seemed, like, different to
what he had
in mind.

18:14.593 --> 18:18.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is there a
contradiction between
President Trump working to get
you released

18:18.664 --> 18:25.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, on the other hand, praising
the government
of Egypt which was holding you
in prison?

18:25.537 --> 18:35.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: I think he's trying
to be effective,
because he even said it to me
while we met,

18:35.547 --> 18:40.552 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that, well, that he was
effective, wasn't
he?

18:40.586 --> 18:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I don't know how to say no.

18:44.857 --> 18:49.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is the traditional way
of just, like,
mere criticism, very sharp
criticism, and

18:49.661 --> 18:51.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is the more diplomatic
way, perhaps.

18:51.697 --> 18:58.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think that
maybe, in
your conversation with him and
in his learning

18:58.604 --> 19:04.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about your experience, that
maybe he's -- you
have adjusted his thinking about
human rights?

19:04.676 --> 19:06.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Or what do you think about that?

19:06.879 --> 19:14.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: I hope he gets to
know that the
human rights situation is really
horrible

19:15.020 --> 19:21.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at that time, and people are not
just -- it's
not just for fighting terrorism,
because people

19:21.994 --> 19:25.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are unjustly held, and there are
so many fabricated
cases.

19:25.497 --> 19:27.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They are illegitimately held.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are both of you
optimistic
that things are going to get
better in Egypt?

19:30.502 --> 19:33.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMED HASSANEIN (through
translator): Worry
and optimism are different
things.

19:33.705 --> 19:37.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very normal to be worried,
but it's not
normal to live out hope.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.011 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And we're also hopeful.

19:39.044 --> 19:40.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I'm worried.

19:40.412 --> 19:44.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you want
for Egypt,
for the people of Egypt?

19:44.082 --> 19:45.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you want for them?

19:45.484 --> 19:48.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: We want what we call
-- some may
call American values.

19:48.987 --> 19:55.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would like to think of them as
universal
values, humanity, number one, a
good governed

19:55.127 --> 20:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state where people can express
themselves,
where they can freely assemble,
where they

20:00.799 --> 20:02.601 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can live in harmony and peace.

20:02.634 --> 20:05.070 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democracy is not a bad word to
describe that.

20:05.103 --> 20:06.805 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you believe
that time is
coming?

20:06.838 --> 20:12.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AYA HIJAZI: We have to believe
until the very
last day we die.

20:12.945 --> 20:18.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, if we want to be parents
-- we're
not parents yet -- and we want
to see something

20:18.417 --> 20:20.185 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
good for future generations.

20:20.219 --> 20:31.630 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So either we say we have given
you a better
world, or we die trying.

20:31.663 --> 20:38.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: President
Trump spent the
last full day of his first and
lengthy overseas

20:38.503 --> 20:42.574 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trip in Sicily today at a
meeting of the so-called
G7 countries.

20:42.608 --> 20:47.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It ended a week that took him
from Saudi Arabia,
to Israel and the West Bank, to
the Vatican,

20:47.679 --> 20:51.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and yesterday to the Brussels
headquarters
of the European Union and NATO.

20:51.416 --> 20:55.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I spoke a short time ago with
Bloomberg News
White House correspondent
Margaret Talev in

20:55.554 --> 21:00.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Taormina, Sicily, and asked her
if President
Trump tried to convey central
messages to

21:00.492 --> 21:01.560 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
world leaders.

21:01.593 --> 21:04.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARGARET TALEV, Bloomberg News:
There sure
were.

21:04.062 --> 21:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say, in the Middle East,
it was the
idea that President Trump is
uniquely qualified

21:08.433 --> 21:12.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to restart the Mideast peace
process by kind
of shifting the focus a little
bit away from

21:12.838 --> 21:18.710 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
that traditional
Israeli-Palestinian dynamic
to this broader idea of Israelis
and Muslim

21:18.744 --> 21:22.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Arab nations having a lot in
common in
a desire to fight terrorism.

21:22.648 --> 21:23.849 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's one big message.

21:23.882 --> 21:25.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In Europe, the message really
was different.

21:25.917 --> 21:31.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was sort of bringing
President Trump's
campaign promises about kind of
resetting

21:31.857 --> 21:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expectations for NATO countries,
paying what
he would call their fair share,
rebalancing

21:39.164 --> 21:43.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trade and how Europe and the
United States
think about trade with one
another, the idea

21:43.802 --> 21:47.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of reciprocal trade agreements,
if you make
this tough for me, I will make
this tough

21:47.939 --> 21:49.107 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
for you.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.110 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those were a lot of those
messages in Western
Europe.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.547 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, so, I think what you saw
pretty much
follows.

21:55.580 --> 22:03.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was a very warm welcome in
the Middle East,
and a much sort of more
skeptical, sometimes

22:03.955 --> 22:07.659 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
critical reception in at NATO
and the G7.

22:07.693 --> 22:10.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tell us about
a little bit
about those reactions from world
leaders,

22:10.162 --> 22:11.930 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at least on the European side.

22:11.963 --> 22:17.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET TALEV: Yes, I mean, the
visit with
the pope, of course, it was sort
of how President

22:17.302 --> 22:19.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump kicked off his arrival in
Europe.

22:19.938 --> 22:26.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we know, from the last
year's campaign,
how many differences of opinion
the two men

22:26.611 --> 22:28.413 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
have.

22:28.447 --> 22:34.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so both of their teams sort
of made clear
from the outset that this was an
attempt for

22:34.553 --> 22:39.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
each to preserve a channel to
talk with one
another, but that they weren't
going to be

22:39.591 --> 22:41.860 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
necessarily on the same page
about everything.

22:41.893 --> 22:46.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump's reaction,
ebullient, joyous,
great honor, love it, grinning
ear to ear.

22:46.998 --> 22:53.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Pope Francis' demeanor, much
more reserved,
and a lot of sort of reading on
the tea leaves

22:53.205 --> 22:54.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the body language on that
front.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We will see where that
relationship goes.

22:56.842 --> 23:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, from there, the move over
to NATO, the
Western allies in NATO had sort
of boxed him

23:03.915 --> 23:08.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in to try to force his
commitment, for him
to restate a commitment to NATO
by having

23:08.820 --> 23:14.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him attend this unveiling of an
Article 5
memorial.

23:14.159 --> 23:20.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Trump was willing
to be led
to the water to a point, but to
choose his

23:20.198 --> 23:25.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wording carefully in terms of
reaffirming
his commitment to Article 5
without saying,

23:25.337 --> 23:28.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and I'm in it forever no matter
what, you
know, whatever you need.

23:28.273 --> 23:30.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That wasn't the message.

23:30.175 --> 23:35.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The message was very much,
Article 5, we appreciate
that it was invoked for the U.S.
after 9/11,

23:36.014 --> 23:42.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but for NATO to work long-term,
there needs
to be a stepping up of financial
contributions.

23:42.687 --> 23:46.291 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That was -- the NATO leaders
have already
agreed to that.

23:46.324 --> 23:48.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There have been plans made three
years ago.

23:48.293 --> 23:50.095 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was always on track to be
stepped up.

23:50.128 --> 23:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of those leaders really
bristled at
the idea that President Trump
was trying to

23:53.999 --> 23:57.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say this was all because of him
and some bad
feelings there.

23:57.235 --> 24:02.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, as you moved over to
the G7, two
big issues rolling into the
final day of the

24:02.707 --> 24:08.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
summit that have emerged as
fairly predictable
stumbling blocks again are
climate change

24:08.313 --> 24:10.048 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and trade.

24:10.081 --> 24:15.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Angela Merkel, the German
leader, telling
folks after day one's session
that all of

24:15.520 --> 24:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the other leaders of the G7 were
unanimous
in pressing the president of the
United States

24:21.593 --> 24:25.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to stay with Paris and to get
sort of with
their program.

24:25.197 --> 24:30.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gary Cohn, the president's
economic adviser,
preserving the space for
President Trump perhaps

24:30.402 --> 24:35.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to stay in the Paris talks, to
show that he's
listening to European leaders,
but leaving

24:35.774 --> 24:40.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a little bit of room to do that
at his own
pace and under his own terms,
and saying,

24:40.812 --> 24:42.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
look, I want to get this right.

24:42.047 --> 24:45.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm going to take my time,
meaning not necessarily
here.

24:45.917 --> 24:51.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then on trade, again, we're
expecting
months, if not longer, of kind
of a shift

24:51.990 --> 24:57.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in discussions about what the
future of U.S.
and European trade relations are
going to

24:57.596 --> 24:59.464 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
look like.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And we also
saw a very short
communique out of the G7,
usually a sign that

25:01.199 --> 25:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was very little that they
all agreed
on to put on paper.

25:05.136 --> 25:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARGARET TALEV: Yes, that's
right.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you can say that that's
a good thing.

25:08.874 --> 25:10.408 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You can say that it's a bad
thing.

25:10.442 --> 25:12.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not going to agree to
more than you
agree on.

25:12.344 --> 25:18.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this does, again, preserve
some diplomatic
space for moving closer together
in the future,

25:18.817 --> 25:21.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it also reflects what sort
of visit this
was.

25:21.820 --> 25:26.558 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was calibrated by the White
House to show
that, to a domestic audience, as
well as to

25:26.591 --> 25:31.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Europe, that President Trump is
not going
to abandon every position that
he held from

25:31.796 --> 25:37.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the campaign just because he is
here in these
meetings, but, at the same time,
a recognition

25:37.402 --> 25:44.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from his aides that the more he
engages with
key allies all over the world,
the more nuance

25:45.010 --> 25:50.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is brought to the table in terms
of him understanding
the leadership role that the
U.S. is expected

25:50.549 --> 25:53.718 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to fulfill and the complexities
of those obligations.

25:53.752 --> 25:56.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Margaret Talev
of Bloomberg joining us tonight
from Italy,

25:56.521 --> 25:57.489 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

25:57.522 --> 25:58.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARGARET TALEV: Thanks, Hari.

25:58.523 --> 26:10.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

26:10.068 --> 26:14.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
from the "NewsHour"
Bookshelf, a humorous take on
getting out

26:14.539 --> 26:20.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of your bubble; a soldier's
perspective on
being a veteran of a war that
never ends;

26:20.545 --> 26:25.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and what happened when one of
Mr. Roger's
neighbors met the TV icon during
a difficult

26:25.450 --> 26:28.286 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
season of life?

26:28.320 --> 26:30.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But first to the analysis of
Shields and Brooks.

26:30.355 --> 26:33.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
New York Times columnist David
Brooks.

26:33.758 --> 26:37.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All right, let's start this week
on the foreign
front.

26:37.329 --> 26:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president met potentates,
presidents,
prime ministers and a pope.

26:42.067 --> 26:43.935 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There were magical orbs.

26:43.969 --> 26:45.503 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:45.537 --> 26:47.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There were
tweet-sized messages
stuck into a Wailing Wall.

26:47.539 --> 26:48.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How did he do?

26:48.540 --> 26:49.507 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: B-plus.

26:49.541 --> 26:50.508 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

26:50.542 --> 26:51.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

26:51.643 --> 26:52.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I'm not
going to grade
him.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.112 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I grade him on the curve.

26:54.145 --> 27:03.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say the visual highlight
was with
the pope when he said, you know,
the pope

27:03.555 --> 27:08.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a very humble man, much like
me, which
he had tweeted earlier, and
that's why I like

27:08.593 --> 27:10.362 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
him so much.

27:10.395 --> 27:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But just sort of they're polar
opposites,
of the two, one a champion of
immigrants and

27:14.666 --> 27:22.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
refugees and almost disdainful
of opulence
and excessive wealth, and the
other sort of

27:22.574 --> 27:24.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the embodiment of it.

27:24.409 --> 27:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I thought, quite frankly,
the first part
of the trip, he laid down the
policy, and

27:28.813 --> 27:35.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the policy is that we will stand
on the side
of Sunni autocrats against
terrorism, and

27:35.420 --> 27:37.155 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no questions asked.

27:37.188 --> 27:43.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here, in addition, is a
major weapons,
a huge weapons sale that -- and
we're not

27:43.795 --> 27:48.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to ask how you use it or
where you use
it, and if people are killed in
Yemen, and

27:48.767 --> 27:54.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're -- made in the USA is on
the weapon
that kills them, and it's done
indiscriminately,

27:54.272 --> 27:59.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's their business and not
ours, because
the operating and organizing
principle of

27:59.411 --> 28:03.648 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign policy is opposition to
terrorism
under Donald Trump.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.918 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I thought
Melania had a
very good week.

28:06.951 --> 28:08.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I thought a lot of good moments
for her.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.655 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There was a lot of good
judgments, actually.

28:10.689 --> 28:14.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He, by the standards of some of
the competence
of the previous week, I would
say you would

28:14.592 --> 28:18.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have to say the trip was, by
competence standards,
a success.

28:18.196 --> 28:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He did what he wanted to do in
Saudi Arabia,
at NATO, at various other
places.

28:22.434 --> 28:28.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I do think, as Mark suggested,
the chief oddity
of the entire trip is that we
seem to be mean

28:28.373 --> 28:31.609 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to our friends and kind to our
foes.

28:31.643 --> 28:35.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so, Saudi Arabia -- Fareed
Zakaria had
a very good column on this --
we're supposed

28:35.947 --> 28:40.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be against terrorism, and
Trump loves to
talk about Iranians -- Iran's
influence on

28:40.752 --> 28:45.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terrorism, but the main source
of terror funding
for both the ideas and sometimes
the organizations

28:45.790 --> 28:46.758 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is Saudi Arabia.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's not Iran.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so -- but, somehow, we're
super nice to
Saudi Arabia.

28:51.496 --> 28:59.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, we're super mean to
Germany and
France and some of our NATO
allies.

28:59.104 --> 29:03.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so there's just been a
perversion of American
foreign policy, which is sort of
based on

29:03.842 --> 29:07.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the idea that character doesn't
matter, and
you can -- whether the leaders
from Russia

29:07.746 --> 29:13.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the Philippines or Saudi
Arabia, that people
of bad character are people we
can ally with.

29:13.518 --> 29:16.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, somehow, I think there is a
consistency
between the government here and
some of the

29:17.021 --> 29:19.557 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
governments the Trump
administration likes
around the world.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There was a
bit of that
we just saw...

29:21.159 --> 29:22.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

29:22.160 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm sorry?

29:23.928 --> 29:24.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There was a
bit of that
we just saw in the conversation
that Judy

29:24.362 --> 29:25.330 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
had.

29:25.363 --> 29:27.232 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's exactly
right.

29:27.265 --> 29:31.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would just say that the NATO
part of the
visit, I found particularly
disturbing, because

29:31.836 --> 29:35.473 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there was nothing about the
principles and
values.

29:35.507 --> 29:41.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was nothing about values
and what we
share and what animates us and
what we respect

29:41.846 --> 29:46.217 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and revere, whether it's
individual rights
or democracy.

29:46.251 --> 29:49.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That just seemed to be
unimportant.

29:50.021 --> 29:57.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all the criticism that the
president had
was stored up, as David pointed
out, for these

29:57.128 --> 29:59.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
folks for somehow being welfare
cheats or
something.

29:59.998 --> 30:00.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

30:01.032 --> 30:02.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's pure demagoguery.

30:02.867 --> 30:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He spoke as if we -- they owe us
money because
they haven't been paying their
dues, which

30:07.472 --> 30:08.439 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is not true.

30:08.473 --> 30:10.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: That's not the way
that the
-- the problem is that they sort
of pledged

30:11.543 --> 30:13.845 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to gradually get to 2 percent of
GDP in defense
spending.

30:13.878 --> 30:15.547 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

30:15.580 --> 30:17.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And some of the
countries have,
and a lot of the countries have
not.

30:17.248 --> 30:19.017 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's a legitimate issue.

30:19.050 --> 30:22.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he portrayed it as if we're
bailing them
out, and they owe us money, and
they haven't

30:22.787 --> 30:24.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
paid their bills, which is just
actually untrue.

30:24.889 --> 30:27.792 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
let's shift gears
to the budget.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What do you make of the
priorities that were
set forth in this?

30:30.662 --> 30:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a political document, but
it kind of
lets you know what you think is
important.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.035 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

30:37.068 --> 30:41.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We don't pass a budget, but I
think it's fair
to say it was mean---spirited
and dishonest

30:41.673 --> 30:49.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were the two words that come
quickest to mind,
again, coming back to the visit
with the pope,

30:49.247 --> 30:55.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has sort of made himself the
pope of the
poor, unlike a number of his
predecessors,

30:55.720 --> 30:59.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who seemed to enjoy the opulence
of Vatican
City.

31:00.024 --> 31:05.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump, at that very
meeting, his
budget, which he is distanced
from, he's not

31:05.396 --> 31:14.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even in town as it's released,
is, I think
fair to say, an orthodox
Republican document

31:14.305 --> 31:21.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the worst sense, in that it
is tax cuts
for the most advantaged among
us, and saving

31:21.779 --> 31:27.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the character of those Americans
who are struggling,
who depend upon school lunches,
who depend

31:27.552 --> 31:32.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
upon supplemental food, who
depend upon Medicaid
-- there are more people in the
United States

31:32.824 --> 31:35.426 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Medicaid than there are on
Medicare.

31:35.460 --> 31:41.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And half of the people on
Medicaid get -- work
every day.

31:41.266 --> 31:43.401 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're talking about elderly
poor.

31:43.434 --> 31:47.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, I mean, all of this is
being cut, for
what purpose?

31:47.505 --> 31:51.676 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To provide an enormous tax cut
for those who
are best-off.

31:51.709 --> 31:56.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, doesn't
some of this
go right at the base of
supporters that Donald

31:56.547 --> 32:00.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump have, the poor working
class that came
to him?

32:00.285 --> 32:03.688 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And it seems, as Mark is
pointing out, that
some of the programs that are
being cut are

32:03.721 --> 32:05.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going to affect them first.

32:05.590 --> 32:08.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, you look at
the food stamps
program, and that has radically
expanded over

32:09.027 --> 32:10.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the last 10 years.

32:10.995 --> 32:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the question is, has it
expanded maybe
for some of the reasons Social
Security disability

32:14.966 --> 32:18.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
expanded, just because it's
become sort of
welfare through the backdoor?

32:18.169 --> 32:19.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Is it illegitimate?

32:20.004 --> 32:23.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, if you look into the food
stamp program,
the reason it's expanded is
because a lot

32:23.408 --> 32:27.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of people are now near poor and
because of
economic changes.

32:27.445 --> 32:30.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's not because of some
illegitimate explosion
of the welfare state.

32:30.415 --> 32:34.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's because of the underlying
structure of
society has disadvantaged a lot
of people,

32:34.519 --> 32:36.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and they need some help.

32:36.454 --> 32:40.892 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so it's -- as Donald Trump's
own secretary
of agriculture said, it's a
successful program,

32:40.925 --> 32:43.761 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and yet it's getting savagely
cut.

32:43.795 --> 32:48.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that's -- and that,
as you say,
goes right at the Trump voters,
because the

32:48.433 --> 32:52.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lower-middle-class voters in
rural areas are
getting a lot of those benefits.

32:52.503 --> 32:58.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To me, the most egregious, two
egregious things
about the budget is, as Mark
said, it hurts

32:58.543 --> 33:03.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the poor and helps the rich, but
it also hurts
the young and helps the old, and
that whether

33:03.648 --> 33:07.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's food stamps or a lot the
other programs,
if you believe in human capital,
that we're

33:07.952 --> 33:12.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investing in the future with a
lot these programs,
then that's the good kind of
spending, even

33:12.890 --> 33:14.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
if you're kind of conservative.

33:14.726 --> 33:18.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, to me, we should cut some
of the money
that goes to affluent elderly
people and give

33:18.162 --> 33:19.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more money to young, struggling
people.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Donald Trump does the
reverse.

33:21.899 --> 33:27.839 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the second thing is just the
almost in-your-face
dishonesty of it.

33:27.872 --> 33:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of it is -- just it's
assuming there
will be 3 percent growth, which
is not going

33:32.243 --> 33:34.078 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to happen, given our
demographics.

33:34.112 --> 33:40.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Larry Summers pointed out
that this made
the most elementary budget
calculating error

33:40.718 --> 33:43.021 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of any administration in 40
years.

33:43.054 --> 33:47.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They took the same revenue
source, and they
counted it twice, in order to
cover.

33:47.658 --> 33:51.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's just -- everybody had
the to catch
that error, but they were just
going to do

33:51.729 --> 33:53.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it anyway, and they didn't care
what anybody
said.

33:53.064 --> 33:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Larry Summers,
the former
treasury secretary.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, what about the president
coming back
and saying, hey, you know what,
I made these

33:58.870 --> 34:02.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
promises, I said I wasn't going
to touch aid
to the elderly?

34:02.740 --> 34:06.677 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, he said he
wouldn't cut
Social Security, Medicare or
Medicaid.

34:06.711 --> 34:13.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That was the promise he made in
one of his
campaign tweets, that I'm the
only candidate.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He made that point.

34:15.286 --> 34:16.921 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And he has not.

34:16.954 --> 34:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He has not touched Social
Security.

34:18.890 --> 34:26.531 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He's cutting SSI, Social
Security -- the Supplemental
Social Security, for people who
are disabled

34:26.564 --> 34:31.436 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and elderly, but he's not
cutting Social Security
payments to the elderly.

34:31.469 --> 34:36.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's not means-testing it in any
way, and
nor is he touching Medicare.

34:36.541 --> 34:40.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Medicaid, having promised
not to, he is.

34:40.144 --> 34:41.579 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He is, in fact.

34:41.612 --> 34:46.617 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's almost -- cutting Medicaid,
proposed
to cut it in half, the spending.

34:46.651 --> 34:48.453 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Federal spending would be cut in
half.

34:48.486 --> 34:51.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the food stamps will be cut
by one-quarter.

34:51.656 --> 34:58.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't know how you justify
this when,
in the same week, Hari, the
Congressional

34:58.796 --> 35:05.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Budget Office, the Republican
selected chief
economist, but very respected
nonpartisan,

35:05.503 --> 35:11.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
says 23 million people are going
to lose the
health coverage insurance that
they already

35:11.375 --> 35:15.947 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have under the Republican-passed
plan.

35:15.980 --> 35:17.748 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I will say this unequivocally.

35:17.782 --> 35:23.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, three weeks after the
House passed
that health care bill, there is
not a single

35:23.187 --> 35:26.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
member of the House who regrets
having voted
against it.

35:26.390 --> 35:27.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about
members of the
Senate?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do they do going forward?

35:29.193 --> 35:31.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, well, they're
going to
have trouble.

35:31.095 --> 35:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, it was kind of surprising
they went
through all the change of
rewriting the thing,

35:35.099 --> 35:38.336 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they basically got the same
CBO number
as they got last time.

35:38.369 --> 35:40.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I can't believe -- I
couldn't believe
they got so many House people to
vote for

35:40.972 --> 35:44.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this thing, because it's going
to be a killer
issue for a lot of people.

35:44.275 --> 35:48.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the Senate, they're doing
everything in
secret right now.

35:48.079 --> 35:49.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

35:49.413 --> 35:51.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: And so we don't
exactly know
what's happening.

35:51.048 --> 35:52.850 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're talking with each other.

35:52.884 --> 35:56.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do know they're divided
almost down
the middle on some of the
Medicaid cuts, on

35:56.954 --> 36:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some oft other issues, on some
of the preexisting
conditions.

36:00.124 --> 36:04.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And passage in the Senate, you
wouldn't want
to bet on that, not by a long
shot.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And whatever
gets through
the Senate, there's a good
chance it wouldn't

36:06.564 --> 36:07.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
get passed in the House.

36:07.565 --> 36:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Right.

36:08.566 --> 36:09.534 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It wouldn't get passed.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.369 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes.

36:11.402 --> 36:16.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, in order to make
it acceptable
-- the pledge to repeal
Obamacare was great

36:16.140 --> 36:18.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as a political rallying cry.

36:18.209 --> 36:19.744 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's terrible policy.

36:19.777 --> 36:21.812 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's not -- it won't pass.

36:21.846 --> 36:25.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: But they could --
if they could
get -- they could have another
way to give

36:26.017 --> 36:30.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people health insurance through
health savings
accounts and tax credits and
things like that,

36:30.221 --> 36:33.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if they guaranteed the same
level of coverage
that Obama is doing.

36:33.157 --> 36:35.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think that would be a
completely legitimate
approach.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe introduce some more
competition into
the system.

36:37.361 --> 36:39.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is not what they're doing.

36:39.130 --> 36:41.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
lastly, in the
last two minutes we have here, a
new member

36:41.933 --> 36:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the House of -- Republicans
-- during a
special election in Montana,
Greg Gianforte

36:47.905 --> 36:52.610 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
beats his opponents, but
body-slams a reporter
on the way to getting there.

36:52.643 --> 36:56.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does this say about -- you
know, and
the thing that I heard this
morning on NPR

36:56.581 --> 36:59.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, one of the reporters was
talking to some
of his supporters, saying, you
know what,

36:59.217 --> 37:01.085 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that guy had it coming.

37:01.118 --> 37:06.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the extent of hostility
toward the
press and how it's manifesting
itself in different

37:06.090 --> 37:08.459 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ways in the past couple of
months.

37:08.492 --> 37:10.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't think
there is any question.

37:10.394 --> 37:17.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was legitimized in
part by President
Trump's campaign, which included
this and

37:17.201 --> 37:24.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of rhetorical excesses and
singling out
members of the press.

37:24.242 --> 37:30.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Frank Luntz, the Republican
pollster,
who was the pollster for the
Contract With

37:31.015 --> 37:35.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America, Newt Gingrich, said, if
you check
the party affiliation of someone
who commits

37:35.953 --> 37:41.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
assault before deciding how you
feel about
it, you're what's wrong with
America.

37:41.692 --> 37:43.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's really what it's
become.

37:43.628 --> 37:49.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the seminal moment in
contemporary
American politics was when
President Obama

37:49.767 --> 37:54.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was addressing the joint session
of Congress
on health care, and Joe Wilson
of South Carolina

37:54.105 --> 38:00.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stood up and said, "You lie,"
unprecedented
in its rudeness and boorishness,
and he raised

38:00.678 --> 38:03.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a million dollars in the next
week in funds.

38:03.814 --> 38:05.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think that polarization
was rewarded.

38:06.017 --> 38:06.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

38:07.018 --> 38:08.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would say two things are true.

38:08.753 --> 38:11.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The climate of ugliness is no
doubt ratcheting
up and giving some permission to
this.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In this case, I'm willing to
give the guy
a break.

38:13.524 --> 38:14.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He did apologize.

38:14.525 --> 38:16.027 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he could have just lost his
temper.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will see what his career is
like.

38:18.062 --> 38:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm willing to -- if a
leader is at least
willing to apologize, that's
frankly a step

38:23.134 --> 38:25.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up from what we have seen on the
presidential
level.

38:25.403 --> 38:28.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, New
York Times
columnist David Brooks,
syndicated columnist

38:28.406 --> 38:31.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Mark Shields, thank you both.

38:31.475 --> 38:35.046 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Hari.

38:35.079 --> 38:45.623 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now a comic
with a sharp
edge and an astute take on
modern life and

38:45.656 --> 38:47.091 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
politics.

heard of the phrase

Black Lives Matter.

think about
that?

38:54.632 --> 38:57.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Sociopolitical
comedy, it's
a way of describing the work of
W. Kamau Bell,

38:57.768 --> 39:02.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
host of CNN's "United Shades of
America,"
in which he does something
rather unusual

39:02.073 --> 39:07.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these days, seeking out the
America and Americans
we don't know or regularly
interact with.

39:07.912 --> 39:08.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: Come here.

39:08.879 --> 39:10.214 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Come here.

39:10.247 --> 39:11.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Can you say it, because
-- can you
tell me a little bit?

39:11.115 --> 39:12.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: No, what you said
is true.

39:12.316 --> 39:13.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
All lives should matter.

39:13.317 --> 39:14.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I know that.

39:14.318 --> 39:15.586 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

39:15.619 --> 39:16.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: But right now,
but not -- right
now, lives...

39:16.320 --> 39:17.254 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: ... offensive.

39:17.288 --> 39:18.255 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

39:18.289 --> 39:19.256 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It does.

39:19.290 --> 39:20.257 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

39:20.291 --> 39:21.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes.

39:21.292 --> 39:23.027 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
No.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, to many people it does,
because all
lives don't really matter in the
same way,

39:24.295 --> 39:24.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then all lives matter is
like an aspirational
goal.

39:24.995 --> 39:26.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
White people, learn from her.

39:26.964 --> 39:31.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Now Bell expands
on his own
view of the world in a new book,
"The Awkward

39:31.535 --> 39:38.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thoughts of W. Kamau Bell," with
the subtitle
"Tales of a 6' 4", African
American, Heterosexual,

39:38.242 --> 39:44.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Cisgender, Left-Leaning,
Asthmatic, Black
and Proud Blerd, Mama's Boy,
Dad, and Stand-Up

39:44.382 --> 39:45.349 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Comedian."

39:45.383 --> 39:46.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
So, welcome.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.351 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That says it all pretty much

39:47.385 --> 39:48.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.353 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the whole book.

39:49.387 --> 39:50.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: That's the book.

39:50.388 --> 39:51.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: That's the book.

39:51.555 --> 39:52.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: We don't have to
read the book
anymore.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.025 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

39:55.059 --> 39:56.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: "Awkward
Thoughts," though,
the title, what does that mean
exactly?

39:56.927 --> 39:58.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: It comes from the
fact that
I realize that the best things
that have happened

39:58.662 --> 40:02.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to me in life have been friends
of mine sitting
me down and having awkward talks
with me,

40:02.366 --> 40:06.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family members, or reading
things that challenge
me, that that's when I feel
really like I'm

40:06.704 --> 40:09.306 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
growing as a person, when I'm in
an awkward
situation.

40:09.340 --> 40:13.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a lot of times, in society,
we're trained
to run from awkward situations.

40:13.043 --> 40:17.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If things get awkward, you
either run from
them or yell over them to try to
control them.

40:17.648 --> 40:20.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, for me, when things get
awkward, I get
quieter and start to listen
more.

40:20.451 --> 40:24.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I used that
sociopolitical
comedy, which I took from the
jacket cover

40:24.355 --> 40:26.524 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the book, so I assume you
approve of that.

40:26.557 --> 40:27.725 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Oh, yes.

40:27.758 --> 40:28.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, I'm the one who started
describing myself
as that.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You started that,
but what
does that mean?

40:30.461 --> 40:33.597 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: I think I found
it somewhere,
this idea of sociopolitical.

40:33.631 --> 40:37.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of times, a comedian like
me is a called
a political comedian.

40:37.501 --> 40:42.406 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think political comedy in
America conjures
up a pretty specific image.

40:42.440 --> 40:46.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I love political comedians,
but I think
there is a pretty big difference
between what

40:46.510 --> 40:49.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm doing and what you would
think a stand-up
political comedian is doing.

40:49.313 --> 40:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm talking about -- I'm not
talking much
about politicians.

40:51.682 --> 40:56.787 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I'm talking about social
movements or people
who are struggling or oppressed
people.

40:56.821 --> 40:59.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not so much about what's
going on in
D.C.

40:59.390 --> 41:04.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In the television
show and
to some extent certainly in the
book, this

41:04.395 --> 41:06.430 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
search for the other, right?

41:06.464 --> 41:08.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Mm-hmm.

41:08.232 --> 41:11.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: One of the
premises clearly
is we're all in our own boxes,
and we need

41:11.869 --> 41:12.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get out of them.

41:12.870 --> 41:14.705 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes.

41:14.738 --> 41:16.740 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first part, when I was a
kid, I just moved
around a lot because my mom
moved around a

41:16.774 --> 41:18.476 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
lot.

41:18.509 --> 41:21.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think I sort of was
already being -- I
was always being broken out of
boxes.

41:21.979 --> 41:23.080 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
My dad lives in Alabama.

41:23.113 --> 41:25.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we would be somewhere and go
to Alabama.

41:25.049 --> 41:28.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if you're in the north or in
the west
and you go to Alabama, that's a
different

41:28.719 --> 41:30.287 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
box.

41:30.321 --> 41:33.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for me, the whole thing has
been about
like searching for where I
belong.

41:33.924 --> 41:37.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, as an adult, as a
stand-up comedian,
you travel around the country
doing stand-up

41:37.728 --> 41:39.563 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shows.

41:39.597 --> 41:41.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you go anywhere where they
will hire you,
so you're in different places
you never would

41:41.765 --> 41:46.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
think to go, like Garden City,
Kansas, or
Appalachian State University.

41:46.136 --> 41:48.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, for me, it's just been a
natural thing.

41:48.906 --> 41:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the TV show sort of
takes all that
experience and really pushes it
forward another

41:52.209 --> 41:53.177 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
step.

41:53.210 --> 41:54.912 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, it does.

41:54.945 --> 41:57.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Everything you just said is sort
of your personal
experience of why you get out of
boxes.

41:57.147 --> 42:01.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But then you are extrapolating,
I think, to
a larger -- like, this is what
we all need.

42:01.952 --> 42:02.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is what America needs.

42:03.020 --> 42:03.988 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.422 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes?

42:05.456 --> 42:07.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes, because I
travel around,
and I talk to people.

42:07.258 --> 42:11.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And everybody sort of loves
their part of
America, which is great, but
then a lot of

42:11.729 --> 42:15.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
times, we think, this is the
most America
part of America, the part I live
in.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, the people in New York
think, this is
the most America.

42:17.835 --> 42:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
People in Alabama think...

42:19.036 --> 42:20.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: To the detriment,
though, of
the culture?

42:20.838 --> 42:24.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes, because then
you watch
the news, and if you're in New
York and they

42:24.475 --> 42:29.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say -- they talk about Alabama,
you think,
ah, that's not my country,
that's not my people.

42:29.847 --> 42:33.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so somehow you condescend to
what their
experience is, or you think you
can actually

42:33.684 --> 42:36.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
judge their experience, even
though you have
never been there.

42:36.053 --> 42:39.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you think those people want
-- like, you
look at people in coal country,
people who

42:39.623 --> 42:42.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
don't live in coal country go,
why do they
want to destroy the environment
with coal?

42:42.860 --> 42:45.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you go talk to people in
coal country,
it's about jobs.

42:45.930 --> 42:48.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We sort of demonize them because
we think
they love destroying the
environment.

42:48.532 --> 42:51.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You talked to the
alt-right
leader, right, Richard Spencer.

42:51.135 --> 42:52.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes.

42:52.503 --> 42:56.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you do it in
a gentle,
sort of humorous way.

42:56.740 --> 42:58.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not like you're...

42:58.108 --> 43:00.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes, I do it the
same way I'm
talking to you, yes.

43:00.778 --> 43:01.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

43:01.779 --> 43:02.813 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

43:02.846 --> 43:04.615 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
But to what end?

43:04.648 --> 43:05.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You're not trying to convince
them -- and
you have -- and you're clear
about your own

43:05.549 --> 43:06.817 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
left-leaning, where you're
coming from.

43:06.850 --> 43:07.885 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.286 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's not -- I'm not pulling a
trick on anybody.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I sit down as the person I am.

43:10.688 --> 43:12.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm very Googleable, so people
can find out
everything about me.

43:12.756 --> 43:14.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

43:14.091 --> 43:15.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: And they're not
going to be
tricked about me.

43:15.092 --> 43:16.293 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Not only are you
Googleable.

43:16.327 --> 43:18.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You say it all right on the
cover of the book.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.396 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
W. KAMAU BELL: Yes.

43:19.430 --> 43:20.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I have written it down on paper.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.465 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's forever.

43:21.498 --> 43:22.499 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the idea is like, can we
have a conversation?

43:22.533 --> 43:24.702 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Can we actually get to a
different place?

43:24.735 --> 43:28.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the thing that I'm doing on
TV is, like,
I know it's for TV.

43:28.138 --> 43:32.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, if I talk to you and get you
relaxed and
make you laugh and I laugh,
you're going to

43:32.710 --> 43:34.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say something that you weren't
expecting to
say, because you're more
comfortable.

43:34.912 --> 43:38.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Richard Spencer normally sits
across from
people like me, and they're
pushing him and

43:38.315 --> 43:39.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they're challenging him.

43:39.316 --> 43:40.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it makes him defensive.

43:40.317 --> 43:42.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it sort of gets to the same
place.

43:42.219 --> 43:45.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
By me sitting down with me, we
got to different
places than he normally gets
with other people,

43:45.623 --> 43:48.525 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which exposed him in a different
way to people
who thought they knew everything
about him.

43:48.559 --> 43:51.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The election
happened, surprised
a lot of people.

43:51.996 --> 43:58.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there was suddenly a lot of
talk about
an America that felt left
behind, right, or

43:58.769 --> 44:00.537 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
left out.

44:00.571 --> 44:04.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So to the extent you're clear
about where
you're coming from and your
politics, what

44:04.508 --> 44:08.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
do you think people of your
political persuasion
should be doing now?

44:08.512 --> 44:12.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: I just wrote an
op-ed for The
New York Times saying people in
Berkeley need

44:12.149 --> 44:13.884 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to go vacation in Alabama.

44:13.917 --> 44:18.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that that is really --
if you can,
get out of your comfort zone and
get out of

44:18.155 --> 44:20.457 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your immediate area and go
someplace you wouldn't
expect to go.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You are going to learn more
about people.

44:22.126 --> 44:23.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think people in Alabama
should go to
Berkeley.

44:23.894 --> 44:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I travel the country a lot.

44:25.529 --> 44:27.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you talk to people and
they're like, I
have never been to New York
City.

44:27.264 --> 44:28.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have never been to New York
City?

44:28.499 --> 44:30.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Now, I get a lot of that is
economic.

44:30.300 --> 44:32.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But some of that is just people
think, that's
not for me.

44:32.636 --> 44:35.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I feel like the best thing
you can do
in this country is mix it up
with other people.

44:35.339 --> 44:37.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, if you can't physically do
it, you need
to get online.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.777 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You need to connect with people.

44:39.810 --> 44:42.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need to try to talk to
people, not yelling
at people on Facebook and
Twitter, but actually

44:42.780 --> 44:44.515 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
really connect with people.

44:44.548 --> 44:48.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Just one last
thing in thinking
about the comedy and the
sociopolitical.

44:48.786 --> 44:51.321 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Serious issues, you're dealing
with.

44:51.355 --> 44:52.556 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is there a line?

44:52.589 --> 44:55.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is there someplace where you
think comedy
just can't go?

44:55.159 --> 44:58.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: No, comedy is
pretty nonpartisan.

44:58.429 --> 45:00.397 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comedy goes wherever comedy
wants to go.

45:00.431 --> 45:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether or not something is a
joke depends
on the ability of the person who
writes the

45:03.434 --> 45:05.069 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
joke to communicate the
punchline.

45:05.102 --> 45:07.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Comedy is not something that --
it's like
math.

45:07.638 --> 45:10.107 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's way more like math than
people realize.

45:10.140 --> 45:11.775 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's comedians who are
Republicans.

45:11.809 --> 45:13.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's comedians who are
Democrats.

45:13.077 --> 45:14.878 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Comedy doesn't care.

45:14.912 --> 45:17.081 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Comedy is just there to make
people laugh.

45:17.114 --> 45:20.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, "The
Awkward Thoughts
of W. Kamau Bell."

45:20.484 --> 45:22.219 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

45:22.252 --> 45:28.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
W. KAMAU BELL: Thank you.

45:28.992 --> 45:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tonight:
reflections from
author Brian Castner, who offers
his Humble

45:36.066 --> 45:41.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Opinion on why he felt most at
home overseas
fighting what he calls the
forever war.

45:41.839 --> 45:45.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRIAN CASTNER, Author, "The Long
Walk": It's
a little odd to be a veteran of
a war that

45:45.442 --> 45:46.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
doesn't end.

45:46.844 --> 45:49.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I did three tours, got home from
Iraq a decade
ago.

45:49.980 --> 45:53.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You think you have moved on, put
the war in
its place, and then you see
Tomahawk cruise

45:53.884 --> 45:58.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
missile strikes on cable news,
and you're
reminded that your war isn't
over.

45:58.122 --> 46:00.691 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's just gone on without you.

46:00.724 --> 46:05.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of us call it the forever
war, the invasions
of Afghanistan and Iraq, bombing
Libya and

46:05.963 --> 46:12.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yemen, raids all over Africa,
and now Army
Rangers and Marine Corps
artillery in Syria.

46:12.336 --> 46:16.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's already the longest war in
American history,
and I have given up thinking
peace is coming

46:16.874 --> 46:18.709 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
any time soon.

46:18.742 --> 46:23.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our nation has an all-volunteer
military,
and people join for lots of
reasons: education,

46:23.747 --> 46:26.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a sense of adventure,
patriotism.

46:26.350 --> 46:31.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But staying in the military,
racking up five,
six, seven tours, that's a
different kind

46:31.655 --> 46:33.423 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of decision.

46:33.457 --> 46:36.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are plenty of ways to pay
for college
that don't involve getting shot
at over and

46:36.794 --> 46:38.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
over again.

46:38.362 --> 46:39.563 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So why did I do it?

46:39.596 --> 46:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Why do soldiers choose to keep
serving in
the forever war?

46:43.433 --> 46:48.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was an explosive ordnance
disposal technician,
EOD, we call it, the bomb squad.

46:48.672 --> 46:52.342 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After my last Iraq tour, I was
worn out mentally
and physically.

46:52.376 --> 46:56.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But my EOD brothers and sisters
were dying,
and I needed to stay to protect
them.

46:56.947 --> 47:04.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Such a feeling provides intense
meaning, but
also, in the forever war,
limitless obligation.

47:04.655 --> 47:09.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our little tribe has lost more
than its share,
disarming those infamous
roadside bombs, and

47:09.092 --> 47:15.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I found it harder to stop going
back than
to go the first time, because,
at its core,

47:15.499 --> 47:18.735 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
EOD work is about lifesaving,
not killing.

47:18.769 --> 47:24.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How do you say, I'm too tired, I
can't help
anyone else?

47:24.474 --> 47:28.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a devil's bargain, choosing
between one's
tribe and one's family.

47:28.579 --> 47:32.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the one hand, I needed to be
in Iraq to
keep my comrades alive.

47:32.583 --> 47:37.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, on the other, every moment
I was gone,
I wasn't a good husband or dad.

47:37.287 --> 47:43.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Sometimes, I ask myself, how
many tours would
have been enough to know, deep
in my bones,

47:43.460 --> 47:45.329 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that I had done my part?

47:45.362 --> 47:48.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This isn't survivor's guilt, or
nostalgia
for the adrenaline.

47:48.498 --> 47:51.635 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is just shallow, fades with
youth.

47:51.668 --> 47:58.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a haunting sense that I let
my comrades
down by giving up before the job
was done.

47:58.609 --> 48:03.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that's the paradox, right,
because it
feels like this business will
never be finished.

48:03.747 --> 48:09.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For years, I maintained this
fantasy that
I would get a phone call from my
old unit.

48:09.353 --> 48:11.488 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need you back, they'd say.

48:11.521 --> 48:16.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I kept all my gear packed in a
trunk in the
basement, just in case.

48:16.693 --> 48:18.829 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't want to go back to Iraq.

48:18.862 --> 48:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But I also don't want my
brothers and sisters
to go back without me.

48:22.299 --> 48:27.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The end of the forever war can't
come soon
enough.

48:28.005 --> 48:38.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now to our
"NewsHour" Shares,
something that caught our eye
that may be

48:38.582 --> 48:40.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of interest to you too.

48:40.651 --> 48:45.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the aftermath of the terror
attack in Manchester,
England, writer Anthony
Breznican took to

48:45.289 --> 48:51.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Twitter to recount how one
person comforted
him during a difficult period in
his own life.

48:51.161 --> 48:54.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That man was Fred Rogers, of
"Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood."

48:54.431 --> 48:58.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Breznican recently spoke with us
via Skype
about the lessons he learned
during a chance

48:58.535 --> 49:00.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
encounter with the late TV icon.

49:00.904 --> 49:10.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANTHONY BREZNICAN,
"Entertainment Weekly":
My grandfather had died not so
long ago, and

49:10.814 --> 49:15.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he was sort of this one steady
constant in
my life, and a really positive
influence.

49:15.285 --> 49:20.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And when you don't have a lot of
those to
being with, to lose one is
really devastating.

49:20.691 --> 49:23.827 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, I was going through a hard
time.

49:23.860 --> 49:30.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One afternoon, or morning, I was
leaving the
dorm, and I heard a familiar
song coming down

49:30.400 --> 49:33.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the hallway, won't you be my
neighbor.

49:33.203 --> 49:38.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I kind of stuck my head into
the commons
room, and there on the TV was
Mr. Rogers.

49:38.408 --> 49:41.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of his favorite things was
to talk about,
what do you do with the mad that
you feel?

49:41.912 --> 49:44.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED ROGERS, Host, "Mister
Rogers' Neighborhood"
(singing): What do you do with
the mad that

49:44.848 --> 49:47.985 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feel, when you feel so mad, you
could bite?

49:48.018 --> 49:53.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY BREZNICAN: You know, a
way of helping
kids deal with their anger,
acknowledging

49:53.056 --> 49:55.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it, instead of telling them that
they shouldn't
feel it.

49:55.425 --> 49:59.396 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it was like, this speaks to
me.

49:59.429 --> 50:00.397 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm very angry.

50:00.430 --> 50:01.865 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm very scared.

50:01.898 --> 50:04.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even as a young adult, like this
-- it didn't
feel like a kids program.

50:04.968 --> 50:06.703 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It felt very profound.

50:06.737 --> 50:11.375 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Within about two weeks or so, I
was at the
school paper and I got into the
elevator to

50:11.408 --> 50:16.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go down to the lobby, and the
doors opened,
and standing there is Mr. Rogers
himself.

50:16.780 --> 50:22.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I turned around and said, like:
"Look, I just
want to tell you how much you
mean to me."

50:22.285 --> 50:26.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said -- he didn't say
like, thank you,
I appreciate that or anything.

50:26.456 --> 50:30.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was just like: "Oh, did you
grow up as
one of my television neighbors?"

50:30.160 --> 50:32.229 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And just the way he said it was
so sweet.

50:32.262 --> 50:35.098 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was like, "Yes, yes, I was
your neighbor."

50:35.132 --> 50:39.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he gives -- opens his arms
and he is like,
"It's great to see you again,
neighbor," and

50:39.403 --> 50:41.071 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he just gives me this big hug.

50:41.104 --> 50:48.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it felt so wonderful to meet
him, but
also to literally be embraced by
Mr. Rogers,

50:48.078 --> 50:49.279 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this kind man.

50:49.312 --> 50:52.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FRED ROGERS (singing): I will be
back when
the day was new.

50:52.582 --> 50:56.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANTHONY BREZNICAN: And he sat
down and he
said, "Would you like to tell me
what it was

50:56.286 --> 50:57.788 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that was upsetting you?"

50:57.821 --> 51:02.159 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just the say he said that,
too, is so
indicative of Mr. Rogers.

51:02.192 --> 51:04.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He didn't say, oh, what was
bothering you?

51:04.694 --> 51:06.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He said, "Would you like to tell
me?"

51:06.296 --> 51:07.731 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I did.

51:07.764 --> 51:11.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it helped so much just to
have someone
to talk to.

51:11.301 --> 51:14.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't just a persona that he
put on for
this program.

51:14.704 --> 51:20.744 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The program grafted itself onto
his personality,
his real soul, his real heart.

51:20.777 --> 51:24.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was the night of the
Manchester bombing,
and I think the whole world was
just wondering

51:24.848 --> 51:27.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how someone could do something
like this.

51:27.317 --> 51:31.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that quote that he gave
repeatedly in
interviews about his mother
telling him, if

51:31.788 --> 51:36.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you see something awful, look
for the helpers,
find hope among the helpers, the
people who

51:36.560 --> 51:40.263 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are rushing in to save those who
are hurting.

51:40.297 --> 51:45.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I saw that meme, like a
photograph of
him with that text shared again
and again

51:45.402 --> 51:47.137 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by different people online.

51:47.170 --> 51:51.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that just got me thinking of
this memory
of how Mr. Rogers was kind in
real life.

51:51.508 --> 51:55.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think anybody could ever
fill Mr.
Rogers' shoes.

51:55.812 --> 51:57.180 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We can try.

51:57.214 --> 51:59.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But he was one of a kind.

51:59.349 --> 52:02.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And once in a lifetime means
once in a lifetime.

52:02.052 --> 52:05.555 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thank goodness
for reruns.

52:05.589 --> 52:09.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: It's almost
Memorial Day, meaning it's
almost summer,

52:09.893 --> 52:14.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a time to catch up on missed
readings, turn
back to old favorites, and
discover new ones.

52:14.798 --> 52:19.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get recommendations for great
summer reads
from two bookstore owners who
are also novelists.

52:19.703 --> 52:23.540 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:23.573 --> 52:25.542 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Robert Costa and his team
are preparing
for "Washington Week."

52:25.575 --> 52:27.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Robert, what do you got on tap?

52:27.410 --> 52:32.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: President Trump's
foreign trip
did little to distance him or
his family from

52:32.549 --> 52:34.451 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the FBI's Russia probe.

52:34.484 --> 52:39.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We will have the latest on why
investigators
are eager to interview
son-in-law Jared Kushner,

52:39.523 --> 52:45.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plus how the president's America
first agenda
played out on the world stage,
tonight on

52:45.595 --> 52:46.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"Washington Week" -- Hari.

52:46.696 --> 52:47.697 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Thanks,
Robert.

52:47.731 --> 52:49.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We will be watching.

52:49.533 --> 52:53.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tomorrow, on "PBS NewsHour
Weekend," in the
wake of the deadly Manchester
bombing, I sit

52:53.136 --> 52:58.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
down with an expert on the
politics of Islam
to discuss what motivates
terrorists to commit

52:58.308 --> 52:59.943 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
such horrific acts.

52:59.976 --> 53:03.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GILLES KEPEL, Political
Scientist: People
who are imbued with this
Islamist radical

53:03.446 --> 53:08.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ideology, and then, you know,
you take a knife,
you take a gun, you take your
car, and then

53:08.752 --> 53:12.022 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you kill as many kafir, or
infidels, as possible.

53:12.055 --> 53:13.089 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then they will retaliate.

53:13.123 --> 53:15.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They will, say, desecrate a
mosque or something.

53:16.026 --> 53:21.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this will create a sort of
system of provocation
and repression, which will lead
up to the

53:21.831 --> 53:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
breakup of society.

53:23.533 --> 53:26.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So the goal is
to break
society up from the inside, to
create civil

53:26.903 --> 53:27.871 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
strife.

53:27.904 --> 53:29.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GILLES KEPEL: Exactly.

53:29.272 --> 53:31.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's
tomorrow night on
"PBS NewsHour Weekend."

53:31.074 --> 53:33.410 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday.

53:33.443 --> 53:39.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I will have a report on the
origin of organs
that are used to transplant in
China, a system

53:39.482 --> 53:41.484 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that has been shrouded in
secrecy.

53:41.518 --> 53:42.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:42.852 --> 53:43.820 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Hari Sreenivasan.

53:43.853 --> 53:44.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:44.888 --> 53:54.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.

53:54.931 --> 54:09.946 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you, and good night.
