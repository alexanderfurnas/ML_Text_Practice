06:05.833 --> 06:08.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:08.633 --> 06:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

OF HIS RACES IN RIO WHAT HIS

06:27.567 --> 06:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:29.667 --> 06:32.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE GUTTED OUT THAT FLY.

06:32.533 --> 06:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

IT.

06:35.167 --> 06:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE WAS SEIZING UP IN THE FINAL

10 METERS, AND I KNOW THAT FEEL.

06:40.933 --> 06:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SOMEHOW FOUND A WAY TO GET

06:42.800 --> 06:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

06:44.600 --> 06:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

CAN YOU REMIND US OF SOME OF THE

06:58.167 --> 06:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEVIATIONS HIS CAREER-- MAYBE

06:59.500 --> 07:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CALL THEM RUTS-- HE WENT

07:01.533 --> 07:02.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THAT COULD HAVE REALLY

07:02.967 --> 07:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUNTED HIS PROGRESS.

07:05.600 --> 07:09.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE YEAR AFTER BEIJING, HE

07:09.167 --> 07:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS AT A PARTY WITH A FEW

07:11.967 --> 07:13.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRIENDS.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYONE IN THAT ROOM HE THOUGHT

07:14.633 --> 07:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS A FRIEND, AND THERE WAS A

07:19.100 --> 07:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARIJUANA BONG IN PLAY, AND THAT

07:22.400 --> 07:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PICTURE GOT OUT.

07:23.667 --> 07:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THAT WAS THE FIRST BLEMISH.

07:26.033 --> 07:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN HE HAD A D.U.I., AND A

07:30.133 --> 07:34.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SECOND D.U.I. IN 2014, AND THAT

07:34.967 --> 07:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS REALLY THE TURNING POINT FOR

07:36.400 --> 07:37.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL.

07:37.267 --> 07:39.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE AFTER THAT SECOND

07:39.867 --> 07:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
D.U.I., HE WENT INTO RECOVERY, A

IN ARIZONA.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT IS ASTONISHING THE

07:47.433 --> 07:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENCE IN HIM.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S ALMOST AS IF HE IS A

07:55.067 --> 07:56.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT PERSON.

07:56.167 --> 07:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S THE SAME SWIMMER BUT A

07:58.600 --> 07:59.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PERSON, SO

07:59.700 --> 08:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH MORE SELF-AWARE, AND SO

08:03.000 --> 08:04.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE.

APPARENTLY, WHAT IS HIS LEGACY

ON THE SPORT ITSELF?

08:13.100 --> 08:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I BELIEVE WHAT HE'S DONE IN

08:15.400 --> 08:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST BRINGING MORE PEOPLE FROM

08:17.500 --> 08:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MORE COUNTRIES TO SPORTS.

08:22.833 --> 08:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WERE SO MANY WHEN THERE

08:26.000 --> 08:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE SIX OR SEVEN COUNTRIES

08:27.167 --> 08:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPRESENTED IN THE TOP EIGHT.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I CAN REMEMBER A TIME WHEN THAT

08:30.433 --> 08:32.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS NOT THE CASE.

08:32.867 --> 08:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOUR

08:34.200 --> 08:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRIES AT THE MOST.

08:39.400 --> 08:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE OWE THAT TO MICHAEL, I

08:40.900 --> 08:41.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BELIEVE.

08:41.767 --> 08:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THESE ARE PEOPLE IN THE SPORT

09:13.567 --> 09:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THEM TO TAKE IT UP.

09:17.067 --> 09:18.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THE RISK OF CATASTROPHE

THAT THAT RISK CAN BE MITIGATED.

17:50.900 --> 17:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE TESTING

17:51.900 --> 17:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXTENSIVELY.
