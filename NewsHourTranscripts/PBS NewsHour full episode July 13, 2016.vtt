Gwen Ifill.

00:05.505 --> 00:06.573 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And I'm Judy
Woodruff.

GWEN IFILL: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:

00:08.408 --> 00:13.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, British Prime
Minister: My
only wish is continued success
for this great

00:13.413 --> 00:15.883 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country that I love so very
much.

00:15.916 --> 00:20.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: David Cameron steps
down as British
prime minister, handing over the
increasingly

00:20.787 --> 00:25.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
complicated job of governing an
independent
Britain to Conservative Theresa
May.

00:25.826 --> 00:31.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Also ahead this
Wednesday:
Speculation mounts over possible
V.P. picks,

00:31.498 --> 00:37.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as Donald Trump spars with
Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Hillary
Clinton calls

00:37.404 --> 00:39.206 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
out Trump for being divisive.

00:39.239 --> 00:43.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And the latest in
our
series The End of AIDS takes us
to New York

00:43.877 --> 00:47.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
state, home to nearly one in 10
HIV-positive
Americans.

00:47.547 --> 00:54.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN, "Science": New York
has so many
infected people that it has
problems of scale

00:54.521 --> 01:00.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when trying to end an epidemic.
It buys more
drug than anywhere else to treat
HIV-infected

01:00.427 --> 01:01.662 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

01:01.695 --> 01:04.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.331 --> 01:08.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:08.669 --> 01:21.014 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The first
funerals were held
today for the police officers
shot to death

01:21.048 --> 01:27.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by a sniper in Dallas last week.
Thousands
attended memorials for three of
the five victims,

01:27.754 --> 01:33.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
police Senior Corporal Lorne
Ahrens, Police
Sergeant Michael Smith, and
Rapid Transit

01:33.293 --> 01:35.262 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Officer Brent Thompson.

01:35.295 --> 01:38.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thompson's wife, a fellow
officer, spoke at
his service.

01:38.498 --> 01:43.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY THOMPSON, Widow of Brent
Thompson: Brent
loves all of his brothers and
sisters in blue.

01:43.537 --> 01:49.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I encourage you to stand with
me, continue
to wear the badge with me,
remembering the

01:49.076 --> 01:57.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oath we took. We will not, we
cannot, we shall
not let the act of a coward
break us.

01:57.951 --> 02:03.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Elsewhere, the
American Civil
Liberties Union and others sued
the police

02:03.056 --> 02:07.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, over
their treatment
of protesters.

02:07.194 --> 02:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And President Obama called in
police chiefs,
mayors and civil rights
activists to talk

02:12.399 --> 02:15.335 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about building trust between
police and minorities.

02:15.369 --> 02:20.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: China today rejected
an international
court's ruling against its
claims in the South

02:20.741 --> 02:26.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
China Sea. Chinese planes made
test landings
on newly built artificial
islands. And, in

02:26.913 --> 02:32.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beijing, the Foreign Ministry
said it may
impose an air defense zone over
the region.

02:32.519 --> 02:35.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LU KANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesman
(through translator): China
firmly upholds

02:36.023 --> 02:40.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the dignity and solemnity of
international
law. We will by no means agree
upon the sheer

02:40.527 --> 02:45.132 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fallacy that the award from an
illegal arbitration
tribunal is legally binding.

02:45.165 --> 02:50.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Taiwan also
condemned the tribunal's
ruling. It has similar
territorial claims

02:50.937 --> 02:52.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to those of mainland China.

02:52.739 --> 02:57.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Nearly 50 more
U.S. troops
arrived in South Sudan's capital
today to

02:58.011 --> 03:04.084 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
protest American citizens and --
protect,
I should say, American citizens
and property.

03:04.117 --> 03:09.156 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That follows days of fighting
between rival
factions, until a cease-fire
yesterday.

03:09.189 --> 03:14.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, U.N. peacekeepers
helped evacuate
civilians from the city today.
There were

03:14.761 --> 03:20.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also reports that armed men have
attacked
people trying to flee, and
demanded money.

03:20.100 --> 03:24.404 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, Wall Street
took a pause from its recent
rally. The Dow

03:24.438 --> 03:32.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jones industrial average gained
24 points
to close at 18372. The Nasdaq
fell 17 points,

03:32.245 --> 03:35.382 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the S&amp;P 500 added a
fraction.

03:35.415 --> 03:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still to come on
the "NewsHour":
a new prime minister moves into
10 Downing

03:40.020 --> 03:46.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Street; who could fill the vice
presidential
slot for Donald Trump?; New
York's daunting

03:46.226 --> 03:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
task of defeating AIDS; and much
more.

03:53.133 --> 04:06.980 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The United Kingdom
has a new prime
minister, and her name is
Theresa May. Only

04:07.013 --> 04:12.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the second woman ever to hold
the office,
May takes over the top job after
an extraordinarily

04:12.919 --> 04:18.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rapid turn of events following
last month's
popular vote to exit the
European Union.

04:19.025 --> 04:24.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We begin our coverage from
London with this
report from Chris Ship of
Independent Television

04:24.631 --> 04:26.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
News.

04:26.399 --> 04:31.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS SHIP: Less than three
weeks as print
voted in the E.U. referendum, a
new prime

04:31.071 --> 04:36.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minister, Theresa May, was
walking along Downing
Street and a new political
chapter was beginning

04:36.977 --> 04:43.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in British history. Not just a
new occupant
in the building, but a new
direction, as Mrs.

04:43.517 --> 04:47.454 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
May made clear from her first
words in her
new job.

04:47.487 --> 04:51.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
THERESA MAY, British Prime
Minister: I have
just been to Buckingham Palace,
where Her

04:51.491 --> 04:58.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Majesty the Queen has asked me
to form a new
government, and I accepted.

04:58.265 --> 05:04.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government I lead will be
driven not by
the interests of the privileged
few, but by

05:04.838 --> 05:11.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
yours. We are living through an
important
moment in our country's history.
Following

05:11.111 --> 05:17.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the referendum, we face a time
of great national
change. And I know, because we
are Great Britain,

05:17.951 --> 05:24.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that we will rise to the
challenge. As we
leave the European Union, we
will forge a

05:24.391 --> 05:27.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bold, new, positive role for
ourselves in
the world.

05:27.894 --> 05:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS SHIP: Theresa May became
the 76th prime
minister of the United Kingdom
and only the

05:33.433 --> 05:37.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
second woman ever to hold the
post, after
driving the short distance from
Westminster

05:37.938 --> 05:39.806 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to Buckingham Palace.

05:39.839 --> 05:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mrs. May and husband Philip
arrived in the
courtyard just a few minutes
after David Cameron

05:44.778 --> 05:50.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had tendered his resignation as
prime minister.
This was the moment Theresa May
was invited

05:50.750 --> 05:55.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to form a government of her own
by Her Majesty
the Queen.

05:55.188 --> 06:01.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, a new prime minister
entering Downing
Street means the old one must
leave. And David

06:01.494 --> 06:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cameron did leave today, his
wife, Samantha,
his daughters Nancy and
Florence, his son

06:06.766 --> 06:08.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Elwen by his side.

06:08.635 --> 06:11.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON, Former British
Prime Minister:
It's not been an easy journey,
and, of course,

06:11.238 --> 06:16.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have not got every decision
right, but
I do believe that, today, our
country is much

06:16.977 --> 06:23.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stronger. It has been the
greatest honor of
my life to serve our country as
prime minister

06:23.283 --> 06:29.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over these last six years and to
serve as
leader of my party for almost 11
years.

06:29.256 --> 06:38.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as we leave for the last
time, my only
wish is continued success for
this great country

06:38.098 --> 06:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that i love so very much.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.301 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.069 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

06:43.103 --> 06:47.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS SHIP: Mr. Cameron's final
performance
in front of M.P.s had happened
earlier in

06:47.240 --> 06:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the day, his last ever prime
minister's questions.

06:51.611 --> 06:58.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Cheers first greeted Theresa
May, and then
cheers for the man Mrs. May was
about to replace.

06:59.019 --> 07:02.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON: Mr. Speaker this
morning, I
had meetings with ministerial
colleagues and

07:02.756 --> 07:07.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
others. Other than one meeting
this afternoon
with Her Majesty the Queen, the
diary for

07:07.627 --> 07:09.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the rest of the day is
remarkably light.

07:09.562 --> 07:11.264 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:11.298 --> 07:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS SHIP: Next week, it will
be Theresa
May's turn. Today, though, she
was just a

07:13.633 --> 07:15.368 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spectator.

07:15.402 --> 07:20.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CAMERON: Nothing is really
impossible
if you put your mind to it.
After all, as

07:20.440 --> 07:23.043 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I once said, I was the future
once.

07:23.076 --> 07:24.911 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:24.944 --> 07:32.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS SHIP: But he is not the
future. He is
now the past. His job in this
place was done.

07:32.752 --> 07:40.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her job, however, is just
beginning tonight.
The black door of Number 10 has
a new occupant.

07:40.327 --> 07:45.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Joining me now to
discuss today's
historic events and this
remarkable time in

07:45.865 --> 07:50.770 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the U.K. is Sir Peter
Westmacott, a longtime
diplomat in the British Foreign
Service. He

07:50.804 --> 07:55.375 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
left his post as British
ambassador to the
U.S. earlier this year, and
served before

07:55.408 --> 07:58.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that as ambassador to France and
Turkey.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.013 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Ambassador, welcome.

08:00.046 --> 08:05.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's been a head-spinning day, a
head-spinning
time. How are things now doing
in Britain?

08:05.552 --> 08:07.354 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What can you tell us about
Britain now?

08:07.387 --> 08:08.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR PETER WESTMACOTT, Former
British Ambassador
to the United States: Well, it's
good to be

08:08.822 --> 08:10.623 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with you again.

08:10.657 --> 08:14.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think we're all still a bit
shell-shocked,
but I think the main change
that's happened

08:14.961 --> 08:19.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the less than three weeks,
can you believe
it, since the referendum is that
even those

08:19.232 --> 08:23.870 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who thought it was the
wrong outcome
and felt that the campaign to
leave the European

08:23.903 --> 08:29.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union was based on a lot of
misrepresentation
and fraudulent facts and so on,
everybody

08:29.442 --> 08:33.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has more or less come to terms
with the fact
that this is going to happen,
the negotiations

08:33.513 --> 08:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are going to begin, even if many
of us believe
that, at some point before the
deed is done,

08:38.752 --> 08:42.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the British people will need to
be consulted
again, either in a general
election or in

08:42.689 --> 08:45.258 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
another referendum and so on.

08:45.291 --> 08:51.564 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, meanwhile, the political
drama has accelerated
with great speed. David Cameron,
prime minister,

08:51.598 --> 08:56.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chose to resign, thought that he
was going
to be there until the 9th of
September, and,

08:56.236 --> 09:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
boom, suddenly, in a couple of
days, because
there was no other candidate but
Theresa May

09:00.874 --> 09:05.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to succeed him, he finds that
the removal
van has arrived and he's left
and he's been

09:05.845 --> 09:10.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to see the queen. And we have a
new prime
minister and we have half a new
Cabinet, well,

09:10.450 --> 09:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not quite half, but a number of
senior positions
already announced.

09:13.787 --> 09:20.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think the mood is one of
some surprise,
amazement at how quickly things
move, and

09:20.794 --> 09:22.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming to terms with new
realities.

09:22.595 --> 09:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tell us about
Theresa May. You
know her. Tell us what we can
expect of her.

09:27.033 --> 09:31.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR PETER WESTMACOTT: Well, I
knew her, saw
a good deal of her when she came
to stay with

09:31.438 --> 09:36.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
us when I was ambassador in
France, when we
had big migration issues, and
also, of course,

09:36.042 --> 09:37.877 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
when she used to come to
Washington.

09:37.911 --> 09:43.783 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think she's a very
businesslike, no-nonsense
person. She's not someone who
has cliquey

09:43.817 --> 09:50.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
personal entourages. She is very
grounded.
she comes from a humble,
straightforward background,

09:50.890 --> 09:56.062 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a vicar's daughter. And I'm a
vicar's son
myself, so I can say these
things.

09:56.095 --> 10:01.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is very professional. She
does her homework.
She likes to get her way, I
would say. And

10:01.801 --> 10:06.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she makes up her mind and she's
pretty hard
to shift unless you are very,
very sure of

10:06.473 --> 10:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your ground. But she has made a
couple of
speeches in the last day or two
which are

10:10.076 --> 10:15.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
extraordinarily inclusive and
very centrist,
even, I would say, and quite
surprising for

10:15.048 --> 10:19.886 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
somebody who was considered to
be on the right
of the Conservative Party, about
the importance

10:19.919 --> 10:23.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the British people coming
together and
of a government which is for all
the people

10:23.957 --> 10:25.658 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and not just the privileged few.

10:25.692 --> 10:29.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that may have
surprised a few
people, but encouraged a lot of
people as

10:29.195 --> 10:31.030 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
well.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: She moved quickly
today to fill
her Cabinet, including making
Boris Johnson,

10:34.033 --> 10:40.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who declined to run for prime
minister, her
-- to make her foreign minister,
and Philip

10:40.707 --> 10:45.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hammond her finance minister.
These are the
two men who are going to have
execute these

10:46.012 --> 10:47.714 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Brexit negotiations.

10:47.747 --> 10:51.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR PETER WESTMACOTT: Well, they
are, but
they're also going to have one
other key player

10:51.284 --> 10:56.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is going to be the leader of the
negotiation,
of whatever it's going to be
called, the department

10:56.322 --> 10:59.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the withdrawal from the
European Union,
who is going to be David Davis.

10:59.993 --> 11:06.165 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Philip Hammond, you're
right, my old boss,
extremely knowledgeable about
accounts, numbers,

11:06.199 --> 11:11.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an experienced negotiator,
understands budgets,
sorted out the finances of the
Ministry of

11:11.504 --> 11:15.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Defense when he was defense
secretary, he's
gone to Treasury. And I think
that is an appointment

11:15.975 --> 11:17.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that will be widely welcomed.

11:17.777 --> 11:22.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the appointment of Boris
to the Foreign
Office was probably a surprise
as much to

11:22.315 --> 11:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him as to many other people,
because after
the referendum, which seemed --
the result

11:26.786 --> 11:31.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of which seemed to surprise him,
he didn't
appear to be quite clear what he
did next

11:31.457 --> 11:36.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and made a number of statements
which suggested
that nothing was going to change
between Britain's

11:37.030 --> 11:38.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
relationship and the European
Union.

11:38.965 --> 11:42.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think he will be thrilled.
Obviously,
he's visibly delighted to go to
the Foreign

11:42.168 --> 11:49.175 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Office, born in the United
States of America,
partly Turkish, partly American,
great cosmopolitan,

11:49.208 --> 11:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
extremely cultured man, speaks
lots of languages.

11:52.245 --> 11:57.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He will have a wonderful time in
the Foreign
Office. And he will not, I
suspect,be in the

11:57.050 --> 12:01.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
lead of these particular
negotiations. I think
that will be left to the other
ministers largely,

12:01.454 --> 12:05.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I'm not sure about that.
That depends
very much on how the prime
minister handles

12:05.625 --> 12:07.360 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And my guess is that her own
relationship
with Angela Merkel is going to
be critical

12:09.829 --> 12:11.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to the success of those
negotiations, too.

12:11.898 --> 12:17.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Does David Cameron
leaving the
scene so quickly today, does he
leave behind

12:17.770 --> 12:19.839 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a legacy of failure or success?

12:19.872 --> 12:25.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SIR PETER WESTMACOTT: I think
(INAUDIBLE)
probably, some good stuff, some
bad stuff.

12:25.878 --> 12:30.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think my own view is that the
grand coalition
that he was bold enough to
create when he

12:30.850 --> 12:36.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
didn't win a majority in the
general election
in 2010 was a remarkable piece
of political

12:36.155 --> 12:40.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
accomplishment. I think the
coalition government
between the Lib Dems and the
Conservatives

12:40.460 --> 12:45.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worked very well for the first
parliamentary
term between 2010 and 2015.

12:45.098 --> 12:49.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In some ways, it smoothed the
corners, if
you like, of the policies of
each party. And

12:49.035 --> 12:52.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
demonstrably the prime minister
and Deputy
Prime Minister Nick Clegg got on
very well.

12:52.872 --> 12:56.976 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think they got some good
business done,
so I think that was a plus.

12:57.010 --> 13:02.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the way in which he got
the British
economy going after the meltdown
of 2008 and

13:02.315 --> 13:06.586 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2009 was pretty remarkable. The
United Kingdom
has a level of unemployment
which is less

13:06.619 --> 13:10.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than half the European average.
We have been
growing at the fastest rate of
any European

13:10.590 --> 13:14.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union country for the last three
years. Along
the United States, we have been
leading the

13:14.494 --> 13:16.295 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Western democracies out of
recession.

13:16.329 --> 13:21.534 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They have cut the deficit by
more than half.
So I think the economic story
will be a plus

13:21.567 --> 13:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for David Cameron. And running
the referendum
and winning it on Scotland was a
plus. People

13:28.107 --> 13:31.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said at the time it was a
gamble, but, in
the end, there was a 10-point
difference,

13:31.077 --> 13:34.180 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so that kept Scotland in the
United Kingdom.

13:34.213 --> 13:37.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his legacy inevitably is
going to one
which is colored by the fact
that he took

13:37.850 --> 13:42.689 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
something of a gamble in
organizing this referendum
because his own party had become
somewhat

13:42.722 --> 13:49.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ungovernable, believed that he
could win if
it came to the referendum
actually being held.

13:49.062 --> 13:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And alas for him and alas for,
in my view,
many of us, it didn't work out.

13:54.267 --> 13:58.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the United Kingdom is
leaving, and
I think that the United
Kingdom's decision

13:58.171 --> 14:03.042 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to vote to leave the European
Union is inevitably
going to be one of the main
features of David

14:03.076 --> 14:04.844 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Cameron's political legacy.

14:04.877 --> 14:08.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Former British
Ambassador to the
United States Peter Westmacott,
thank you

14:08.414 --> 14:10.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very much.

14:10.249 --> 14:18.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIR PETER WESTMACOTT: Thank you.

14:18.558 --> 14:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: For Republicans,
the countdown
to their national convention in
Cleveland

14:28.034 --> 14:32.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is on, with a major focus on who
will be the
vice presidential choice.

14:33.005 --> 14:38.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The party's nominee-to-be spent
this day working
to answer that question.

14:38.244 --> 14:44.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Donald Trump and Indiana
Governor Mike Pence,
after meeting this morning in
Indianapolis.

14:44.550 --> 14:47.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Pence also appeared with Trump
last night
at a rally.

14:47.286 --> 14:52.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. MIKE PENCE (R), Indiana: We
are ready
to put a fighter, a builder, and
a patriot

14:52.525 --> 14:58.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Oval Office of the United
States of
America. We're ready for Donald
Trump to be

14:58.631 --> 14:59.699 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
our next president.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

15:01.601 --> 15:05.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Alabama Senator
Jeff Sessions
met with Trump today, too, as
did former House

15:05.938 --> 15:12.011 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Speaker Newt Gingrich. He had
served as warm-up
act in Ohio last week.

15:12.044 --> 15:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On FOX News yesterday, Gingrich
likened the
veep search to a certain reality
show.

15:17.483 --> 15:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH (R), Former
Speaker of the House:
It's a little bit like "The
Apprentice." You

15:20.453 --> 15:23.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
find out sooner or later who is
the last one
standing is.

15:23.589 --> 15:28.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: New Jersey
Governor Chris Christie
huddled with the candidate
yesterday, after

15:28.327 --> 15:31.497 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
campaigning with him Monday in
Virginia.

15:31.531 --> 15:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump told The Wall Street
Journal yesterday
that he wants a running mate who
can go on

15:35.935 --> 15:42.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the attack to answer the attacks
on him. That
means going after his Democratic
opponent,

15:42.608 --> 15:49.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton. She appeared
today in Springfield,
Illinois, where President
Lincoln long ago

15:49.115 --> 15:52.518 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
warned of a house divided.
Clinton singled
out Trump.

15:52.552 --> 15:57.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
His campaign is as divisive as
any we have

15:57.623 --> 16:08.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
seen in our lifetimes. It is
built on stoking
mistrust and pitting American
against American.

16:08.167 --> 16:14.640 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But Trump is also
taking fire
from an unexpected quarter,
Supreme Court

16:14.674 --> 16:20.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In
recent days,
she told The New York Times --
quote -- "I

16:20.546 --> 16:25.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can't imagine what the country
would be with
Donald Trump as our president."

16:25.384 --> 16:32.191 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ginsburg made similar remarks in
other interviews,
and Trump fired back in an
early-morning tweet.

16:32.225 --> 16:37.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said Ginsburg -- quote --
"embarrassed
all by making very dumb
political statements

16:38.030 --> 16:41.868 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about me. Her mind is shot.
Resign."

16:41.901 --> 16:47.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It was amid that furor that
Trump's camp said
he was aiming to make a final
running mate

16:47.573 --> 16:50.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
decision by Friday.

16:50.376 --> 16:55.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we unpack it all now with
Susan Page,
Washington bureau chief for USA
Today, and

16:55.381 --> 16:59.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Costa, national political
reporter
at The Washington Post.

16:59.852 --> 17:04.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a lot to talk about,
but, Susan,
let's start with the veep search
on Donald

17:04.257 --> 17:10.429 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's part, very public. What
do you make
of this process, including his
children, and

17:10.463 --> 17:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
all these interviews? And does
it come down
to these three or four people?

17:13.599 --> 17:15.668 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
This is just one more way in
which Donald

17:15.701 --> 17:18.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump has changed the way we
view politics,
how politics works.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The vice presidential search is
usually something
that's very coy. They're talking
to the people

17:22.909 --> 17:26.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who are being talked about, say
they're not
interesting or try to tamp down
speculation

17:27.013 --> 17:32.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about it. In this case, we have
had tryouts
in front of our eyes about
whether they can

17:32.184 --> 17:34.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be at a rally with Trump, how
they connect
with him.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So that has been different, and
I think that's
been a good thing. I think we're
seeing now

17:37.890 --> 17:42.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a debate between Donald
Trump's head and
his heart, because his head says
Mike Pence

17:42.261 --> 17:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a guy who rounds out his
resume, who gives
him some unity with parts of the
Republican

17:47.066 --> 17:51.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Party like evangelicals and Tea
Party types
that he does haven't the best
relationships

17:51.270 --> 17:53.039 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
with.

17:53.072 --> 17:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I bet his heart is saying
Gingrich or
Chris Christie or just guys he
would prefer

17:57.276 --> 18:02.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be around and rather see in
that debate
against Hillary Clinton's vice
presidential

18:02.214 --> 18:03.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
candidate.

18:03.983 --> 18:05.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Costa,
what are you
learning about all this? Where
do you think

18:05.785 --> 18:07.386 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Donald Trump is right now in
this?

18:07.420 --> 18:09.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA, The Washington
Post: I think
Susan's spot-on with her
analysis.

18:09.388 --> 18:14.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What I'm hearing from Trump
campaign associates
is that Pence is at the top of
the list for

18:14.393 --> 18:19.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many of the family members who
traveled with
Trump today in Indiana. Paul
Manafort, the

18:19.365 --> 18:24.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign chairman, is also said
to be inclined
toward the Indiana governor.

18:24.303 --> 18:27.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But that means -- that doesn't
necessarily
mean that Trump has made a
decision. He's

18:27.506 --> 18:33.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flying to California tonight
with a populist
conservative from Alabama,
Senator Jeff Sessions.

18:33.212 --> 18:36.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he is continuing to try to
think through
his options, wondering whether
he wants an

18:36.382 --> 18:39.885 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack dog or, as Susan said,
someone to round
out that resume.

18:39.919 --> 18:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, Susan, so
what does that
say to us that it's narrowed
down to these

18:46.192 --> 18:50.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
four, and including, as Robert
said, Senator
Sessions from Alabama?

18:50.629 --> 18:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Yes, and we're not
quite sure
why Senator Sessions is on that
list. He was

18:54.433 --> 18:59.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an early supporter, and this may
be a way
to say thank you to Senator
Sessions for standing

18:59.271 --> 19:01.040 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

19:01.073 --> 19:05.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It tells us he chose only men.
The standard
political calculation would have
had a woman

19:05.611 --> 19:09.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in that mix as a finalist,
especially since
Donald Trump had some trouble
with women voters.

19:09.448 --> 19:14.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't do that. And it's
people who want
to be on the ticket with him.

19:14.787 --> 19:18.691 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's not coaxing somebody who's
reluctant
to be on the ticket. He's going
to choose

19:18.724 --> 19:21.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
somebody who is out there
comfortable auditioning
for it.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.329 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Eager for it.

19:23.362 --> 19:26.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, Robert Costa, what do you
make again
of the process? I mean, it stuck
that he has

19:26.532 --> 19:30.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his grown children in these
meetings. How
typical is that?

19:30.569 --> 19:32.438 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: It's atypical.

19:32.471 --> 19:37.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump doesn't really function
with a normal
political organization. He
counts on his family

19:37.743 --> 19:43.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for counsel and some advisers.
But this is
someone who operates by making a
lot of phone

19:43.449 --> 19:47.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
calls, bringing in friends and
different people
who he's been with throughout
his life and

19:47.853 --> 19:52.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
soliciting their advice, their
take on the
vice presidential search.

19:52.158 --> 19:57.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he's getting a lot of
political calculations
thrown his way, but what's most
important

19:57.229 --> 20:01.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Trump, if you read his books
or if you
speak to him himself, he wants a
rapport,

20:01.667 --> 20:03.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he wants a connection, someone
he can trust.

20:03.536 --> 20:07.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan, let's turn
to -- well,
we will find out soon enough.
We're told it

20:07.339 --> 20:10.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to happen either
Thursday or Friday
of this week.

20:10.042 --> 20:16.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's turn to this really
remarkable, I guess,
series of criticisms that the
Supreme Court

20:16.248 --> 20:19.652 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has
launched on
Donald Trump. Very unusual.

20:19.685 --> 20:23.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Never in modern
times have we
seen these kind of exchanges.

20:23.756 --> 20:27.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When justices in the past have
had a slip
of the tongue, as Sandra Day
O'Connor did

20:27.993 --> 20:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on election night in 2000, it
hasn't been
the kind of deliberate attempt
we have seen

20:31.997 --> 20:35.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by Justice Ginsburg. She didn't
just say this
once. She said it to the
Associated Press,

20:35.734 --> 20:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then she said it The New
York Times, and
then she said it to Joan
Biskupic.

20:38.771 --> 20:44.610 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this was a message she
wanted to get out.
And it's managed to get The Post
and The Times

20:44.643 --> 20:50.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to editorialize on Trump's side.
So, that
is something very rare in this
election season.

20:50.249 --> 20:54.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Robert Costa, how
is the Trump
campaign seeing this? As
somebody who covers

20:54.787 --> 21:00.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
politics, how unusual does it
look to you
to hear a Supreme Court justice
going after

21:00.392 --> 21:02.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a political candidate?

21:02.328 --> 21:04.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: It is unusual.

21:04.130 --> 21:08.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But inside of the Trump campaign
today in
Indiana, they are framing the
justice's comments

21:08.834 --> 21:13.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as condescension, condescension
that Trump
may try to use, in his mind, for
political

21:13.873 --> 21:18.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advantage by running as someone
who's politically
incorrect, anti-establishment.
They think

21:18.611 --> 21:23.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this kind of battle playing out
in public
could be useful to Trump in the
coming months

21:23.082 --> 21:26.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as he tries to solidify himself
as someone
who is an outsider.

21:26.185 --> 21:29.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's my
question, Susan.
What kind of -- does something
like this have

21:29.555 --> 21:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
consequences down the road?

21:31.257 --> 21:34.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: I'm not sure this is
very -- I'm
not sure this has big
consequences.

21:34.193 --> 21:38.631 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think if you agree with
Justice Ginsburg,
you probably think, hey, great,
I'm glad she

21:38.664 --> 21:41.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
spoke up. If you disagree with
her, you're
probably on Trump's side. There
are going

21:42.001 --> 21:45.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be a lot of things that are
very important
in this election. And I think
this is one

21:45.037 --> 21:49.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the things that's more
interesting of the
moment than something with
lasting political

21:49.542 --> 21:51.343 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
consequences.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The last thing I
want to ask
you both about is what's been
going on already

21:53.145 --> 21:58.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Cleveland this week, and that
is meetings
of different Republican
committees.

21:58.217 --> 22:01.520 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of them has to do with the
convention,
one of them, Robert, having to
do with the

22:01.554 --> 22:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
platform. It is looking to be a
pretty conservative
document. What do we know about
that? What

22:07.660 --> 22:10.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does that say to us? Should we
even be paying
attention to it?

22:10.329 --> 22:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COSTA: The platform is
very ideologically
conservative.

22:13.699 --> 22:17.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is a way the Trump
campaign and the
Republican National Committee
believe they

22:17.803 --> 22:21.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can make an overture to the
elements of the
Republican Party that are
disgruntled about

22:21.907 --> 22:25.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump's nomination. And they are
saying, look,
Trump may be more centrist and
populist on

22:25.844 --> 22:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of these issues, but when
it comes to
the party, we're still down the
line, even

22:29.548 --> 22:31.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hard-line conservative.

22:31.550 --> 22:35.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's most important here is
that the Republican
National Committee is trying to
tamp down

22:35.754 --> 22:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any kind of revolt or uprising
among these
delegates against Trump. And
Republican Chairman

22:41.560 --> 22:44.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Priebus is working closely with
Trump to ensure
that doesn't happen.

22:44.296 --> 22:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, they're using
this as a
way to tamp down disagreement?

22:48.434 --> 22:53.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: But they're creating
big problems
for themselves with some of the
groups that

22:53.038 --> 22:58.077 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
after that -- in that autopsy
they did after
the 2012 defeat, they said they
needed to

22:58.110 --> 23:02.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do -- they needed to do, for
instance, more
to reach out to young people, to
African-Americans,

23:02.381 --> 23:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to Hispanics, to gay people.

23:04.149 --> 23:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This platform doesn't do any of
that. The
stance on gay rights, on gay
marriage is more

23:09.021 --> 23:14.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative than the platform
that was enacted
in 2012. So, in terms of
appealing, say, to

23:14.827 --> 23:17.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
millennials, this is not going
to do the Republican
Party any good.

23:17.229 --> 23:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You were telling
me that it
has even language in there about
requiring

23:20.499 --> 23:23.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- looking at conversion therapy
for individuals
who are gay.

23:23.669 --> 23:28.507 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: It has language that
approves
of parents using this
controversial technique

23:28.540 --> 23:32.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
called conversion therapy for
their gay children.
That's something that even Chris
Christie

23:32.645 --> 23:34.380 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
signed a law banning.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just quickly,
Robert, so
are these things that we can
expect Donald

23:38.017 --> 23:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump to try to implement?

23:40.419 --> 23:42.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT COSTA: Unlikely.

23:42.187 --> 23:46.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you look at Donald Trump, he
had a phone
call in recent weeks with
Caitlyn Jenner.

23:46.191 --> 23:50.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's someone who comes out of
Manhattan. He's
comfortable with people of all
different backgrounds

23:50.863 --> 23:55.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and orientations. He's not a
social conservative.
He's never really been a
traditional social

23:55.801 --> 24:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conservative, but he's running
to be the standard
bearer of a party the Times
Square has moved

24:00.072 --> 24:01.974 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
increasingly to the right.

24:02.007 --> 24:04.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, some
interesting questions.
And we will be looking at it at
the convention

24:04.810 --> 24:06.545 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
next week.

24:06.578 --> 24:10.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Robert Costa with The Washington
Post, Susan
Page with USA Today, we will see
you both.

24:10.816 --> 24:13.552 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thanks.

24:13.585 --> 24:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Next, we continue
our series The
End of AIDS.

24:26.865 --> 24:31.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, we go to New York
state, where health
care providers are trying
innovative approaches

24:31.804 --> 24:37.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bring HIV infection under
control. While
pushing widespread use of the
HIV prevention

24:37.676 --> 24:44.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
drug Truvada, they are also
trying to expand
care to the state's
hardest-to-reach populations.

24:44.416 --> 24:48.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Correspondent William Brangham
and producer
Jason Kane continue their
reporting, which

24:48.287 --> 24:52.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is supported by the Pulitzer
Center on Crisis
Reporting.

24:52.524 --> 24:58.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This might not
look like
a breeding ground for HIV, and
Tina Wolf might

24:58.664 --> 25:01.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not look like a typical health
worker, but
she is.

25:01.900 --> 25:06.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her windblown drives across Long
Island, New
York, are part of a statewide
effort to get

25:06.405 --> 25:11.844 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out of clinics and medical
centers to find
hard-to-reach people. Wolf
recently started

25:11.877 --> 25:17.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a needle exchange program for
injection drug
users. Sharing infected needles
is one of

25:17.449 --> 25:19.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the most efficient ways to
spread HIV.

25:19.118 --> 25:23.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, each day, she and a small
staff pack up
hundreds of clean syringes.

25:23.389 --> 25:26.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA WOLF, Community Action for
Social Justice:
I brought 200, so we need
another 200 29-gauge

25:26.892 --> 25:28.160 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
half-CCs.

25:28.193 --> 25:32.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They load them
into her
hatchback, and head out.

25:32.664 --> 25:38.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York, like so many states,
has a growing
heroin problem. Wolf wants to
stop HIV from

25:38.771 --> 25:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
piggybacking onto that crisis.

25:40.472 --> 25:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA WOLF: It could very well
turn into a
new HIV epidemic if we don't get
ahead of

25:46.245 --> 25:48.213 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it in terms of syringe exchange
right now.

25:48.247 --> 25:52.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In
middle-class neighborhoods
throughout the island, Wolf goes
to meet her

25:52.317 --> 25:52.785 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
clients.

25:52.818 --> 25:53.452 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEN, New York: Hi.

25:53.485 --> 25:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TINA WOLF: Hey, how are you?

25:54.353 --> 25:56.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEN: Good. How are you?

25:56.155 --> 25:58.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Today, she
meets with this
woman, a woman who prefers only
to be known

25:58.323 --> 25:59.591 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as Jen.

25:59.625 --> 26:02.494 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEN: It's perfect timing,
because I ran out
two days ago.

26:02.528 --> 26:06.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Most needle
exchanges would
require Jen to come to them, but
Wolf makes

26:06.498 --> 26:12.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
house calls. Before these
deliveries, Jen
says she and her boyfriend would
reuse needles

26:12.738 --> 26:17.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
until they became dull as butter
knives. And
even though Jen knows lots of
people with

26:17.776 --> 26:20.078 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HIV, she's shared needles in the
past.

26:20.112 --> 26:23.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEN: You're not going to say,
oh, I'm going
to wait until I get a new one.
You're going

26:23.682 --> 26:27.119 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to wait until the person who's
in the car
with you is done. Maybe you will
rinse it

26:27.152 --> 26:32.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out with the bottle of water in
the car, and
you get high, and you don't
think about it.

26:32.357 --> 26:35.627 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That
needle-sharing is what
public health officials say
drove the recent

26:35.661 --> 26:39.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HIV outbreak in Austin, Indiana,
which prompted
a state of emergency there.

26:39.798 --> 26:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEN: I have done things that
other people
have done, and they have ended
up with all

26:44.570 --> 26:49.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different diseases. So, I feel
like, with
Tina, I can avoid all that now.

26:49.942 --> 26:57.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GOV. ANDREW CUOMO (D), New York:
We will not
stop until we add AIDS to the
list of conquered

26:57.082 --> 26:58.851 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
killers!

26:58.884 --> 27:02.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last year, New
York Governor
Andrew Cuomo pledged $200
million to ramp

27:02.287 --> 27:08.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
up efforts statewide to end the
AIDS epidemic
here by 2020. Their aim is to
cut the rate

27:08.527 --> 27:13.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of new HIV infections below the
rate of HIV-related
deaths.

27:13.098 --> 27:17.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But New York, one of the states
hardest-hit
by the epidemic over the years,
still has

27:17.769 --> 27:23.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enormous challenges. Nearly one
in 10 people
with HIV in America lives here.
That's an

27:23.175 --> 27:27.913 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
estimated 154,000 HIV-positive
New Yorkers.

27:27.946 --> 27:33.519 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Approximately 3,000 people are
diagnosed statewide
every year. And, here,
minorities bear the

27:33.552 --> 27:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
brunt of the infections. An
estimated 70 percent
of new cases are among blacks
and Latinos.

27:39.992 --> 27:44.496 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jon Cohen has been covering
HIV/AIDS for more
than 25 years for "Science"
magazine, and

27:44.530 --> 27:50.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helped us report this series. He
says New
York's plan is bold, but the
state has a tremendous

27:50.035 --> 27:51.870 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
challenge ahead.

27:51.904 --> 27:56.441 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JON COHEN, "Science": New York
has so many
infected people that it has
problems of scale

27:56.475 --> 28:02.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
when trying to end an epidemic.
It buys more
drug than anywhere else to treat
HIV-infected

28:02.047 --> 28:08.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people. It has to track, monitor
more HIV-infected
people. It has to address the
failures that

28:08.887 --> 28:15.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are far larger than anywhere
else in a way
that's just more overwhelming
than any other

28:15.127 --> 28:16.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
jurisdiction in the country
faces.

28:16.862 --> 28:20.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Step one for
public health
workers is finding those who are
infected

28:20.666 --> 28:24.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and don't know it. They're the
most likely
drivers of new HIV cases.

28:24.636 --> 28:26.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: I love this outreach here.

28:26.538 --> 28:30.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: An estimated
22,000 New
Yorkers fit that bill.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, how do you identify them?

28:32.177 --> 28:34.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: So, what we would want to
do is look
for like hiding spots right now.

28:34.813 --> 28:39.117 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Here in
Harlem, sometimes,
that looks like an adult version
of hide and

28:39.151 --> 28:40.819 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
seek.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: So, usually, like, you will
see them
standing up there, like along
the railing.

28:43.655 --> 28:48.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Robert Gamboa
and Jose Velez
(ph) work for the Harlem
Prevention Center.

28:48.260 --> 28:53.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's part of an organization
called ICAP out
of Columbia University. Their
job is reaching

28:53.098 --> 28:58.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out to gay and bisexual men,
encouraging HIV
prevention, and inviting them to
join the

28:58.403 --> 28:59.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
center's research.

28:59.671 --> 29:02.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Behind the tree over here,
that's clearly
out of view.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.610 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Hmm. Oh.

29:04.643 --> 29:09.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: They target
well-known cruising
spots where men often have sex.
Gamboa sees

29:09.181 --> 29:12.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a couple having oral sex behind
a tree, and
he doesn't hesitate.

29:12.651 --> 29:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: What up, man? I work with
Harlem Prevention
Center. We do research studies.

29:17.923 --> 29:22.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Each new HIV
infection that's
prevented saves almost
half-a-million dollars

29:22.628 --> 29:24.396 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in lifetime treatment costs.

29:24.429 --> 29:26.732 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. WAFAA EL-SADR, Director,
ICAP: It would
be very interesting to think of
what we can

29:26.765 --> 29:28.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Dr. Wafaa
El-Sadr oversees
ICAP, which also supports global
HIV prevention

29:31.937 --> 29:36.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and treatment programs. She says
testing as
many people as possible, and
treating them

29:36.675 --> 29:40.312 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as quickly as possible, is one
of the best
tools for ending the epidemic.

29:40.345 --> 29:45.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. WAFAA EL-SADR: Getting those
individuals
into care, on treatment, for
their own benefit,

29:45.450 --> 29:50.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as, of course, to
prevent transmission
from them to others, that's
something that

29:50.656 --> 29:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have to tackle. And that's
usually individuals
who are disenfranchised, afraid,
in denial,

29:57.496 --> 30:01.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stigmatized. So it's a
hard-to-reach population
that we must reach.

30:01.800 --> 30:06.538 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: New York has
also pioneered
other data-driven ways to find
people in need

30:06.571 --> 30:11.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of HIV care. Using Medicaid
information, the
state works in tandem with
specialized insurance

30:11.476 --> 30:17.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
companies like Amida Care to
identify patients
who've stopped having tests or
stopped refilling

30:17.049 --> 30:19.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prescriptions for their HIV
meds.

30:19.584 --> 30:24.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Outreach workers then try to get
them back
into treatment. Right now in New
York, Medicaid

30:24.389 --> 30:29.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
covers half the HIV-positive
people in the
state, so keeping those people
in care is

30:29.428 --> 30:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
crucial. One estimate said
nearly $4 billion
could be saved in New York by
successfully

30:35.200 --> 30:37.602 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
caring for this slice of the
population.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So Amida Care's staff try the
phone first.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: No, she didn't answer.

30:41.339 --> 30:43.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
MAN: OK.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: If that
doesn't work, they
will often head out into the
city to go knock

30:45.210 --> 30:50.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on doors, anything they can do
to get people
back on track.

30:50.282 --> 30:54.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Breaking down the barriers that
keep people
from consistent HIV care is the
next step.

30:54.820 --> 31:00.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A few years ago, that the issue
for Joe Pannell.
He's HIV-positive. And he was
given antiretroviral

31:00.726 --> 31:06.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medications. But he was homeless
then and
addicted to crack and alcohol,
so staying

31:06.131 --> 31:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on those meds was pretty low on
the list of
priorities.

31:08.467 --> 31:12.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE PANNELL, HIV Patient: I
would go to the
doctor and he'd give me
medication, I would

31:12.504 --> 31:17.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sell it. I didn't take it.
Finally ,one of
the doctors told me, he said,
that's suicidal.

31:17.142 --> 31:21.480 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said, everything you're
doing, it sounds
like to me you're trying to kill
yourself.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.248 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hi.

31:23.281 --> 31:26.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: But that all
changed when
he got a roof over his head. New
York says

31:26.218 --> 31:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is their -- quote --
"greatest unmet
need," helping the estimated
10,000 to 12,000

31:31.590 --> 31:35.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HIV-positive New Yorkers who
need housing
assistance.

31:35.327 --> 31:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Joe Pannell now lives in an
apartment complex
run by Housing Works, and not
only do they

31:39.431 --> 31:44.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
provide a home, but residents
here can also
get their HIV treatment in the
same building.

31:44.336 --> 31:49.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES KING, CEO, Housing
Works: Part of
the idea of developing this type
of facility

31:49.174 --> 31:54.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
was that a person living
upstairs, the way
I like to say it is, they can
crawl out of

31:54.346 --> 31:56.615 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bed and they will fall into the
program.

31:56.648 --> 32:02.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Charles King
started Housing
Works. They provide 241 units
for low-income

32:02.120 --> 32:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HIV-positive people in New York.
King was
also instrumental in the
creation of New York's

32:06.424 --> 32:12.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
broader HIV plan. He says
homelessness is
a clear risk factor for
acquiring HIV.

32:12.264 --> 32:18.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHARLES KING: It doesn't matter
what risk
category you fall into, if
you're a gay man,

32:18.937 --> 32:25.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
man who has sex with men,
transgender person,
sex worker. Homelessness
magnifies the vulnerabilities

32:25.177 --> 32:27.946 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that are going to expose you to
HIV.

32:27.979 --> 32:32.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Like the
majority of HIV-positive
residents in Housing Works,
Pannell is now

32:32.551 --> 32:37.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taking his antiretroviral drugs
regularly.
The virus is now undetectable in
his blood.

32:37.923 --> 32:42.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His life is back on track, he
says. Long-lost
family members are reaching out
to him again.

32:42.460 --> 32:46.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOE PANNELL: Since I came here,
all of these
things reoccurred in my life. My
daughter

32:46.097 --> 32:52.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
called me one night, and said,
"Hi, daddy."
I could not believe it.

32:52.337 --> 32:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Over the last
10 years,
New York has been successfully
bending its

32:58.410 --> 33:04.349 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HIV/AIDS curve, reducing new
infections by
40 percent and reducing the
number of HIV-related

33:04.382 --> 33:06.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deaths by even more.

33:06.084 --> 33:09.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Whether these are enough to
break the back
of the epidemic remains to be
seen.

33:09.354 --> 33:12.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. WAFAA EL-SADR: I think we
can do it. I
think it can be done. I'm not
saying we're

33:13.024 --> 33:16.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
going to go to zero, but I think
we can decrease
the numbers substantially.

33:16.428 --> 33:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Public health
advocates
say that, absent a vaccine or a
cure, the

33:20.932 --> 33:26.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
challenge ahead is maintaining,
and intensifying,
these efforts. They argue ending
AIDS in New

33:26.838 --> 33:30.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
York means prevention has to be
dialed up
and more people brought into
care.

33:31.009 --> 33:36.248 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The state needs increased
housing for the
most vulnerable and sustained
lifetime treatment

33:36.281 --> 33:39.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for tens of thousands of people
for many years
to come.

33:39.618 --> 33:43.388 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham
in New York.

33:43.421 --> 33:48.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Tomorrow night, our
series on
The End of AIDS turns from the
epidemic here

33:48.193 --> 33:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the one in sub-Saharan
Africa, and specifically
to Rwanda, a nation that's
recovered from

33:54.299 --> 33:58.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a genocide, and has now achieved
impressive
results tackling HIV.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.539 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's a preview.

34:00.572 --> 34:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: At this
hospital in a remote
northern area of Rwanda, a small
medical miracle

34:04.943 --> 34:10.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is unfolding. This district,
still in the
grips of an HIV epidemic, has
not recorded

34:10.382 --> 34:16.021 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a single case of mother-to-child
HIV transmissions
for three years.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Similar progress has been
happening throughout
Rwanda, outpacing many other
places in the

34:19.991 --> 34:22.160 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
world, even many in the U.S.

JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

34:40.312 --> 34:45.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour" from
the creator
of New York's High Line comes a
new public

34:45.450 --> 34:49.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
square in Cleveland, just in
time for the
Republican Convention.

34:49.654 --> 34:54.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first: how
science is
increasingly considering the
possibilities

34:54.192 --> 34:59.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of medical marijuana as
conventional medicine
for some cases.

34:59.197 --> 35:04.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Science correspondent Miles
O'Brien has the
second of his two reports on
this for our

35:04.035 --> 35:06.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
weekly series The Leading Edge.

35:06.838 --> 35:13.111 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's a landmark
place, and
time, on the long road to bring
medicinal

35:13.144 --> 35:19.250 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marijuana into the scientific
mainstream.

35:19.284 --> 35:24.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New England Treatment
Access, or NETA,
dispensary in Brookline,
Massachusetts, is

35:24.322 --> 35:33.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
housed in a Beaux-Arts bank
building built
in the 1920s, a cathedral of
cannabis.

35:33.565 --> 35:38.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paul Breeden (ph) has been a
coming here to
treat chronic pain since the
dispensary opened

35:38.036 --> 35:39.771 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in February.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL BREEDEN, Chronic Pain
Patient: I have
been praying for this day all my
life. I have

35:41.706 --> 35:46.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
been fighting for this day all
my life. I'm
a son of a minister. I believe
God created

35:46.244 --> 35:49.347 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
marijuana. Humans don't know how
God works.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Look at that
thing.

35:51.583 --> 35:58.490 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NETA is a nonprofit, serving
about 7,000 medical
marijuana customers now. The
goal is to supply

35:58.523 --> 36:04.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
10,000 on an ongoing basis.
Besides dried
flowers and buds that can be
smoked, they

36:05.030 --> 36:10.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
offer pills, vapor cartridges,
creams, tinctures,
brownies, chocolates and
lozenges.

36:10.702 --> 36:15.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL BREEDEN: It's really part
of sort of
the normalization of medical
cannabis. The

36:15.874 --> 36:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
days of Ziploc baggies are over.

36:18.676 --> 36:24.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Norton Arbelaez
is a NETA consultant
who turned to medical marijuana
after he contracted

36:24.783 --> 36:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a staph infection 10 years ago.

36:26.818 --> 36:31.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORTON ARBELAEZ, Consultant, New
England Treatment
Access: I had quite a bit of
pain. I was prescribed

36:31.389 --> 36:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
opiate painkillers. And I made
up a decision,
a very conscious decision to not
take them.

36:37.695 --> 36:44.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I had to find a way to
medicate otherwise.
I did some research, and
cannabis seemed like

36:44.402 --> 36:46.137 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a good choice for me.

36:46.171 --> 36:51.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Arbelaez believes
this classic
old bank is brick-and-mortar
proof pot is

36:51.643 --> 36:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in emerging from prohibition,
not just legally,
but also in the court of public
opinion.

36:56.714 --> 37:01.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NORTON ARBELAEZ: We are coming
out of the
shadows and into the mainstream.
What better

37:01.286 --> 37:06.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way to say that than to be in
such a beautiful
and historic building, the
first, really,

37:06.357 --> 37:11.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this magnitude on the Eastern
Seaboard,
I think is a harbinger of things
to come.

37:11.429 --> 37:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Five minutes away
from the
dispensary, another possible
harbinger.

37:15.767 --> 37:21.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: I can think of no better
place to host
the first annual CannMed
Conference than here

37:21.272 --> 37:23.108 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at Harvard Medical School, so
welcome.

37:23.141 --> 37:24.876 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

37:24.909 --> 37:28.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The first annual
Personalized
Cannabinoid Medicine Conference
at Harvard

37:28.646 --> 37:33.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Medical School in April, an
unprecedented
meeting of the minds in the
world of medicinal

37:33.852 --> 37:35.753 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
marijuana.

37:35.787 --> 37:38.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. RAPHAEL MECHOULAM, Hebrew
University of
Jerusalem: For almost 30 years,
nothing happened.

37:38.690 --> 37:43.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: And the father of
marijuana
research was here to receive a
lifetime achievement

37:43.995 --> 37:50.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
award. Raphael Mechoulam is an
Israeli chemist
who became interested in
cannabis when he

37:50.635 --> 37:52.504 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
began his scientific career.

37:52.537 --> 37:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. RAPHAEL MECHOULAM: And I was
kind of surprised
to find out that the chemistry
of cannabis,

37:58.143 --> 38:06.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an important drug, in my view,
wasn't well-known.
As a matter of fact, we didn't
know at that

38:06.184 --> 38:11.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
time -- I'm speaking of the
early '60s -- the
active compounds had not been
isolated in

38:11.089 --> 38:12.790 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pure form.

38:12.824 --> 38:18.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In 1963, he
identified the
structure of cannabidiol, CBD,
one of the

38:18.363 --> 38:25.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
most medically important
compounds found in
cannabis, and, in 1964, he
isolated the active

38:25.336 --> 38:28.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
component of marijuana,
tetrahydrocannabinol,
THC.

38:28.039 --> 38:35.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. RAPHAEL MECHOULAM: I thought
that as soon
as we know the chemistry and the
pharmacology

38:35.113 --> 38:40.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then the toxicity, and if
there are any
positive effects, companies will
go in and

38:40.485 --> 38:48.693 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
take compounds and go ahead with
clinical
trials, which is true for a
huge, huge number

38:48.726 --> 38:50.528 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of drugs.

38:50.562 --> 38:56.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But this drug is
like no other.
It was made illegal one year
after the 1936

38:56.834 --> 39:02.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
release of a cinematic diatribe
against marijuana
called "Reefer Madness."

39:02.040 --> 39:15.286 align:left position:0%,start line:53.33% size:100%
NORTON ARBELAEZ: It's not so
much the
substance itself. It's who uses
it. The substance
was associated with
Mexican-American and
African-American

39:15.320 --> 39:20.758 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communities. If you look at the
precepts of
"Reefer Madness," it's a pretty,
I would say,

39:20.792 --> 39:23.461 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
embarrassing part of our
national history.

39:23.494 --> 39:29.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: In the U.S.,
marijuana still
remains classified as a Schedule
1 controlled

39:29.100 --> 39:35.440 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
substance, the same category as
heroin, cocaine
and LSD, with tight restrictions
for researchers

39:35.473 --> 39:38.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and no accepted use for medical
treatment.

39:38.576 --> 39:44.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still, Dr. Mechoulam pressed on,
gradually
writing the scientific textbook
on marijuana.

39:44.482 --> 39:50.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But for years, he didn't fully
understand
how and why cannabis works in
our bodies.

39:51.022 --> 39:54.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, in the early '90s, he
had a eureka
moment.

39:54.425 --> 40:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. RAPHAEL MECHOULAM: THC
mimics compounds
which we make called endogenous
cannabinoids,

40:01.499 --> 40:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
which our brain makes, our body
makes. THC
mimics their effects. All this
is called the

40:07.305 --> 40:13.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
endocannabinoid system, and this
endocannabinoid
system seems to be extremely
important.

40:13.411 --> 40:17.715 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Here's how
endocannabinoids
works in our nervous system.

40:17.749 --> 40:23.154 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The nerves that form the
electrical grid of
our body are not continuous
strands of fiber.

40:23.187 --> 40:29.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Instead, there are many gaps in
the wiring.
The nerve ends are called
neurons, the gaps,

40:29.360 --> 40:35.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
synapses. The electrical current
is transmitted
from neuron to neuron across
synapses by chemical

40:35.600 --> 40:38.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
messengers called
neurotransmitters.

40:38.569 --> 40:43.541 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The volume and route of these
signals determines
what we are thinking, what we
perceive and

40:43.574 --> 40:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what we feel. Our body generates
cannabinoids
to help regulate the flow of
these neurotransmitters.

40:51.783 --> 40:56.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Scientists suspect the active
ingredient in
cannabis, THC, can either can
increase or

40:56.888 --> 41:02.660 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
decrease the flow of the
neurotransmitters.
And this can have all kinds of
impacts on

41:02.694 --> 41:04.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our physical state of being.

41:04.495 --> 41:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. RAPHAEL MECHOULAM: The
endocannabinoid
system is involved in
essentially all human

41:09.901 --> 41:11.736 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
diseases.

41:11.769 --> 41:16.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: Different
endocannabanoid receptors
are found in non-nerve cells in
the immune

41:16.140 --> 41:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
system, for example. So perhaps
it is no surprise
that researchers suspect
cannabis can do so

41:21.746 --> 41:27.719 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many things, from fighting
cancer, to concussions,
to Crohn's disease.

41:27.752 --> 41:34.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But perhaps the most dramatic
story of how
cannabis might be good medicine
is in epilepsy.

41:34.492 --> 41:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the '70s and '80s, Dr.
Mechoulam published
studies that showed CBD can curb
seizures.

41:41.899 --> 41:46.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was no further research,
until parents
of epileptic children who didn't
respond to

41:46.938 --> 41:50.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conventional pharmaceuticals
discovered Dr.
Mechoulam's work.

41:50.575 --> 41:53.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CATHERINE JACOBSON,
Neuroscientist: I do this
with two hats.

41:53.644 --> 41:58.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Neuroscientist
Catherine Jacobson
told her story to the cannabis
medical conference

41:58.416 --> 42:08.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at Harvard. Her 7-year-old son,
Ben, has epilepsy.
After discovering Dr.
Mechoulam's papers,

42:08.760 --> 42:14.098 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she started giving Ben daily
homemade doses
of CBD, at times making the
formula in her

42:14.132 --> 42:15.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
garage.

42:15.433 --> 42:18.202 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His seizures diminished by 40
percent.

42:18.236 --> 42:24.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE JACOBSON: But it's
excruciating
to think about what we went
through to get

42:24.308 --> 42:29.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, right, and what might have
happened
if we have been able to do this
five years

42:29.947 --> 42:31.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ago or six years ago.

42:31.749 --> 42:35.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know for a fact he would be a
different
kid today if he hadn't suffered
all that brain

42:35.653 --> 42:37.455 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
damage.

42:37.488 --> 42:41.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Her experience
with her son
and CBD prompted her to redirect
her scientific

42:41.793 --> 42:50.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
career. She now heads clinical
research for
Tilray, a Canadian medical
marijuana company

42:50.268 --> 42:53.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trying to turn cannabis into
conventional
medicine.

42:53.304 --> 42:56.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CATHERINE JACOBSON: If it can't
happen in
the U.S., then we're going to
make it happen

42:56.841 --> 42:58.609 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
globally.

42:58.643 --> 43:02.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: But Dr. Mechoulam
believes
the pace of research will
increase dramatically

43:02.447 --> 43:05.116 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
if prohibition in the U.S. is
lifted.

43:05.149 --> 43:10.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. RAPHAEL MECHOULAM: People
express themselves
and say, we want this to be
done, it can be

43:10.655 --> 43:15.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
done. It is complicated. It will
cost money.
It will take time, but it can be
done.

43:15.927 --> 43:21.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: During his visit
to Boston,
Raphael Mechoulam visited NETA's
remarkable

43:21.332 --> 43:27.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dispensary. The father of
marijuana research
spent a career trying to make
this moment,

43:28.005 --> 43:31.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this place possible.

43:31.108 --> 43:41.619 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Brookline,
Massachusetts.

43:41.652 --> 43:50.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Cleveland is getting
ready for
the Republican National
Convention next week,

43:50.061 --> 43:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and a chance to showcase some
big changes
in the city. That includes a
redesign, renovation

43:55.967 --> 43:59.136 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and revamping of the city's
central square.

43:59.170 --> 44:03.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story with
production
help from our PBS colleagues at
WVIZ ideastream.

44:03.741 --> 44:16.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Strike up the
band, turn on
the fountain, and ask yourself,
what makes

44:16.754 --> 44:21.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a 21st century city livable,
viable, even
exciting?

44:21.792 --> 44:26.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Cleveland, they're hoping
part of the answer
is Public Square, the new
version of it, that

44:26.864 --> 44:34.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, a $50 million project, eight
years in
the planning, 10 acres in the
heart of downtown,

44:34.272 --> 44:39.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
remade into a space for
relaxing, meeting
up with friends, cooling off on
a hot day.

44:39.343 --> 44:43.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRANK JACKSON, Mayor of
Cleveland, Ohio: This
is a public space. We own Public
Square. So

44:43.447 --> 44:46.551 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why would you not fix up your
own property?

44:46.584 --> 44:50.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All, says Mayor
Frank Jackson,
with a larger purpose.

44:50.121 --> 44:54.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK JACKSON: As we reinvent
and redefine
Cleveland, and we reinvent and
redefine downtown

44:54.725 --> 44:57.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cleveland, Public Square is
essential in that.

44:57.061 --> 45:07.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The
idea here in Cleveland is one
that other cities
are embracing, or re-embracing,
that the social

45:07.138 --> 45:11.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
side of urban life, the sheer
pleasure of
hanging out with other people in
a nice setting,

45:11.642 --> 45:14.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can be an important driver of
economic health.

45:14.145 --> 45:19.150 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JAMES CORNER, Landscape
Architect: Well-designed
public spaces add significant
value to a city.

45:19.183 --> 45:24.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The landscape
architect behind
Cleveland's new Public Square is
James Corner,

45:24.755 --> 45:30.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whose firm, James Corner Field
Operations,
is today designing public spaces
in many cities

45:30.962 --> 45:37.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the U.S. and abroad. I met
him near his
New York office at his best
known site, the

45:37.034 --> 45:38.803 align:left position:37.5%,start line:86.67% size:62.5%
elevated
High Line Park.

45:38.836 --> 45:42.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: It wasn't that
long ago that
there was a lot of skepticism
about public

45:42.873 --> 45:49.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
space, that public space was
seen as a waste
of taxpayer money, filled with
litter, or

45:49.714 --> 45:53.684 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
homelessness, or crime, or just
empty space.

45:53.718 --> 45:59.023 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think we have seen a
renaissance. If you
can create these great spaces
where people

45:59.056 --> 46:04.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
can come together, it's
enormously powerful.
It affects people's psyche, it
affects their

46:04.595 --> 46:11.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imagination, it affects how they
relate to
other people, and it just
charges up the positive

46:11.369 --> 46:14.071 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
energy about what it means to
live in a city.

46:14.105 --> 46:18.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In Cleveland,
Corner was faced
with a square that had long
served as a transit

46:19.010 --> 46:24.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hub with two busy downtown
streets dividing
it, a place to pass through, not
linger.

46:24.949 --> 46:32.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it actually started life as
a public commons.
This 1936 painting for the WPA
Arts Project

46:32.456 --> 46:37.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
imagined the square 100 years
earlier. This
was where the local militia
would assemble

46:37.895 --> 46:44.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and, later, where citizens
gathered to pay
respects to Abraham Lincoln
after he was assassinated.

46:44.168 --> 46:47.238 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The new idea then is actually an
old one.

46:47.271 --> 46:50.341 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VERONICA RIVERA, James Corner
Field Operations:
This is exactly the idea. People
will be able

46:50.374 --> 46:55.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to enjoy the park, sit back,
have lunch, just
enjoy the center of Cleveland.

46:55.579 --> 47:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Veronica Rivera
moved to Cleveland
as an on-the-ground designer for
James Corner's

47:01.085 --> 47:07.058 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
group. Among much else,
construction teams
removed a main thoroughfare,
restored iconic

47:07.091 --> 47:12.963 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statues, sculpted elements of
the landscape,
creating a concert hill, winding
paths and

47:12.997 --> 47:19.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
new sight lines, all of it
creating the illusion
of a small natural setting in a
large park

47:19.837 --> 47:21.672 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
planned down to the eighth of an
inch.

47:21.706 --> 47:25.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VERONICA RIVERA: It's relatively
flat. So
if you would have walked in and
seen everything

47:25.476 --> 47:30.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the same time, it would have
been a bit
overwhelming. It would have felt
more like

47:30.081 --> 47:32.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a parking lot, instead of a
park.

47:32.616 --> 47:38.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And by using topography, we both
create an
amphitheater for the lawn for
events, and

47:38.122 --> 47:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also create these smaller, more
intimate spaces.
We wanted to create that
layering effect,

47:44.061 --> 47:51.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the square can adapt to you
walking on
your own, but if it's a huge
crowd, that it

47:51.168 --> 47:53.037 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
feels appropriate for that as
well.

47:53.070 --> 47:58.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The 15-month
construction was
captured in this time-lapse
video. That followed

47:58.142 --> 48:04.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years of planning overseen by
two local civic
organizations, Group Plan
Commission and LAND

48:04.548 --> 48:07.051 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Studio.

48:07.084 --> 48:11.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Public space these days can cost
a lot of
money. More than half of what
was needed to

48:11.255 --> 48:16.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rebuild the square's surface
area came from
foundations, individuals and
corporations.

48:16.694 --> 48:19.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ann Zoller is executive director
of LAND Studio.

48:19.764 --> 48:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANN ZOLLER, Executive Director,
LAND Studio:
From day one, when we started
raising money,

48:22.633 --> 48:26.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we not only raised money for
capital, but
we raised money for the ongoing
program and

48:26.303 --> 48:30.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maintenance. So it's build it
right, make
sure it's used correctly, and,
at the get-go,

48:30.341 --> 48:32.176 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
raise money for the future
program and maintenance.

48:32.209 --> 48:36.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This city is on a
roll, most
recently with its basketball
championship

48:36.547 --> 48:40.317 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for LeBron James and the
Cavaliers.

48:40.351 --> 48:46.090 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a building boom
downtown. Within
a few blocks of Public Square
are new hotels,

48:46.123 --> 48:52.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a Convention Center, renovated
apartment houses,
the large Flats East Bank
project, and much

48:52.429 --> 48:54.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
more.

48:54.165 --> 48:58.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Biomedical companies have been
one driver
of jobs, and the downtown
population is on

48:58.969 --> 49:03.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the rise. The hope now is that
Public Square
will bring more.

49:03.841 --> 49:08.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Cleveland still has plenty
of problems,
including one of the country's
highest poverty

49:08.746 --> 49:10.481 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
rates.

49:10.514 --> 49:15.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does Public Square benefit
everybody? It's
a majority African-American
city, I believe.

49:15.820 --> 49:20.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I look around downtown here,
mostly white,
I think.

49:20.357 --> 49:24.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANK JACKSON: Well, I think,
for this event,
you will have that, but when you
come here

49:24.895 --> 49:31.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on a daily basis and watch who
takes public
transportation, who goes into
Tower City,

49:31.569 --> 49:37.041 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who goes in to -- who comes to
work every
day, this is a public square.

49:37.074 --> 49:44.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we don't play off downtown
vs. neighborhood,
black vs. white. We don't play
off those kinds

49:44.582 --> 49:49.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of things. What we do, we invest
in the city
of Cleveland. And when we invest
in the city

49:49.887 --> 49:53.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Cleveland, we do that for the
benefit of
the entire city.

49:53.390 --> 49:58.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And now for the
Republican
National Convention. And the
brand-new Public

49:58.596 --> 50:03.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Square may be ground zero for
protests and
demonstrations.

50:03.400 --> 50:05.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This park is going to get a real
test, right,
real soon.

50:05.636 --> 50:07.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRANK JACKSON: Oh, yes.

50:07.404 --> 50:10.107 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And your city is
going to get
a real test. Are you worried at
all about

50:10.140 --> 50:10.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
what...

50:10.774 --> 50:11.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRANK JACKSON: Oh, no, no.

50:11.275 --> 50:11.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: No?

50:11.809 --> 50:13.544 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FRANK JACKSON: No.

50:13.577 --> 50:18.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Look, we do what we do. You
should never ask
for something and then complain
about it.

50:18.249 --> 50:22.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I also asked
architect James
Corner if he fears what's
coming.

50:22.386 --> 50:28.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: No, I relish that.
I mean, I
really hope that there is
protest and gatherings

50:28.659 --> 50:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and public speech in Public
Square. Creating
great public spaces is not only
about beautification

50:35.966 --> 50:42.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and greenery and social
settings. It's also
about platforms for democratic
life to play

50:42.072 --> 50:43.807 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
out.

50:43.841 --> 50:46.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even if, in this
case, you
might have thousands and
thousands of people

50:46.143 --> 50:50.080 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trampling the whole -- it could
-- it's possible
that it could get violent.

50:50.114 --> 50:54.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES CORNER: It's been built in
a robust
way. I wouldn't be fearful if
there are thousands

50:54.285 --> 50:57.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of people in there. It can take
it.

50:57.187 --> 51:02.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Maybe so, but few
major urban
projects have faced such a
dramatic test this

51:02.459 --> 51:03.694 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fast.

51:03.727 --> 51:06.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From Cleveland, I'm Jeffrey
Brown for the
"PBS NewsHour."

51:06.797 --> 51:11.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that makes us
all more
excited to be going to
Cleveland.

51:11.502 --> 51:16.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen and I and the "NewsHour"
team will be
there all next week for our
special convention

51:16.740 --> 51:17.107 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coverage.

51:17.141 --> 51:18.776 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Take a look.

51:18.809 --> 51:25.149 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARRATOR: With so much at stake,
you need
election coverage you can trust.
That's why

51:25.182 --> 51:30.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the "PBS NewsHour" has teamed up
with NPR
to bring you prime-time coverage
of the conventions.

51:30.321 --> 51:36.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff are
joined by
NPR's Rachel Martin for
balanced, in-depth

51:36.193 --> 51:38.529 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reporting you won't find
anywhere else.

51:38.562 --> 51:44.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us for live coverage of the
Republican
National Convention, begins
Monday, July 18,

51:44.902 --> 51:48.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at 8:00/7:00 Central, only on
PBS and NPR
stations.

51:48.539 --> 51:53.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: It's a first for
public media.
And we're really excited.

51:53.711 --> 51:57.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: Being
able to distinguish music from
noise may owe

51:58.015 --> 52:04.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more to culture than biological
hard-wiring.
That's the finding of a new
study from MIT,

52:04.088 --> 52:09.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and it may settle a
centuries-long debate.
Read about that and much more on
our Web site,

52:11.595 --> 52:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And tune in later
tonight on
"Charlie Rose": Kevin Rudd, a
former prime

52:16.700 --> 52:21.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
minister of Australia, on what
The Hague's
ruling on the South China Sea
means for the

52:21.405 --> 52:23.807 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
region and for the United
States.

52:23.841 --> 52:25.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's the "NewsHour" for
tonight. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

52:25.743 --> 52:27.578 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

52:27.611 --> 52:32.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Join us online and again here
tomorrow evening.
For all of us here at the "PBS
NewsHour,"

52:32.416 --> 52:37.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.

52:37.955 --> 52:42.426 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
thank you, and good night.
