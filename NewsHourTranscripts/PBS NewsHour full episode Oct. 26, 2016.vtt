00:28.762 --> 00:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And the rise of
white nationalism
during this election and why one
group heralds

00:34.835 --> 00:39.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new generation of separatists
vying for

00:42.976 --> 00:48.282 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the hollers of West Virginia or
to Kentucky,
and look in the eyes of white
working-class

00:48.315 --> 00:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men, women and children, and
tell them that
they have any power in this
system whatsoever.

00:53.854 --> 00:56.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and

five words,
under budget and ahead of
schedule.

01:52.913 --> 01:57.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today is a metaphor for what we

JOHN YANG: Hillary Clinton
campaigning in
battleground Florida on her 69th
birthday

02:03.857 --> 02:06.460 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
suggesting a darker side to
Trump's ribbon-cutting.

02:06.493 --> 02:14.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He
relied on undocumented
workers to make his project
cheaper.

02:14.668 --> 02:19.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And most of the products in the
rooms were
made overseas.

02:19.206 --> 02:22.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Others are getting in

Megyn Kelly over the sexual
allegations against
the nominee.

02:32.753 --> 02:37.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I'm sick and tired of people
like you using

02:37.057 --> 02:39.793 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
language that is inflammatory
that is not
true.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.762 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MEGYN KELLY, FOX News: Excuse
me, Mr. Speaker.

02:41.795 --> 02:43.930 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have no idea whether it's
true or not.

02:43.964 --> 02:44.931 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What we know is that...

02:44.965 --> 02:46.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:46.867 --> 02:48.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH: Hillary Clinton
in a secret

pays her $225,000

02:48.902 --> 02:54.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying her dream is an open
border, where
600 million people could come to
America,

02:54.041 --> 02:55.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that's not worth covering?

02:55.108 --> 02:56.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MEGYN KELLY: That is worth
covering, and we
did.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.078 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEWT GINGRICH: And you want to
go back through
the tapes on your show recently?

02:58.111 --> 03:01.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are fascinated with sex, and
you don't
care about public policy.

03:01.715 --> 03:06.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: And after Vice
President Biden
said he'd like to take Trump
behind the high

03:06.286 --> 03:09.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
school gym, Trump said bring it
on.

03:09.322 --> 03:11.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: Did you see where
Biden wants
to take me?

03:11.958 --> 03:13.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
To the back of the barn.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.327 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Me.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.328 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He wants to.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I would love that.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I would love that.

03:18.765 --> 03:23.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump returned to
campaigning this
afternoon in another crucial
state, North

03:23.437 --> 03:25.372 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Carolina.

03:25.405 --> 03:29.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the candidates drive to the
finish, Republicans
are saying promised there would
be no honeymoon

03:29.743 --> 03:33.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if Clinton wins the White House
and the GOP
holds the House.

03:33.814 --> 03:38.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Oversight Committee Chairman
Jason Chaffetz
told The Washington Post there
would be immediate

03:38.452 --> 03:40.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hearings into Clinton's time at
the State
Department.

03:40.987 --> 03:46.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said they already have two
years' worth
of material lined up.

03:46.460 --> 03:51.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. told
the "NewsHour"
that the people he's met during
the campaign

03:51.198 --> 03:54.234 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
has him thinking about a
political future
for himself.

03:54.267 --> 03:56.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP JR., Son of Donald
Trump: It'd
be an honor to be able to one do
that.

03:56.670 --> 04:00.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think I have got to get my
kids through
school, and after this, I may
need a good

04:01.007 --> 04:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
10-year break from politics.

04:02.175 --> 04:05.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But, you know, again, there is a
rush to it.

04:05.445 --> 04:10.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, there is something very
exciting and
very moving and humbling when
you are speaking

04:10.417 --> 04:11.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with those people.

04:11.852 --> 04:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So, someday, there
could be another
candidate named Trump.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:17.591 --> 04:24.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: Pakistan's
city of Quetta virtually closed
down to mourn

04:24.097 --> 04:27.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
61 victims of a massacre at a
police academy.

04:27.234 --> 04:31.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The assault, late Monday,
targeted cadets
as they slept.

04:31.204 --> 04:36.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
More than half-a-million people
live in Quetta,
but today the streets were
mostly empty as

04:36.243 --> 04:39.713 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
businesses and offices
memorialized the victims.

04:39.746 --> 04:44.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Both an Islamic State affiliate
and a Taliban
splinter group have claimed
responsibility.

04:44.584 --> 04:49.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Taliban is
denying it
kidnapped and killed 26
civilians in Afghanistan.

04:49.589 --> 04:51.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The victims were taken to a
hospital morgue
today.

04:51.958 --> 04:56.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They had been abducted in the
remote central
province of Ghor on Tuesday.

04:56.229 --> 05:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Farther east, Taliban fighters
did cut the
main highway linking Kabul to
Kandahar.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the latest in a series of
assaults.

05:02.102 --> 05:07.807 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: New warnings
today from Iraq
that Islamic State fighters in
Mosul are killing

05:07.841 --> 05:10.243 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and kidnapping scores of
civilians.

05:10.277 --> 05:16.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the same time, thousands of
others are
fleeing to freedom, as
government troops advance.

Jonathan Rugman of Independent
Television
News reports from the front
lines.

05:19.753 --> 05:25.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN RUGMAN: The road to
Mosul is paved
with bad intentions, the
smoldering oil drums

05:25.258 --> 05:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and tires of ISIS fighters who
hoped the smoke
would save them from coalition
airstrikes,

05:31.031 --> 05:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the skeletons of cars driven
by suicide
bombers towards the front line.

05:37.671 --> 05:43.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Behind this wall of earth lies a
village called
Bazwaia, this the border of a
shrinking caliphate

05:43.610 --> 05:45.412 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of fear.

05:45.445 --> 05:51.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bazwaia is the only village now
lying between
us and Mosul, which lies six
miles down the

05:51.051 --> 05:52.786 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
road from here.

05:52.819 --> 05:57.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At this rate, Iraqi special
forces will be
in the suburbs of the city
within the next

05:57.090 --> 05:59.092 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
few days.

05:59.125 --> 06:04.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the homes lie abandoned, but
this one
is full of surprises, for, if
and when the

06:04.264 --> 06:10.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
owners return, they will find a
Russian T-54
tank parked in their living
room, an attempt

06:10.937 --> 06:15.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the jihadists to hide it from
airstrikes.

06:15.976 --> 06:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Running along the back garden is
an ISIS tunnel
stretching for hundreds of
meters, complete

06:21.548 --> 06:24.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with breathing holes for the
fighters below.

06:24.284 --> 06:29.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Last night, Iraqi troops thought
they heard
somebody inside, so they fired
into it and

06:29.322 --> 06:31.191 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
set it alight.

06:31.224 --> 06:36.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And villagers who survived the
fierce bombardment
of the last 10 days are now
leaving, heading

06:36.963 --> 06:42.702 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through the fields to freedom
after enduring
more than two years of ISIS
rule.

06:42.736 --> 06:48.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This dusty refugee camp is the
home which
awaits them, the men of fighting
age at first

06:48.508 --> 06:54.214 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
held at gunpoint amid checks
they are not
ISIS militants themselves.

06:54.247 --> 07:00.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Along the outside of the camp
fence, the tears
of new arrivals, those who
escaped ISIS before

07:00.787 --> 07:06.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the militants arrived now
reunited with those
who were trapped and couldn't
leave until

07:06.926 --> 07:08.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

07:08.662 --> 07:13.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over 10,000 have been displaced
since this
offensive began, 1,000 arriving
here this

07:13.600 --> 07:15.135 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
morning.

07:15.168 --> 07:19.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, as the army advances
towards Mosul, many
more are expected to arrive.

07:19.606 --> 07:24.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Israel, 13
people have
been charged with inciting
violence in a video

07:24.344 --> 07:26.479 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
showing Jewish extremists at a
wedding.

07:26.513 --> 07:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It showed rowdy celebrants
holding weapons
and even stabbing a picture of a
Palestinian

07:30.583 --> 07:31.818 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
toddler.

07:31.851 --> 07:34.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The child had died when his
family's home
was firebombed.

07:34.354 --> 07:38.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: French officials
have finished
clearing the Calais migrant camp
given the

07:38.625 --> 07:40.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
name the Jungle ahead of
schedule.

07:41.027 --> 07:44.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
More than 6,000 people were
relocated to other
sites.

07:44.431 --> 07:49.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Their departure left
firefighters to fight
fires set by some of the camp
dwellers.

07:49.436 --> 07:53.673 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The regional prefect said it's a
custom among
Afghan migrants.

07:53.707 --> 07:57.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FABIENNE BUCCIO, Calais Regional
Prefect (through
translator): They have told us
that it's a

07:57.077 --> 08:00.814 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
tradition which is very
established: When
you go, you burn.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.183 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we organized ourselves in
advance.

08:03.216 --> 08:07.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Firefighters are actually here
24 hours a
day, so there's no big risk of
the fire spreading.

08:07.320 --> 08:12.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meanwhile, the
U.N. reports
2016 is now the deadliest year
on record for

08:12.459 --> 08:14.494 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
migrants trying to reach Europe.

08:14.527 --> 08:19.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says that at least 3,800
people have died
trying to cross the
Mediterranean Sea, more

08:19.899 --> 08:21.801 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than all of last year.

08:21.835 --> 08:25.305 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Two
earthquakes rocked Central
Italy tonight, sending
shockwaves across the

08:25.338 --> 08:30.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country just two months after
another quake
killed nearly 300 people.

08:30.076 --> 08:35.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new tremors were centered
six miles below
ground near the town of Visso,
110 miles north

08:35.982 --> 08:37.517 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of Rome.

08:37.550 --> 08:39.986 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Around Visso, several old
churches and other
buildings collapsed into rubble.

08:40.019 --> 08:43.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The quakes also closed some
roads and injured
two people.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.925 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And this was a
mixed day on
Wall Street.

08:45.959 --> 08:51.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
gained 30
points to close at 18199.

08:51.564 --> 08:56.035 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq fell 33 points, and
the S&amp;P 500
slipped three.

08:56.069 --> 09:00.273 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
where the most money is being
spent two weeks

09:00.306 --> 09:05.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before Election Day; the secret
computer codes
trying to sway your political
opinions; reprieve

09:05.979 --> 09:12.919 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
for soldiers hit with an
unexpected bill;
and much more.

09:12.952 --> 09:24.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We dig in now to
the numbers
in the race for the White House,
with most

09:24.297 --> 09:28.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national and battleground state
polls showing
Hillary Clinton ahead.

09:28.802 --> 09:33.173 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the number of undecided
voters shrink by
the day, we are joined by two
people who have

09:33.206 --> 09:35.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
made a career in polling.

09:35.809 --> 09:39.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic pollster Peter Hart
is founder
of Hart Research and Associates.

09:39.479 --> 09:44.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He is fresh from conducting a
focus group
of voters in Charlotte, North
Carolina.

09:44.417 --> 09:50.123 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Whit Ayres, he's a
Republican pollster
and author of the book "2016 and
Beyond: How

09:50.156 --> 09:53.927 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Republicans Can Elect a
President in the New
America."

09:53.960 --> 09:55.862 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.932 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's talk about where this race
stands nationally.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Peter, what does it look like?

10:00.667 --> 10:03.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER HART, Democratic Pollster:
Well, it
looks pretty uphill if you're
Donald Trump

10:03.236 --> 10:04.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and on that side.

10:04.971 --> 10:09.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at Hillary Clinton, she
stands in
much better shape, and the
organizational

10:09.642 --> 10:12.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
efforts who are going to be
important for
her.

10:12.245 --> 10:15.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think she is primed to do
very well
on election night.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
it, Whit?

10:17.684 --> 10:21.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WHIT AYRES, Republican Pollster:
If you look
at an average of recent polls,
Judy, Hillary

10:21.287 --> 10:24.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton is ahead by about 6
percentage points.

10:24.824 --> 10:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To put that in perspective, Mitt
Romney lost
to Barack Obama in 2012 by four
points, and

10:31.464 --> 10:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John McCain lost to Barack Obama
in 2008 by
seven points.

10:35.668 --> 10:40.640 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the deficit now is somewhere
between the
2008 and 2012 numbers.

10:40.673 --> 10:44.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Peter, if
people watching
want to know, OK, who and what
are contributing

10:44.777 --> 10:48.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to her doing well and his not
doing as well,
how would you describe that?

10:48.915 --> 10:54.387 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER HART: Well, she has
broadened beyond
the traditional Democratic
coalition, and

10:54.420 --> 10:56.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
she's reaching across to
independents.

10:56.656 --> 11:00.059 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she's doing exceptionally
well with women
at this stage in the game.

11:00.093 --> 11:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that all the troubles
that Donald
Trump has had and his
difficulties have parlayed

11:06.866 --> 11:11.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a situation where independent
women are moving
across.

11:11.804 --> 11:18.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, women who have
college education,
that vote went for Romney four
years ago.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It certainly is going to be
Democratic this
time around.

11:20.713 --> 11:21.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And non-white.

11:21.948 --> 11:25.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER HART: Oh, definitely the
non-white voters
are there.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the millennials are also
very strong.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whit, what about
Donald Trump?

11:29.923 --> 11:31.758 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Where is he doing well and where
is he struggling?

11:31.791 --> 11:37.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WHIT AYRES: Donald Trump has
based his entire
campaign on getting a higher
turnout of whites

11:37.697 --> 11:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and getting a large proportion
of whites.

11:40.166 --> 11:45.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem with that is that
every single
presidential election since
1996, the proportion

11:45.905 --> 11:50.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of whites has gone down by two,
three, or
four percentage point.

11:50.243 --> 11:55.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year will probably be about
70 percent
white and 30 percent non-white.

11:55.148 --> 12:00.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But trying to win a national
election in this
environment by getting a larger
and larger

12:00.653 --> 12:06.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
share of a smaller and smaller
proportion
of the electorate is a losing
strategic proposition.

12:06.259 --> 12:10.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Having said that,
Peter, you
come, as we said, from
conducting this focus

12:10.296 --> 12:13.299 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
group last night, undecided
voters, Charlotte,
North Carolina.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER HART: Late deciders.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Late deciders.

12:15.301 --> 12:17.070 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PETER HART: OK.

12:17.103 --> 12:21.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So these are people who waited
until after
the convention and have now
jumped in, and

12:21.174 --> 12:23.309 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
some of them still remain
undecided.

12:23.343 --> 12:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what's so fascinating is, we
started the
race where people were unhappy
with the world.

12:29.148 --> 12:33.620 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They remain unhappy with the
world, but they're
more unhappy with the
candidates.

12:33.653 --> 12:38.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, they look at one as
unfit and the
other as untrustworthy.

12:38.124 --> 12:44.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, these poor people are
reaching the end
of the road, and, essentially,
they don't

12:44.063 --> 12:46.099 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
know what to do.

12:46.132 --> 12:50.536 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The interesting thing is, there
were three
women in the group, all of whom
should be

12:50.570 --> 12:56.943 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in the Republican column, and
they would like
to be there, but they just
cannot stomach

12:56.976 --> 12:57.944 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Donald Trump.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.546 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't find him as
acceptable.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.048 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They find him as a bully.

13:02.081 --> 13:03.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They find him as a baby.

13:03.850 --> 13:07.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They just -- everything about
him bothers
them.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So they can't be with him.

13:09.022 --> 13:12.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Whit, have we
seen anything
-- have you seen anything like
this in your

13:12.759 --> 13:14.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
years of polling?

13:14.560 --> 13:18.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WHIT AYRES: We have never seen
anything like
Donald Trump before and probably
won't for

13:18.464 --> 13:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the rest of our lives.

13:19.699 --> 13:20.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

13:20.700 --> 13:22.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WHIT AYRES: It's amazing,
though, Judy.

13:22.535 --> 13:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two-thirds of the people in this
country are
unsatisfied with the direction
of the country.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They want a change.

13:28.908 --> 13:33.046 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would think that Donald
Trump would be
able to tap into that
successfully, but he

13:33.079 --> 13:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has run his entire campaign
preaching to the
converted and trashing everyone
else.

13:38.751 --> 13:44.257 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Consequently, he basically is
ending the campaign
right where he started it,
somewhere in the

13:44.290 --> 13:46.192 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
low 40s.

13:46.225 --> 13:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so a general election
strategy that involves
revving up your own supporters,
but not reaching

13:53.099 --> 13:54.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out, is not a successful
strategy.

13:54.967 --> 13:58.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Peter, back
to this question
about where the race is overall,
is there

13:58.771 --> 14:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a path to victory for Donald
Trump at this
point?

14:01.841 --> 14:03.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PETER HART: No.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.777 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And I say that.

14:04.811 --> 14:07.880 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Obviously, turnout is critical.

14:07.914 --> 14:14.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And African-Americans are less
enthusiastic
than they were in 2008 and 2012.

14:14.520 --> 14:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hispanics are -- seem to be as
interested,
millennials much less
interested.

14:19.425 --> 14:23.730 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think Barack Obama becomes
the key to
this.

14:23.763 --> 14:30.970 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has been an exceptional
surrogate, and
essentially bringing across
those voters.

14:31.003 --> 14:36.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think Michelle Obama has
become sort
of the moral center of this
campaign, and

14:36.576 --> 14:39.946 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there's nobody that we have
found that is
more popular.

14:39.979 --> 14:45.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I actually think the Obamas
become the
legacy and the reason that
Hillary Clinton

14:45.685 --> 14:46.652 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can win.

14:46.686 --> 14:47.920 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whit, what do you
see?

14:47.954 --> 14:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you see there's a path of
some kind for
Donald Trump?

14:50.456 --> 14:53.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WHIT AYRES: It would be like
drawing an inside
straight.

14:53.226 --> 14:58.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He would have to win every
single swing state
that's remotely close right now,
and that's

14:58.631 --> 15:01.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a very, very high hill to climb
with less
than two weeks to go.

15:01.901 --> 15:07.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Whit, you were
also telling
us that -- something that
strikes but this

15:07.573 --> 15:12.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
election year is the separation
between what
you call the Trump brand and the
Republican

15:12.612 --> 15:13.579 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
brand.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What did you mean by that?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WHIT AYRES: There's a dramatic
difference
between the Trump brand and the
Republican

15:17.049 --> 15:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brand, in part because Trump is
not really
a Republican.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What that means for down-ballot
races is...

15:22.722 --> 15:24.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Senate and
the House.

15:24.490 --> 15:26.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WHIT AYRES: Yes, the Senate and
the House,
is that a lot of Republican
candidates are

15:26.959 --> 15:31.097 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running well ahead of Donald
Trump, even in
these swing states.

15:31.130 --> 15:36.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Candidates like Rob Portman in
Ohio, Marco
Rubio in Florida, Chuck Grassley
in Iowa,

15:36.936 --> 15:41.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
John McCain in Arizona are all
running well
ahead of Trump.

15:41.641 --> 15:47.246 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that is the hope that
Republicans have
that we could actually do well
in congressional

15:47.280 --> 15:49.215 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Senate races.

15:49.248 --> 15:56.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It bears mentioning that when
Bob Dole lost
to Bill Clinton in 1996 by 8.5
points, Republicans

15:56.923 --> 15:58.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
picked up two Senate seats.

15:58.658 --> 15:59.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it's not unheard of.

15:59.992 --> 16:01.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Peter, how do you
see these
Senate races going?

16:01.861 --> 16:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PETER HART: Well, I think the
Senate is -- the
Republicans are having a very
difficult time,

16:06.699 --> 16:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because they have so many seats
up, and the
mentions that Whit made are
important.

16:12.839 --> 16:15.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But you really have to go to a
different side
of it.

16:15.341 --> 16:20.279 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You look at so many of these
states, whether
it is Pennsylvania or New
Hampshire or even

16:20.313 --> 16:25.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Carolina and Wisconsin and
Illinois,
all of those seats are going to
be Democratic

16:25.284 --> 16:31.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
seats, in part because they will
have the
coattails of Hillary Clinton.

16:31.357 --> 16:33.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you can add Missouri there.

16:33.192 --> 16:38.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think the Democrats are
going to have
the majority, I think somewhere
in 51 to 52

16:38.998 --> 16:39.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
seats.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.434 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That would be my take.

16:41.467 --> 16:42.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WHIT AYRES: I'm not willing to
concede all
those seats today, Peter.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

16:43.736 --> 16:45.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WHIT AYRES: I think a lot of
them are very
close.

16:45.571 --> 16:49.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think Republicans are running
very good
campaigns for the Senate in
those -- in those

16:49.775 --> 16:51.577 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
states.

16:51.611 --> 16:55.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I am not giving up hope that
Republicans
can hold on to both the House
and the Senate.

16:55.481 --> 16:57.316 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PETER HART: Underline hope.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

16:59.218 --> 17:02.088 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We're going to
have you both
back after the election and look
at the numbers.

17:02.121 --> 17:03.589 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Peter Hart, Whit Ayres, thank
you both.

17:03.623 --> 17:04.590 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WHIT AYRES: Thank you.

17:04.624 --> 17:05.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Enjoyed being with you.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Appreciate it.

17:07.693 --> 17:12.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Another big numbers focus during
this election
has been on money, how the
candidates have

17:12.431 --> 17:16.702 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
raised and spent it, and what
that says about
their campaigns.

17:16.736 --> 17:21.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matea Gold covers money and
influence for
The Washington Post, and she
joins us now.

17:21.807 --> 17:23.542 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Matea, welcome back to the
program.

17:23.576 --> 17:28.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, tell us, what do we know at
this point
about what Donald Trump and
Hillary Clinton,

17:28.314 --> 17:30.249 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how much they have raised and
how much they
have spent?

17:30.283 --> 17:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD, The Washington Post:
So, what's
remarkable is that Hillary
Clinton has raised

17:34.020 --> 17:40.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more than double Donald Trump,
and her campaign
committee, nearly $500 million,
to his $219

17:40.660 --> 17:41.827 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
million.

17:41.861 --> 17:45.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so she is by default also
vastly outspending
him.

17:45.431 --> 17:52.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the month of September, she
plowed $95
million into her campaign
effort; $66 million

17:52.772 --> 17:56.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of that went into television ads
alone.

17:56.676 --> 18:01.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump spent a third of
that on television
ads, as he's trying to really
build up his

18:01.480 --> 18:03.249 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
voter file.

18:03.282 --> 18:07.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw a lot of money going into
getting voter
data, but really he is getting
outflanked

18:07.253 --> 18:09.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by Clinton on the money race in
every regard.

18:09.322 --> 18:13.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What else can you
tell us,
Matea, about what they're
spending money on,

18:13.893 --> 18:15.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
staff organization,
get-out-the-vote?

18:15.828 --> 18:21.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: What is really
interesting is,
if you look at the campaign
spending strategy,

18:21.667 --> 18:24.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you see a reflection of the
infrastructure
that they have invested in.

18:24.737 --> 18:31.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, Clinton, for example, had
815 staffers
on her payroll at the end of
September.

18:31.978 --> 18:36.816 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's compared to 168 staffers
that Trump
had on his payroll.

18:36.849 --> 18:40.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what you see in there is the
investment
that Clinton is making in a
ground game.

18:40.720 --> 18:45.658 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She has staffers deployed all
across the country
in an effort to turn out the
vote.

18:45.691 --> 18:50.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump, on the other hand, is
leaning much
more heavily on the RNC to
provide that voter

18:50.496 --> 18:52.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
mobilization effort.

18:52.331 --> 18:56.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Matea, you
were telling
us, it's interesting to look at
how much Donald

18:56.335 --> 18:59.505 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump himself is putting into
his campaign.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.307 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you see in that regard?

19:01.340 --> 19:05.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: What's been very
curious is that
Trump continues to insist that
he's putting

19:05.678 --> 19:11.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$100 million, if not more, into
his campaign
of his own personal funds.

19:11.751 --> 19:15.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As of now, we have only seen $56
million.

19:15.087 --> 19:19.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's a large sum, but
obviously not close
to $100 million.

19:19.492 --> 19:24.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He has a very short remaining
window of time
to put in the remaining $44
million, and we

19:24.196 --> 19:26.065 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
will see if that actually comes
to be.

19:26.098 --> 19:30.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about in
terms of
reimbursing himself, the
campaign?

19:30.770 --> 19:32.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How does that work and how
typical is that?

19:32.905 --> 19:38.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: So, the Trump
campaign has used
a lot of Trump properties as he
has been making

19:38.511 --> 19:40.179 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his bid for the White House.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have had events at Trump
hotels.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They have their campaign
headquarters in Trump
Tower.

19:45.785 --> 19:51.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, under the law, he's not
allowed to let
those companies donate those
services.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, he does have to reimburse
them for it.

19:53.325 --> 19:58.230 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But his decision to use Trump
companies in
the pursuit of his campaign
means that he's

19:58.264 --> 20:04.203 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
also putting a lot of money back
into his
own companies, more than $9
million to date,

20:04.236 --> 20:06.906 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
including $1 million in
reimbursements last
month.

20:06.939 --> 20:11.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the majority of that money
has gone to
reimburse TAG Air, which is his
private airline.

20:11.677 --> 20:16.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now, Matea, you
also wrote
this week that Donald Trump has
decided some

20:16.449 --> 20:22.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
days ago to stop holding
big-dollar fund-raising
events for himself and the GOP.

20:22.388 --> 20:24.090 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why do that?

20:24.123 --> 20:27.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: So, it is typical at
this point
for the presidential candidates
to get off

20:27.860 --> 20:32.098 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the money circuit and just stick
to campaign
events and rallies.

20:32.131 --> 20:36.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what's unusual is, the Trump
campaign
didn't set up a schedule of
fund-raising events

20:36.936 --> 20:42.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for surrogates to continue to
bring in high-dollar
donations to support party in
these final

20:42.775 --> 20:44.243 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

20:44.276 --> 20:48.914 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Clinton has 41 events scheduled
on the books
between now and November 3.

20:48.948 --> 20:51.383 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Trump campaign now says they
have a handful
of events.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.185 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They might do more ad hoc
events.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.621 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they have taken a very
different approach
to this.

20:55.654 --> 20:59.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said that they are raising
a lot of money
online, some of which will go to
the partly,

20:59.758 --> 21:05.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the majority of their
efforts right now
are on -- is on making his case
to voters.

21:05.297 --> 21:09.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally,
Matea, you were
talking to us about what you
have noted in

21:09.468 --> 21:16.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
terms of how Clinton is raising
big sums of
money from groups that were,
frankly, enabled

21:16.475 --> 21:21.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to give money by that famous
Supreme Court
decision Citizens United.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATEA GOLD: Right.

21:22.982 --> 21:27.553 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One thing that is such a
dramatic storyline
in the money race, I think, this
year is the

21:27.586 --> 21:34.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full embrace by Clinton of super
PACs, which
were really entities that
President Obama

21:34.226 --> 21:39.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was very reluctant to support
and use to his
reelection advantage.

21:39.865 --> 21:45.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, by contrast, Clinton, from
the very beginning
of her race, made it clear that
she wanted

21:45.371 --> 21:48.107 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
donors to support these groups.

21:48.140 --> 21:52.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because of that, she's been able
to raise,
in conjunction with super PACs
and the party,

21:52.478 --> 21:55.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
$1.1 billion in pursuit of the
White House.

21:55.181 --> 21:59.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, finally, you
said that
you were surprised the Democrats
have raised

21:59.618 --> 22:01.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as much money as they have this
cycle.

22:01.720 --> 22:05.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Well, I don't think
anyone would
have predicted when the cycle
started that

22:05.524 --> 22:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats would win at the money
race.

22:07.293 --> 22:11.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have seen that the super
PACs that
have formed to support Trump
have not been

22:11.997 --> 22:13.232 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very well-organized.

22:13.265 --> 22:16.435 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have gotten conflicting
messages from
the campaign.

22:16.468 --> 22:21.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, because of that, donors
have been reluctant,
until recently, to write big
checks.

22:21.574 --> 22:25.110 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Because the Democrats were so
organized on
the big-money front, they have
been able to

22:25.144 --> 22:30.316 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
collect large checks from the
very beginning
of this race, and now they have
the resources

22:30.349 --> 22:32.585 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to use that money in the final
stretch.

22:32.618 --> 22:35.087 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A remarkable set
of stories.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.056 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody follows this more closely
than you
do.

22:37.089 --> 22:40.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matea Gold with The Washington
Post, we thank
you.

22:40.859 --> 22:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATEA GOLD: Thanks, Judy.

22:48.133 --> 22:54.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: More than ever
before, a
big part of this election
campaign has played

22:55.007 --> 22:56.809 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
itself out on social media.

22:56.842 --> 23:01.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
No doubt the candidates and
their campaigns
have tried to take advantage of
these platforms.

23:01.313 --> 23:05.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's been a much bigger
role this year
as well for unseen players.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.287 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You might call it the rise of
the bots.

23:08.320 --> 23:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Miles O'Brien has the story,
part of our weekly
reporting about on the Leading
Edge of science

23:11.991 --> 23:13.792 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and technology.

23:13.826 --> 23:15.894 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
Donald supported the invasion of
Iraq.

23:15.928 --> 23:17.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
Wrong.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.598 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: That is
absolutely
proved over and over again.

23:19.632 --> 23:20.599 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: Wrong.

23:20.633 --> 23:21.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Wrong.

23:21.634 --> 23:23.402 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON: He
actually...

23:23.435 --> 23:26.472 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Much as we may
wish otherwise,
the race for the Oval Office is
not over.

23:26.505 --> 23:31.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is already one clear
winner, by
acclamation, Twitter.

23:31.744 --> 23:37.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Thanks to a candidate who
prefers campaigning
in 140-character spurts, the
social networking

23:37.549 --> 23:42.054 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
platform has become an essential
political
forum.

23:42.087 --> 23:43.389 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What could go wrong with that?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.390 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Plenty.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Tweeters, beware.

23:46.225 --> 23:49.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FILIPPO MENCZER, Indiana
University: Because
so much of the opinions that we
form and the

23:49.995 --> 23:56.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information that we digest comes
from social
networks and social media, it is
possible

23:56.635 --> 24:00.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try and manipulate the
network to control
opinions.

24:00.306 --> 24:06.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Filippo Menczer
is director
of the Center for Complex
Networks and Systems

24:06.378 --> 24:08.414 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at Indiana University.

24:08.447 --> 24:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says the junction of the
political and
computer sciences is a dangerous
place for

24:14.320 --> 24:16.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
democracy.

24:16.188 --> 24:21.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO MENCZER: Just like
people have tried
to influence elections forever
without social

24:21.493 --> 24:24.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
media, why wouldn't they also
try with social
media?

24:24.997 --> 24:29.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just like any other tool and
technology, it
can be used for good things and
it can also

24:29.101 --> 24:31.070 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
be manipulated or abused.

24:31.103 --> 24:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Menczer and his
team are researching
the shadowy world of bots,
software programmed

24:37.776 --> 24:40.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to mimic humans and engage with
them.

24:40.879 --> 24:43.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You probably encounter bots all
the time

24:43.048 --> 24:44.583 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: What's my day look
like?

24:44.616 --> 24:45.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
COMPUTER VOICE: Not bad.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.252 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Only two meetings today.

24:47.286 --> 24:49.455 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Whether it's
Apple's Siri.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTOR: Alexa, play rock music.

24:51.357 --> 24:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMPUTER VOICE: Rock music.

24:53.058 --> 24:54.760 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Amazon's Alexa.

24:54.793 --> 24:56.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Alexa, stop.

24:56.595 --> 25:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Or the chat box
that pops up
offering advice when your cable
TV is on the

25:01.834 --> 25:03.035 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fritz.

25:03.068 --> 25:06.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
A good one is hard to
differentiate from a
real person.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that's the trouble.

25:07.906 --> 25:13.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clever bots, employed in a
stealthy, strategic
manner, can put a virtual finger
on the scale

25:13.212 --> 25:14.980 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of political discourse.

25:15.013 --> 25:20.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bots generated a huge volume of
tweets pro
and con during the Brexit vote
in the United

25:20.519 --> 25:21.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Kingdom.

25:21.687 --> 25:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also promoted candidates in
the 2014
India elections.

25:26.425 --> 25:33.699 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIS uses bots to amplify
propaganda by creating
thousands of phony accounts.

25:33.732 --> 25:40.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FILIPPO MENCZER: It's like very
easy to create
one or 10 or 100 or 1,000
accounts controlled

25:40.472 --> 25:46.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by that campaign and make it
look like these
are just regular people who are
expressing

25:46.078 --> 25:47.846 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their freedom of speech.

25:47.880 --> 25:54.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Bots first reared
their ugly
heads in U.S. presidential
politics in 2012.

25:54.720 --> 26:00.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mitt Romney got caught buying
bots when he
gained more than 140,000
followers in two

26:00.759 --> 26:02.628 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
days.

26:02.661 --> 26:07.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For a few dollars, anyone can
buy a few thousand
bots that can be deployed to
strengthen your

26:07.266 --> 26:09.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Twitter prowess.

26:09.034 --> 26:14.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this go-round, the bots are
doing much
more than providing artificial
popularity.

26:14.273 --> 26:17.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Phil Howard is a professor of
the Internet
at Oxford University.

26:17.643 --> 26:21.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL HOWARD, Oxford University:
You program
the bots that are following you
to repeat

26:21.747 --> 26:23.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your message.

26:23.582 --> 26:28.253 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what happens is that a
larger and larger
number of people see the
retweets and think,

26:28.287 --> 26:31.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this is an important position
paper or this
is a great new idea.

26:31.590 --> 26:35.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You're talking
about taking
out ISIS, but you were there and
you were

26:35.961 --> 26:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
secretary of state when it was a
little infant.

26:37.729 --> 26:42.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Howard analyzed
tweets during
the first presidential debate.

26:42.234 --> 26:49.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He found bots were behind
one-fifth of pro-Clinton
Twitter traffic, and nearly
one-third of pro-Trump

26:49.241 --> 26:51.009 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tweets.

26:51.043 --> 26:54.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL HOWARD: The real problem
here is that
not all users can tell when the
content that

26:54.780 --> 26:58.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
comes up in their social media
feed is actually
generated by these bots.

26:58.917 --> 27:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's very difficult to know what
the overall
impact is on public opinion, but
we do know

27:03.555 --> 27:07.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that most Americans can't
distinguish these
bots from real users.

27:07.793 --> 27:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: It's hard enough
for computer
scientists and, for that matter,
Twitter itself.

27:14.366 --> 27:20.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The company admits 8.5 percent
of its accounts
are updated with no discernible
human action.

27:21.006 --> 27:26.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But that includes useful
applications like
TweetDeck, as well as harmful
bots.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Finding them is a challenge.

27:28.981 --> 27:32.084 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Menczer and his team are working
on this.

27:32.117 --> 27:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They visualize Twitter traffic,
helping them
find accounts that look and act
suspiciously

27:37.890 --> 27:39.391 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nonhuman.

27:39.424 --> 27:42.361 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FILIPPO MENCZER: Very often,
there are patterns
that we can still discern.

27:42.394 --> 27:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're not necessarily easy for
the human
eye, but, sometimes, the
machine-learning

27:47.132 --> 27:52.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
algorithms, by looking at over
1,000 features,
they can recognize some patterns
that make

27:52.538 --> 27:55.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one particular account similar
to other bots.

27:55.340 --> 28:00.679 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: The result is a
Web site called
BotOrNot, which analyzes Twitter
accounts

28:00.712 --> 28:06.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
based on the frequency of
tweets, the type
of networks and friends, and the
sentiment

28:06.451 --> 28:08.220 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the tweets convey.

28:08.253 --> 28:12.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This Twitterbot account simply
repeats pro-Hillary
Reddit postings.

28:12.791 --> 28:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BotOrNot predicts it is 70
percent likely
to be a bot.

28:16.295 --> 28:20.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PHIL HOWARD: One of the fun
things about studying
bots is that it's very difficult
based on

28:20.232 --> 28:24.169 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the code alone to predict what
they will do.

28:24.202 --> 28:28.807 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And even designers can't always
predict what
a bot will do.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.076 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Brad Hayes can
attest to that.

28:31.109 --> 28:34.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He is a postdoctoral associate
at MIT.

28:34.880 --> 28:40.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He read a Boston Globe article
that concluded
Donald Trump speaks at the level
of a fourth-grader.

28:40.986 --> 28:43.689 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To him, that sounded like good
grist for some
Twitterbot fun.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.457 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
BRAD HAYES, Postdoctoral
Associate, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology: I went
to work, and

28:45.490 --> 28:50.662 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I created this bot, and I went
through and
grabbed all of the transcripts I
could find

28:50.696 --> 28:56.802 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from his speeches, the
Republican debates,
from his Twitter feed, basically
anything,

28:56.835 --> 29:01.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
any kind of Donald Trump
information, things
that he has said, such that I
could train

29:01.740 --> 29:03.542 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the statistical model on that.

29:03.575 --> 29:09.181 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MILES O'BRIEN: His bot,
DeepDrumpf, doesn't
understand language, per se, but
rather detects

29:09.214 --> 29:11.283 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
patterns in the sequence of
letters.

29:11.316 --> 29:14.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: A lot of things
are going on
folks, a lot of things.

29:14.820 --> 29:19.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: By analyzing
reams of Trump
speeches, it can make
statistically valid

29:19.992 --> 29:25.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and frequently humorous
predictions of how
the real Donald Trump might
complete sentences

29:25.931 --> 29:27.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that Brad begins.

29:27.232 --> 29:29.301 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
BRAD HAYES: "I'm a great judge
of this country.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have to control everybody and
let them
fight each other.

29:31.937 --> 29:32.904 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They won't refuse me.

29:32.938 --> 29:33.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I will make a fortune."

29:33.939 --> 29:35.574 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: What's your best
tweet?

29:35.607 --> 29:38.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BRAD HAYES: "If I don't win in
the end, I
will fire the entire American
people.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We cannot achieve peace if I
don't want it."

29:40.379 --> 29:42.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Does it kind of
surprise you
at times what comes out?

29:42.614 --> 29:44.349 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BRAD HAYES: Absolutely.

29:44.383 --> 29:47.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a computer scientist, the
most surprising
thing is that this kind of
simple model can

29:47.419 --> 29:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
create such great results.

29:49.187 --> 29:54.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MILES O'BRIEN: Which is why he
doesn't let
his bot tweet without human
supervision.

29:54.393 --> 29:58.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DeepDrumpf is all in good fun
and clearly
labeled a bot.

29:58.563 --> 30:05.303 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, tweeter, beware of the more
nefarious
bots that lurk out there in the
Twitterverse.

30:05.337 --> 30:11.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What may seem like a viral
grassroots movement
can be nothing more than an
empty field covered

30:11.410 --> 30:12.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Astroturf.

30:12.678 --> 30:18.417 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, take a moment to check
before you retweet.

30:18.450 --> 30:27.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Miles O'Brien, the "PBS
NewsHour," Boston.

30:27.159 --> 30:33.298 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

30:33.331 --> 30:39.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
where economic
worries meet white nationalism;
and the first

American author to win the
esteemed Man Booker
Prize.

30:42.741 --> 30:48.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But first: The
Defense Department
today tried to defuse a
burgeoning controversy

30:48.146 --> 30:52.317 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
surrounding recruitment bonuses
for soldiers.

30:52.350 --> 30:56.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon faced a mounting
outcry for trying
to recoup enlistment bonuses
from thousands

30:56.922 --> 30:59.424 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of California National Guard
members.

30:59.458 --> 31:03.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Defense Secretary Ash Carter
interrupted
a visit today to NATO
headquarters in Brussels

31:03.862 --> 31:05.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to address the issue.

31:05.831 --> 31:08.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ASHTON CARTER, U.S. Defense
Secretary: I have
ordered the suspension of all
efforts to collect

31:08.333 --> 31:16.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reimbursement from affected
California Guard
members, and that suspension
will continue

31:16.241 --> 31:20.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until I'm satisfied that our
process is working.

31:20.445 --> 31:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Over the
weekend, The Los
Angeles Times reported
California Guard soldiers

31:23.849 --> 31:28.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are being asked to repay bonuses
of $15,000
or more.

31:28.420 --> 31:33.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The payments were an effort to
meet enlistment
goals during the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan.

31:33.258 --> 31:37.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They were intended for soldiers
with skills
in high demand, but recruiters
doled them

31:37.395 --> 31:38.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
out improperly.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.599 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some of the soldiers say, it's
not their fault.

31:40.632 --> 31:42.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS BRYAN STROTHER,
California
National Guard: I had done
everything that

31:42.367 --> 31:44.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they had asked of me.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.837 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These were promises that were
made.

31:45.871 --> 31:49.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The push to
take back the
bonus money has also drawn angry
reactions

31:49.708 --> 31:51.209 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Congress.

31:51.243 --> 31:56.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Carter says he wants
all the cases
resolved by July 1.

31:56.081 --> 32:00.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We take a closer look at this
now with Los
Angeles Times reporter David
Cloud, who broke

32:00.318 --> 32:03.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this story, and Sergeant 1st
Class Robert
Richmond.

32:03.388 --> 32:09.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He reenlisted in the California
National Guard
in 2006 and received a $15,000
bonus, but

32:09.294 --> 32:12.030 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then was told he needed to pay
the money back.

32:12.063 --> 32:17.569 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, what's happening now in
terms of what
the secretary of defense said
today?

32:17.602 --> 32:19.371 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What does his order do?

32:19.404 --> 32:22.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CLOUD, The Los Angeles
Times: Well,
his order halts the recoupment
of all of these

32:22.507 --> 32:28.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cases right now, and sets up a
process to
essentially speed up the appeals
process that

32:28.480 --> 32:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many soldiers have gone through
and have,
you know, in a very frustrating
way, you know,

32:33.185 --> 32:36.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gone through years of efforts to
try to get
this recoupment stopped.

32:36.555 --> 32:39.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the Pentagon is setting up a
process to
speed up those appeals.

32:39.991 --> 32:41.193 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How did we get
here?

32:41.226 --> 32:44.362 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How did we get to the point that
he had to
say, stop this?

32:44.396 --> 32:50.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CLOUD: It's a long tale
that really
began in 2006, when the Guard
and the Army

32:50.669 --> 32:53.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as a whole needed troops to go
to Iraq and
to Afghanistan.

32:53.705 --> 32:57.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, they started paying large
bonuses, and
they started paying without a
lot of controls.

32:57.576 --> 33:01.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, there was a fair
amount of fraud
in what was done.

33:01.713 --> 33:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Soldiers didn't know about that.

33:02.781 --> 33:04.249 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They -- most soldiers didn't
know about that.

33:04.282 --> 33:07.285 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They took the money in good
faith, completed
their enlistments.

33:07.319 --> 33:11.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then, a decade later, they
get a bill
from the Pentagon or from the
National Guard

33:11.256 --> 33:12.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying, you have got to pay us
this money
back.

33:13.024 --> 33:15.260 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
A lot of them are justifiably
shocked.

33:15.293 --> 33:19.831 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Robert
Richmond, you were
one of those soldiers that had
this happen

33:19.865 --> 33:20.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to them.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much did this money mean to
you when you
got it?

33:23.235 --> 33:27.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, more important, what
happened to you
when you were requested to
return it?

33:27.772 --> 33:30.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS ROBERT RICHMOND,
U.S. Army
Special Forces: Well, for me
personally, the

33:30.909 --> 33:32.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
money meant something.

33:32.711 --> 33:36.047 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For other soldiers, because I'm
just one of
many, it meant the world.

33:36.081 --> 33:40.719 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These other soldiers, it
probably was everything,
that they relied on that bonus
solely for

33:40.752 --> 33:41.720 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.521 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For me, I partially relied on
it.

33:43.555 --> 33:48.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I had choices to go into the
civilian sector,
where I could earn a lot more
money, even

33:48.159 --> 33:53.064 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
working as an adviser in a
civilian capacity.

33:53.098 --> 33:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I asked if I was eligible
for a bonus.

33:54.866 --> 33:58.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They said I was eligible for
$15,000 for six
years.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.539 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I knew for a fact that that
enlistment would
send me back to Iraq.

34:01.573 --> 34:03.441 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
However, it was enough.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And with the camaraderie of
being with my
unit, it was enough for me to
make the decision

34:06.745 --> 34:09.948 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to go ahead and enlist for
another six years.

34:09.981 --> 34:13.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When they came back 10 years --
you know,
nine years later, actually, and
said I have

34:13.985 --> 34:17.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pay this money back, I was in
shock, in
awe.

34:17.222 --> 34:20.025 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the more that it went on, I
just felt
betrayed.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I felt it just -- it lacked
empathy.

34:22.627 --> 34:26.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I felt like I was some sort of a
criminal,
and they're -- going to give it
back right

34:26.531 --> 34:29.668 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now, or they were going to ruin
my life financially,
turning me in.

34:29.701 --> 34:31.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it was very threatening.

34:31.670 --> 34:35.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, you
said the government
has already recouped, what,
about $22 million

34:35.106 --> 34:36.841 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

34:36.875 --> 34:40.512 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What happens to the people who
have repaid
sums of money that perhaps
shouldn't have?

34:40.545 --> 34:45.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID CLOUD: That's a very good
question and
is one that will be difficult to
untangle.

34:45.150 --> 34:50.789 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are soldiers I know, one
in particular,
who owed $46,000, and to pay
that off, he

34:50.822 --> 34:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and his family refinanced their
home.

34:52.757 --> 34:56.061 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they took steps that cost
them money to
pay off the money.

34:56.094 --> 35:00.498 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To now go back and make them
whole will not
be an easy task.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.634 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's one that I think the
Pentagon will
look at.

35:02.667 --> 35:07.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, this has generated so
much outrage
in Congress and so much
attention that I think

35:07.305 --> 35:12.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people who, you know, did take
the steps to
pay the money back, even
thinking that they

35:12.210 --> 35:15.246 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
didn't really owe it, will in
some sense be
made whole.

35:15.280 --> 35:18.450 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure they will be made
totally whole,
but they will get some money
back.

35:18.483 --> 35:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Robert, I see
you shaking
you head.

35:20.285 --> 35:23.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the people that David
spoke to in the
story, she said, you know, go
ahead, fine,

35:23.588 --> 35:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
take the money back, but give me
my years
back, too.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.225 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Where does this leave you?

35:27.258 --> 35:29.561 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS ROBERT RICHMOND:
Yes, it certainly
won't make me whole.

35:29.594 --> 35:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, what I did in the
military and what
I did -- you know, what happened
to me, that

35:34.899 --> 35:35.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
-- I signed a contract.

35:35.900 --> 35:36.868 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I did that.

35:36.901 --> 35:38.703 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's fine.

35:38.737 --> 35:42.540 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you gave me my $15,000 bonus
back, that
would hardly make me whole,
because by -- with

35:42.574 --> 35:44.709 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
what they did to me, they ruined
my credit.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.077 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They ruined my finances.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.580 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have so many financial losses
as a result.

35:48.613 --> 35:51.649 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm just -- I'm in the
middle of the group.

35:51.683 --> 35:56.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are soldiers out there
that have probably
suffered so bad financially and
emotionally

35:56.755 --> 35:59.357 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they will never be able to
recover just
by giving them their money back.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not even close.

36:01.226 --> 36:05.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: David, it
seems -- there
seems to be some agreement right
now in Congress

36:05.630 --> 36:07.432 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to say, this is horrible.

36:07.465 --> 36:09.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By coincidence, there's an
election two weeks
out.

36:09.501 --> 36:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And part of your reporting
showed that Congress
was notified about this a couple
of years

36:15.106 --> 36:16.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.075 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CLOUD: Yes.

36:17.108 --> 36:18.810 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's an interesting part of
the story.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, when the story broke on
Saturday,
you know, in the days after, you
had a lot

36:20.745 --> 36:25.150 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of members of Congress putting
out press releases
expressing a lot of outrage
about it, saying

36:25.183 --> 36:27.018 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
something needed to be done.

36:27.052 --> 36:31.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As the story came out, it turned
out the California
Guard had gone to members of the
California

36:31.322 --> 36:36.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegation two years earlier and
asked them
to pass a provision that would
have helped

36:36.528 --> 36:39.831 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
allay some of these cases.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The provision wasn't passed at
the time.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.536 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Several members did initially
propose it.

36:44.569 --> 36:46.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was dropped because it would
have cost
money.

36:46.704 --> 36:51.776 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this was a time when
sequestration, across-the-board
cuts in the military budget were
happening.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was just a resistance to
doing that
sort of thing.

36:54.379 --> 36:57.482 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, nothing happened until it
appeared in
our newspaper.

36:57.515 --> 37:01.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Robert, you
set up a petition
online, and I'm assuming that
even before

37:01.686 --> 37:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, you have been listening to
and hearing
from other soldiers.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.892 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Give us a sense of how
widespread this is.

37:07.926 --> 37:11.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are focusing on California
right now, but
there are National Guard members
across the

37:11.896 --> 37:13.098 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
country.

37:13.131 --> 37:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS ROBERT RICHMOND:
That's absolutely
right.

37:14.599 --> 37:18.403 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I first received my letter,
I honestly
thought I was the only one.

37:18.436 --> 37:21.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while I was calling people
and asking
questions, I came to find out
there was nearly

37:21.806 --> 37:25.009 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
17,000 soldiers affected, was
the first number
I heard.

37:25.043 --> 37:30.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then I heard it was 16,000 in
California and
at least 1,000 nationwide.

37:30.381 --> 37:34.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Recently, by doing my petition,
people write
to me all the time because I
have my contact

37:34.786 --> 37:36.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
information in there.

37:36.488 --> 37:41.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I recently was reached out to by
somebody
from the actual Navy who is
having the same

37:41.059 --> 37:42.794 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
issues.

37:42.827 --> 37:45.363 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Sergeant 1st
Class Robert Richmond and David
Cloud of The

37:45.396 --> 37:47.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
L.A. Times, thank you both for
joining us
tonight.

37:47.398 --> 37:48.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID CLOUD: Thank you.

37:48.566 --> 37:53.404 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SGT. 1ST CLASS ROBERT RICHMOND:
Thank you
very much.

37:53.438 --> 38:05.049 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The number of
white nationalist
groups has surged in the United
States over

38:05.083 --> 38:06.851 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the past couple of years.

38:06.885 --> 38:11.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Experts say they have been
energized by the
divisive rhetoric of this year's
presidential

38:11.623 --> 38:13.324 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
campaign.

38:13.358 --> 38:17.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The "NewsHour"'s P.J. Tobia met
with the leaders
of one group and produced this
report.

38:17.729 --> 38:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a warning: Some may find the
imagery and
symbols in this story
disturbing.

38:22.534 --> 38:29.707 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Late summer, in the
hills of East
Tennessee, a small group of
white power activists

38:29.741 --> 38:30.942 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hold a meeting.

38:30.975 --> 38:35.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's merchandise, music, and
a rewriting
of history.

38:35.980 --> 38:40.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Despite the mythology,
Russian Jews were
never oppressed in any way.

38:40.485 --> 38:45.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Later, the group
goes to a nearby
town for a rally, in the center
of it all,

38:45.623 --> 38:47.458 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Matthew Heimbach.

38:47.492 --> 38:48.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW HEIMBACH, Co-Founder,
Traditionalist
Worker Party: Because a white
homeland shall

38:48.960 --> 38:50.728 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be our homeland.

38:50.762 --> 38:53.932 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Just 25 years old,
the Southern
Poverty Law Center has called
Heimbach the

38:53.965 --> 38:57.001 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
face of a new generation of
white nationalists.

38:57.035 --> 39:00.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In 2015, he founded the
Traditionalist Worker
Party.

39:00.672 --> 39:05.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're white separatists who
want distinct
homelands in the U.S. for whites
and blacks.

39:05.610 --> 39:07.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They want Jews out of the
country entirely.

39:07.412 --> 39:09.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you guys racists?

39:09.080 --> 39:13.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW HEIMBACH: The definition
of racist
is thrown around all the time in
America,

39:13.418 --> 39:18.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and it's used almost exclusively
just to determine
any white people that want to be
able to advocate

39:18.590 --> 39:20.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for their best interests.

39:20.425 --> 39:25.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: But there were Nazis
and all kinds
of very strident anti-minority
propaganda.

39:25.363 --> 39:29.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone with a Nazi symbol on
them is going
to be considered a racist, if
not racially

39:29.734 --> 39:31.569 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
insensitive.

39:31.603 --> 39:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW HEIMBACH: And so our
movement is moving
towards being a European-style
nationalist

39:34.539 --> 39:35.707 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
movement.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I respect all my comrades
from other organizations.

39:37.208 --> 39:40.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They might take a little bit of
a different
presentation than we do.

39:40.745 --> 39:43.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see what direction
our movement
is moving in.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.549 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I'm happy to be a part of
that.

39:44.582 --> 39:48.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: This election
season, Heimbach
is supporting Donald Trump.

39:48.686 --> 39:53.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In March, he was caught on tape
shoving a
young African-American woman as
she was being

39:53.091 --> 39:55.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
escorted out of a Trump rally.

39:55.827 --> 40:00.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When he's not on the road
preaching white
nationalism, Heimbach lives
here, the southern

40:00.098 --> 40:02.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Indiana town of Paoli.

40:02.734 --> 40:07.438 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just steps from the town square,
Heimbach
moved his family to this
two-acre plot.

40:07.472 --> 40:11.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Matt Parrott, Heimbach's friend
and co-founder
of the Traditionalist Worker
Party, bought

40:11.743 --> 40:13.244 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the land in a bank repossession.

40:13.278 --> 40:16.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A handful of Heimbach's other
followers have
joined them.

40:17.015 --> 40:18.416 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Their plan?

40:18.449 --> 40:21.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
To build a community of
like-minded separatists
in this rural enclave.

40:21.853 --> 40:26.357 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
From the Ku Klux Klan to
skinheads, white
power groups are nothing new in
the United

40:26.391 --> 40:28.293 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

40:28.326 --> 40:31.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, in recent years, their
numbers have grown,
drawing disaffected whites who
say they feel

40:31.496 --> 40:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
increasingly marginalized in
America 2016.

40:35.500 --> 40:39.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heimbach sees overlap between
Trump's message
and white nationalist ideology.

40:39.103 --> 40:44.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW HEIMBACH: He has shown
us that the
majority of everyday Americans
support our

40:44.375 --> 40:46.177 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
sort of message.

40:46.210 --> 40:49.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're tired of globalism,
they're tired
of rampant capitalism, they're
tired of Wall

40:49.147 --> 40:51.849 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Street being put first, instead
of Main Street.

40:51.883 --> 40:56.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: At 34, Matt Parrott
is one of
the older members of Heimbach's
group.

40:56.321 --> 40:58.289 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's lived in Paoli most of his
life.

40:58.323 --> 41:00.191 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He gave me a tour.

41:00.224 --> 41:01.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT PARROTT, Co-Founder,
Traditionalist Worker
Party: Everything's winding up
and closing

41:01.526 --> 41:02.860 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
down.

41:02.894 --> 41:06.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All through here, you see
business for sale,
business for sale.

41:06.998 --> 41:10.568 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Up there, that business is also
for sale.

41:10.601 --> 41:13.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was growing up, like,
everybody's dad
worked in a factory.

41:13.404 --> 41:17.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You would have the dad working
in a factory
and you would have the
stay-at-home mom.

41:17.575 --> 41:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now both mom and dad are
working some
crappy service job that doesn't
pay benefits,

41:25.116 --> 41:26.384 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
oftentimes that's just
part-time.

41:26.417 --> 41:30.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: He blames this
decline on global
trade policies.

41:30.722 --> 41:34.525 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Using a common anti-Semitic
trope, he blames
one group in particular.

41:34.559 --> 41:41.065 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT PARROTT: The globalist
trade and things
like that are largely due to the
global Jewish

41:41.099 --> 41:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
economic and banking interests.

41:42.934 --> 41:47.338 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Parrott says that
all of this
has fueled both white
nationalism and support

41:47.372 --> 41:48.840 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Trump.

41:48.873 --> 41:53.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT PARROTT: He taps into a
deep sense of
foreboding in white America.

41:53.778 --> 41:57.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Heimbach says this
foreboding
comes from new attitudes in
America.

41:57.949 --> 41:59.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Chief among his complaints?

41:59.851 --> 42:04.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The increasing cultural currency
of the Black
Lives Matter movement and the
notion of white

42:04.389 --> 42:06.190 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
privilege.

42:06.224 --> 42:10.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATTHEW HEIMBACH: I would dare
anyone to go
into the hollers of West
Virginia, or Kentucky,

42:10.695 --> 42:15.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or the communities that have
been destroyed
by globalism around this
country, where the

42:15.333 --> 42:19.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
communities have literally been
torn apart,
and look in the eyes of white
working-class

42:19.704 --> 42:24.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
men, women and children, and
tell them that
they have any power in this
system whatsoever.

42:24.876 --> 42:28.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CAROL ANDERSON, Emory
University: Economic
anxieties play into it.

42:28.679 --> 42:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think I would say that it's
more hyped than
real.

42:32.016 --> 42:36.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Carol Anderson is a
professor
at Emory University and the
author of "White

42:36.454 --> 42:38.990 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our
Racial Divide."

42:39.023 --> 42:47.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL ANDERSON: It is racism,
pure, unabashed,
unadulterated, as I say, USDA
grade-A prime

42:47.432 --> 42:49.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beef racism.

42:49.600 --> 42:57.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Race is framing this discussion,
even when
it seems cloaked in language
such as law and

42:57.542 --> 43:00.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
order or stop and frisk.

43:00.778 --> 43:01.746 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's race.

43:01.779 --> 43:03.781 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Race, combined with
fear.

43:03.815 --> 43:10.054 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CAROL ANDERSON: What we're
seeing is a fear
in America that this America is
becoming vastly

43:10.087 --> 43:11.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more multicultural, vastly more
diverse.

43:11.923 --> 43:18.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It leads to a question about,
what will happen
to the resources of this nation,
as they have

43:18.229 --> 43:26.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to become more equitably shared
and distributed
based on merit, and not skin
color?

43:26.170 --> 43:29.640 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: This is not just an
American phenomenon.

43:29.674 --> 43:32.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
White nationalist groups have
surged in Europe.

43:32.610 --> 43:36.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heimbach frequently meets with
the leaders
of European nationalist groups,
like Greece's

43:36.247 --> 43:39.917 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Golden Dawn and the National
Democratic Party
in Germany.

43:39.951 --> 43:42.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They all want immigrants kept
out of their
countries.

43:42.520 --> 43:43.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: You know what?

43:43.955 --> 43:47.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yes, make American great again,
build a wall,
kick these people out.

43:47.291 --> 43:49.527 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is my country.

43:49.560 --> 43:51.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This all belongs to me.

43:51.229 --> 43:55.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Trump has earned the
endorsement
of a number of prominent
racists.

43:55.066 --> 43:59.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard
David Duke
mentioned Trump in his
announcement of a Senate

43:59.437 --> 44:01.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
run in Louisiana.

44:01.205 --> 44:02.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID DUKE, Former Imperial
Wizard of the
Ku Klux Klan: I'm overjoyed to
see Donald

44:02.974 --> 44:09.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump and most Americans embrace
most of the
issues that I have championed
for years.

44:09.146 --> 44:13.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: In the run-up to the
Iowa caucus,
well-known white power writer
Jared Taylor

44:13.317 --> 44:17.455 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recorded this anti-Muslim
immigrant robocall
that went out to Iowa voters.

44:17.488 --> 44:21.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JARED TAYLOR, White Power
Writer: We don't
need Muslims.

44:21.092 --> 44:25.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We need smart, well-educated
white people
who will assimilate to our
culture.

44:25.897 --> 44:27.498 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Vote Trump.

44:27.532 --> 44:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: Hard statistics on
white nationalist
groups are difficult to come by.

44:30.768 --> 44:35.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the Southern Poverty Law
Center says the
number of hate groups in the
U.S. increased

44:35.106 --> 44:37.875 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by 14 percent last year.

44:37.909 --> 44:42.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A recent report by the
Anti-Defamation League
said that anti-Semitic Twitter
attacks on

44:42.146 --> 44:44.749 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
journalists spiked early this
year.

44:44.782 --> 44:49.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Words like Trump, nationalist
and white appeared
frequently in the bios of users
publishing

44:49.520 --> 44:51.222 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the tweets.

44:51.255 --> 44:55.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White power Web site Stormfront
sees a 30
percent to 40 percent increase
in traffic

44:55.159 --> 45:00.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when Trump makes news on
immigration or Muslims,
according to an interview with
the site's

45:00.164 --> 45:01.899 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
owner.

45:01.933 --> 45:05.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Critics charge that Trump has
been slow to
reject the embrace of alt-right
groups and

45:05.503 --> 45:07.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
racists, including David Duke's
endorsement.

45:07.905 --> 45:11.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also say Trump has echoed
the language
used by groups like Heimbach's.

45:11.876 --> 45:14.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
This election will determine
whether we are

45:14.845 --> 45:20.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a free nation or whether we have
only the
illusion of democracy, but are
in fact controlled

45:20.685 --> 45:25.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by a small handful of global
special interests
rigging the system.

45:25.423 --> 45:27.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And our system is rigged.

45:27.525 --> 45:34.632 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Anyone who challenges their
control is deemed
a sexist, a racist, a xenophobe,
and morally

45:34.665 --> 45:36.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
deformed.

45:36.467 --> 45:41.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: The Trump campaign
did not respond
to a request for comment for
this story.

45:41.706 --> 45:45.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Heimbach and his followers say
Trump's rhetoric
stops short of their ethnic
ideology.

45:45.710 --> 45:50.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even if the candidate loses,
they think this
campaign has opened the door for
what they

45:50.948 --> 45:52.883 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
hope will be a wider following.

45:52.917 --> 45:55.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATTHEW HEIMBACH: It's about
these ideas of
nationalism, not globalism.

45:55.820 --> 45:57.288 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's what we're building
towards.

45:57.321 --> 46:01.125 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And Donald Trump is just
introducing these
ideas to a lot of new people.

46:01.158 --> 46:04.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we were here before, and
we're going to
be here after.

46:04.161 --> 46:10.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
P.J. TOBIA: P.J. Tobia, "PBS
NewsHour," in
Southern Indiana.

46:10.034 --> 46:18.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Online, we
explore concerns
about racial bias in policing
and a decade-old

46:18.676 --> 46:22.947 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
FBI warning about white
supremacists infiltrating
law enforcement.

46:22.980 --> 46:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's at PBS.org/NewsHour.

46:28.352 --> 46:40.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight, a very
different look at race and a
first in the

46:41.032 --> 46:42.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
world of books.

46:42.266 --> 46:44.769 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
An American has won the
prestigious Man Booker
Prize.

46:44.802 --> 46:48.673 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The honor was originally
established for British
Commonwealth and Irish writers.

46:48.706 --> 46:52.677 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, three years ago, all
English-language
authors became eligible.

46:52.710 --> 46:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, last night, Paul Beatty
became the first
American winner for his novel
"The Sellout,"

46:57.848 --> 47:03.888 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a biting satire of race in this
country, in
which a black man decides to
resegregate his

47:03.921 --> 47:05.256 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
hometown.

47:05.289 --> 47:08.125 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown spoke with him
when the book
came out last year.

47:08.159 --> 47:09.126 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's another look.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.594 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Well, Paul
Beatty, welcome.

47:10.628 --> 47:12.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL BEATTY, Author, "The
Sellout": Thanks
for having me.

47:12.329 --> 47:18.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is a
thorough skewering
through humor of racial politics
today.

47:18.135 --> 47:19.870 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And no one is spared.

47:19.904 --> 47:20.871 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What set you off?

47:20.905 --> 47:22.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What are you responding to?

47:22.373 --> 47:23.641 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

47:23.674 --> 47:26.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL BEATTY: I'm just kind of
responding to
myself, I guess.

47:26.410 --> 47:31.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's not like there is some
impetus that's
like, oh, I have got to write
about that.

47:31.982 --> 47:34.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just stuff that I have been
thinking
about for a long time.

47:34.618 --> 47:40.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I just have been thinking
about segregation
for some reason, no -- I think I
had read

47:40.091 --> 47:44.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
something about somebody saying,
oh, black
people were better off under
segregation.

47:44.395 --> 47:48.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just went, oh, it would be
so fun to
try to

47:48.432 --> 47:51.836 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
see how segregation would work
now, in a weird
kind of guise.

47:51.869 --> 47:57.675 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: So your
character, nameless
character, young black man, he
tries to resegregate

47:57.708 --> 47:58.809 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
his city, in a sense.

47:58.843 --> 47:59.810 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL BEATTY: Yes.

47:59.844 --> 48:00.811 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

48:00.845 --> 48:01.812 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In order to save
it, right?

48:01.846 --> 48:02.813 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL BEATTY: Yes.

48:02.847 --> 48:04.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Strangely enough.

48:04.715 --> 48:07.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL BEATTY: He doesn't know
that he's doing
that, and that the city is
already segregated.

48:07.651 --> 48:09.854 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It is de facto --
it is segregated.

48:09.887 --> 48:11.188 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL BEATTY: In many different
ways.

48:11.222 --> 48:14.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, yes, as is
much of our
life today still.

48:14.058 --> 48:15.826 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL BEATTY: Exactly.

48:15.860 --> 48:20.297 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's interesting in the book how
acknowledging
that you're being segregated
changes your

48:20.331 --> 48:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behavior a little bit.

48:22.099 --> 48:30.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But it allows you
to look at
every black piety, at every
liberal piety.

48:30.441 --> 48:33.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's easy in a way to kind of
skewer out-and-out
racism.

48:33.878 --> 48:34.845 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL BEATTY: Yes.

48:34.879 --> 48:36.147 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

48:36.180 --> 48:36.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you're doing
-- you are
getting everybody.

48:36.881 --> 48:38.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL BEATTY: Yes.

48:38.849 --> 48:44.522 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it's -- I'm not very
pious about anything,
fortunately, but I'm skewering
myself first.

48:44.555 --> 48:49.994 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm skewering things that I care
about and
things that are important to me
and then just

48:50.027 --> 48:51.829 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
my own foibles.

48:51.862 --> 48:54.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For me, it's just this stuff
that I'm thinking
about, like these absurdities in
the way we

48:54.932 --> 48:57.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talk about race, class, culture,
education,
politics.

48:57.234 --> 48:58.235 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What absurdities?

48:58.269 --> 48:59.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do we get wrong?

49:00.004 --> 49:02.039 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL BEATTY: We get it all
wrong.

49:02.072 --> 49:03.808 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's no right.

49:03.841 --> 49:07.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that is part of it,
is, like,
we think that there is this
weird utopian

49:07.545 --> 49:11.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
endgame to life, not just racial
politics.

49:11.749 --> 49:14.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And for me, it's a weird way to
try to live
life.

49:14.151 --> 49:18.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's not to say that we
shouldn't aspire
to those things.

49:18.889 --> 49:24.161 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So a thing I have been hearing
about lately
is some people always say, oh,
it's hard to

49:24.195 --> 49:25.329 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talk about race.

49:25.362 --> 49:26.497 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can't have the discussion.

49:26.530 --> 49:28.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm, like, well, what does that
really mean?

49:28.799 --> 49:33.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't understand what that
discussion is
and where this metaphorical
table -- you know,

49:33.804 --> 49:34.939 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have got to come to the
table.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't know where these tables
are.

49:36.373 --> 49:37.675 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:37.708 --> 49:39.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL BEATTY: So, yes, I get to
set my own
table a little bit.

49:39.476 --> 49:43.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: At the same time,
though, of
course, these are very serious
issues.

49:43.047 --> 49:50.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In your book, the narrator's
father is shot
by police in an area around Los
Angeles, and

49:50.254 --> 49:51.222 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's very real stuff.

49:51.255 --> 49:52.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL BEATTY: Yes.

49:52.556 --> 49:53.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But your approach
is completely
through humor.

49:53.991 --> 49:57.228 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL BEATTY: Yes, through humor
and through
my own experience.

49:57.261 --> 50:00.564 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, like, the shooting is
something that's
sort of personal to me.

50:00.598 --> 50:03.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't like, oh, people are
getting shot,
let me write about that.

50:03.801 --> 50:07.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm really starting from myself,
and I'm not
starting from current events or
what it is

50:07.304 --> 50:10.741 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the news or some "TIME"
magazine sidebar
about this stuff.

50:10.774 --> 50:12.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Are we too
squeamish?

50:12.576 --> 50:17.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was thinking to myself, one of
the problems
I have even in quoting from the
book is your

50:17.815 --> 50:19.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
very liberal use of the N-word.

50:19.950 --> 50:20.918 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL BEATTY: Yes.

50:20.951 --> 50:21.919 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

50:21.952 --> 50:22.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right?

50:22.953 --> 50:23.921 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can't sit here and read it.

50:23.954 --> 50:24.955 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We can't quote from it too much.

50:24.989 --> 50:25.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are we too squeamish?

50:25.990 --> 50:27.858 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Are we just not talking
honestly?

50:27.892 --> 50:34.331 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL BEATTY: I think it's like
-- like, when
I used to read poetry, people
would bring

50:34.365 --> 50:36.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
me into like some high school to
read.

50:36.533 --> 50:38.502 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I would say the F-word or
something.

50:38.535 --> 50:42.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And everybody acts so surprised,
like, oh,
I have never heard this word
before.

50:42.640 --> 50:44.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But they're saying it five
minutes later.

50:44.675 --> 50:52.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I think there's a weird --
there's this
line between propriety and how
we really speak

50:52.816 --> 50:54.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and how we really think.

50:54.151 --> 50:56.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I'm just trying to have fun
with that
stuff.

50:56.186 --> 50:57.788 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you're talking about the
word (EXPLETIVE
DELETED).

50:57.821 --> 50:59.156 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I can't say the N-word for it.

50:59.189 --> 51:02.226 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just even let myself say it
because it's
just so ridiculous.

51:02.259 --> 51:08.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is a part of the book
where characters
talking about Mark Twain's
"Huckleberry Finn."

51:08.465 --> 51:10.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that word is all throughout
there.

51:10.501 --> 51:13.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this effort to eras that,
and so it's
weird.

51:13.637 --> 51:18.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm not sure why we're trying to
erase these
things, why we try to use these
euphemisms

51:18.709 --> 51:19.677 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
all the time.

51:19.710 --> 51:21.312 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, what purpose is that
serving?

51:21.345 --> 51:26.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is this kind of
big satire
hard to pull off?

51:26.216 --> 51:29.820 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL BEATTY: Yes, I don't try to
be satirical.

51:29.853 --> 51:32.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I just try to get what's in my
head on the
page.

51:32.756 --> 51:34.124 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that part is hard for me to
do.

51:34.158 --> 51:40.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It takes a long, long time to
make it poetic,
somewhat essayistic.

51:40.831 --> 51:43.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And just I have a little bit of
an agenda.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.768 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That part is hard to pull off.

51:44.802 --> 51:47.171 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the book is about a big
scope.

51:47.204 --> 51:52.109 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think everybody focuses on
race, but it's
about a ton of things, and it's
because I

51:52.142 --> 51:56.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just see these things as all
interrelated
and all interwoven in a weird
way.

51:56.180 --> 52:00.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And where does
your sense,
where does your love of writing
come from
