JUDY WOODRUFF: Good
evening. I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.773 --> 00:08.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And I'm Gwen Ifill.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight: It's Election Day in
much of the country.

00:13.480 --> 00:19.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Voters pick new leaders and
decide on issues, from pot
legalization to LGBT rights.

00:19.319 --> 00:24.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Also ahead this
Tuesday: pipeline politics. The
company behind the Keystone

00:24.224 --> 00:28.195 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
XL pipeline asks to
hold off on a decision.

00:28.195 --> 00:32.599 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we talk with
the woman in charge of the
upcoming U.N. climate change

00:32.599 --> 00:34.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summit.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES, Executive
Secretary, United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate

00:35.569 --> 00:40.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Change: The major, major shift
that we had between where we
were in Copenhagen to now

00:40.240 --> 00:46.780 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is that countries have
increasingly understood that
addressing climate change is not
just

00:46.780 --> 00:51.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a global issue. It's actually
also a national priority.

00:51.251 --> 00:55.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Plus, could building
more dams be a solution for
drought-stricken California

00:55.155 --> 00:57.557 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
farmers?

00:57.557 --> 01:03.630 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:07.968 --> 01:17.878 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The puzzle of what
brought down a Russian airliner
over Egypt remained far

01:17.878 --> 01:23.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
from solved today. U.S.
officials said images shot from
space may contain clues to why
the

01:23.550 --> 01:28.622 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
plane broke up on Saturday,
killing all 224 people on board.

01:28.622 --> 01:33.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Paul Davies of Independent
Television News reports on the
day's developments.

01:33.160 --> 01:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL DAVIES: Stretcher bearers
formed a guard of honor as the
bodies recovered from the

01:38.231 --> 01:44.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wreckage in the Egyptian desert
finally completed their journey
home to Saint Petersburg.

01:44.204 --> 01:49.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a city in mourning. And
there are more painful days
ahead. Relatives have been

01:49.476 --> 01:56.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
arriving at the morgue to give
DNA samples to help in the grim
process of identification.

01:56.850 --> 02:01.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Russian officials have been
giving a daily update on the
recovery operation and the
spread

02:01.455 --> 02:07.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of wreckage on the ground, but
still no hard information on
whether this was an act of

02:07.160 --> 02:10.230 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
terrorism.

02:10.230 --> 02:19.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bereaved families are having to
make due with rumors. The latest
clues are all unconfirmed.

02:19.339 --> 02:25.212 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russian media is reporting that
unusual sounds were recorded by
the plane's black boxes.

02:25.212 --> 02:30.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American sources say their spy
satellites detected a strong
heat flash, which could

02:30.317 --> 02:35.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been an on-board explosion,
and there are reports of
mysterious debris at the crash

02:35.355 --> 02:41.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
site said not to be part of the
plane. It's hoped the
examination of flight recorders

02:41.595 --> 02:46.299 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
due to start tonight could
turn rumors into answers.

02:46.299 --> 02:50.670 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All that's known at this stage
is that the Russian Airbus
appeared to break up in midair

02:50.670 --> 02:56.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
after leaving the Egyptian Red
Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh,
and that all 224 on board

02:56.510 --> 03:01.114 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
perished. Egyptian investigators
say they will solve this
mystery, but warn it could

03:01.114 --> 03:03.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be a long process.

JUDY WOODRUFF: In other news, in
Turkey today, a crackdown
intensified on alleged
supporters

03:08.422 --> 03:11.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of a major opposition leader.

03:11.725 --> 03:17.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police arrested at least 44
people accused of ties to Muslim
cleric Fethullah Gulen,

03:17.831 --> 03:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who's in exile in the U.S. A
former police chief and three
state governors were among

03:23.703 --> 03:26.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those detained. The Turkish
government accuses Gulen of
running -- quote -- "a terrorist

03:26.973 --> 03:29.109 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%

GWEN IFILL: China and Taiwan
plan a historic summit on
Saturday. They announced today
that

03:34.481 --> 03:39.886 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chinese President Xi Jinping and
Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou
will meet Saturday

03:39.886 --> 03:45.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Singapore. It's the first
such meeting since 1949, when
communists won China's civil

03:45.625 --> 03:47.394 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
war.

03:47.394 --> 03:52.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The head of U.S.
Pacific forces played down
tensions with China today over

03:52.666 --> 03:57.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disputes in the South China Sea.
Last week, the U.S. Navy sent a
warship past Chinese-built

03:57.938 --> 04:01.842 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
islands, through waters
that Beijing claims.

04:01.842 --> 04:06.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At a meeting there today,
Admiral Harry Harris said the
move wasn't meant as a threat.
But

04:06.947 --> 04:10.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a top Chinese general complained
that it soured relations.

04:10.884 --> 04:14.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEN. FANG FENGHUI, Chief of
Staff, People's Liberation Army
(through translator): I had

04:14.855 --> 04:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
planned to have a good talk with
you on the South China Sea
issue. However, regardless

04:19.292 --> 04:24.531 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the solemn representations of
the Chinese side, the incident
has created a disharmonious

04:24.531 --> 04:27.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
atmosphere. We are resolute in
our determination and will to
safeguard our sovereignty and

04:27.434 --> 04:29.970 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
maritime rights.

04:29.970 --> 04:34.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: At a separate
meeting in Malaysia, China's
defense minister told U.S.
Defense

04:34.941 --> 04:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Secretary Ash Carter that
there's a -- quote -- "bottom
line" on challenges to China's

04:39.045 --> 04:42.549 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
territorial claims.
He didn't elaborate.

04:42.549 --> 04:48.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Iraqi politician
who played a key role in
promoting the U.S. invasion

04:48.188 --> 04:55.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in 2003 has died. State TV
reports Ahmed Chalabi had a
heart attack and passed away in
Baghdad.

04:55.262 --> 05:00.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After 9/11, the exiled leader
helped persuade officials in the
Bush administration that

05:00.066 --> 05:05.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Saddam Hussein possessed weapons
of mass destruction. That turned
out to be false. Chalabi later

05:05.939 --> 05:11.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
served as Iraq's deputy prime
minister. He was 71 years old.

05:11.011 --> 05:18.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Vatican faced
new exposes today in book form
about gross financial
mismanagement.

05:18.118 --> 05:23.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Associated Press reported
"Merchants in the Temple" tells
of wasteful spending, outright

05:23.957 --> 05:30.764 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
greed and entrenched resistance
to Pope Francis' reforms. A
second book, "Avarice," claims

05:30.764 --> 05:35.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that money from a hospital
foundation went to renovate a
Vatican official's plush
apartment.

05:35.635 --> 05:41.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Back in this
country, Republican presidential
candidate Donald Trump dismissed

05:41.007 --> 05:46.546 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his rivals' complaints about
debate formats and questions
today, but he didn't confirm

05:46.546 --> 05:52.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reports that his campaign plans
to negotiate its own debate
terms with TV networks. The

05:52.252 --> 05:55.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
billionaire celebrity was asked
about the issue at a news
conference in New York.

05:55.822 --> 05:58.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate: I will go anywhere
they want. I don't care

05:58.692 --> 06:02.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
too much about the debates.
Look, I'm the one that gets all
the nasty questions anyway.

06:02.495 --> 06:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I like the debates. I think
they're good for me, but we have
to be treated a little bit

06:06.800 --> 06:08.602 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
fairly.

06:08.602 --> 06:12.472 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, as far as I'm concerned, I
really don't care that much. I
just want to debate. I think

06:12.472 --> 06:15.875 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
debating is a good thing. It's
healthy. It gets everything into
the open.

06:15.875 --> 06:19.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Separately, Trump
accused the U.S. Federal Reserve
of keeping interest rates

06:19.913 --> 06:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
low at the request of President
Obama. The White House flatly
rejected that claim.

06:26.019 --> 06:32.158 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Japan's Takata
Corporation will pay $70 million
in U.S. fines for mishandling

06:32.158 --> 06:38.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a huge air bag recall. It could
reach a record $200 million if
the company fails to comply

06:38.832 --> 06:43.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with terms announced today.
Takata now admits that it
delayed recalling more than 20
million

06:43.903 --> 06:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
air bag inflators that can
explode with too much force.

06:48.508 --> 06:53.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The U.S. auto
industry is now on track for a
record year in sales. Most

06:53.847 --> 06:58.285 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
major automakers saw
double-digit gains last month.
GM led the way with sales up
nearly

06:58.285 --> 07:01.988 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
16 percent from a year ago.

07:01.988 --> 07:08.595 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on Wall Street, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
89 points to close at 17918.

07:08.595 --> 07:15.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose nearly 18
points, and the S&amp;P 500 added
more than five.

07:15.001 --> 07:20.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
from legalizing marijuana to
LGBT rights, voters go to the

07:20.273 --> 07:26.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
polls to decide; the
controversial Keystone pipeline,
is it effectively dead?; the
woman

07:26.313 --> 07:33.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in charge of the upcoming global
climate change summit, and much
more.

07:33.753 --> 07:46.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The presidential
election may still be a year
away, but a handful of states

07:46.199 --> 07:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
voted today to elect state and
local leaders and decide on a
number of important ballot

07:51.671 --> 07:57.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
measures. Issues ranged from the
legalization of marijuana to the
expansion of LGBT protections.

07:57.944 --> 08:03.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For a look at the big races and
voter initiatives around the
country, we are joined by Reid

08:03.049 --> 08:06.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Wilson of the Web site and
newsletter Morning Consult.

08:06.419 --> 08:09.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, welcome, Reid Wilson.

08:09.856 --> 08:13.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's start out talking about
some of these major ballot
measures around the country,

08:13.660 --> 08:19.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ohio looking at legalizing
marijuana, but in a limited way.
Tell us about that one.

08:19.265 --> 08:22.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON, Morning Consult:
Ohio would become fifth state
along with the District of
Columbia

08:22.435 --> 08:26.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to legalize marijuana for
recreational use, but there is a
little twist here.

08:26.740 --> 08:31.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As states create new laws about
marijuana, they have to come up
with new regulatory structures.

08:31.778 --> 08:35.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Nobody has ever regulated
marijuana, because it's always
simply been illegal. So what
Ohio

08:35.715 --> 08:40.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is thinking of doing is allowing
10 groups, 10 businesses to
control production for the

08:40.587 --> 08:43.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
first four years or so.

08:43.757 --> 08:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It seems a way to sort of
control what makes it to the
market and to sort of demand
some

08:49.863 --> 08:53.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quality. However, there are a
lot of people who are worried
that they're essentially handing

08:53.133 --> 08:57.137 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over monopoly control of a major
industry -- and it is a major
industry -- there are

08:57.137 --> 09:00.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
millions at stake here -- to
just a small handful of people,
including some very wealthy

09:00.440 --> 09:02.142 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
investors.

09:02.142 --> 09:04.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if this
passed, it would set a
precedent. It would be
different.

09:04.711 --> 09:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, every state
that has legalized marijuana has
done so in a slightly different

09:09.382 --> 09:14.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way. Washington State regulates
it like alcohol. Colorado
regulates it in a sort of
slightly

09:14.354 --> 09:19.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
different way that allows
sellers to grow their own
marijuana.

09:19.626 --> 09:22.829 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Everybody is sort of trying to
figure out what's right, what is
the right way to do

09:22.829 --> 09:26.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these things. The big question
is, what is going to come on the
ballot in 2016? There

09:26.766 --> 09:31.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are at least 17 states that are
considering some kind of
marijuana legislation or ballot

09:31.604 --> 09:34.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
initiatives, including 10 alone
in the state of California.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.509 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you were
telling us that's a way the look
at several of these ballot

09:36.509 --> 09:38.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
measures.

09:38.878 --> 09:43.750 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's look at -- talk about two
of the city measures. In
Houston, you have voters looking

09:43.750 --> 09:49.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at nondiscrimination protection
for LGBT individuals. This has
become very controversial, and a

09:49.622 --> 09:51.524 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
lot of focus on
public restrooms.

09:51.524 --> 09:54.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Yes, it has.

09:54.661 --> 10:00.099 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
And last year, a
nondiscrimination law passed the
city of Houston. This measure,
if it passes

10:00.099 --> 10:06.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tonight, would repeal that
previous nondiscrimination
measure. And the focus on
restrooms, I think,

10:06.139 --> 10:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sort of hints at the next step
in the fight over gay rights.
The focus on restrooms has

10:10.743 --> 10:13.613 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to do with those who
are transgendered.

10:13.613 --> 10:19.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, there's public support for
people -- for nondiscrimination
against those who are
transgendered

10:19.319 --> 10:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has lagged behind public support
for nondiscrimination against
gays and lesbians. So this is a
way

10:24.557 --> 10:30.129 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to sort of shift the focus from
a question that opponents of
this nondiscrimination law

10:30.129 --> 10:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would lose to some other element
that they might have a better
pathway to toward a majority

10:33.800 --> 10:35.235 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of public opinion.

10:35.235 --> 10:39.205 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, again, hotly
controversial there in Houston.

10:39.205 --> 10:43.943 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, San Francisco is
looking at an initiative on
Airbnb. This is the company

10:43.943 --> 10:46.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that helps you rent out a room
in your house, rent out your
apartment. Tell us about that

10:46.379 --> 10:48.381 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
one.

10:48.381 --> 10:52.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: Well, what this
legislation would do is, it
would limit the ability of
homeowners

10:52.952 --> 10:57.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to rent out their apartments on
a short-term basis, their
apartments, their homes,
whatever

10:57.690 --> 11:01.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
room they have to rent. It would
limit it to 75 days a year.
Currently, most homeowners

11:01.895 --> 11:06.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can rent out their place
for 90 days a year.

11:06.065 --> 11:10.236 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it's just a small little
change. However, it does have to
-- it does sort of speak to

11:10.236 --> 11:14.941 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this larger battle between the
traditional economy and the
rising sharing economy. We

11:14.941 --> 11:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have seen big legislative fights
in cities across the country
over Uber, as Uber takes

11:19.379 --> 11:24.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the taxi industry. Now we
have got Airbnb taking on the
hotel industry, both of whom

11:24.217 --> 11:26.920 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have millions of dollars
at stake in this.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.855 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, as far as we
know, first time Airbnb has been
on a ballot.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.924 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: As far as we know.

11:30.924 --> 11:34.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: OK. So, let's
look at now some of these races.
You have a governor's race,

11:34.694 --> 11:38.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a contested race in Kentucky.
You have got interesting state
Senate races in Virginia.

11:38.998 --> 11:41.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Let's look at those.

11:41.034 --> 11:46.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: So, in 2010 and
2014, one of the sort of
overlooked consequences of the

11:46.439 --> 11:50.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican wave that swept power
in Congress back towards the
Republicans was that it swept

11:50.543 --> 11:54.147 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
even more power back to
Republicans in state
legislatures.

11:54.147 --> 11:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are very few Democratic
state legislators in the country
these days, compared to before

11:59.419 --> 12:04.891 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 2010 elections. And in
Kentucky, one of the very few
Democrats who still governs a

12:04.891 --> 12:09.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Southern state, a usually
Republican state, is
term-limited. So the two
candidates who

12:09.095 --> 12:13.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are running, Attorney General
Jack Conway, the Democrat, is
probably slightly favored,

12:13.800 --> 12:17.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but only slightly, over the
Republican businessman Matt
Bevin.

12:17.337 --> 12:21.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You might remember Matt Bevin's
name. He ran against Mitch
McConnell two years ago -- last

12:21.107 --> 12:22.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year, rather, in a primary.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Challenged Mitch
McConnell in the last -- right.

12:23.943 --> 12:28.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: Matt Bevin has run
a very poor race at the moment,
but it's a very heavily

12:28.247 --> 12:33.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican state. What really
matters to the outcome of this
race is what voters are thinking

12:33.553 --> 12:37.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about when they head into the
polls. Are they thinking about
national issues and President

12:37.323 --> 12:41.094 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Obama? His approval rating is
at 34 percent in Kentucky.

12:41.094 --> 12:45.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or are they thinking about how
the outgoing governor, Steve
Beshear, the Democrat, has

12:45.131 --> 12:49.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
run the state? His approval
rating is at 59 percent.
Democrats want to focus on
statewide

12:49.035 --> 12:51.804 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
issues. Republicans want
to focus on the national.

12:51.804 --> 12:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And finally just
a word, Reid Wilson, about those
Senate races in Virginia,

12:55.508 --> 12:58.511 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, right now, both houses in
Virginia are controlled by the
Republicans.

12:58.511 --> 13:02.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
REID WILSON: And the Senate is
only narrowly controlled by
Republicans, just by one seat.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.351 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are about four races that
we're all closely watching, a
couple down near Richmond,

13:05.351 --> 13:08.921 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a couple up here in the
Washington suburbs.

13:08.921 --> 13:13.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is one of those cases where
Democrats lost so many
legislative seats. They have

13:13.126 --> 13:17.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a chance to win back a chamber
tonight. It's -- maybe this is a
preview of 2016 and how

13:17.697 --> 13:19.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Democrats can do that.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Governor Terry
McAuliffe doing a lot of pacing
tonight.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REID WILSON: There you go.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, Reid
Wilson giving us a preview of
all those races.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

13:27.607 --> 13:35.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
REID WILSON: Thank you.

13:35.214 --> 13:42.789 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The long-running
debate over the Keystone
pipeline has taken another sharp

13:42.789 --> 13:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
turn, as the company behind its
construction asked to suspend a
review of its plans, triggering

13:48.795 --> 13:53.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many questions about whether the
Obama administration is planning
to reject it anyway.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary: Given how long it's
taken, it seems unusual

13:57.303 --> 14:01.808 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to me to suggest that somehow
it should be paused yet again.

14:01.808 --> 14:08.448 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: White House Press
Secretary Josh Earnest expressed
skepticism today over
TransCanada's

14:08.448 --> 14:15.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abrupt request to suspend the
Keystone application process.
The company said it wants to
wait

14:15.254 --> 14:19.625 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for state-level reviews and
litigation to play out. But
Earnest said another motive

14:19.625 --> 14:22.195 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
may be at work.

14:22.195 --> 14:26.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST: There's no doubt
that this debate has been
heavily influenced by politics,
and

14:26.199 --> 14:29.502 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the president is doing his best
to try to shield the actual
process that will consider

14:29.502 --> 14:32.905 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the merits of the project
from those politics.

14:32.905 --> 14:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Earnest said the
president still plans to decide
the issue before he leaves

14:37.043 --> 14:44.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
office in early 2017. If
approved, the pipeline would
connect oil sands in Alberta,
Canada,

14:44.884 --> 14:50.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to refineries along the Gulf
Coast, passing through six U.S.
states. It would carry 800,000

14:50.723 --> 14:53.926 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
barrels of oil a day.

14:53.926 --> 14:59.398 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The application process began in
2008, but a final decision has
been delayed time and

14:59.398 --> 15:04.704 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time again. The president has
remained publicly noncommittal
about the project, but in South

15:04.704 --> 15:08.541 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Carolina earlier this year, he
offered some pointed criticism.

15:08.541 --> 15:14.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States: We're not going
to authorize a pipeline that

15:14.947 --> 15:23.556 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
benefits largely a foreign
company, if it can't be shown
that it is safe and if it can't

15:23.556 --> 15:27.160 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be shown that, overall, it
wouldn't contribute to climate
change.

15:27.160 --> 15:32.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: In February, the
president also vetoed a
Republican bill to force
construction

15:32.498 --> 15:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the pipeline. Environmental
groups opposed to Keystone
argued today that TransCanada

15:38.271 --> 15:44.310 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is now hoping a president
friendlier to the project will
be elected next year.

15:44.310 --> 15:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wyoming Senator John Barrasso, a
leading Republican and pipeline
supporter, agreed.

15:48.347 --> 15:53.152 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SEN. JOHN BARRASSO (R), Wyoming:
By putting the pause button now,
that allows things to

15:53.152 --> 15:57.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stay active, in my opinion,
until after the 2016 election,
when we may have a Republican

15:57.557 --> 16:02.261 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president in office who can then
approve it. I think the fear
right now is that the president

16:02.261 --> 16:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was getting ready to oppose it
and put a final close-down on
it, and this just keeps it
alive.

16:08.067 --> 16:10.736 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: For now, the State
Department continues its review
of the project, with

16:10.736 --> 16:14.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no end date announced.

16:14.574 --> 16:19.011 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much of this latest twist in
the pipeline is driven by
politics, and how much by
policy?

16:19.011 --> 16:21.514 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For that, we turn to Juliet
Eilperin, who covers the White
House for The Washington

16:21.514 --> 16:22.582 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Post.

16:22.582 --> 16:26.152 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And you also cover these
environmental matters, Juliet.

16:26.152 --> 16:30.089 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we know -- we heard what
Josh Earnest said. The president
is going to decide before

16:30.089 --> 16:34.594 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he leaves office, but there's a
long period of time between we
get -- between now and

16:34.594 --> 16:38.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then. Where do we know, where do
we think, what does your
reporting tell us, that the

16:38.030 --> 16:40.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
administration is
in this process?

16:40.333 --> 16:43.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN, The Washington
Post: My sense is that the
administration has been debating

16:43.269 --> 16:49.008 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether to give a final decision
in advance of the U.N. climate
negotiations that are

16:49.008 --> 16:52.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the end of this month.
There's kind of an argument one
way or another.

16:52.411 --> 16:56.415 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could say that this would
help give added momentum for the
global fight against climate

16:56.415 --> 17:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
change, or they could wait until
after this period. The move by
TransCanada is a little

17:01.254 --> 17:04.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
unexpected. It kind of throws
more uncertainty into the
process.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But -- so that's one of the
things they're weighting. But in
terms of -- my sense is

17:08.461 --> 17:12.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from my reporting that the
review is finished, the
determination is made, and it's
a question

17:12.832 --> 17:15.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of, when are they going to
announce what they're going to
do?

17:15.401 --> 17:19.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And the assumption
among many parties is that the
decision that's been made

17:19.171 --> 17:21.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is against the pipeline.

17:21.340 --> 17:25.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Yes, that's my
sense of where they are, and it
certainly is interesting

17:25.778 --> 17:30.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to hear again folks, including
Senator Barrasso and others,
saying that they assume that's

17:30.182 --> 17:33.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it is and that's one of
the reasons they really would
like this decision delayed,

17:33.819 --> 17:37.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that the next president who
could be a Republican could
decide it.

17:37.456 --> 17:42.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, what's behind
TransCanada's decision to
request the pulling of the plug?

17:42.728 --> 17:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How would a delay for them
affect the outcome here?

17:47.833 --> 17:51.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Really, the
only question is that it would
give an opportunity to
potentially

17:51.504 --> 17:52.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
make the case before a
different administration.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.006 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: That's it?

17:54.006 --> 17:58.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Aside from
that, there's no real benefit.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you talk to them, they
say that they're not interested
in withdrawing the application,

18:01.180 --> 18:02.848 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
which would be
ultimately of course...

18:02.848 --> 18:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But they could
do that if they wanted to.

18:04.784 --> 18:07.586 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: They could do
that, but I talked to them just
today, and their spokesman

18:07.586 --> 18:10.156 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said they have no interest in
doing that. So, given that, it
seems very unlikely that

18:10.156 --> 18:12.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they would do that.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.860 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And yet a lot of
environmental organizations you
would assume would be dancing

18:14.860 --> 18:18.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a victory dance today
aren't exactly.

18:18.331 --> 18:21.334 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Right. No. In
fact, they're nervous about the
idea that this could be

18:21.334 --> 18:24.670 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
put over to the next
administration, where they don't
have a commitment, particularly,

18:24.670 --> 18:27.573 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
again, if it ends up
being a Republican.

18:27.573 --> 18:32.111 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, given, when we look at the
lay of the land, if it's a
Democrat, all the Democrats

18:32.111 --> 18:36.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
running right now are opposed to
it. But that's not the case in
the GOP. And so they really

18:36.082 --> 18:40.386 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want the president to reject
that so that's done before he
leaves office.

18:40.386 --> 18:43.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Are they pressuring
the White House at this stage,
or not letting up on

18:43.990 --> 18:47.560 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the previous pressure of the
White House to go ahead and make
this decision?

18:47.560 --> 18:51.831 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: They are
pressing very fiercely. All the
groups opposed to it issued
statements

18:51.831 --> 18:56.235 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last night when TransCanada
asked for a delay. There was no
variation. They're all saying,

18:56.235 --> 18:59.572 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this pipeline needs to be
rejected by President Obama
before he leaves office.

18:59.572 --> 19:04.844 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Now, part of
TransCanada's reasoning is that
there are still unresolved
issues,

19:04.844 --> 19:09.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially the path of the
pipeline through Nebraska. What
is that challenge and where

19:09.382 --> 19:10.583 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
does it stand?

19:10.583 --> 19:10.850 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JULIET EILPERIN: Right.
It's kind of complicated.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.518 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

19:12.518 --> 19:15.955 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: But the easy
way to put it is that they had a
route through Nebraska,

19:15.955 --> 19:19.692 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which essentially was thrown out
over procedural grounds stemming
from a lawsuit.

19:19.692 --> 19:25.564 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They have detailed three
possible routes, all of which
have been on the table before,

19:25.564 --> 19:30.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with a couple slight of
alterations. And so a state
commission has to approve that,
and

19:30.136 --> 19:33.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that process could take
between seven and 12 months.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.575 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: There's a southern
route that's already approved.

19:36.575 --> 19:40.880 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Exactly. We're
talking about this upper route,
which is 1,179 miles that

19:40.880 --> 19:44.683 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes to Steele City, Nebraska,
from Hardisty, Alberta.

19:44.683 --> 19:50.489 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The connection from Steele City,
Nebraska -- from Steele City
down to the Gulf Coast

19:50.489 --> 19:54.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was approved by the Obama
administration. The president
went out and talked about this

19:54.727 --> 19:58.164 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
being a way to increase
accessibility to oil. And so
that's been up and running, and
it's

19:58.164 --> 20:00.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
profitable.

20:00.399 --> 20:05.771 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So, in Canada, we
now have the potential of a
different leadership. Stephen

20:05.771 --> 20:10.042 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Harper, the former prime
minister, was very much in favor
of this. And now we have Justin

20:10.042 --> 20:13.412 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trudeau. Is there a different
political climate?

20:13.412 --> 20:16.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: There's a
slightly different political
climate, although incoming Prime

20:16.382 --> 20:20.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Minister Trudeau has said that
he's in favor of this pipeline.

20:20.319 --> 20:24.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That said, when he talked to the
president right after his
reelection, he emphasized

20:24.390 --> 20:29.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he thought the relationship
between the U.S. and Canada is
broader than one pipeline

20:29.195 --> 20:33.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and also talked about the
importance of balancing economic
interests against environmental
priorities.

20:33.132 --> 20:34.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And so clearly...

20:34.266 --> 20:34.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

20:34.967 --> 20:36.435 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: He's leaving
himself a little room.

20:36.435 --> 20:38.404 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: A little bit
of wiggle room on that front.

20:38.404 --> 20:41.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Where does the State
Department -- what role does the
State Department play

20:41.707 --> 20:45.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this decision process between
now and the end of the
president's term?

20:45.778 --> 20:50.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: They need to
issue a national interest
determination to essentially say

20:50.583 --> 20:54.820 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether or not this cross-border
permit is justified on the basis
of the U.S. national

20:54.820 --> 20:57.423 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
interest, which is a
very broad issue.

20:57.423 --> 21:02.962 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At that point, the president
could intervene if he wanted to
or not. So, at this point,

21:02.962 --> 21:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it is seen that whatever the
State Department does, it would
be in concert with the White

21:07.366 --> 21:09.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
House. And you wouldn't have --
it would seem quite unlikely
that they'd issue something

21:09.969 --> 21:11.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and then the president
would do something.

21:11.337 --> 21:13.539 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: So that's the next
shoe we're waiting to see drop.

21:13.539 --> 21:15.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JULIET EILPERIN: Waiting
to hear that drop.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Juliet Eilperin of
The Washington Post, thank you.

21:18.310 --> 21:26.285 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
JULIET EILPERIN:
Thank you, Gwen.

21:26.285 --> 21:31.857 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

21:31.857 --> 21:39.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
dams, the problem or solution in
a drought-stricken state;
teenagers'

21:39.064 --> 21:45.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
screen time spikes to nine hours
a day; and author John Irving
reveals his creative process.

21:45.571 --> 21:52.344 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVING, Author, "Avenue of
Mysteries": I always get endings
first. I can't tell you

21:52.344 --> 21:58.684 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
why, but I do. There is a sense
that I always have as a writer
that my endings are always

21:58.684 --> 22:01.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
predetermined for me.

22:01.754 --> 22:07.459 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, first, in
just a few weeks, countries from
around the world will meet

22:07.459 --> 22:13.599 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Paris to try to reach a new
agreement on limiting or
reducing greenhouse gas
emissions.

22:13.599 --> 22:18.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But prior climate summits have
often hit a wall over
disagreements about economics,
development

22:18.037 --> 22:21.173 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and what should be
the ultimate goals.

22:21.173 --> 22:26.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As the Paris conference nears,
Jeffrey Brown explores the
prospects ahead.

22:26.779 --> 22:34.320 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Last year marked
the warmest for the planet since
records were first kept,

22:34.320 --> 22:37.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lending new urgency to calls
from scientists and many leaders
for slowing greenhouse gas

22:37.990 --> 22:40.726 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
emissions.

22:40.726 --> 22:45.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To that end, the Paris summit
could present a major
opportunity -- a key goal, find
a

22:45.898 --> 22:49.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
way to slow the rise in global
temperatures to about two
degrees Celsius or by the end

22:49.068 --> 22:52.838 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the century.

22:52.838 --> 22:57.209 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama, who traveled to
Alaska this summer to show the
effects of warming, has

22:57.209 --> 23:02.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made it a central focus of his
second term, including new
limits on carbon dioxide
emissions

23:02.815 --> 23:07.186 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from power plants. In recent
months, China, India and the
European Union have all
announced

23:07.186 --> 23:10.489 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
long-term plans.

23:10.489 --> 23:15.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a similar conference in
Copenhagen six years ago failed
to reach a deal. And there

23:15.961 --> 23:19.798 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are questions about whether
voluntary commitments will work
this time, and also continued
political

23:19.798 --> 23:23.669 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opposition here and abroad.

23:23.669 --> 23:27.506 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Christiana Figueres is the
U.N.'s point person in charge of
the Paris summit. I sat down

23:27.506 --> 23:29.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
with her in Washington
earlier today.

23:29.742 --> 23:32.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Christiana Figueres,
welcome to you.

23:32.611 --> 23:31.710 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES, Executive
Secretary, United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate

23:31.710 --> 23:33.445 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Change: Thank you, Jeff.

23:33.445 --> 23:37.283 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Let me start with
the big question, six years ago
in Copenhagen widely seen as

23:37.283 --> 23:42.121 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a failure. Now Paris.
Have things changed?

23:42.121 --> 23:46.058 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: Well, you
know, I have often said that
Copenhagen was the most
successful

23:46.058 --> 23:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
failure of the United Nations,
because we learned an awful lot
from Copenhagen. But,

23:49.895 --> 23:51.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
yes, things have changed.

23:51.096 --> 23:53.732 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Is that
good spin? Or is that...

23:53.732 --> 23:58.003 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: No, no, no,
no, no, no. Truly, we made
actually a very in-depth study

23:58.003 --> 24:00.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of everything that went wrong in
Copenhagen, so that we could
learn. So, it's not just

24:00.806 --> 24:04.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
spin. It truly is the case.

24:04.176 --> 24:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, you know, in addition to
the way that we handle
conferences nowadays, in
addition

24:09.048 --> 24:15.587 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to that, what has changed
dramatically is the context in
which this meeting in Paris

24:15.587 --> 24:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is going to take place, for many
different reasons, technology
perhaps being one of the

24:21.026 --> 24:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very salient differences, where
we had before -- it wasn't
really sure whether renewable

24:27.466 --> 24:30.336 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
energies would be able to
compete with fossil fuel.

24:30.336 --> 24:35.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, today, we have the answer.
Yes, they are already competing.
So, you know, technology

24:35.341 --> 24:40.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is definitely much better.
Finance is already beginning to
flow. We already have $2.6
trillion

24:40.079 --> 24:42.214 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's already moving into green
technology. The policy...

24:42.214 --> 24:44.049 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

24:44.049 --> 24:47.686 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: OK, but let me
stop you on finances then,
because I want to get to some

24:47.686 --> 24:51.724 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the continuing
problems you face.

24:51.724 --> 24:55.794 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The pledge by industrial
countries to help poorer
countries with $100 billion a
year,

24:55.794 --> 24:58.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that part hasn't happened.

24:58.764 --> 25:01.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: It is a
pledge to help developing
countries with $100 billion by

25:01.667 --> 25:03.869 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
2020.

25:03.869 --> 25:10.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A (INAUDIBLE) report that was
just launched a couple of weeks
ago shows that, in 2013,

25:10.743 --> 25:16.615 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the flow was at $51 billion. In
2014, the flow was at $62
billion. And we don't have

25:16.615 --> 25:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the numbers for 2015, obviously
not also for next year, but
there is already a trend going

25:22.187 --> 25:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up, and hence a very good
possibility that we will be able
to -- that they will be able

25:25.491 --> 25:29.528 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get to $100 billion.

25:29.528 --> 25:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those numbers that I quote have
not been accepted by developing
countries because there still

25:34.066 --> 25:39.705 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has to be a discussion about
methodologies, definitions and
assumptions. But, order of

25:39.705 --> 25:42.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
magnitude, it shows that we're
moving certainly in the right
direction.

25:42.641 --> 25:45.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Political will,
you think, is more there than it
was?

25:45.411 --> 25:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: Political
will is definitely there.

25:46.478 --> 25:47.846 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:47.846 --> 25:49.982 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Where do you see
that? Give me an example. Where
do you see that?

25:49.982 --> 25:51.884 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: Well,
that's very simple.

25:51.884 --> 25:58.323 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All you have to do is take a
look at the 157 national climate
change plans that we have

25:58.323 --> 26:04.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already received and counting,
because we will receive more
before Paris, so 157 different

26:04.596 --> 26:09.768 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
countries, every single one of
the industrialized countries,
every one, and over 100 other
countries

26:09.768 --> 26:15.707 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who have already put in writing
and in public what they're going
to do to contribute both

26:15.707 --> 26:19.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to bringing emissions down, as
well as to making their
infrastructure more resilient.

26:19.978 --> 26:23.916 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Most of that
nonbinding agreements from these
countries.

26:23.916 --> 26:29.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of experts continue to
question that. Circumstances
change. Politics change. How

26:29.288 --> 26:31.590 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
do you know that
they stick to it?

26:31.590 --> 26:35.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: Well, first
of all, I don't know of anything
binding that is actually

26:35.260 --> 26:38.163 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a guarantee.

26:38.163 --> 26:42.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Kyoto Protocol is the best
example of that, because we had
countries adopt the Kyoto

26:42.267 --> 26:46.605 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Protocol and then not ratify. We
had countries adopt, ratify and
then still not comply. So,

26:46.605 --> 26:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you know, even if it's legally
binding, that's not a guarantee.

26:50.642 --> 26:54.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think one of the major --
going back to your first
question, sort of the major,

26:54.947 --> 27:01.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
major shift that we had between
where we were in Copenhagen and
now is that countries have

27:01.053 --> 27:07.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increasingly understood that
addressing climate change is not
just a global issue. It is
actually

27:07.626 --> 27:12.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
also a national priority. It is
national development
opportunity.

27:12.197 --> 27:18.303 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they're no longer seeing
themselves as having to choose
between what is important

27:18.303 --> 27:22.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to them nationally and how they
can contribute globally. But,
rather, they're beginning to

27:22.441 --> 27:29.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see the coincidence of these.
That, to me, is a much more
compelling driving force,
because

27:29.915 --> 27:33.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
countries will operate
in their own interests.

27:33.118 --> 27:39.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Going into this
conference, one of the huge
goals, major goal, holding

27:39.157 --> 27:45.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the warming to two degrees
Celsius, already declared
unreachable, according to your
analysis.

27:45.130 --> 27:50.602 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: The sum
total of all of those climate
change plans make a huge

27:50.602 --> 27:57.309 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dent in both the growth of
emissions that would have
projected without those climate

27:57.309 --> 28:00.846 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
change plan, and certainly in
the corresponding temperature.

28:00.846 --> 28:05.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, without those climate change
plans, we would have been where
we were in Copenhagen,

28:05.984 --> 28:12.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for example, moving into a
scenario of a world that would
have warmed four, five, six
degrees

28:12.724 --> 28:17.029 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
centigrade. Today, with these
climate change plans, assuming
that they're implemented,

28:17.029 --> 28:21.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and we can talk about that,
we're moving into a world that,
currently, with the current

28:21.633 --> 28:26.438 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
level of effort, would warm
somewhere between 2.7 to three
degrees.

28:26.438 --> 28:29.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A major improvement.
Is it enough? No.

28:29.608 --> 28:33.011 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: No, a huge
dent, but not enough.

28:33.011 --> 28:38.884 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: Not enough,
which is why Paris is not just
going to be the receiving

28:38.884 --> 28:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
vessel for those climate change
plans as currently being
planned, but, rather, it will
understand

28:44.957 --> 28:48.894 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that that is the floor of global
effort and certainly not the
ceiling.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You talk about
the political will being there,
but continued skepticism

28:51.697 --> 28:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from many quarters in this
country, in Congress.

28:55.567 --> 29:01.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're, of course, now in a
presidential campaign again,
where you hear about opposition
to

29:01.006 --> 29:05.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
making changes in the economy,
in policy for climate change.
You are still facing that.

29:05.911 --> 29:09.014 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: Yes.

29:09.014 --> 29:16.822 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what I see is an increasing
support on the part of certainly
the private sector,

29:16.822 --> 29:22.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as well as different subnational
governments, whether they are
state or city level, for

29:22.861 --> 29:25.597 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
President Obama's
Clean Power Plan.

29:25.597 --> 29:31.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, more importantly than that,
more importantly, let us
remember that this is not the
first

29:31.803 --> 29:43.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
time that this country has
grappled with the question of,
do we stay bound in an operating

29:43.682 --> 29:50.756 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mode that has been prevalent in
the past, or do we move toward
something completely

29:50.756 --> 29:53.358 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
new?

29:53.358 --> 30:00.165 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is not the first time. And if
you look at the history of the
United States last century,

30:00.165 --> 30:08.206 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this century, it is a very tough
call. But the U.S., as every
other country, eventually

30:08.206 --> 30:14.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
does make the right choice, and
there is only one right choice
to make. And I am very confident

30:14.680 --> 30:17.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that this country will make
the right choice, clearly.

30:17.783 --> 30:20.419 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Christiana
Figueres, thank you very much.

30:20.419 --> 30:26.658 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTIANA FIGUERES: Thank you
very much for the invitation.

30:26.658 --> 30:40.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: A storm swept across
California's Bay Area yesterday.
But the inch of rain it

30:40.172 --> 30:43.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brought with it is scant relief
for a state that's experiencing
one of the worst droughts

30:43.475 --> 30:46.278 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on record.

30:46.278 --> 30:49.748 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One potential solution, building
more reservoirs to store
unpredictable rainfall, which
could

30:49.748 --> 30:52.884 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mean more dams.

30:52.884 --> 30:56.688 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"NewsHour" special correspondent
Spencer Michels reports on the
viability of such a proposal

30:56.688 --> 31:00.158 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and the consequences
for the Golden State.

31:00.158 --> 31:07.199 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: It may be the
sign of a hopeful farmer: a
biplane spreading fertilizer on

31:07.199 --> 31:13.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a dry field in California's
Central Valley. There's no
irrigation in this part of the

31:13.071 --> 31:17.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
valley, so, for now, rain is the
only way these crops will grow,
and there hasn't been

31:17.909 --> 31:22.214 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
much of that for the
last four years.

31:22.214 --> 31:29.087 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the reservoirs, like Folsom
Lake near Sacramento, that
normally fill the canals

31:29.087 --> 31:34.359 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and make the crops bloom, are
depleted. Folsom is just 17
percent full.

31:34.359 --> 31:34.760 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM QUINN, Executive Director,
Association of California Water
Agencies: It's flat-out

31:34.760 --> 31:37.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
empty because of this drought.

31:37.596 --> 31:43.435 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Tim Quinn is
executive director of the
Association of California Water
Agencies.

31:43.435 --> 31:46.938 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And what's the solution to
this, build another reservoir?

31:46.938 --> 31:49.107 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM QUINN: Well, if we'd had
more water going into storage,
we could still have more left

31:49.107 --> 31:51.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than we have got today.

31:51.076 --> 31:56.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: And that's
important, says Quinn, not just
to Californians.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM QUINN: We're a big part of
this economy. And we provide
food to the nation and to the

31:58.984 --> 32:01.386 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

32:01.386 --> 32:07.125 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Quinn and many
in state government want a
comprehensive solution,
including conservation.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.628 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM QUINN: We do need to build
more dams, but we also need to
connect them with more

32:09.628 --> 32:12.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
underground storage.

32:12.097 --> 32:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: But building
new dams goes against a recent
trend in some states, including

32:17.369 --> 32:22.574 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Washington, of actually
demolishing dams, mostly for
environmental reasons like
protecting

32:22.574 --> 32:27.312 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
fish and restoring
wildlife habitat.

32:27.312 --> 32:32.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These days in California, the
mood is quite different. Since
the gold rush, building dams

32:32.984 --> 32:39.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and canals has been California's
answer to unpredictable rain and
snowfall. To get the

32:39.124 --> 32:44.529 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
water from where it falls in the
mountains hundreds of miles away
to the dry farms and

32:44.529 --> 32:50.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
populated areas, Californians
have constructed more than 1,400
dams, including Shasta Dam

32:50.335 --> 32:53.238 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the Sacramento River.

32:53.238 --> 33:00.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 1968, the state dedicated
Oroville Dam, tallest dam in the
country, and sent water

33:00.412 --> 33:06.852 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
south to farms and cities. For
many farmers and those whose
livelihoods are tied to farming,

33:06.852 --> 33:13.024 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the success of those dams is a
key to what needs to happen now.

33:13.024 --> 33:17.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Grant Garland is vice president
of Bar ALE, a livestock and
poultry feed mill in Williams,

33:17.028 --> 33:18.763 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
California.

33:18.763 --> 33:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GRANT GARLAND, Vice President,
Bar ALE: We could solve the
problem fairly easily by
building

33:22.300 --> 33:26.638 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something like the equivalent of
five more lake Orovilles, where
we'd have plenty of

33:26.638 --> 33:32.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water to store, and we'd have
hydroelectric power for both
agricultural or urban and
industrial

33:32.577 --> 33:35.614 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
purposes, and for the
environment as well.

33:35.614 --> 33:41.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: That sentiment
is echoed in radio ads playing
in ag communities in

33:41.086 --> 33:43.488 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Central Valley
and on the Internet.

33:43.488 --> 33:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NARRATOR: But the solution
is more dam storage.

33:46.625 --> 33:52.030 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON STORK, Friends of the River:
People are frustrated. They
don't have as much water

33:52.030 --> 33:57.269 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as they want. And they want to
be able to do something with
somebody else's money.

33:57.269 --> 34:00.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Ron Stork is
policy director for Friends of
the River, an environmental

34:00.739 --> 34:02.607 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
group.

34:02.607 --> 34:07.746 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RON STORK: When you do the
arithmetic, the big dams that
are being proposed right now

34:07.746 --> 34:13.785 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
wouldn't add more than 1 percent
to California's developed water
supply. The real solution

34:13.785 --> 34:18.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is to recognize that you can't
develop much more water.

34:18.390 --> 34:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Stork and other
environmentalists like
University of California fish
biologist

34:23.561 --> 34:29.434 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Peter Moyle, allege that dams
have created major problems in
rivers for the native fish

34:29.434 --> 34:32.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
population, especially
in the drought.

34:32.170 --> 34:33.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER MOYLE, University of
California: You get these severe
problems, the environment

34:33.371 --> 34:35.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
always seems to lose.

34:35.840 --> 34:41.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: More dams, he
says, will exacerbate the
situation, especially for
salmon.

34:41.179 --> 34:44.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER MOYLE: There are many
places where the flows below the
dams are simply not adequate

34:44.349 --> 34:47.152 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
to support big
populations of salmon.

34:47.152 --> 34:51.990 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Besides, Moyle
says, new dams don't make
economic sense.

34:51.990 --> 34:56.227 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PETER MOYLE: Essentially, all
the good dam sites are taken. So
whatever dams you build

34:56.227 --> 35:00.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to try to increase storage,
you're really picking at the
fringes.

35:00.632 --> 35:05.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Nevertheless, a
year ago, spurred on by the
drought, Californians approved

35:05.937 --> 35:15.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a $7.5 billion water bond that
requires spending $2.7 billion
on water storage. Several
projects

35:15.380 --> 35:20.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are vying for that money,
including a plan to raise Shasta
Dam by 18 feet, even though

35:20.452 --> 35:25.190 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the present lake rarely fills.

35:25.190 --> 35:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another project would add a
second dam and reservoir behind
Friant Dam near Fresno on

35:30.462 --> 35:36.134 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a river that largely is depleted
of water, most of it channeled
to San Joaquin Valley

35:36.134 --> 35:42.574 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
farmers. Some politicians want
to remove federal protections
from the mostly wild and
free-flowing

35:42.574 --> 35:49.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Merced River, below Yosemite
National Park, so a reservoir
can be enlarged.

35:49.614 --> 35:54.319 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's almost no disagreement,
especially during the drought,
that California needs

35:54.319 --> 36:00.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more water storage. But building
new dams and reservoirs,
especially in a state that

36:00.091 --> 36:04.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has every major river already
dammed, strikes some people as a
waste of money, a lot of

36:04.929 --> 36:07.699 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
money.

36:07.699 --> 36:13.071 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One proposal is to take this
valley and flood it under 350
feet of water, with a big dam

36:13.071 --> 36:15.140 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the other end.

36:15.140 --> 36:19.044 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY WELLS, California Resident:
It's a very bittersweet
situation. I don't want to lose

36:19.044 --> 36:21.846 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
my home of 40-some years.

36:21.846 --> 36:26.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Mary Wells
lives in the hamlet of Sites,
which would be inundated by the

36:26.284 --> 36:31.189 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reservoir. But most of her
farmlands are beyond the
proposed lake.

36:31.189 --> 36:36.861 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY WELLS: We all ultimately
look on the other side of these
hills, and that's where

36:36.861 --> 36:44.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our livelihood is, the almond
trees, the rice fields. They all
need water. And if I'm to

36:44.202 --> 36:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sustain the business I have
created as a fifth-generation
farming family, we have got to
have additional

36:48.239 --> 36:49.074 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
water.

36:49.074 --> 36:51.576 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Good morning.

36:51.576 --> 36:57.382 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Wells raises
cattle, and grows hay, almonds
and rice on land beyond

36:57.382 --> 37:05.924 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the reservoir site, most of it
irrigated. She has served on
various water boards, and

37:05.924 --> 37:11.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has advocated for decades to dam
her valley and develop more
water, even though private

37:11.996 --> 37:16.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
landowners, like her, who
benefit will have to pay for at
least half.

37:16.601 --> 37:21.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY WELLS: The reality of it is
that the days of totally
government-financed, be it

37:21.806 --> 37:27.812 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
federal or state, building of
dams is long over. We are using
the highest and best use

37:27.812 --> 37:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for that water, and we therefore
need to pay for that water.

37:31.850 --> 37:36.020 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SPENCER MICHELS: But not
everyone agrees that supplying
farms and new plantings of
almonds

37:36.020 --> 37:39.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are the best use for the water.

37:39.290 --> 37:44.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jim Brobeck, a water policy
analyst for AquAlliance in
nearby Chico, says the state
should encourage

37:44.696 --> 37:47.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more unirrigated land.

37:47.632 --> 37:51.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM BROBECK, AquAlliance:
California really needs to put a
moratorium on the expansion

37:51.936 --> 37:57.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of irrigated agriculture on land
that is currently being used
successfully as ranch land.

37:57.909 --> 38:04.782 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
California has already
overextended its water-based
agriculture. And grazing is a
very suitable

38:04.782 --> 38:07.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
use for the land up there.

38:07.685 --> 38:13.424 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: Besides, he
says, the cost of Sites'
reservoir, as much as $4
billion,

38:13.424 --> 38:16.327 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
could make the price
of water prohibitive.

38:16.327 --> 38:23.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JIM BROBECK: This water will
never be affordable by farmers,
who need very inexpensive water.

38:23.801 --> 38:27.906 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SPENCER MICHELS: As the state
continues to grow, keeping up
with the demand for water

38:27.906 --> 38:34.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will remain contentious. The
water bond money will be
allocated some time next year.

38:34.379 --> 38:43.288 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Spencer Michels in California's
Central Valley.

38:43.288 --> 38:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Most of us are
spending more time with screens
than ever before, from TV

38:55.833 --> 39:00.038 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and computers, to the
smartphones we carry in our
pockets.

39:00.038 --> 39:07.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A new report on media use by
teens and tweens shows that may
be even more true for children.

39:07.478 --> 39:14.619 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The survey of 2,600 kids between
the ages of 8 and 18 paints a
picture of constant connection.

39:14.619 --> 39:19.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Children between 8 and 12
reported spending an average of
four-and-a-half-hours a day

39:19.390 --> 39:25.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
using a screen, and nearly six
hours consuming media of any
kind.

39:25.496 --> 39:30.635 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among teenagers, average screen
time was more than
six-and-a-half-hours a day and
almost

39:30.635 --> 39:35.440 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nine hours with media overall.
Those totals don't count
educational uses in school or

39:35.440 --> 39:37.542 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for homework.

39:37.542 --> 39:43.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me now to dig into the
findings is James Steyer. He is
the CEO of Common Sense

39:43.248 --> 39:48.119 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Media. It's a nonprofit
children's advocacy and media
rating organization that is
behind

39:48.119 --> 39:49.954 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
today's report.

39:49.954 --> 39:52.190 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour,"
James Steyer.

39:52.190 --> 39:57.662 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, just remind us. Your
organization looks at how young
people use media.

39:57.662 --> 39:58.930 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER, Founder and CEO,
Common Sense Media: That's
right, and how it affects their

39:58.930 --> 40:01.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lives, how it affects them in
school. And then we advocate on
behalf of kids in schools

40:01.799 --> 40:03.501 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
across the country.

40:03.501 --> 40:06.537 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So you did this
survey. We said 2,600 people 8
to 18.

40:06.537 --> 40:07.505 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: Right.

40:07.505 --> 40:09.040 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
were the main findings?

40:09.040 --> 40:12.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: Well, the sheer
volume. I mean, the opening that
you just did, Judy, nine

40:12.844 --> 40:16.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hours a day on average is what
teenagers spend with media and
technology.

40:16.881 --> 40:20.551 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, think about it. That's
way more than they spend with
their parents, with teachers,

40:20.551 --> 40:21.519 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
even more time than
they spend sleeping.

40:21.519 --> 40:23.388 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Sleeping.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: The number-one
activity in their life now is
media and technology.

40:25.857 --> 40:29.260 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what did --
and you made a distinction
between, again, what, the tweens

40:29.260 --> 40:30.628 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
-- this is the 8- to
12-year-olds -- are doing vs.
teenagers.

40:30.628 --> 40:32.297 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: Right.

40:32.297 --> 40:34.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How are they
spending that time? What are
they doing?

40:34.832 --> 40:37.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: Well, first of
all, there is no one archetype.
There is no one-size-fits-all

40:37.101 --> 40:39.671 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kid.

40:39.671 --> 40:45.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so you have kids on social
media, watching TV, listening to
music, even reading books,

40:45.243 --> 40:49.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remember them, and then doing
different forms of media, but
the bottom line is the sheer

40:49.747 --> 40:54.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
volume of time that kids spend
today means that they have a
24/7 reality with media and

40:54.252 --> 40:57.322 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technology that's shaping their
lives in so my many ways.

40:57.322 --> 41:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you found, I
saw, that a lot of what they're
doing is multitasking.

41:01.225 --> 41:04.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're listening to music while
they doing their homework or
watching videos while they're

41:04.796 --> 41:05.797 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
doing something else.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: Right.

41:07.632 --> 41:13.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the truth, as a parent of
four kids who actually
multitask, against their
parents'

41:13.171 --> 41:18.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
advice, you cannot multitask and
concentrate on your homework.
But two-thirds of the teenagers

41:18.543 --> 41:22.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that were surveyed say that they
continue to multitask, meaning
they're on Facebook

41:22.747 --> 41:26.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or Instagram or texting their
friends, while they're doing
their homework.

41:26.017 --> 41:29.554 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're supposed to be reading
Shakespeare, but they're texting
their friends.

41:29.554 --> 41:33.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But we start to
hear that their brains are wired
differently? And they are

41:33.224 --> 41:36.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to do some multitasking.
So, what's the answer about
that?

41:36.394 --> 41:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: Well, the truth is
multitasking really doesn't
work. It's a myth.

41:39.397 --> 41:43.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Some of my colleagues at
Stanford University did a major
study on this a couple of years

41:43.167 --> 41:47.872 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ago, and showed that you simply
can't have two conversations at
once and you can't concentrate

41:47.872 --> 41:51.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on more than one thing well.
Think about how important
homework it is to concentrate on

41:51.042 --> 41:52.810 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
information.

41:52.810 --> 41:56.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the multitasking finding in
this study has very big
implications for schools, and

41:56.681 --> 42:00.551 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also for parents giving
guidance to their kids.

42:00.551 --> 42:05.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What are the
implications, and how much do
parents know? You asked these

42:05.523 --> 42:07.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
teenagers and tweens how much do
their parents know about what
they're doing. What did they

42:07.592 --> 42:09.127 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
say?

42:09.127 --> 42:11.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: And you know what
they said? They don't know very
much.

42:11.796 --> 42:16.601 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Of course, we didn't grow up
with these devices. That's a big
part of it. But, also, I think

42:16.601 --> 42:20.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that one of the things that we
really see from this study is
that parents need to look

42:20.171 --> 42:24.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the mirror. You have got to
look at your own behavior. If
you're glued to your cell

42:24.142 --> 42:28.780 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
phone all the time, if you're
bringing your devices to the
dining room table or to the

42:28.780 --> 42:32.316 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
restaurant and you're not having
conversations with your kids
when you're present with them

42:32.316 --> 42:36.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because you're too busy with
your e-mail or your text
messages, what example are you
setting?

42:36.921 --> 42:41.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think this report, while it
displays this remarkable impact
of media and technology

42:41.926 --> 42:45.062 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on kids, also sends a clear
message to parents about their
own behavior.

42:45.062 --> 42:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about to
schools? What can schools,
teachers, educators do? What

42:48.633 --> 42:50.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
should they think about?

42:50.868 --> 42:54.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: Well, I think,
first and foremost, every kid in
this society needs to learn
digital

42:54.906 --> 43:01.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
literacy and citizenship, the
safe, smart, ethical use of
digital devices. We all hear

43:01.112 --> 43:05.216 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about cyber-bullying and privacy
violations and really
not-so-good stuff that happens

43:05.216 --> 43:07.852 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
on media and
technology platforms.

43:07.852 --> 43:12.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, schools need to teach this
just like they taught driver's
ed or sex ed. It's a basic

43:12.190 --> 43:16.727 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
part of life today. And I think
the second thing they can do if
you look at multitasking

43:16.727 --> 43:20.131 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is teach kids, you can't do your
homework while you're also
Facebooking your friends.

43:20.131 --> 43:23.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you need to concentrate.

43:23.034 --> 43:28.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, this is an ongoing
challenge. But I actually think
that the report is a message to
everybody

43:28.172 --> 43:32.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in this country about we have to
recognize that this is a reality
that our kids are living

43:32.944 --> 43:35.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in. But there's something we can
all do to make sure it's a
positive reality for our

43:35.680 --> 43:37.315 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
kids.

43:37.315 --> 43:41.752 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But how much of
this is made harder, James
Steyer, by the fact that so

43:41.752 --> 43:46.657 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
much of it is out of sight of
parents or any other adult in
that child's life, because

43:46.657 --> 43:49.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is on a device, so much of
it, that others can't see?

43:49.026 --> 43:50.595 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: That's right.

43:50.595 --> 43:54.298 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a great question, Judy,
because in the old days, we used
to talk about no TV

43:54.298 --> 43:58.703 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the bedroom, no video game
machine in the bedroom. Well,
with your teenagers, you have

43:58.703 --> 44:00.304 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
got to tell them you can't take
your cell phone to bed. By the
way, it really interferes

44:00.304 --> 44:02.306 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with sleep.

44:02.306 --> 44:06.177 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you have to have very
different rules, but I actually
think it's important for parents

44:06.177 --> 44:11.048 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to understand that phones get in
the way of sleep. They stimulate
the brain. You should

44:11.048 --> 44:16.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a place not in the bedroom
and not in the dining room where
devices can be parked.

44:16.220 --> 44:19.190 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I do think we're literally
having to set new rules of the
road for families and for

44:19.190 --> 44:21.759 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
young people across the country.

44:21.759 --> 44:27.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: If parents are
out there watching this, and
teens themselves and educators,

44:27.899 --> 44:31.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where do they go to -- is there
a set of rules to follow, or
should every family try to
figure

44:31.936 --> 44:33.271 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this out for themselves?

44:33.271 --> 44:36.007 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: I think
there are a set of rules.

44:36.007 --> 44:39.277 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shamelessly, I will say, look,
Common Sense Media is a large
organization that gives out

44:39.277 --> 44:43.414 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
tips and tools to everybody. But
I think that every school in
this country should be teaching

44:43.414 --> 44:46.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the basics of digital
citizenship to parents and to
kids. It's as important to
educate

44:46.984 --> 44:50.054 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
parents about it
as it is to kids.

44:50.054 --> 44:55.326 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think there are rules out
there, and they're not that
complicated. It's basic common
sense.

44:55.326 --> 44:58.329 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You need to put the device away
at times. You need to remember
that the most important

44:58.329 --> 45:01.098 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
conversations you ever
have are face to face.

45:01.098 --> 45:05.102 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in the long run, the genie
is out of the bottle. This
world's here to stay, so

45:05.102 --> 45:07.805 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
we have to set new rules for
our kids and for ourselves.

45:07.805 --> 45:09.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And maybe
sometimes take that device away
from your child?

45:09.974 --> 45:10.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: Absolutely.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.243 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:12.243 --> 45:13.978 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: I mean, Judy, it's
not -- by the way, if they're a
teenager, that's a pretty

45:13.978 --> 45:16.180 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hard thing to do.

45:16.180 --> 45:22.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, absolutely, you should do
that. Media and technology are a
privilege, not a right,

45:22.954 --> 45:26.857 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that is part of parenting.
You have to take the device
away. I'm sorry to tell you

45:26.857 --> 45:30.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that, but every parent,
including the Steyer family,
needs to do that, and yours as
well.

45:30.127 --> 45:30.795 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank
you for the advice.

45:30.795 --> 45:32.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

45:32.063 --> 45:34.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: James Steyer,
Common Sense Media.

45:34.131 --> 45:34.865 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Parenting is evolving.

45:34.865 --> 45:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JAMES STEYER: It sure is.

45:35.733 --> 45:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

45:36.267 --> 45:41.105 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JAMES STEYER: Good
to see you, Judy.

45:41.105 --> 45:47.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.

GWEN IFILL: A poor child who
sorts garbage in Mexico grows up
to become a prominent American

45:54.752 --> 45:57.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
writer. How did that happen?

45:57.822 --> 46:02.793 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The new novel "Avenue of
Mysteries" takes us through a
life that includes a host of

46:02.793 --> 46:07.965 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other vivid characters, events
and places. Its author is
himself a prominent American

46:07.965 --> 46:12.770 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
novelist, John Irving, whose
books include "The World
According to Garp," "Cider House

46:12.770 --> 46:16.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Rules," "A Prayer for Owen
Meany," and other bestsellers.

46:16.474 --> 46:19.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He joined Jeffrey Brown for our
"NewsHour" Bookshelf
conversation.

46:19.477 --> 46:21.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: John
Irving, welcome to you.

46:21.812 --> 46:23.314 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN IRVING, Author, "Avenue
of Mysteries": Thank you.

46:23.314 --> 46:27.485 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, the story of
a writer, he's named Juan Diego,
in your head -- we

46:27.485 --> 46:31.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
meet him old and new. In your
head, did you see him first as
an older man or as a young

46:31.255 --> 46:32.923 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
boy?

46:32.923 --> 46:38.963 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVING: I saw him first as
a child and an adolescent. I saw
him as a dump kid, an

46:38.963 --> 46:40.698 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
orphan

46:40.698 --> 46:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Literally, a dump
kid, we should say, right? He
works...

46:42.500 --> 46:43.134 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN IRVING: Yes, yes.

46:43.134 --> 46:45.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

46:45.202 --> 46:52.109 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVING: They're called nino
de la basura, children of the
rubbish. And it's still true

46:52.109 --> 46:57.281 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, as it was in 1970, that
the children are the workers in
the dump who do the sorting

46:57.281 --> 47:00.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and separating of the
stuff that's there.

47:00.651 --> 47:07.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And so the
"Avenue of Mysteries is the
specific story of this man, Juan
Diego,

47:07.625 --> 47:11.929 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but also how -- in a sense,
how we become who we are.

47:11.929 --> 47:14.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN IRVING: Yes.

47:14.331 --> 47:23.040 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wouldn't be the first time
for me that the focus of a novel
begins at that threshold

47:23.040 --> 47:29.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
age in early adolescence, when
an adolescent is becoming an
adult, or a child is becoming

47:29.113 --> 47:36.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an adolescent. I have always
believed that, in a story, if
something traumatic or
calamitous

47:36.420 --> 47:43.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
enough happens to a kid at a
formative age, that will make
him or her the adult they
become.

47:43.294 --> 47:49.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In this case, the
kid, he is the dump -- he works
in a dump, but he picks

47:49.967 --> 47:54.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
up books, right? And he learns
to read, he teaches himself to
read, he teaches himself

47:54.105 --> 47:57.208 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
languages.

47:57.208 --> 48:01.579 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Did that interest you, that sort
of book as a way into a larger
life?

48:01.579 --> 48:10.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVING: Oh, very much. It
was the perfect connection to
the Jesuits' interest in him.

48:10.221 --> 48:17.428 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Given the high priority the
Jesuits have always put on
education, the fact that there
was

48:17.428 --> 48:25.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a kid who taught himself to
read, the dump reader, they call
him, they were more inclined

48:25.302 --> 48:30.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to think that he could be one of
their children, in their
orphanage, because he was so
teachable

48:30.908 --> 48:33.310 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that he had already
taught himself.

48:33.310 --> 48:36.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's also -- I
mean, there are many vivid
characters in here; one is

48:36.947 --> 48:44.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
his sister, Lupe, right, who is
clairvoyant, knows what's on
people's minds. That, of course,

48:44.188 --> 48:49.426 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
allows you to have this mix of
realism, real realism, right, in
the dump, but also a sense

48:49.426 --> 48:50.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of magic.

48:50.094 --> 48:53.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN IRVING: Yes.

48:53.264 --> 49:02.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the third time I have
been tempted to bring a
character into a novel who is
partially

49:02.139 --> 49:05.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
informed of what I always know.

49:05.476 --> 49:06.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

49:06.644 --> 49:10.114 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You're smiling
as you say that, right?

49:10.114 --> 49:19.356 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVING: Well, because I
always get endings first. I
can't tell you why, but I do.

49:19.356 --> 49:25.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a sense of -- that I
always have as a writer that my
endings are predetermined

49:25.462 --> 49:33.337 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for me, and this is now the
third time that I have given
some part of that gift -- it's

49:33.337 --> 49:40.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a dubious gift, if you are a
child, especially, and you bear
the burden of it -- giving the

49:40.311 --> 49:50.554 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
character at least the
conviction that he or she knows
what's going to happen.

49:50.554 --> 49:55.226 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a burden for those
characters, especially if
they're young and innocent in
other ways.

49:55.226 --> 50:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, Lupe has -- she has these
two ancestors in earlier novels.
But when a character like

50:03.300 --> 50:11.475 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that happens to me, a clear
repetition of a character I have
invented before, I'm not

50:11.475 --> 50:18.849 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even aware of the repetition
until it's too late to turn
back. It's already there.

50:18.849 --> 50:23.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you, the
author, are clairvoyant in that
sense, right? And you have
famously

50:23.053 --> 50:28.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said you write backwards. You
know the ending of these
stories?

50:28.659 --> 50:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVING: I do. I'm not
proselytizing my method. I don't
believe that one writer should

50:36.467 --> 50:41.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tell other writers how to write.

50:41.238 --> 50:48.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's just long been my habit,
when I'm thinking about a novel,
when the characters begin to

50:48.279 --> 50:54.585 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
form, when the story begins to
emerge, I always know more about
the ending, even the aftermath

50:54.585 --> 50:59.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the ending, than I know about
the beginning. And so there's a
construction that works from

50:59.890 --> 51:02.459 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
back to front.

51:02.459 --> 51:08.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't begin a novel until I
have written, not just the last
sentence, but usually, as

51:08.832 --> 51:15.205 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a result thereof, many of the
surrounding final paragraphs, so
that in addition to knowing

51:15.205 --> 51:20.744 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what happens, I know what the
voice is. I know how
melancholic, or not. I know how
I

51:20.744 --> 51:25.015 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sound when I'm telling
the story at the end.

51:25.015 --> 51:29.753 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This story is
notably about an author in older
age, looking back, filling

51:29.753 --> 51:30.721 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in that story.

51:30.721 --> 51:32.923 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JOHN IRVING: Yes.

51:32.923 --> 51:38.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So, the -- I
suppose the requisite question
is about whether you are,
yourself,

51:38.128 --> 51:44.802 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in retrospective mode, and
thinking about how one becomes
an author, a novelist.

51:44.802 --> 51:52.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN IRVING: I think, in earlier
novels, the main characters who
were writers were exactly

51:52.176 --> 52:00.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as you say. They were an attempt
on my part to understand my own
origins.

52:00.017 --> 52:08.392 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in this case, I feel that
because of what happens to Juan
Diego as an older man,

52:08.392 --> 52:15.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would almost have to be a
writer in order to live as much
in his imagination as he does.

52:15.399 --> 52:24.575 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't want to say so much that
I give the story away, but I'm
not so sure that -- if

52:24.575 --> 52:30.681 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this character weren't a fiction
writer, if -- I'm not so sure
that he would get in quite

52:30.681 --> 52:32.049 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as much trouble as he does.

52:32.049 --> 52:32.950 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:32.950 --> 52:34.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: And
that interested you?

52:34.651 --> 52:37.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN IRVING: It did. It did.

52:37.354 --> 52:46.063 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I'm a worst-case scenario
person. I'm only interested in a
story because I kind of go,

52:46.063 --> 52:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like a magnet, to the worst
thing that can happen.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And, hopefully,
the reader will want to come
along, right?

52:52.036 --> 52:52.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN IRVING: Yes. Yes. Yes.

52:52.703 --> 52:53.604 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

52:53.604 --> 52:56.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The novel
is "Avenue of Mysteries."

52:56.407 --> 52:57.174 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Irving, thanks so much.
