JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening. I'm
Judy Woodruff.

00:06.039 --> 00:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, while Gwen Ifill's away, we
welcome Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:08.976 --> 00:10.911 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Happy to help
how I can.

00:10.944 --> 00:16.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on the
"NewsHour" tonight:
devastation in Ecuador. A
powerful earthquake

00:16.149 --> 00:22.356 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
flattens coastal villages and
towns, leaving
thousands injured and a rising
death toll

00:22.389 --> 00:24.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in its wake.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Monday:
The Supreme Court takes on
President Obama's

00:26.660 --> 00:31.198 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
controversial immigration
actions which prevent
millions from deportation.

00:31.231 --> 00:37.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Then, as the U.S.
braces for
a rise in cases of the Zika
virus, women and

00:37.137 --> 00:39.773 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
health officials grapple with
tough questions.

00:39.806 --> 00:44.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And how a
long-held Hindu
belief in considering cows
sacred is part

00:44.478 --> 00:47.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a bigger divide in India's
culture and
politics.

00:47.814 --> 00:51.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHASHI THAROOR, Opposition
Member of Parliament:
It's high time that the
government realize

00:51.218 --> 00:56.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that they're making asses of
themselves and
discrediting an enormously
plural and diverse

00:56.723 --> 00:58.058 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
civilization.

00:58.091 --> 01:04.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

01:04.665 --> 01:07.301 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:07.334 --> 01:18.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The death toll in
Ecuador's
devastating earthquake rose to
350 today.

01:18.211 --> 01:24.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hundreds more are missing, but
three people
were rescued, after being
trapped for 32 hours.

01:24.351 --> 01:26.787 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
John Yang reports on the day's
developments.

01:26.820 --> 01:33.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Through a second
night, crews searched
for survivors in the rubble.
Families of the

01:33.360 --> 01:35.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
missing watched anxiously.

01:35.162 --> 01:38.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BETTY REINA, Ecuador (through
translator):
No, I didn't sleep last night
and I won't

01:38.398 --> 01:42.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
best able to sleep today because
I am distressed
with the desperation to find
them, to see

01:42.769 --> 01:44.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
them, to know they are OK.

01:44.604 --> 01:48.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Daylight broke. More
bodies were
pulled from there debris, and
the devastation

01:48.875 --> 01:51.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Saturday night's disaster
lay everywhere.

01:51.878 --> 01:55.716 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Stephan Kueffner of The
Economist is watching
from Quito.

01:55.749 --> 02:00.921 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHAN KUEFFNER, The Economist:
You start
hearing, like, the window frames
cracking.

02:00.954 --> 02:07.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You feel the ground shake. Then
you see -- you
look up and see how the lamps
moving. And

02:07.494 --> 02:12.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
then you realize after a couple
of seconds,
no, this is not going to be over
quickly.

02:12.833 --> 02:18.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The quake had a
magnitude of 7.8
and struck about nine miles off
Ecuador's

02:18.705 --> 02:24.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coast in the Pacific Ocean,
about 100 miles
from the capital city of Quito.
It was the

02:24.344 --> 02:29.716 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
strongest tremor in decades to
hit the Andean
nation of 16 million.

02:29.750 --> 02:35.355 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Drone footage over the
provincial capital
of Portoviejo shows multistory
buildings completely

02:35.389 --> 02:43.063 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
askew and a ruined
infrastructure. Cars were
crushed, homes teetered at
precarious angles,

02:43.096 --> 02:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and families slept on the
streets, on edge
after hundreds of aftershocks.

02:47.701 --> 02:51.905 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAVIER MENDOZA, Ecuador (through
translator):
Hopefully, we get the support
and help we

02:51.938 --> 02:54.641 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
need, because we slept in a
field all night.

02:54.674 --> 02:59.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ecuador's president,
Rafael Correa,
flew back Sunday from a trip to
Italy.

02:59.246 --> 03:03.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RAFAEL CORREA, President of
Ecuador (through
translator): Downtown Portoviejo
is truly

03:04.017 --> 03:08.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
devastated. The situation is
stabilizing.
It's being coordinated. Aid is
arriving. The

03:08.955 --> 03:14.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whole country is mobilized. It's
a huge training,
the biggest since the Ambato
earthquake in

03:14.795 --> 03:19.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
1949. But even bigger is the
world and the
Ecuadorian people. We're united
today more

03:19.199 --> 03:20.967 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
than ever.

03:21.001 --> 03:24.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: There's almost
nothing to work
with in some of the hardest-hit
places. Again,

03:24.871 --> 03:26.706 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
reporter Stephan Kueffner:

03:26.740 --> 03:32.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
STEPHAN KUEFFNER: In the beach
town of Canoa,
the situation is so grave that
there are about

03:32.612 --> 03:39.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
400 homeless people, including
150 children,
with extremely limited supplies.
And the situation

03:39.686 --> 03:45.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is so -- that bodies are being
taken to the
local park, as they have nowhere
to put them.

03:45.392 --> 03:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Relatives consoled
each other outside
Portoviejo's morgue this
morning, as more

03:50.097 --> 03:55.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and more bodies arrived. The
injured were
treated in makeshift tents set
up by the Red

03:55.235 --> 03:59.873 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cross. More than 2,500 people
hurt.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.476 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Diego Castellanos is with the
Red Cross in
Quito.

04:02.509 --> 04:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIEGO CASTELLANOS, Red Cross:
It's like a
war happened there. They don't
have water.

04:07.180 --> 04:12.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are looking for relatives
all the time
during the day, during the
night. And some

04:12.385 --> 04:18.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the work or the job that we
are trying
to do with them is just to give
them the support,

04:18.458 --> 04:24.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and also to give them the food
and the water
and all the support that we can.

04:24.498 --> 04:29.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Meanwhile, aid has
begun to trickle
in from neighboring countries,
including Bolivia.

04:29.636 --> 04:35.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And a plane loaded with a
47-member Spanish
rescue team left Madrid today.
It also carried

04:35.742 --> 04:39.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
15 tons of humanitarian aid.

04:39.246 --> 04:41.581 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:41.615 --> 04:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In the day's
other news:
Thousands of rescue workers in
Japan kept

04:46.686 --> 04:50.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
searching for survivors from two
earthquakes
last week. They hit the southern
island of

04:50.957 --> 04:56.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Kyushu on Thursday night and
again early Saturday,
killing 42 people. The U.S.
military lent

04:56.129 --> 05:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
its support today with
tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft
delivering aid.

05:00.734 --> 05:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Landslides and damaged roads
have left hundreds
of people stranded on parts of
the island.

05:06.106 --> 05:10.410 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Here in the U.S.,
parts of
Houston are underwater today,
after more than

05:10.443 --> 05:17.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a foot of rain hit the nation's
fourth largest
city. Some 110,000 homes and
businesses lost

05:17.317 --> 05:22.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
power, schools closed and
hundreds of flights
were canceled. People waded
through waist-deep

05:22.923 --> 05:29.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
water in scores of subdivisions,
and some
used anything that would float
to seek safety.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.765 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The city's mayor warned there's
more to come.

05:31.798 --> 05:35.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SYLVESTER TURNER, Mayor of
Houston, Texas:
The heavy rain appears to be
sagging out of

05:35.535 --> 05:42.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the area for right now, but if
you look on
the radar system, we can
anticipate some additional

05:42.042 --> 05:46.179 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
heavy rain probably into late
tonight going
into tomorrow morning.

05:46.213 --> 05:51.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The flood watch
also extended
into Western Louisiana and in
Arkansas.

05:51.251 --> 05:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This was
presidential primary
eve in New York state, with the
front-runners

05:55.355 --> 05:59.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hoping for big wins tomorrow.
Republican Donald
Trump and Democrat Hillary
Clinton are well

05:59.593 --> 06:04.464 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ahead in delegates, but both
have suffered
a string of recent losses.

06:04.497 --> 06:08.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, 300 people were
arrested at the
U.S. Capitol. It's the latest in
a week's

06:08.835 --> 06:14.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worth of protests against big
money in politics.
We will return to the
presidential race later

06:14.274 --> 06:15.976 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the program.

06:16.009 --> 06:19.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The United States
will send
another 200 troops and for the
first time

06:19.512 --> 06:25.318 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack helicopters to battle the
Islamic State
group in Iraq. In Baghdad,
Defense Secretary

06:25.352 --> 06:30.690 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Ash Carter announced the
advisers will be
closer to the front lines. But
the White House

06:30.724 --> 06:33.126 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
insisted it is not mission
creep.

06:33.159 --> 06:36.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSH EARNEST, White House Press
Secretary:
This has to be a fight that is
lead by local

06:36.229 --> 06:44.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
forces with the support and
assistance of
the United States and our
coalition partners.

06:44.337 --> 06:49.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's exactly what we have
done thus
far, and that hasn't changed
based on the

06:49.476 --> 06:51.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
enhancements that were announced
today.

06:51.278 --> 06:55.582 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The announcement
comes as Iraqi
forces are gearing up to try to
push ISIS

06:55.615 --> 06:59.419 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
militants out of Mosul, the
country's second
largest city.

06:59.452 --> 07:03.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: In Ethiopia,
government
troops are hunting gunmen from
South Sudan

07:03.957 --> 07:08.495 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who killed more than 200
civilians in a raid
on Friday. They also abducted
more than 100

07:08.528 --> 07:13.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
children. It happened in an
eastern region
close to the country's border
with South Sudan.

07:13.066 --> 07:16.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Ethiopians have now crossed
that border
in pursuit.

07:16.503 --> 07:22.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A bomb set fire
to a bus in
Jerusalem and set fire to
another. At least

07:22.175 --> 07:27.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
21 people were hurt. Police said
there is
no doubt it was a terror attack.
Two people

07:27.347 --> 07:32.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the bus were seriously
wounded and the
rest of the victims were the
other bus and

07:32.285 --> 07:35.622 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a car. Such attacks have been
rare in recent
years.

07:35.655 --> 07:39.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Syrian
peace talks hit
a new snag today, when the
opposition suspended

07:39.926 --> 07:45.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
its formal participation. Only
three delegates
from that side attended a
meeting with a U.N.

07:45.799 --> 07:51.371 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
envoy in Geneva. A senior
negotiator pointed
to new attacks by government
forces inside

07:51.404 --> 07:53.306 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Syria.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.343 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MOHAMMAD ALLOUSH, Senior
Opposition Negotiator
(through translator): The
humanitarian conditions

07:56.376 --> 08:01.348 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and regime attacks and
violations of the cease-fire
negatively affect the political
process. We

08:01.381 --> 08:05.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
need clear and concise answers,
and we need
an agenda reflecting real
political transition

08:06.019 --> 08:09.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in Syria. We want real
negotiations, not farcical
ones.

08:09.789 --> 08:14.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Meanwhile,
Yemen's Shiite
rebels backed out of
U.N.-brokered peace talks

08:14.527 --> 08:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Kuwait. They complained of
cease-fire violations
by Saudi Arabia and other
supporters of Yemen's

08:20.266 --> 08:22.168 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

08:22.202 --> 08:25.739 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the Pulitzer
Prizes were handed down for the
100th time.

08:25.772 --> 08:31.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press won the
Public Service
Prize for its investigation of
slave labor

08:31.344 --> 08:37.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in seafood in Southeast Asia.
The Los Angeles
Times was honored for its
breaking news coverage

08:37.550 --> 08:42.722 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the San Bernardino shootings,
and the hit
Broadway musical "Hamilton" won
the prize

08:42.756 --> 08:44.524 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for drama.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Wall Street
started the
week on a high note. The Dow
Jones industrial

08:46.926 --> 08:51.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
average gained 106 points to
close at 18004.
The Nasdaq rose 21 points, and
the S&amp;P 500

08:51.264 --> 08:52.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
added 13.

08:52.999 --> 08:54.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And on this
Boston Marathon
day, runners from Ethiopia swept
the men's

08:54.934 --> 08:56.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and women's titles, ending
Kenya's dominance.
Some 30,000 people took part,
including victims

08:56.770 --> 08:57.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the bombing three years ago
that killed
three people and wounded more
than 260 others.

08:57.470 --> 08:59.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some ran with prosthetic blades.

08:59.239 --> 09:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the fate
of four million undocumented
immigrants before

09:01.174 --> 09:05.311 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Supreme Court; the
candidates' final push
to win over voters in New York;
Brazil's president

09:05.345 --> 09:14.454 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facing impeachment; and much
more.

09:14.487 --> 09:21.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There was just
one case
on the docket today for this
shorthanded Supreme

09:21.928 --> 09:27.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Court. But that case happened to
be one of
the biggest of the term: a
dispute over immigration

09:27.600 --> 09:33.273 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the scope of presidential
power.

09:33.306 --> 09:38.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The arguments inside the court
drew hundreds
of pro-immigration demonstrators
outside,

09:38.178 --> 09:46.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
chanting, "Yes, we can" in
Spanish. They were
there supporting the president's
program known

09:46.519 --> 09:52.792 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as DAPA, Deferred Action for
Parents of Americans.
It shields some four million
people from deportation.

09:52.826 --> 09:55.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LUIS ORTEGA, Son of Undocumented
Immigrant:
My dad travels all over the
state of Texas.

09:55.962 --> 10:01.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And every time he goes out, we
live in the
fear that he's going to be
deported. And families

10:01.601 --> 10:03.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
shouldn't live like this.

10:03.369 --> 10:08.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Congressional
supporters
also turned out to defend the
president's

10:08.107 --> 10:09.943 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
acting without congressional
approval.

10:09.976 --> 10:14.447 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. LUIS GUTIERREZ (D),
Illinois: The president
of the United States has taken
actions that

10:14.481 --> 10:20.420 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
were clearly established today
in the court
that Ronald Reagan took, that
George Bush

10:20.453 --> 10:22.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
took.

10:22.388 --> 10:24.190 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
REP. ZOE LOFGREN (D),
California: It was made
abundantly clear that the
ability of the president

10:24.224 --> 10:29.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to grant deferred action is of
long standing
and based in statute and
regulation. To deny

10:29.829 --> 10:39.105 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that at this point would be an
extraordinary
departure from law and history.

10:39.138 --> 10:43.142 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But Texas and
25 two other
states have mounted the legal
challenge to

10:43.176 --> 10:47.113 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAPA. They argue the president
did overstep
his constitutional authority.

10:47.146 --> 10:50.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KEN PAXTON, Texas Attorney
General: If we
allow a president, whether it's
this president

10:50.984 --> 10:56.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a future president, no matter
what their
political persuasion or their
party, to make

10:56.155 --> 11:02.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
changes in the law without
congressional approval,
then we will end up with a
perverted Constitution.

11:02.128 --> 11:09.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: A small group
turned out
today to support that position,
including

11:09.836 --> 11:11.638 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
several from Congress.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REP. STEVE KING (R), Iowa: It's
very clear,
even from the beginning, they
created groups

11:14.807 --> 11:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or classes of people that would
get blanket
amnesty under the directive
given by the president.

11:21.180 --> 11:25.184 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lower courts
have put the
program on hold. But with the
death of Justice

11:25.218 --> 11:31.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Antonin Scalia, a 4-to-4 split
on the high
court would leave the program in
legal limbo.

11:31.891 --> 11:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get more now on today's
arguments from
someone who was in the courtroom
today, Marcia

11:35.929 --> 11:39.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Coyle, chief Washington
correspondent for
"The National Law Journal" and a
"NewsHour"

11:39.399 --> 11:40.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
regular.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.569 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what's at the core of the
dispute, from
what you heard today?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE, "The National Law
Journal":
There are a number of issues
before the court

11:45.004 --> 11:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Texas raises about this
program, but
the arguments today really
focused on two,

11:52.245 --> 11:53.980 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
mainly two.

11:54.013 --> 11:59.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first issue has to do --
it's a threshold
issue: Does Texas actually have
the right

11:59.085 --> 12:04.324 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be in federal court suing the
government
over this program? This is what
we call standing

12:04.357 --> 12:12.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to sue. Texas argues that it
does have standing
because it will suffer an
injury, a financial

12:12.065 --> 12:19.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
injury, in what it's going to
cost to deliver
license -- driver's licenses to
these immigrants.

12:19.572 --> 12:24.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government contends they
don't have standing,
that this is not the kind of
injury. It's

12:24.510 --> 12:32.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an incidental injury. Texas
could easily change
its own law which provides these
licenses

12:32.118 --> 12:38.491 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
to not give them to this
category of immigrants.
So, when -- the issue was
addressed right

12:38.524 --> 12:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
away with the start of the
arguments.

12:40.927 --> 12:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And here you had the chief
justice and Justice
Alito for the most part
answering -- asking

12:46.866 --> 12:51.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the most skeptical questions of
the Obama
administration's lawyer,
Solicitor General

12:51.371 --> 12:57.443 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Verrilli. Chief Justice
Roberts said,
for example, isn't money the
classic standing

12:57.477 --> 13:04.550 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
injury? And, again, the
government, Mr. Verrilli
said, not in this case. This is
a case where

13:04.584 --> 13:11.524 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's almost hypothetical. The
program hasn't
begun. Texas hasn't incurred an
injury yet.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.326 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let them change their law.

13:13.359 --> 13:17.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then the chief justice
responds, well,
if they change their law not to
give licenses,

13:17.730 --> 13:22.935 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
won't you sue them? And that,
again, the -- Mr.
Verrilli said was hypothetical.

13:22.969 --> 13:29.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that was the first. And then
you had the
more liberal justices turning to
the standing

13:29.442 --> 13:35.581 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
question with Texas' there,
Scott Keller.
And, there, Justice Breyer said
your view

13:35.615 --> 13:41.120 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of standing here, your injury
here is in a
way so broad that every time a
state has a

13:41.154 --> 13:46.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
political disagreement with the
federal government,
it would sue the federal
government. We could

13:46.059 --> 13:47.727 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
have a flood of litigation.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So those are
the two big
issues.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: That's one issue.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.432 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's just
one issue.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARCIA COYLE: Yes.

13:54.300 --> 13:57.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second issue is really the
fundamental
issue. Is this program legal?
Does it violate

13:57.470 --> 14:03.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the law? Did the president go a
step too far?
And there again, you saw almost
the ideological

14:03.643 --> 14:08.881 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
breakdown. You had the
government saying,
we're exercising enforcement
discretion. There

14:08.915 --> 14:13.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are 11 million immigrants.
Congress never
appropriated enough money for us
to deport

14:13.586 --> 14:20.026 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
all of them, but Congress does
give us this
enforcement discretion that
presidents have

14:20.059 --> 14:22.295 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
been exercising for decades.

14:22.328 --> 14:28.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Texas says, uh-uh, this is a
different type
of program. By giving deferred
deportation

14:28.835 --> 14:35.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to a whole class of illegal
immigrants, you
are actually changing their
legal status,

14:35.241 --> 14:37.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and you can't do that without a
congressional
act.

14:37.877 --> 14:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There again, you saw Justice
Kennedy saying
to the Obama administration
lawyer, you seem

14:43.716 --> 14:49.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to be setting policy and asking
Congress to
follow along. That seems
upside-down.

14:49.722 --> 14:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So does this
-- the absence
of Justice Scalia increase the
likelihood

14:55.495 --> 14:59.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this is a 4-4 just by the way
that you're
asking -- you're telling us
where the justices

14:59.932 --> 15:01.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
were pointing their questions?

15:01.768 --> 15:06.572 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: Absolutely it
does. And when
I came out of the arguments, I
think it wasn't

15:06.606 --> 15:10.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
clear to me at least how the
court was going
to resolve this.

15:10.476 --> 15:17.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If they find -- if they decide
4-4 that they're
on standing, for example, with
Texas -- or

15:17.850 --> 15:24.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even if they decide 5-4 -- I'm
sorry -- 5-3
that there is no standing,
that's the end

15:24.624 --> 15:30.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the case for Texas. Texas
loses. But if
there is a 4-4 split, the case
will go on.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.801 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will go back to the district
court in Texas
for a full trial.

15:34.834 --> 15:42.208 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This was just a preliminary
nationwide injunction
that is holding up the program
right now.

15:42.241 --> 15:45.745 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Note, the district court has not
ruled on
all of the merits yet.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.347 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Marcia Coyle
from "The National Law Journal,"
thanks so

15:48.381 --> 15:49.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
much.

15:49.715 --> 15:56.455 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARCIA COYLE: My pleasure, Hari.

15:56.489 --> 16:05.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And as we heard
earlier, tomorrow
marks the New York primary, a
critical contest

16:05.231 --> 16:11.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for both parties. The two
front-runners, Republican
Donald Trump and Democrat
Hillary Clinton,

16:11.470 --> 16:14.307 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
both claim ties to the Empire
State.

16:14.340 --> 16:18.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, they jabbed opponents for
different
versions of their New York
values.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
You know, we love this city. You
look at the

16:21.747 --> 16:26.552 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
other folks that are running,
they couldn't
care less about New York. We do
care about

16:26.586 --> 16:29.055 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
New York, and we care about New
York a lot.
And we care about New York
values.

16:29.088 --> 16:32.625 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I know that we're going to win
because we're

16:32.658 --> 16:37.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on the right side of history. We
stand up
for New York values, which are
American values.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.632 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

16:39.665 --> 16:45.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: To dissect that
New York brawl
and all the week's politics,
it's time for

16:45.104 --> 16:46.873 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Politics Monday.

16:46.906 --> 16:51.978 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's analysis from Amy Walter
of The Cook
Political Report and Tamara
Keith of NPR,

16:52.011 --> 16:54.714 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who joins us from New York City.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.382 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome back to both of you.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, let's talk about New York.

16:58.284 --> 17:02.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tamara, you're there. You're in
New York City.
What's the state of the
Democratic race? Let's

17:02.622 --> 17:04.457 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
start with them.

17:04.490 --> 17:07.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: The state
of the Democratic race is that
they are both

17:07.093 --> 17:13.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
running hard. Bernie Sanders a
little bit
later tonight has a very --
likely to be a

17:13.065 --> 17:17.503 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
very large rally. He's been
having record-breaking
crowds at his rallies.

17:17.536 --> 17:23.409 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, meanwhile, Hillary Clinton
is racing
from borough to borough doing
sort of small

17:23.442 --> 17:30.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
retail politics kind of events,
more of a
traditional way of running in
New York. And

17:30.583 --> 17:34.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the polling would indicate that
Hillary Clinton,
this is her -- the state she was
elected to

17:34.487 --> 17:41.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
twice in the Senate, that she is
favored.
The Sanders campaign is in their
fund-raising

17:41.193 --> 17:45.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
e-mails saying, well, we don't
actually have
to win. We just have to win a
lot of delegates.

17:45.698 --> 17:51.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think that the Sanders
campaign is trying
to set expectations, and the
Clinton campaign

17:51.304 --> 17:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has said things like, well, this
might be
closer than the public polls
would have you

17:55.207 --> 18:02.982 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
indicate. So, it's a race, but
all indications
are that Clinton has the
stronger position

18:03.015 --> 18:04.784 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in New York heading into the
voting.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.954 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy, what do you
make of it?
Bernie Sanders is out there
drawing these

18:07.987 --> 18:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
huge crowds, what, 20-some
thousand last night,
but Hillary Clinton's ahead in
the polls.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.296 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: New
York is really a question of,
will Hillary

18:17.330 --> 18:19.131 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Clinton be able to get her
groove back?

18:19.165 --> 18:23.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And she's been on the defensive
for the last
few weeks here. Bernie Sanders
has won eight

18:23.469 --> 18:27.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the last nine contests. He
has outraised
her when it comes to
fund-raising. He's put

18:27.039 --> 18:31.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her on defensive on a whole host
of issues,
most specifically whether she
will release

18:31.310 --> 18:33.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
these transcripts of speeches
she gave to
Goldman Sachs.

18:33.913 --> 18:37.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It has not been a good couple of
weeks to
be Hillary Clinton. This is her
chance to

18:37.984 --> 18:42.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sort of reset the race, reset
the narrative,
especially if she wins it by a
significant

18:43.022 --> 18:47.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
amount. She will get to focus
then on the
things she likes talking about
more, which

18:47.460 --> 18:51.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the math, and the delegate
math and how
difficult it will be for Bernie
Sanders to

18:51.497 --> 18:53.432 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
catch up.

18:53.466 --> 18:58.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it's close, she still gets
the most delegates,
she is still is on the way to
locking up the

18:58.137 --> 19:02.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nomination, but it gives Bernie
Sanders the
argument that the momentum is
still behind

19:02.641 --> 19:07.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him, the race is closing. We had
a new poll
out today, national poll of
Democrats showing

19:07.179 --> 19:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton up by two
points. National
polls don't mean anything when
you have regional

19:11.250 --> 19:15.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
primaries. But it just shows
that this race
has tightened a great deal over
the course

19:15.221 --> 19:16.322 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of this campaign.

19:16.355 --> 19:19.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How could the
dynamic change,
Tamara?

19:19.125 --> 19:23.896 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Bernie Sanders continues to talk
about how
much money Hillary Clinton is
raking in from

19:23.929 --> 19:29.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
big money sources. And, in fact,
George Clooney,
the actor who with his wife gave
Hillary Clinton

19:29.068 --> 19:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a highly publicized fund-raiser
over the weekend,
I guess the big tickets were
$350,000 a person

19:37.777 --> 19:43.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or a couple -- Clooney himself
said over the
weekend, these are obscene
amounts of money.

19:43.549 --> 19:46.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Does this hurt Hillary Clinton
or what?

19:46.085 --> 19:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: This is certainly
an area where
Bernie Sanders has some
strength.

19:53.059 --> 20:00.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been, as we know very well,
$27 at a
time, been able to outraise
Hillary Clinton.

20:00.266 --> 20:06.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And his fund-raising isn't just
about money.
It's about his message. The
money is the message

20:06.439 --> 20:13.212 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for Bernie Sanders. Just today,
his campaign
sent a letter to the DNC
complaining about

20:13.245 --> 20:19.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and saying that maybe some sort
of violation
had happened in how Hillary
Clinton is raising

20:19.118 --> 20:26.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
money with the DNC at this
fund-raiser at
Clooney's house where they were
able to raise

20:26.392 --> 20:28.027 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this much money.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's through the Hillary Victor
Fund. It's
a complicated system. Sanders is
pointing

20:31.997 --> 20:38.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to it, saying that this is
somehow a violation.
The Clinton campaign is firing
back, saying,

20:38.737 --> 20:44.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hey, look, Hillary Clinton is
raising money
for down-ballot races. They are
fighting about

20:44.076 --> 20:50.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
fund-raising and that is really
better territory
for Bernie Sanders, because he
has a story

20:50.883 --> 20:53.886 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that he can tell, a story $27 at
a time.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.790 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is this something
with traction,
Amy? We have been hearing about
it for so

20:57.823 --> 20:59.592 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
long.

20:59.625 --> 21:03.162 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, the real
question in my
mind is what happens when this
race is over.

21:03.195 --> 21:08.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If Hillary Clinton continues to
pick up delegates,
stays on the path, she wins the
nomination,

21:08.367 --> 21:11.170 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
does she bring these voters
back?

21:11.203 --> 21:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is always the debate we
have, Judy, every
single election. Is the primary
good for party?

21:14.807 --> 21:19.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is it bad? Are you going to have
disappointed,
disaffected Bernie Sanders
supporters who

21:19.178 --> 21:24.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
do listen to his attacks on her
fund-raising,
have taken that to heart? Are
they going to

21:24.617 --> 21:26.352 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
be open to coming back?

21:26.385 --> 21:32.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the fine line that she's
had to walk
for these last few weeks here,
few months

21:32.057 --> 21:38.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
now, which is going and making
sure that she
makes her case to the public and
to Democratic

21:38.130 --> 21:43.102 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
primary voters without
alienating Bernie Sanders
supporters that she is going to
need back

21:43.135 --> 21:44.837 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
when we hit November.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, I don't
know if over
on the Republican side there is
this kind

21:46.705 --> 21:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of worrying at this point about
alienating
the other guys' supporters.

21:49.875 --> 21:54.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, Tamara, there is still a
race in New
York, but Donald Trump is still
pretty far

21:54.813 --> 21:58.083 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ahead. What are we going to
learn from New
York on the Republican side?

21:58.117 --> 22:02.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: The thing with the
Republican
race is, every time there is
voting, we say,

22:02.988 --> 22:07.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oh, my gosh, well, is this a
trend or is this
a one-time blip? Well, this is
Donald Trump's

22:07.793 --> 22:12.765 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
home state, and he is expected
to do quite
well here.

22:12.798 --> 22:19.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that what we learn is
how well he
does. And if Donald Trump is
able to continue

22:19.138 --> 22:26.612 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adding up delegates, that is
important for
Donald Trump. If Ted Cruz and
John Kasich

22:26.645 --> 22:32.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are able to chip away at that
and get a few
of those Delegates from the
state, well, then

22:32.952 --> 22:39.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's just a few delegates that
keep Donald
Trump away from getting that
elusive 1,237,

22:39.124 --> 22:42.161 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the number of delegates he needs
to clinch
the nomination.

22:42.194 --> 22:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Amy,
meantime, Ted Cruz
has been racking up delegates in
state after

22:46.899 --> 22:50.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
state, where they're going about
the business
of picking the people to fill
these delegate

22:50.936 --> 22:52.538 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
slots.

22:52.571 --> 22:56.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been able to pick up some
points, at
least P.R. points, you were
writing.

22:56.175 --> 22:59.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Well, yes, my
argument right now
is that where Ted Cruz is very
good is at

23:00.012 --> 23:03.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the nuts and the bolts of the
campaigning,
doing things, as you said, to go
and do the

23:03.582 --> 23:07.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
grassroots organizing, the hard
work that
it takes to actually get these
delegates in

23:07.987 --> 23:10.522 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these states at these
conventions.

23:10.556 --> 23:14.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump is terrible at nuts
and bolts.
He's been terrible at picking up
these delegates.

23:14.493 --> 23:18.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His team has only come on in the
last couple
of weeks trying to get into the
game. But

23:18.397 --> 23:22.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's very good at the P.R. and
the marketing.
And right now, the marketing
campaign for

23:22.468 --> 23:26.639 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump of course is, this
game's rigged,
I'm the biggest winner.

23:26.672 --> 23:31.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so I think if Donald Trump
comes out in
New York with a big head of
steam, he wins

23:31.043 --> 23:36.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
either all the delegates or most
of the delegates,
we go into April 26 in states
where he also

23:36.949 --> 23:41.987 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
should be successful, he keeps
winning there,
it makes his argument more
salient that, look,

23:42.021 --> 23:47.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I'm the winner, I have the most,
this 1,237
number is sort of arbitrary,
this getting

23:47.126 --> 23:49.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the delegates thing seems sort
of rigged.

23:49.395 --> 23:53.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, right now, at least in the
most recent
polling we saw from NBC/Wall
Street Journal,

23:53.732 --> 23:58.270 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the majority of Republicans are
with Donald
Trump on this argument. They say
the person

23:58.304 --> 24:02.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who has the most delegates and
the most votes
coming into the convention
should be the nominee.

24:02.341 --> 24:06.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, this is a battle between
this P.R. and
the grassroots organizing that
we are going

24:06.979 --> 24:08.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to continue to see.

24:08.814 --> 24:14.086 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it's gotten
to the point
where, if we keep hearing about
small numbers

24:14.119 --> 24:16.322 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of delegates, we don't know
where this is
going the head.

24:16.355 --> 24:17.523 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: That's right.

24:17.556 --> 24:18.324 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But tomorrow
night will be
important.

24:18.357 --> 24:19.591 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.826 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Amy Walter,
Tamara Keith, thank
you both.

24:20.859 --> 24:21.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: You're welcome.

24:21.694 --> 24:23.462 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Thank you, Judy.

24:23.495 --> 24:25.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we will have
more election
coverage, as we just mentioned,
including

24:25.731 --> 24:32.471 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that crucial New York primary,
tomorrow night.

24:32.504 --> 24:41.814 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

24:41.847 --> 24:46.952 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": on
this tax day,
the IRS commissioner talks
cyber-security

24:46.985 --> 24:53.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and budget fights; what happens
when India's
sacred cows become political;
and, as summer

24:53.058 --> 24:56.195 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
nears, the growing threat of
Zika here at
home.

24:56.228 --> 25:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first: The overwhelming
vote to impeach
Brazil's President Dilma
Rousseff has deepened

25:01.333 --> 25:04.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the crisis in South America's
largest nation.

25:04.269 --> 25:08.374 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We begin with this report from
Guillermo Galdos
of Independent Television News.

25:08.407 --> 25:11.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GUILLERMO GALDOS: Political
goals don't come
much bigger.

25:11.810 --> 25:17.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): We
have been working
on this for a long time,
believing that something

25:17.216 --> 25:19.151 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
had to change.

25:19.184 --> 25:25.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUILLERMO GALDOS: As with any
win, there is
always a loser. And for the
president's supporters,

25:25.691 --> 25:31.130 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those trying to remove Dilma
Rousseff are
playing a dirty game.

25:31.163 --> 25:37.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): This
fascist Congress
wants to lead a coup d'etat on
Brazil's democracy.

25:37.536 --> 25:41.340 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will resist and always fight
for democracy.

25:41.373 --> 25:47.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUILLERMO GALDOS: From the
streets of the
capital to Congress, Brazil is
now a house

25:47.446 --> 25:53.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
divided. Rousseff stands accused
of fiddling
the national accounts to hide
the budget deficit

25:53.852 --> 26:00.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
before her reelection in 2015.
Yet a third
of Brazil's lawmakers are being
investigated

26:01.026 --> 26:04.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for corruption themselves.

26:04.530 --> 26:12.171 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Having ruled for 13 years,
Brazil's Workers'
Party, the P.T., is now on the
ropes. After

26:12.204 --> 26:21.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
her election in 2011, Dilma once
enjoyed 90
percent approval ratings. Those
days are long

26:21.914 --> 26:29.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
gone. Even her popular
predecessor, Lula da
Silva, is now mired in his own
corruption

26:29.888 --> 26:31.723 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
scandals.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOSE EDUARDO CARDOZO, Brazilian
Attorney General
(through translator): I heard
people saying,

26:33.592 --> 26:39.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is she going to resign? Is she
becoming weak
several times? No, a person who
believes in

26:39.198 --> 26:44.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a just cause fights on until the
end, to have
it written in history that she
wasn't a coward.

26:44.937 --> 26:51.477 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GUILLERMO GALDOS: Brazil is
facing its worst
recession since the 1930s, and
60 percent

26:51.510 --> 26:54.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the country is now against
her.

26:54.179 --> 26:58.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For more on
the tumultuous
events in Brazil, as the country
deals with

26:58.050 --> 27:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Zika virus and the upcoming
Summer Olympics,
I'm joined by Lourdes
Garcia-Navarro, the

27:03.255 --> 27:05.023 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Brazil bureau chief for National
Public Radio.

27:05.057 --> 27:08.660 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She joins me tonight from NPR's
headquarters
here in Washington.

27:08.694 --> 27:13.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
First, how do we get to this
point? Is it
that old phrase, it's the
economy?

27:13.065 --> 27:15.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, National
Public Radio:
Well, I think that's certainly
part of it.

27:15.267 --> 27:21.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The economy in Brazil is doing
extremely badly.
It contracted by 3.8 percent
last year alone.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.543 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's expected to contract by the
same this
year.

27:24.576 --> 27:29.982 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's shedding jobs at an
alarming rate. People
are extremely anxious. They're
angry. And

27:30.015 --> 27:37.422 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're taking it out on the
leader, President
Dilma Rousseff. She has record
low popularity.

27:37.456 --> 27:42.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Only about 10 percent of the
country approve
of her leadership. And about 60
percent wanted

27:42.261 --> 27:43.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to see her impeached.

27:44.029 --> 27:47.099 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so the economy really is a
key factor
in all this, but, of course,
there are other

27:47.132 --> 27:51.136 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
things, like a massive
corruption scandal
that has been engulfing the
government, and

27:51.169 --> 27:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that really has also really
affected very
much her presidency and led to
this right

27:55.874 --> 27:57.609 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
now.

27:57.643 --> 28:01.079 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, as far as
corruption
scandals go, how bad is this
compared to what

28:01.113 --> 28:05.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
might have happened with her
predecessors
or in the political climate of
Brazil?

28:05.050 --> 28:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO: Well, I
mean, it's
really hard to know, because
what I think

28:07.953 --> 28:11.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really interesting about this
corruption
scandal is that, for the first
time, it's

28:11.990 --> 28:13.959 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
coming to light.

28:13.992 --> 28:17.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it has really shocked the
Brazilian population,
which has really felt, I think
up until now,

28:17.496 --> 28:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
inured in some sense to
corruption. They really
haven't cared very much about
it.

28:21.567 --> 28:25.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when this came to light, it
really shocked
them. And because And it was
because it was

28:25.537 --> 28:29.408 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about the state oil company. You
have to understand
that Petrobras, the state oil
company, is

28:29.441 --> 28:34.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the crown jewel for the
government. It's a
massive source of income.

28:34.446 --> 28:39.284 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And what was uncovered was a
scheme by which
politicians and businessmen were
bilking it

28:39.318 --> 28:44.856 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for billions and billions of
dollars. And
it was really shocking to many,
many people.

28:44.890 --> 28:49.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that has had wide-ranging
effects. And
so many people have been
implicated.

28:49.728 --> 28:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Billionaires have been put in
prison, politicians
are under indictment. It's a
corruption scandal

28:54.199 --> 28:56.768 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that has really shocked and
engulfed Brazil.

28:56.802 --> 29:00.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How likely is
Rousseff then
to be removed from office?

29:00.772 --> 29:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO: I think,
at this point,
extremely likely.

29:04.276 --> 29:09.715 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The government was very
disheartened, of course,
by what happened on Sunday
night. It went

29:09.748 --> 29:14.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
much worse than had originally
been expected.
But you also have to understand
that what's

29:14.319 --> 29:17.856 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
happening in Brazil is very,
very difficult
for the population.

29:17.889 --> 29:22.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Even though most of the people
in Brazil want
Dilma Rousseff gone, they do
look at the people

29:22.861 --> 29:29.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that might succeed her and they
are very skeptical
of them, too. The vice
president, Michel Temer,

29:29.067 --> 29:34.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has approval ratings similar to
Dilma Rousseff.
About 57 percent of the
population do not

29:35.007 --> 29:36.742 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
like him.

29:36.775 --> 29:40.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After him comes the speaker of
the house,
Eduardo Cunha, who has been
implicated in

29:40.212 --> 29:46.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that massive corruption scandal.
He is accused
of having embezzled millions of
dollars and

29:46.084 --> 29:48.854 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
having secret Swiss bank
accounts where he
stashed it all.

29:48.887 --> 29:52.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you look at the political
class in Brazil,
and for ordinary Brazilians,
they don't see

29:52.958 --> 29:55.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of hope there. They don't
see a good
way forward.

29:55.794 --> 30:00.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, are there
people concerned
about the long-term stability
for not just

30:00.332 --> 30:02.734 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Brazil, but the region, because
of how powerful
Brazil is?

30:02.768 --> 30:05.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yes,
Brazil is extremely
powerful.

30:05.137 --> 30:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is the largest democracy in
the Americas,
the largest economy in South
America and Central

30:12.377 --> 30:18.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America. So it is extremely
worrying for many,
many people. And, yes,
instability is a big

30:18.884 --> 30:20.786 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
concern.

30:20.819 --> 30:24.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The economy is in a freefall, as
we mentioned.
But the political class also
seems to be frozen.

30:24.122 --> 30:28.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And let's not forget they're
dealing with
the Zika virus. They don't have
a health minister

30:28.794 --> 30:33.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right now. They are dealing with
the Olympics
coming up. They just had to
replace the sports

30:33.999 --> 30:36.001 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
minister.

30:36.034 --> 30:39.604 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the new government comes in,
if Dilma Rousseff
is indeed removed from office,
how much legitimacy

30:39.638 --> 30:43.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will a new government have in
the eyes of
the international community,
considering that

30:43.809 --> 30:49.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many people look at the
political class
that enacted this -- these
impeachment proceedings,

30:49.214 --> 30:53.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and see many, many people who
are themselves
the subject of corruption
investigations?

30:53.552 --> 30:57.122 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yesterday,
when we saw some
of the imagery, it was almost
like it was

30:57.155 --> 30:59.825 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a World Cup soccer game. People
were painted
in flags.

30:59.858 --> 31:04.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was I'm with this or I'm
with the other
team, right? And they were out
there. But,

31:04.896 --> 31:08.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as you mentioned, there are some
deep systemic
problems. What are the people on
the street

31:08.700 --> 31:14.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the people that you speak to
concerned
about on -- this particular
problem is solvable.

31:14.306 --> 31:17.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's say we get this particular
person out
of office. Then what?

31:17.409 --> 31:19.611 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO: Yes. I
mean, it's
a very difficult situation.

31:19.644 --> 31:23.782 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I recently traveled to the north
of the country.
This is the place where the
ruling party,

31:23.815 --> 31:28.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dilma Rousseff's party and her
predecessor,
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, that
was really

31:28.353 --> 31:33.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their bastion of support. It's
the poorer,
blacker part of the country. And
it has really

31:33.792 --> 31:37.696 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
been helped a lot by the ruling
party and
many of their social policies.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But when I went up there, many
of the people
said that they had just lost
faith in the

31:41.066 --> 31:44.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government, that they were now
supporting
the removal of Dilma Rousseff.
And that is

31:44.870 --> 31:51.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because many people are facing a
loss of jobs.
They have no money. And they
have very -- they

31:52.010 --> 31:54.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't really have a lot of hope
in the future.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that has really, I think,
been the fatal
blow to this administration.

31:57.549 --> 32:06.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Lourdes Garcia-Navarro
of National Public Radio, thanks
so much.

32:06.424 --> 32:11.797 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO: You're
welcome.

32:11.830 --> 32:18.503 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the day
that the tax
man cometh, or, more accurately,
the day when

32:18.537 --> 32:22.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
millions of Americans will
finish filing their
taxes.

32:22.274 --> 32:28.213 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Internal Revenue Service is
never popular
again. But this year, it's
facing ever tougher

32:28.246 --> 32:34.319 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
scrutiny, especially from
Republicans in Congress.
Last week, lawmakers repeatedly
pressed IRS

32:34.352 --> 32:40.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Commissioner John Koskinen on
why the agency
wasn't moving faster to improve
cyber-security.

32:40.625 --> 32:45.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The IRS has acknowledged hackers
were able
to breach its computers last
year and swipe

32:45.564 --> 32:49.835 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sensitive information about
hundreds of thousands
of taxpayers.

32:49.868 --> 32:51.703 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Koskinen joins me now.

32:51.736 --> 32:53.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Koskinen, thank you for
being with us.

32:53.338 --> 32:55.106 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN, IRS Commissioner:
Delighted
to be here.

32:55.140 --> 32:58.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is it going
to take to
restore the confidence of the
American people

32:58.577 --> 33:00.345 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the IRS?

33:00.378 --> 33:02.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN: Well, I think
what we have
to do is first demonstrate to
them that it's

33:02.781 --> 33:07.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fair system, that, if you hear
from us,
it's because of something in
your return,

33:07.319 --> 33:10.655 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not because who you voted for,
what party
you belong to, what church you
go to.

33:10.689 --> 33:15.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, I think they have to
understand that
security of our data is a high
priority. Our

33:15.660 --> 33:20.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
systems are secure. The problem
has been that
criminals organized around the
world have

33:20.498 --> 33:25.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a vast amount of personal
information available
to them. And so they are
increasingly successful

33:25.136 --> 33:26.905 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as masquerading as taxpayers.

33:26.938 --> 33:31.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when they have gotten into
some of our
applications, it's because they
had already

33:31.776 --> 33:36.014 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stolen the information somewhere
else and
could in fact pretend very
effectively that

33:36.047 --> 33:37.816 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they were the taxpayer.

33:37.849 --> 33:41.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, when members
of Congress
after the IRS, come after you
and say, why

33:41.319 --> 33:46.091 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
aren't you able to prevent this
kind of thing,
do you say it is just not
doable?

33:46.124 --> 33:52.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN: No, I say that we
need to and
are continuing to increase the
levels of security,

33:52.097 --> 33:57.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the authentication we require of
taxpayers
before they have access to
significant applications

33:57.202 --> 34:00.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that we're developing and
continuing to roll
out.

34:00.171 --> 34:02.274 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's it?

34:02.307 --> 34:04.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN: And that's it.

34:04.276 --> 34:09.281 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, and I think we have taken
down the applications
-- two applications that were
accessed by

34:09.314 --> 34:13.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
criminals masquerading as
taxpayers. And we
will bring them back up with
higher levels

34:13.718 --> 34:17.822 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of authentication. But,
unfortunately, while
it makes it more difficult, if
not possible

34:17.856 --> 34:21.192 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
for the criminals to get
through, it will
be a little more difficult for
the taxpayers

34:21.226 --> 34:22.961 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get through as well.

34:22.994 --> 34:25.263 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: There are some
who look at
your -- well, many look at your
agency and

34:25.297 --> 34:29.501 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
say it feels it's been dogged by
one thing
after another. There was a
controversy a few

34:29.534 --> 34:36.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
years ago over the appearance
that the IRS
was holding up approval of
tax-exempt status

34:36.775 --> 34:39.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for these conservative nonprofit
groups.

34:39.244 --> 34:43.515 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was then this breach of
security. And
I will ask you in a minute about
the Panama

34:43.548 --> 34:51.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Papers. Question, is the IRS, is
it really
in a situation where it can't
win, where there's

34:51.856 --> 34:57.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
just perpetually going to be one
problem after
another that is gripping this
agency?

34:57.495 --> 35:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN: Well, I think
there are always
challenges in this day and age
for agencies.

35:01.833 --> 35:07.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, ultimately, the IRS
does a remarkable
job of processing tax returns
efficiently

35:07.572 --> 35:13.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and effectively and promptly,
dealing with
taxpayers. If we have the
funding, we provide

35:13.545 --> 35:16.147 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
very good levels of service for
taxpayers.

35:16.181 --> 35:20.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we continue, like all
financial institutions,
to have challenges, as I say,
particularly

35:20.952 --> 35:24.489 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with the organized crime
syndicates we're
dealing with all around the
world. Our systems

35:24.522 --> 35:29.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are attacked over a million
times a day by
people trying to get access,
which, fortunately,

35:29.227 --> 35:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thus far, they haven't been able
to get as
far as our basic systems.

35:32.230 --> 35:37.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You mentioned
adequate funding.
It's something, I think, many
Americans look

35:37.369 --> 35:43.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at the IRS and they say, well,
why do you
need more money? You already
have so much.

35:43.174 --> 35:45.844 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, you know, why can't you
make do with
what you have?

35:45.877 --> 35:51.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN: Well, our budget
was cut for
five years in a row from 2010 to
2015 by over

35:51.049 --> 35:56.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$1 billion, which meant that we
have lost
15,000 to 17,000 employees over
that time

35:56.421 --> 35:58.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
frame.

35:58.223 --> 36:01.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, while we need to be more
efficient and
are working to do that, at some
point -- we

36:01.092 --> 36:05.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have 10 million more taxpayers
than we had
-- at some point, you actually
begin to destroy

36:05.130 --> 36:09.634 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the effectiveness of the agency.
So whether
it's taxpayer service, taxpayer
enforcement,

36:09.667 --> 36:15.206 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or even protection of the
database, as we
continue to struggle for
funding, we continue

36:15.240 --> 36:16.574 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to be at risk.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.777 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And what does
that mean for
the American people?

36:18.810 --> 36:22.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN: Well, it means
that we estimate
we are collecting $4 billion or
$5 billion

36:22.080 --> 36:27.118 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a year less than we would if we
had 5,000
revenue agents, officers and
criminal investigators

36:27.152 --> 36:29.120 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we used to have five years ago.

36:29.154 --> 36:33.258 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It means that, as we
demonstrated this year
-- Congress gave us additional
funding for

36:33.291 --> 36:38.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
2016 for taxpayer service, and
the level of
taxpayer service on the phones
doubled. Instead

36:38.463 --> 36:44.402 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of only 37 percent getting
through, over 70
percent got through. It's a
direct line of,

36:44.436 --> 36:48.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you give us the money, and we
can hire
people, they will be able to
answer the phone.

36:48.106 --> 36:51.543 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you don't give us money, we
can't hire
the people during filling
season, and it will

36:51.576 --> 36:53.378 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be much harder to get an answer
on the phone.

36:53.411 --> 36:56.481 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Would it be
easier if -- we
know some of the Republican
candidates for

36:56.514 --> 37:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
president are saying, what needs
to be done
is, we just need a
one-postcard-sized filing

37:01.019 --> 37:04.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
form for every American or
virtually every
American.

37:04.289 --> 37:06.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Could something like that be an
answer for
the IRS?

37:06.624 --> 37:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN: Well, clearly,
life would be
simpler for taxpayers and
simpler for us if

37:10.261 --> 37:15.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the tax code were simpler. It
doesn't -- not
even necessarily to a postcard,
but it is

37:15.333 --> 37:18.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
obviously overly complicated for
everyone
at this point in time.

37:18.636 --> 37:24.209 align:left position:12.5%,start line:66.67% size:87.5%
So, we have been great
supporters of tax
simplification.
The policy issues are the domain
of the Congress

37:24.242 --> 37:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the administration. We do
tax administration,
but I have made it clear that
tax administration

37:29.114 --> 37:33.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
would be a lot easier and more
effective and
efficient if the code were
simpler. And so

37:33.585 --> 37:35.520 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whatever we can do to support
that, we're
happy to do.

37:35.553 --> 37:39.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Let me ask you
finally, John
Koskinen, about the Panama
Papers, this blockbuster

37:39.591 --> 37:44.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
news report that came out a few
weeks ago
about thousands of wealthy
people around the

37:44.596 --> 37:50.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
world, including some Americans,
who put their
money in offshore bank accounts
in an effort

37:50.635 --> 37:52.737 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to avoid paying tax.

37:52.770 --> 37:58.376 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this something the IRS knew
about ahead
of time, or did you only learn
about it because

37:58.409 --> 38:06.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of this really over a year of
very complex
reporting that was done by a
number of news

38:06.584 --> 38:08.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
organizations working together?

38:08.520 --> 38:13.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN: We didn't know
about this particular
set of data until we heard about
it through

38:13.491 --> 38:15.260 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the press.

38:15.293 --> 38:19.264 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We obviously had had a
full-court press for
the last four or five years on
offshore tax

38:19.297 --> 38:25.537 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
evasion. We have had agreements
with numerous
Swiss banks that have revealed
untold numbers

38:25.570 --> 38:30.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of accounts. We have created a
voluntary disclosure
program that over six or seven
million Americans

38:30.975 --> 38:32.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have taken advantage of.

38:32.710 --> 38:36.381 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, hiding your assets and
avoiding taxes
anywhere in the world is getting
a lot more

38:36.414 --> 38:38.216 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
difficult.

38:38.249 --> 38:42.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you find that
it's now much
easier to go after these
individuals because

38:42.487 --> 38:45.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this kind of reporting, or
does this -- how
much difference does this make?

38:45.857 --> 38:49.060 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN KOSKINEN: Well, I think
this reporting
will help. We're working with a
number of

38:49.093 --> 38:54.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tax administrations around the
world to collect
this particular data and
cooperate on following

38:54.165 --> 38:55.934 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
through with it.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think what's happening for
compliance
generally is, increasingly, I
think, wealthy

38:59.437 --> 39:03.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
investors and taxpayers around
the world are
discovering that there is a
growing global

39:03.841 --> 39:08.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
coalition focused on ending tax
evasion through
foreign accounts.

39:08.713 --> 39:11.516 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On that note, we
will leave
it.

39:11.549 --> 39:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Koskinen, the commissioner
of the Internal
Revenue Service, on Tax Day,

The trigger

39:37.208 --> 39:42.513 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for recent incidents has been
over the consumption
of beef, an age-old controversy
that traces

39:42.547 --> 39:45.783 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
itself to the sanctity of cows

From New Delhi, Fred de Sam

39:48.286 --> 39:54.492 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Last
October, in a village
not far from India's capital, a
56-year-old

39:54.525 --> 40:00.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslim man was beaten to death
and his son
gravely injured by an allegedly
Hindu mob.

40:00.732 --> 40:07.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His alleged crime? A rumor that
he had slaughtered
a cow, an animal considered
sacred to Hindus.

40:07.739 --> 40:12.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mohammad Akhlaq's home was
ransacked, including
the contents of the
refrigerator, before the

40:12.610 --> 40:17.215 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
police arrived.

40:17.248 --> 40:22.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It was perhaps the most
egregious in a spate
of recent such incidents. They
have alarmed

40:22.120 --> 40:27.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
many liberals and especially
leaders of the
significant Muslim minority who
fear a rising

40:27.725 --> 40:30.428 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intolerance in this largely
Hindu nation.

40:32.263 --> 40:37.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

like this is
against India's secularism and
brotherhood.

40:37.335 --> 40:43.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is thinking that looks down
upon Muslims
with distrust. This incident was
not triggered

40:43.675 --> 40:46.811 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by the beef issue. They murdered
him on religious
grounds.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: ®MDNM /It
turns out the
meat found in Akhlaq's
refrigerator was mutton,

40:51.549 --> 40:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
not beef, but the beef issue has
been a political
hot potato, one that's endured
even as the

40:57.288 --> 41:01.959 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
country has entered the

41:01.993 --> 41:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You won't find beef in a Burger

in India, for example, or a
McDonald's. Here,

41:08.299 --> 41:16.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
burgers come from sheep,
chickens, even vegetables,
but not cows. Paradoxically, the
animals roam

41:16.107 --> 41:20.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
freely on the street --
vulnerable to poisonous
garbage and to being captured
and taken to

41:21.012 --> 41:26.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
slaughter at night, though there
are efforts
to crack down on that illegal
practice and

41:26.284 --> 41:28.319 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

reverence in

DEVENDER NAYAK there A poor
family can sustain
themselves with just one family
of cows. They

42:06.157 --> 42:11.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
can sell the milk, use the dung
and the urine,
which has many medicinal
properties.

42:11.295 --> 42:15.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Whether that
reverence
should mean an outright ban on
beef has been

42:15.600 --> 42:22.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a vexing issue ever since
independence in
1947 from the beef-loving
British rulers.

42:22.640 --> 42:27.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The father of modern India, a
Hindu, professed
his love for the cow, but
Mahatma Gandhi said

42:27.945 --> 42:33.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he would not impose his views on

of beef consumption in minority
and many urban
communities. But that changed
with the election

43:05.716 --> 43:12.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

chauvinism. That's the sort of
polarization
that could be deeply damaging to
India's stability

43:27.205 --> 43:28.940 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in its future.

FRED DE SAM LAZARO: In a recent
speech in
Parliament, Tharoor said the
frequent reports

43:33.811 --> 43:39.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of vigilante groups targeting
minorities,
of rising intolerance, is coming
at the cost

43:39.951 --> 43:41.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of India's reputation.

43:41.786 --> 43:45.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHASHI THAROOR: A Bangladeshi
friend of mine
who was visiting Delhi last week
and he told

43:45.690 --> 43:51.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
me that Islamic fundamentalists
in his country
were having a field day
attacking India as

43:51.162 --> 43:52.897 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a place where it is safer to be
a cow than
a Muslim.

43:52.930 --> 43:55.099 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Is that a
bit of hyperbole?

43:55.132 --> 43:59.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHASHI THAROOR: It is a bit of
hyperbole.
I think that it's high time that
the government

43:59.203 --> 44:05.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
realize that they're making
asses of themselves
and discrediting an enormously
plural and

44:05.276 --> 44:07.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
diverse civilization.

44:07.178 --> 44:10.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: For his
part, Prime Minister
Modi, though allied with Hindu
nationalist

44:10.848 --> 44:16.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
groups, has not involved himself
in their
key demand, that India declare
itself a Hindu

44:16.487 --> 44:21.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nation. Modi has stuck to the
pro-business
economic development theme he's
struck ever

44:21.792 --> 44:23.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since ascending to office.

44:23.594 --> 44:27.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NARENDRA MODI, India Prime
Minister (through
translator): Our country can
only prosper

44:27.465 --> 44:32.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if Hindus and Muslims unite to
fight against
poverty and we defeat poverty.

44:32.303 --> 44:37.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Coming
several days after
the murder of Mohammad Akhlaq,
Modi was criticized

44:37.542 --> 44:42.613 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for saying too little too late
and for not
reining in vigilante groups and
some members

44:42.647 --> 44:47.118 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his party who made statements
appearing
to support them.

44:47.151 --> 44:52.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Modi's supporters say it is
the opposition
that is using divisive religion
politics for

44:52.089 --> 44:53.958 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their own gain.

44:53.991 --> 44:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MUKHTAR ABBAS NAQVI, Minister
for Minority
Affairs (through translator):
The prime minister

44:56.160 --> 45:01.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
has repeatedly said that, if the
country should
remain united, everyone will
have to walk

45:01.265 --> 45:06.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hand in hand for development.
But there are
certain politicians that promote
pseudo-secularism

45:07.004 --> 45:08.906 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and are not ready to hear his
message.

45:08.940 --> 45:14.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRED DE SAM LAZARO: The key
question is whether
the so-called beef issue
represents the normal

45:14.345 --> 45:20.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ebb and flow of a vibrant, if
sometimes violent,
democracy or whether, in fact,
that democracy

45:20.384 --> 45:22.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
faces a new, real threat.

45:22.787 --> 45:27.124 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," this is
Fred de Sam
Lazaro in New Delhi.

45:27.158 --> 45:32.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Fred's reporting
is a partnership
with the Under-Told Stories
Project at University

45:32.663 --> 45:38.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of St. Thomas in Minnesota. A
version of this
story aired on the PBS program

in the U.S.,

45:50.214 --> 45:56.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally
tonight: worries
over a potential Zika outbreak
in the U.S.,

45:56.854 --> 45:59.790 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and who may suffer a bigger
impact.

45:59.824 --> 46:03.494 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Public health officials have
been increasingly
concerned about the virus
spreading via mosquitoes

46:03.527 --> 46:08.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this summer. One report even
suggested government
officials were split over
whether to advise

46:08.532 --> 46:12.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
women to avoid pregnancy in
areas where Zika
is circulating.

46:12.637 --> 46:17.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an op-ed titled "Zika Is
Coming," Dr. Peter
Hotez focused on some of these
questions and

46:17.875 --> 46:22.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what it might mean in some
cities in the southern
parts of the country. He's the
dean of the

46:22.747 --> 46:27.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
National School of Tropical
Medicine at Baylor
College of Medicine and a
pediatrician and

46:27.618 --> 46:32.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
microbiologist at Texas
Children's Hospital.
I interviewed him from our New
York studios.

46:32.657 --> 46:37.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I want to read you the first
sentence of the
op-ed you wrote in The New York
Times recently.

46:37.595 --> 46:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It said: "If I were a pregnant
woman living
on the Gulf Coast or in Florida
in an impoverished

46:41.699 --> 46:46.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
neighborhood and city like
Houston, New Orleans,
Miami, Biloxi, Mississippi, or
Mobile, Alabama,

46:46.771 --> 46:48.639 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I would be nervous right now."

46:48.673 --> 46:50.441 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Explain.

46:50.474 --> 46:52.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. PETER HOTEZ, Texas
Children's Hospital:
Well, the reason I made that
statement, Hari,

46:52.410 --> 46:58.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was because what we know, where
this terrible
birth defect, microcephaly, is
happening.

46:58.516 --> 47:03.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It happens when pregnant women
are bitten
by the Aedes mosquitoes. So, the
first requirement

47:03.220 --> 47:07.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is, it has to be a part of the
world where
we have the Aedes mosquito. And,
also, the

47:07.725 --> 47:12.596 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other component that not many
people appropriate
is both crowding and poverty.

47:12.630 --> 47:17.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the reason why poverty is so
important
is because women who live in
poverty have

47:17.368 --> 47:22.873 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
increased exposure to mosquitoes
because of
absent -- or broken window
screens, collected

47:22.907 --> 47:27.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
garbage, environmental
degradation near the
home that breeds mosquitoes.

47:27.378 --> 47:32.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so what you have on the Gulf
Coast of
the U.S. is the perfect storm of
all three

47:32.550 --> 47:38.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
factors, the Aedes aegypti
mosquito, the extreme
poverty and crowding, that you
would find

47:38.255 --> 47:42.159 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Northeastern Brazil, which is
the epicenter
of this epidemic or what we have
seen moving

47:42.193 --> 47:44.161 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
into Colombia.

47:44.195 --> 47:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, for all the reasons we're
seeing microcephaly
cases appear in Brazil and
Colombia, I believe

47:48.899 --> 47:54.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we're going to see on the Gulf
Coast, especially
as we move into the warmer
months, when our

47:54.171 --> 47:56.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
mosquito numbers start to rise.

47:56.073 --> 48:01.979 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we're already finding Aedes
aegypti mosquitoes
on the Gulf Coast, including
here in Houston.

48:02.012 --> 48:06.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm very worried that as we
go into the
warmer months, those mosquito
numbers are

48:06.117 --> 48:13.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to incline, with it, the
poorer neighborhoods
on Gulf Coast cities, such as
Houston, New

48:13.524 --> 48:16.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Orleans, others, are really
going to be affected
by Zika.

48:16.861 --> 48:21.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, what's
that timeline
of progression that you see? Not
all mosquitoes

48:21.332 --> 48:25.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have Zika. It will take some
time for some
of them to get Zika, and then
some of them

48:25.336 --> 48:29.774 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to bite people, some of those
people to have
symptoms, some of those symptoms
to be severe.

48:29.807 --> 48:34.512 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DR. PETER HOTEZ: Well,
arboviruses, viruses
transmitted by mosquitoes are
not new to the

48:34.545 --> 48:39.817 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gulf Coast. We have experienced
a number of
epidemics of arboviral
infections.

48:39.850 --> 48:45.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For instance, in 2003, Houston
experienced
an epidemic dengue fever caused
by the same

48:45.756 --> 48:51.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Aedes aegypti mosquito. And what
we found
was, those numbers started to
rise in May

48:51.529 --> 48:57.101 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and into June, and with it, we
then started
seeing a dengue outbreak back in
2003.

48:57.134 --> 49:03.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I would expect, if Zika is
going to strike
the Gulf Coast, it would go by a
similar playbook.

49:03.240 --> 49:07.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Beginning in May, June, into the
summer months
is when we could see start
seeing Zika transmission

49:07.611 --> 49:09.313 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on the Gulf Coast.

49:09.346 --> 49:14.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Should local
health officials
be advising women to delay
pregnancy?

49:14.418 --> 49:18.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. PETER HOTEZ: Well, it
depends really where
we're talking about.

49:18.289 --> 49:26.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, right now, Zika is rampaging
through Puerto
Rico. According to the CDC,
maybe half or

49:26.163 --> 49:31.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
even more of the island is going
to be infected
by the Zika virus within the
coming weeks.

49:31.836 --> 49:37.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And this is how Zika goes. It
affects the
immunologically naive population
and sweeps

49:37.708 --> 49:40.244 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
through it very quickly over a
period of months.

49:40.277 --> 49:45.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw this in Micronesia and
French Polynesia
and Brazil and now in Puerto
Rico. So, during

49:45.883 --> 49:52.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that time period, I'm of the
opinion, if it's
possible, to try and delay
pregnancy during

49:52.523 --> 49:58.796 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that time when large numbers of
women are
getting exposed to the Zika
virus. Having

49:58.829 --> 50:01.165 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
said that, it's easier said than
done.

50:01.198 --> 50:07.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to remember the problem
of advising
women to delay pregnancy, who is
Zika affecting?

50:07.872 --> 50:14.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's affecting predominantly
women who live
in poverty, not exclusively, but
that's disproportionately

50:14.678 --> 50:16.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
affecting women who are
impoverished.

50:16.447 --> 50:22.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So it's a very tough call. Right
now, we do
not have Zika virus transmission
on the Gulf

50:22.319 --> 50:27.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coast, so I wouldn't make that
recommendation,
but it's something that we're
going to have

50:27.157 --> 50:30.828 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to revisit as we get into the
warmer months.

50:30.861 --> 50:36.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
idea of false-positive
cases that have happened in
Brazil, and that

50:36.901 --> 50:42.039 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
so many Zika infections don't
even lead to
the equivalent of a cold or mild
fever?

50:42.072 --> 50:46.010 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. PETER HOTEZ: Well, we're
starting to change
our opinion on the virus.

50:46.043 --> 50:50.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, we used to say that 80
percent of
cases are without symptoms,
asymptomatic.

50:50.915 --> 50:56.053 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's probably an overestimate.
The real
question that we would like to
know is, if

50:56.086 --> 51:01.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're a pregnant woman and you
become pregnant
with the Zika virus, what's the
likelihood

51:01.859 --> 51:07.531 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you're going to give birth to a
baby with
microcephaly or other terrible
congenital

51:07.564 --> 51:09.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
birth defects?

51:09.300 --> 51:14.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the stakes are very high. I
think, for
now, we have to assume that if a
mother is

51:14.538 --> 51:19.743 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
infected with the Zika virus,
the likelihood
that she will give rise to a
baby with micro

51:19.777 --> 51:24.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- that she will give birth to a
baby with
microcephaly is significant, and
we have to

51:24.181 --> 51:25.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
plan accordingly.

51:26.016 --> 51:28.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Dr. Peter
Hotez from the
