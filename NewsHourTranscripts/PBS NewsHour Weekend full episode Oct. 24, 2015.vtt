00:12.713 --> 00:14.281
FOR SAFE HARBOR IN THE U.S.

00:14.281 --> 00:15.949

IN HONDURAS.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.285

00:29.863 --> 00:30.564

00:30.564 --> 00:31.365
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.466
I'M WILLIAM BRANGHAM, HARI

00:32.466 --> 00:34.334
SREENIVASAN IS ON ASSIGNMENT.

00:34.334 --> 00:35.802
HURRICANE PATRICIA HAS TOPPLED

00:35.802 --> 00:37.070
TREES AND BATTERED BUILDINGS,

00:37.070 --> 00:38.639
BUT HAS CAUSED MUCH LESS DAMAGE

00:38.639 --> 00:39.873
THAN EXPECTED.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.275
THE STORM, WHICH BRIEFLY RATED

00:41.275 --> 00:42.876
AS THE STRONGEST HURRICANE ON

00:42.876 --> 00:43.644
RECORD IN THE WESTERN

00:43.644 --> 00:46.079
HEMISPHERE, WITH 200mph WINDS

00:46.079 --> 00:47.614
WHILE OVER THE PACIFIC OCEAN,

00:47.614 --> 00:48.849
HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A

00:48.849 --> 00:50.517
TROPICAL DEPRESSION WITH WINDS

00:50.517 --> 00:52.619
OF ONLY 35 MILES AN HOUR.

00:52.619 --> 00:53.553
PATRICIA WEAKENED AS IT MADE

00:53.553 --> 00:55.355
LANDFALL ON MEXICO'S PACIFIC

00:55.355 --> 00:56.657
COAST LAST NIGHT AND LARGELY

00:56.657 --> 00:58.258
SPARED THE CITIES IN ITS PATH,

00:58.258 --> 00:59.993
INCLUDING GUADALAJARA AND THE

00:59.993 --> 01:01.261
SEASIDE RESORT OF PUERTO

01:01.261 --> 01:02.229
VALLARTA.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.363
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS AND

01:03.363 --> 01:04.965
TOURISTS HAD FLED INLAND.

01:04.965 --> 01:06.033
HEAVY RAINS HAVE CAUSED FLOODING

01:06.033 --> 01:07.334
BUT THERE ARE NO REPORTS OF

01:07.334 --> 01:08.802
FATALITIES.

01:08.802 --> 01:09.870
THE REMNANTS OF PATRICIA ARE

01:09.870 --> 01:11.171
EXPECTED TO ADD TO THE HEAVY

01:11.171 --> 01:13.240
RAINS ALREADY FALLING ON TEXAS.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.741
MORE THAN A FOOT OF RAIN FELL IN

01:14.741 --> 01:15.909
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PARTS

01:15.909 --> 01:17.210
OF THE STATE IN THE PAST 24

01:17.210 --> 01:19.179
HOURS, CAUSING MAJOR FLOODING.

01:19.179 --> 01:20.547
FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS REMAIN IN

01:20.547 --> 01:22.516
EFFECT IN DALLAS, HOUSTON, SAN

01:22.516 --> 01:23.884
ANTONIO AND AUSTIN.

01:23.884 --> 01:25.352
50 MILES SOUTH OF DALLAS, IN THE

01:25.352 --> 01:26.653
TOWN OF CORSICANA, AN

01:26.653 --> 01:28.188
OVERFLOWING CREEK WASHED AWAY

01:28.188 --> 01:29.423
TRAIN TRACKS AND CAUSED A

01:29.423 --> 01:30.791
FREIGHT TRAIN TO DERAIL.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.858
NO ONE WAS HURT.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.527
TRAFFIC WAS BACKED UP 12 MILES

01:33.527 --> 01:34.328
ON A FLOODED SECTION OF

01:34.328 --> 01:36.430
INTERSTATE 45 OVERNIGHT.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.365
TODAY, AROUND 100 FLIGHTS FROM

01:38.365 --> 01:39.666
DALLAS-FORT WORTH AIRPORT WERE

01:39.666 --> 01:41.201
CANCELLED DUE TO THE WEATHER.

01:41.201 --> 01:42.569
EUROPEAN LEADERS ARE GATHERING

01:42.569 --> 01:44.204
IN BRUSSELS FOR TALKS ON DEALING

01:44.204 --> 01:45.572
WITH THE ONGOING SURGE OF

01:45.572 --> 01:47.174
MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES FLOWING

01:47.174 --> 01:48.942
INTO THE CONTINENT, A SURGE THAT

01:48.942 --> 01:50.243
CONTINUES DESPITE FALLING

01:50.243 --> 01:52.079
TEMPERATURES IN MUCH OF EUROPE.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.880
ONE IDEA ON THE TABLE: NO LONGER

01:53.880 --> 01:55.148
TRANSFERRING MIGRANTS FROM ONE

01:55.148 --> 01:56.984
COUNTRY TO ANOTHER WITHOUT PRIOR

01:56.984 --> 01:58.385
AGREEMENTS.

01:58.385 --> 01:59.886
SLOVENIA SAYS IT HAS ADMITTED

01:59.886 --> 02:01.955
13,000 ASYLUM SEEKERS IN THE

02:01.955 --> 02:04.358
PAST DAY AND 58,000 DURING THE

02:04.358 --> 02:05.325
PAST WEEK.

02:05.325 --> 02:06.893
AT ONE CAMP ALONG SLOVENIA'S

02:06.893 --> 02:08.562
BORDER WITH CROATIA, POLICE IN

02:08.562 --> 02:10.297
RIOT GEAR USED PEPPER SPRAY TO

02:10.297 --> 02:11.665
CONTROL CROWDS SEEKING TO BOARD

02:11.665 --> 02:13.200
BUSES FOR AUSTRIA.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.468
THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION

02:14.468 --> 02:17.270
FOR MIGRATION ESTIMATES 680,000

02:17.270 --> 02:18.939
MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES HAVE

02:18.939 --> 02:20.374
CROSSED INTO EUROPE THIS YEAR

02:20.374 --> 02:22.009
FROM THE MIDDLE EAST, AFRICA

02:22.009 --> 02:22.976
AND ASIA.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.244
U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE JOHN

02:24.244 --> 02:25.846
KERRY SAYS ISRAEL AND JORDAN

02:25.846 --> 02:27.280
HAVE AGREED ON STEPS TO CURB A

02:27.280 --> 02:28.548
WAVE OF VIOLENCE BETWEEN

02:28.548 --> 02:30.283
PALESTINIANS AND ISRAELIS.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.752
IN JORDAN'S CAPITAL OF AMMAN

02:31.752 --> 02:33.186
TODAY, KERRY MET SEPARATELY WITH

02:33.186 --> 02:34.688
JORDAN'S KING ABDULLAH, AND

02:34.688 --> 02:35.989
PALESTINIAN LEADER MAHMOUD

02:35.989 --> 02:36.923
ABBAS.

02:36.923 --> 02:37.958
KERRY ANNOUNCED THERE WILL BE

02:37.958 --> 02:40.227
24/7 VIDEO MONITORING AROUND A

02:40.227 --> 02:41.895
SACRED SITE IN JERUSALEM'S OLD

02:41.895 --> 02:42.696
CITY.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.964
IT'S KNOWN TO MUSLIMS AS HARAM

02:43.964 --> 02:45.632
AL SHARIF, AND TO JEWS AS THE

02:45.632 --> 02:46.733
TEMPLE MOUNT.

02:46.733 --> 02:47.901
ISRAEL ALSO SAID IT WOULD RE-

02:47.901 --> 02:49.436
AFFIRM JORDAN'S ROLE AS

02:49.436 --> 02:51.071
CUSTODIAN OF THE SITE.

02:51.071 --> 02:52.339
KERRY SAID IT WAS A "FALSE

02:52.339 --> 02:54.007
PERCEPTION" AMONG PALESTINIANS

02:54.007 --> 02:55.575
THAT ISRAEL WANTED TO CHANGE THE

02:55.575 --> 02:57.110
RULES GOVERNING ACCESS TO THE

02:57.110 --> 02:58.679
SITE, A CHARGE ISRAEL HAS

02:58.679 --> 02:59.513
DENIED.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.248
THE CONFLICT OVER THIS SITE HAS

03:01.248 --> 03:02.315
BEEN THE SOURCE OF MUCH OF THE

03:02.315 --> 03:03.984
VIOLENCE IN RECENT WEEKS.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.185
AND TODAY, THOUGH, THAT VIOLENCE

03:05.185 --> 03:06.086
CONTINUED.

03:06.086 --> 03:07.354
ISRAELI SOLDIERS SHOT AND KILLED

03:07.354 --> 03:08.989
A PALESTINIAN TEENAGER WHO TRIED

03:08.989 --> 03:10.490
TO STAB A GUARD AT A WEST BANK

03:10.490 --> 03:11.558
BORDER CROSSING.

03:11.558 --> 03:12.993
IN THE PAST FIVE WEEKS,

03:12.993 --> 03:14.561
PALESTINIANS HAVE KILLED TEN

03:14.561 --> 03:16.129
ISRAELIS, MOSTLY BY STABBINGS,

03:16.129 --> 03:17.597
WHILE THE ISRAELI MILITARY AND

03:17.597 --> 03:19.132
POLICE HAVE KILLED MORE THAN 50

03:19.132 --> 03:21.001
PALESTINIANS, DESCRIBING HALF OF

03:21.001 --> 03:22.135
THEM AS ASSAILANTS WHO HAD

03:22.135 --> 03:23.870
ATTACKED ISRAELI CITIZENS.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.205
FOR MORE ON THIS, I AM JOINED BY

03:25.205 --> 03:26.173
ARSHAD MOHAMMED.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.107
HE'S A CORRESPONDENT FOR

03:27.107 --> 03:28.041
REUTERS, AND HE'S BEEN

03:28.041 --> 03:29.743
TRAVELING WITH SECRETARY KERRY.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.211
HE JOINS ME NOW VIA SKYPE FROM

03:31.211 --> 03:32.579
RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA.

03:32.579 --> 03:33.980
ARSHAD MOHAMMED, THANKS FOR

03:33.980 --> 03:35.048
BEING HERE.

03:35.048 --> 03:36.783
GIVE ME A LITTLE SENSE OF WHAT

03:36.783 --> 03:38.318
IS IT EXACTLY THAT ISRAEL AND

03:38.318 --> 03:41.188
JORDAN ARE AGREED TO TODAY?

03:41.188 --> 03:43.890
>> WELL, ACCORDING TO SECRETARY

03:43.890 --> 03:45.492
KERRY, THERE ARE BASICALLY FOUR

03:45.492 --> 03:48.295
BROAD STEPS THAT HE SKETCHED

03:48.295 --> 03:49.496
OUT.

03:49.496 --> 03:53.400
THE FIRST IS THAT THERE WOULD BE

03:53.400 --> 03:57.137
24/7 VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF THE

03:57.137 --> 03:58.138
ENTIRE AREA.

03:58.138 --> 03:59.506
THE IDEA THERE IS THAT

03:59.506 --> 04:00.841
TRANSPARENCY WILL LET EVERYBODY

04:00.841 --> 04:03.210
SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING AND MAKE IT

04:03.210 --> 04:05.412
HARDER TO MISREPRESENT WHAT'S

04:05.412 --> 04:06.947
HAPPENING AND WHETHER THE STATUS

04:06.947 --> 04:08.381
QUO IS CHANGING.

04:08.381 --> 04:13.487
AMONG THE OTHER THINGS ARE THAT

04:13.487 --> 04:15.589
ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER NETANYAHU

04:15.589 --> 04:19.693
WILL ENFORCE THE EXISTING

04:19.693 --> 04:22.829
PROHIBITION ON NON-MUSLIMS,

04:22.829 --> 04:25.031
JEWS, CHRISTIANS AND OTHERS

04:25.031 --> 04:28.001
FROM PRAYING ON THE SITE.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.170
THIRD, THAT HE WOULD RESTATE

04:30.170 --> 04:32.405
THAT ISRAEL HAS NO INTENT OF

04:32.405 --> 04:33.807
DIVIDING THE SITE.

04:33.807 --> 04:38.612
AND FOURTH, THAT ISRAEL AND THE

04:38.612 --> 04:42.349
JORDANIAN RELIGIOUS TRUST, THAT

04:42.349 --> 04:44.184
ADMINISTERS THE SITE, WOULD

04:44.184 --> 04:46.453
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THEIR

04:46.453 --> 04:48.288
COOPERATION, ALL AS A WAY OF

04:48.288 --> 04:51.024
TRYING TO REDUCE TENSIONS AND

04:51.024 --> 04:52.626
PREVENT VIOLENCE.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.793
>> Brangham: GIVEN THAT THERE

04:53.793 --> 04:55.529
HAS BEEN SO MUCH ANIMOSITY OVER

04:55.529 --> 04:57.197
THIS PARTICULAR SITE AND MORE

04:57.197 --> 04:58.298
BROADLY BETWEEN THE ISRAELIS AND

04:58.298 --> 04:59.733
THE PALESTINIANS, HOW LIKELY DO

04:59.733 --> 05:01.601
YOU THINK THAT THIS KIND OF AN

05:01.601 --> 05:03.270
AGREEMENT IS GOING TO HAVE ANY

05:03.270 --> 05:04.671
LASTING EFFECT?

05:04.671 --> 05:08.041
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO SAY.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.978
I THINK A LOT OF IT DEPENDS BOTH

05:11.978 --> 05:15.715
ON THE ACTIONS OF OFFICIALS AND

05:15.715 --> 05:18.018
THEN PUBLIC SENTIMENT.

05:18.018 --> 05:20.053
IF THERE IS SEEN TO BE GOOD WILL

05:20.053 --> 05:21.788
ON THE SIDE OF THE ISRAELIS AND

05:21.788 --> 05:24.925
THE SIDE OF JORDANIANS AND THE

05:24.925 --> 05:27.494
PALESTINIAN RESIDENTS OF THE

05:27.494 --> 05:30.297
AREA, YOU KNOW, THEN IT'S

05:30.297 --> 05:32.032
POSSIBLE THAT THE VIOLENCE WILL

05:32.032 --> 05:35.135
COME DOWN.

05:35.135 --> 05:38.905
YOU KNOW, THE OTHER QUESTION IS

05:38.905 --> 05:40.740
WHETHER WHAT OTHER FACTORS THAT

05:40.740 --> 05:41.942
HAVE GIVEN RISE TO THE TENSION

05:41.942 --> 05:43.743
AND THE VIOLENCE AND, YOU KNOW,

05:43.743 --> 05:46.947
ONE FACTOR THAT IS OFTEN CITED

05:46.947 --> 05:48.915
BY PALESTINIANS IS THE FEELING

05:48.915 --> 05:52.819
THAT ISRAEL IS ALLOWING MORE

05:52.819 --> 05:55.522
JEWS TO VISIT THE SITE AND IS

05:55.522 --> 05:57.557
SORT OF TACITLY ACCEPTING THAT

05:57.557 --> 05:58.825
THEY PRAY THERE.

05:58.825 --> 05:59.993
WHETHER THE PALESTINIANS FEEL

05:59.993 --> 06:04.064
LIKE THAT'S ACTUALLY STOPPING OR

06:04.064 --> 06:06.099
ABATING OR BEING REVERSED.

06:06.099 --> 06:06.800
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT IN THE

06:06.800 --> 06:09.402
PREDICTIONS BUSINESS BUT IT DOES

06:09.402 --> 06:11.104
SEEM TO ME THAT BOTH SIDES HAVE

06:11.104 --> 06:12.906
SOME MEASURE OF INTEREST IN

06:12.906 --> 06:15.675
REDUCING THE VIOLENCE IF THEY

06:15.675 --> 06:16.676
CAN.

06:16.676 --> 06:17.711
>> Brangham: ALL RIGHT, ARSHAD

06:17.711 --> 06:19.112
MOHAMMED FROM REUTERS, THANK YOU

06:19.112 --> 06:20.780
VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE.

06:20.780 --> 06:23.049
>> THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

06:23.049 --> 06:23.750
>> Brangham: SIGNALING A SHIFT

06:23.750 --> 06:25.418
IN ITS POSITION IN SYRIA, RUSSIA

06:25.418 --> 06:27.020
SAYS IT'S READY TO SUPPORT THE

06:27.020 --> 06:28.355
U.S.-BACKED REBELS WHO ARE

06:28.355 --> 06:30.023
FIGHTING SYRIAN PRESIDENT BASHAR

06:30.023 --> 06:31.057
AL-ASSAD.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.325
RUSSIAN FOREIGN MINISTER SERGEI

06:32.325 --> 06:33.793
LAVROV SAID IN AN INTERVIEW

06:33.793 --> 06:35.528
BROADCAST TODAY THAT RUSSIAN

06:35.528 --> 06:36.930
WARPLANES WOULD SUPPORT THE FREE

06:36.930 --> 06:38.765
SYRIAN ARMY AGAINST ASSAD.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.133
IN AIRSTRIKES THIS MONTH, RUSSIA

06:40.133 --> 06:42.235
BOMBED THOSE SAME SYRIAN REBELS.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.070
LAVROV ALSO SAID RUSSIA IS READY

06:44.070 --> 06:45.639
TO COOPERATE WITH THE U.S. ON

06:45.639 --> 06:47.173
ATTACKING THE ISLAMIC STATE, OR

06:47.173 --> 06:49.042
ISIS, IN SYRIA.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.451
THE U.S. SENATE HAS SCHEDULED

06:58.451 --> 06:59.953
FINAL VOTES NEXT WEEK ON A

06:59.953 --> 07:01.421
BILL THAT WOULD PERMIT COMPANIES

07:01.421 --> 07:02.689
TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT

07:02.689 --> 07:04.224
HACKING ATTACKS WITH EACH OTHER

07:04.224 --> 07:05.825
AND WITH THE GOVERNMENT, WITHOUT

07:05.825 --> 07:07.427
FEAR OF LAWSUITS.

07:07.427 --> 07:08.728
THE SO-CALLED "CYBER-SECURITY

07:08.728 --> 07:10.230
INFORMATION SHARING ACT," OR

07:10.230 --> 07:11.831
CISA, HAS ALREADY PASSED THE

07:11.831 --> 07:13.133
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.401
BUT SEVERAL BIG TECH COMPANIES

07:14.401 --> 07:16.269
LIKE APPLE AND TWITTER SAY IT

07:16.269 --> 07:17.604
DOES TOO LITTLE TO PROTECT

07:17.604 --> 07:19.272
INDIVIDUAL PRIVACY.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.140
JOINING ME NOW TO DISCUSS THE

07:20.140 --> 07:21.775
BILL IS "POLITICO" REPORTER TIM

07:21.775 --> 07:22.609
STARKS.

07:22.609 --> 07:23.643
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THIS.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.978
WE LIKE TO THINK OF LEGISLATION

07:24.978 --> 07:26.613
AS TRYING IT SOLVE A PARTICULAR

07:26.613 --> 07:27.480
PROBLEM.

07:27.480 --> 07:28.715
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM THAT

07:28.715 --> 07:30.383
CISA IS TRYING TO SOLVE?

07:30.383 --> 07:33.753
>> THE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT

07:33.753 --> 07:34.688
THERE IS SOME INFORMATION THAT'S

07:34.688 --> 07:36.556
SHARED NOW ON CYBER SECURITY

07:36.556 --> 07:38.925
THREATS BUT NOT ENOUGH.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.493
THE IDEA OF THIS BILL WOULD BE

07:40.493 --> 07:42.062
TO MAKE IT SO THAT COMPANIES

07:42.062 --> 07:43.997
COULD SEND MORE THREAT

07:43.997 --> 07:44.764
INFORMATION TO THE GOVERNMENT

07:44.764 --> 07:46.700
WITHOUT FEAR OF LAWSUITS.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.735
IT HELPS THEM SOLVE THE PROBLEM

07:48.735 --> 07:50.770
OF WHERE THAT THREAT CAME FROM,

07:50.770 --> 07:52.372
AND, THEREFORE, THAT-- THE IDEA

07:52.372 --> 07:53.373
IS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS

07:53.373 --> 07:54.708
DIFFERENT KIND OF EXPERTISE THAN

07:54.708 --> 07:55.975
THE PRIVATE SECTOR, AND THE

07:55.975 --> 07:57.143
GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE ABLE TO HELP

07:57.143 --> 07:58.078
THEM BETTER THAN THEY ARE ABLE

07:58.078 --> 07:59.279
TO HELP THEMSELVES.

07:59.279 --> 08:00.780
>> Brangham: SO IS THE IDEA

08:00.780 --> 08:02.449
THAT A COMPANY EITHER GETS

08:02.449 --> 08:04.851
HACKED OR THINKS THEY'RE BEING

08:04.851 --> 08:07.454
PROBED BY HACKERS, AND THEY WANT

08:07.454 --> 08:08.922
TO THEN SHARE THAT WITH FELLOW

08:08.922 --> 08:09.956
COMPANIES OR THE GOVERNMENT BUT

08:09.956 --> 08:11.891
THEY DON'T WANT TO GET SUED FOR

08:11.891 --> 08:12.459
THAT.

08:12.459 --> 08:13.360
HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS THAT?

08:13.360 --> 08:14.728
ARE COMPANIES BEING SUED LEFT

08:14.728 --> 08:16.129
AND RIGHT FOR SHARING THIS KIND

08:16.129 --> 08:16.830
OF INFORMATION TODAY?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.164
>> NO, THEY'RE NOT, BUT THEY

08:18.164 --> 08:19.799
MIGHT BE, DEPENDING ON THE KIND

08:19.799 --> 08:21.067
OF INFORMATION THEY WOULD SHARE

08:21.067 --> 08:22.602
UNDER THIS BILL.

08:22.602 --> 08:24.270
CERTAINLY THE ISSUE OF

08:24.270 --> 08:24.904
BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS IS A

08:24.904 --> 08:26.306
DIFFERENT KIND OF THING.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.875
THAT'S RELATED TO TRADE

08:28.875 --> 08:29.476
PRACTICES, FOR INSTANCE.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.177
>> Brangham: SO SEVERAL TECH

08:31.177 --> 08:32.045
COMPANIES, APPLE AMONGST THEM,

08:32.045 --> 08:33.646
HAVE RAISED REAL CONCERNS ABOUT

08:33.646 --> 08:35.615
THIS, SAYING THAT THERE'S HUGE

08:35.615 --> 08:36.516
PRIVACY CONCERNS.

08:36.516 --> 08:37.650
YOU CAN EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT

08:37.650 --> 08:39.152
ABOUT WHAT IT IS THAT THEY DON'T

08:39.152 --> 08:39.786
LIKE ABOUT THIS.

08:39.786 --> 08:41.421
>> THERE ARE A NUMBER OF THESE

08:41.421 --> 08:42.589
BIG TECH COMPANIES THAT DO NOT

08:42.589 --> 08:43.656
LIKE THE BILL.

08:43.656 --> 08:44.591
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE WORRIED

08:44.591 --> 08:45.625
ABOUT THE PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS

08:45.625 --> 08:46.126
OF IT.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.460
IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE KIND OF

08:47.460 --> 08:49.162
INFORMATION THAT MIGHT BE SHARED

08:49.162 --> 08:51.231
THAT A COMPANY MIGHT HAVE ON A

08:51.231 --> 08:52.832
THREAT THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED OR

08:52.832 --> 08:54.801
THAT THEY'RE AWARE OF, THERE

08:54.801 --> 08:56.636
MIGHT BE SOME ELEMENTS OF THAT,

08:56.636 --> 08:58.204
THAT INCLUDE WHAT IS CALLED

08:58.204 --> 09:01.174
PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

09:01.174 --> 09:01.841
INFORMATION.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.343
THEY DON'T LIKE THE IDEA OF HOW

09:03.343 --> 09:04.711
MUCH OF THAT MIGHT GET SHARED

09:04.711 --> 09:05.378
UNDER THIS BILL.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.313
I THINK THEY COME AT IT FROM TWO

09:07.313 --> 09:08.281
PERSPECTIVES.

09:08.281 --> 09:11.418
ONE, SILICON VALLEY IS

09:11.418 --> 09:13.553
PHILOSOPHICALLY INCLINED TOWARD

09:13.553 --> 09:14.354
PRIVACY.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.522
AND THEY ARE STILL REELING A

09:15.522 --> 09:18.091
LITTLE BIT FROM WHAT HAPPENED

09:18.091 --> 09:19.225
AFTER EDWARD SNOWDEN'S

09:19.225 --> 09:20.527
REVELATIONS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF

09:20.527 --> 09:22.762
SOME OF THE TECH COMPANIES'

09:22.762 --> 09:26.933
COOPERATION WITH THE NSA.

09:26.933 --> 09:27.801
>> Brangham: SO WHAT IS THE

09:27.801 --> 09:29.169
CONCERN PEOPLE HAVE RAISED?

09:29.169 --> 09:30.537
THEY HAVE SAID IF YOU'RE GETTING

09:30.537 --> 09:31.371
HACKED AND YOU SHARE INFORMATION

09:31.371 --> 09:33.039
WITH THE GOVERNMENT, SOMEHOW

09:33.039 --> 09:34.307
YOU'RE GOING TO REVEAL SOMETHING

09:34.307 --> 09:36.276
ABOUT MY HEALTH INFORMATION, MY

09:36.276 --> 09:37.110
BANKING INFORMATION.

09:37.110 --> 09:38.645
IS THAT THE NATURE OF-- THAT'S

09:38.645 --> 09:39.312
THE CONCERN HERE?

09:39.312 --> 09:41.815
>> YES, THAT'S THE PRIVACY

09:41.815 --> 09:43.883
GROUPS, THEY SAY IT'S A VERY

09:43.883 --> 09:45.185
DANGEROUS BILL, AND INDUSTRY

09:45.185 --> 09:46.553
GROUPS SAY, NO, IF YOU LOOK AT

09:46.553 --> 09:49.155
WHAT THE CYBER THREAT INDICATORS

09:49.155 --> 09:51.291
ARE, THEY'RE SAVED GUARDS ABOUT

09:51.291 --> 09:52.525
MAKING SURE PERSONALLY

09:52.525 --> 09:53.193
IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS

09:53.193 --> 09:54.561
SCRUBBED AT SOME POINT AND THAT

09:54.561 --> 09:55.695
THE BULK OF THIS INFORMATION

09:55.695 --> 09:58.097
WILL BE INFORMATION THAT IS JUST

09:58.097 --> 09:59.799
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, ACTUAL LINES OF

09:59.799 --> 10:01.067
CODE IN SOME CASES.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.603
BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE-- THE

10:03.603 --> 10:05.104
PRIVACY GROUPS SAY CYBER THREAT

10:05.104 --> 10:06.673
INDICATORS ARE POORLY DEFINED IN

10:06.673 --> 10:11.244
THE BILL, NOT NARROWLY DEFINED

10:11.244 --> 10:11.911
ENOUGH.

10:11.911 --> 10:14.614
YOU THINK OF WHAT AN

10:14.614 --> 10:15.615
I.P. ADDRESS MIGHT REVEAL ABOUT

10:15.615 --> 10:16.282
YOU.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.684
IT MIGHT REVEAL YOUR SEXUALITY

10:17.684 --> 10:20.320
AND CERTAIN OTHER KIND OF

10:20.320 --> 10:21.154
INDICATORS THAT WOULD BE

10:21.154 --> 10:22.455
INCLUDED WITH GENDER OR OTHER

10:22.455 --> 10:23.957
SORTS OF INFORMATION THAT IS OF

10:23.957 --> 10:24.757
A PERSONAL NATURE.

10:24.757 --> 10:25.592
>> Brangham: ALL RIGHT, TIM

10:25.592 --> 10:26.493
STARKS OF POLITICO, THANK YOU

10:26.493 --> 10:27.594
VERY MUCH.

10:27.594 --> 10:28.761
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.171
