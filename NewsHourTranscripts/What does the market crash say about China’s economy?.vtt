GWEN IFILL: In just 29 minutes
today, China's
stock market plunged 7 percent,
and then was

00:07.708 --> 00:12.946 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shut down altogether for the
day. It's the
second time in just four days
the China markets

00:12.980 --> 00:18.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have crashed badly, sending
major ripples
around the world, including on
Wall Street,

00:18.652 --> 00:24.024 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where the Dow dropped nearly 400
points, and
continued a two-week slide.

00:24.057 --> 00:28.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look at what's behind the
great fall
in China with David Wessel,
director of the

00:28.629 --> 00:33.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hutchins Center on Fiscal and
Monetary Policy
at the Brookings Institution. He
is also a

00:33.934 --> 00:36.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contributing correspondent to
The Wall Street
Journal.

00:36.570 --> 00:41.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David, help us puzzle this out.
China's economy
or at least its markets are not
that big,

00:41.775 --> 00:43.210 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but the reverberations certainly
were.

00:43.243 --> 00:43.911 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL, The Wall Street
Journal: That's
right.

00:43.944 --> 00:45.012 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
China's economy is pretty big.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.880 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

00:46.914 --> 00:49.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: And I think the
one thing that's
going on here is that people are
saying, uh-oh,

00:49.950 --> 00:54.354 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Chinese economy might be
slowing more
than we thought and the
government is having

00:54.388 --> 00:56.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a hard time stimulating it
again.

00:56.657 --> 01:00.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's one thing. There's
worries about
that. But you're absolutely
right. China's

01:00.127 --> 01:05.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stock market is not very big.
And yet when
stock market has a bad day in
China, it seems,

01:05.732 --> 01:07.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Europe has a bad day and then we
have a bad
day.

01:07.801 --> 01:12.039 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: What's that
connection between
a 7 percent drop in China and a
400-point

01:12.072 --> 01:13.874 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
drop here?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: I think it's hard
to understand
in economics. It's easier to
understand on

01:16.243 --> 01:18.045 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
psychology.

01:18.078 --> 01:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a kind of panic or a sense
that the world
economy is just not in as good
shape as we

01:22.783 --> 01:25.052 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
thought and so everybody is
chasing everybody
else.

01:25.085 --> 01:29.056 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: And that is
something in which
this psychological panic is
always what drives

01:29.089 --> 01:31.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
markets, not necessarily
anything that makes
any other kind of economic
sense.

01:31.792 --> 01:33.660 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Absolutely.
Absolutely.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is the fact that --
people have
had a lot of confidence that the
Chinese leadership

01:36.630 --> 01:40.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could fix what is wrong with
their economy
so it wouldn't have ripple
effects around

01:40.400 --> 01:44.571 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the world. I think that
confidence is being
shaken by how difficult it is
for them to

01:44.604 --> 01:46.373 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
manage their stock market and
their currency.

01:46.406 --> 01:50.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Well, let's talk
about managing
the currency that was part of
the solution

01:50.744 --> 01:56.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
here, which is to let the
currency fall. But
that seems to be making it
worse?

01:56.149 --> 01:57.818 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID WESSEL: Right.

01:57.851 --> 02:01.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was seen as a symptom
that the
Chinese leadership may be really
scared about

02:01.521 --> 02:06.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
their economy. Why would they
want their currency
to fall? Well, the only reason
you would want

02:06.093 --> 02:10.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
your currency to fall, if you
could control
it, is in order to get more
exports. Why would

02:10.664 --> 02:15.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you want to depend more on
exports if you're
a country that has a stated
policy of relying

02:15.402 --> 02:19.439 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
less on exports and more on
consumer spending,
domestic spending?

02:19.473 --> 02:22.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They must be worried about
consumer spending
not being as strong as they had
thought.

02:22.309 --> 02:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: And then stopping
trading mid-trade,
that -- I remember when that
happened on Wall

02:26.680 --> 02:31.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Street here, and it sent
complete panic throughout
all the investors here.

02:31.084 --> 02:35.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: I think the
Chinese are really
amateurs when it comes to
running markets.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.157 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Ah.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: They don't really
believe in
markets. They like stability,
they like control.

02:39.793 --> 02:43.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So we have circuit-breakers here
and if the
stock market falls some, we take
a pause in

02:43.897 --> 02:49.236 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trading, but in the U.S., stocks
have to fall
20 percent before we shut down
trading for

02:49.269 --> 02:51.038 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the day.

02:51.071 --> 02:55.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Chinese shut down trading
after only 7
percent. And I think what they
put in as a

02:55.909 --> 03:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
way to make people collect their
wits, cool
down a little bit, has, instead,
accelerated

03:00.781 --> 03:03.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
panic. I wouldn't be at all
surprised if they
change the rules.

03:03.183 --> 03:07.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Do you expect that
there will
be continued volatility there as
well as here?

03:07.654 --> 03:11.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Well, nobody
really knows what
the market is going to do, but
it sure looks

03:11.458 --> 03:12.692 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
like we are going to have a lot
more volatility.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
GWEN IFILL: Yes.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: At some point,
people may decide
that the U.S. stock market has
fallen enough.

03:17.898 --> 03:22.436 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After all, the U.S. economy
seems to be getting
better, that what happens in
China is not

03:22.469 --> 03:27.674 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
going to have that devastating
effect on car
sales here or how many people
buy Apple phones

03:27.707 --> 03:31.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or what happens at -- how many
people shop
at Wal-Mart.

03:31.812 --> 03:36.383 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may be that the U.S. stock
market starts
to rise if people think it's
gone far enough.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: But you have alluded
to the fact
that people are worried that is
not what is

03:39.719 --> 03:43.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
happening with the Chinese
economy, that in
fact it may not be that
resilient.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Right. That's the
fear.

03:45.258 --> 03:49.863 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People have put a lot of faith
in the government's
ability to get growth going in
China. People

03:49.896 --> 03:53.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have this, what I think,
illusion that there
are six people in China who
really have their

03:53.900 --> 03:58.205 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hand on every button. And what
we're learning
is, it's a very big economy and
they're not

03:58.238 --> 03:59.973 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that good at it.

04:00.006 --> 04:04.010 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, people's confidence in their
leadership
has been shaken. If the
government can't get

04:04.044 --> 04:07.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the economy moving again, they
have a lot
of fundamental problems. They
may now show

04:07.881 --> 04:09.649 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
through.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.551 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: Is there a way to
draw a loop
between what's happening in
China's economy,

04:11.585 --> 04:15.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what is happening here, and what
is happening
with the depressed price of oil
around the

04:15.655 --> 04:16.456 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: Yes. Yes, there
is.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.361 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think oil prices are down for
two reasons.
One is, there is a lot of
supply. There is

04:21.394 --> 04:25.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a lot of supply because the U.S.
now produces
a lot of oil and there is a lot
of supply

04:25.465 --> 04:29.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because the Saudis seem to want
to produce
a lot of oil, maybe to punish
the Iranians

04:29.402 --> 04:31.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the Russians.

04:31.138 --> 04:34.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there is also a concern that
there is
a lack of demand of oil. And so
when commodity

04:34.774 --> 04:39.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prices fall, it's good if you
happen to be
a consumer, but it's sometimes
seen as symptom

04:39.179 --> 04:44.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of a weakening economy. So I
think that exacerbates
the feel that maybe China is
slowing down.

04:44.751 --> 04:48.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That means it will be buying
less from Africa
and Latin America. That means
Procter &amp; Gamble

04:48.822 --> 04:53.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Coca-Cola will sell less in
Latin America
and Africa. And so it is
definitely related.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.128 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
GWEN IFILL: Fascinating.

04:55.162 --> 04:57.297 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David Wessel, thanks, as usual,
for clearing
it all up for us.

04:57.330 --> 04:57.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAVID WESSEL: You're welcome.
