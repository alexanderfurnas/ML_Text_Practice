[GWEN IFILL] TONIGHT'S SPEECH
COMES IN THE WAKE OF WHAT
OFFICIALS

00:43.577 --> 00:48.448 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAVE DECLARED A TERRORIST ATTACK
IN SAN BERNARDINO, CALIFORNIA
THAT LEFT 14 DEAD AND 21 OTHERS

00:48.448 --> 00:49.683 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
WOUNDED.

00:49.683 --> 00:53.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
THE INVESTIGATION... HAS
SPREAD TO PAKISTAN AND

00:53.153 --> 00:57.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SAUDI ARABIA... IN SEARCH OF
LINKS BETWEEN THE MARRIED COUPLE
WHO CARRIED OUT THE SHOOTING

00:57.991 --> 01:03.697 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- SYED FAROOK AND TASHFEEN
MALIK -- AND I-S-I-S OR ANOTHER
GLOBAL JIHADIST GROUP.

01:03.697 --> 01:07.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE THE COUPLE
-- PARENTS OF A SIX MONTH OLD --
MAY HAVE HAD OTHER ATTACKS

01:07.768 --> 01:13.273 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PLANNED, GIVEN THE ARSENAL OF
PIPE BOMBS AND AMMUNITION
DISCOVERED AT THEIR HOME..

01:13.273 --> 01:16.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
YESTERDAY, THE F-B-I RAIDED THE
HOME OF A FORMER NEIGHBOR
SUSPECTED OF BUYING THE RIFLES

01:16.944 --> 01:19.646 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
USED IN THE ASSAULT.

01:19.646 --> 01:23.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
IT WAS THE DEADLIST ACT OF
TERRORISM ON U-S SOIL SINCE

01:23.450 --> 01:26.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
9-11... (AND A REMINDER THAT
ORGANIZATIONS LIKE ISIS

01:26.720 --> 01:31.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAY INSPIRE ATTACKS HERE,
AS WELL AS DIRECT THEM.)

01:31.858 --> 01:36.663 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AND NOW TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.

01:36.663 --> 01:41.635 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Good evening. On Wednesday, 14
Americans were killed as they
came together to celebrate

01:41.635 --> 01:47.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the holidays. They were taken
from family and friends who
loved them deeply. They were

01:47.341 --> 01:55.182 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
white and black, Latino and
Asian, immigrants, and American
born, moms and dads, daughters

01:55.182 --> 01:59.720 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and sons. Each of them served
their fellow citizens. All of
them were part of our American

01:59.720 --> 02:03.490 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
family.

02:03.490 --> 02:08.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight I want to talk with you
about this tragedy, the broader
threat of terrorism and

02:08.462 --> 02:14.468 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how we can keep our country
safe. The FBI is still gathering
the facts about what happened

02:14.468 --> 02:19.840 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in San Bernardino, but here's
what we know. The victims were
brutally murdered and injured

02:19.840 --> 02:25.379 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by one of their co-workers and
his wife. So far, we have no
evidence that the killers

02:25.379 --> 02:29.783 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were directed by a terrorist
organization overseas or that
they were part of a broader

02:29.783 --> 02:36.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conspiracy here at home. But it
is clear that the two of them
had gone down the dark path

02:36.423 --> 02:42.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of radicalization, embracing a
perverted interpretation of
Islam that calls for war against
America

02:42.229 --> 02:48.535 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the West. They had
stockpiled assault weapons,
ammunition, and pipe bombs.

02:48.535 --> 02:55.609 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this was an act of terrorism
designed to kill innocent
people. Our nation has been

02:55.609 --> 03:02.649 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at war with terrorists since Al
Qaeda killed nearly 3,000
Americans on 9/11. In the
process,

03:02.649 --> 03:09.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we've hardened our defenses,
from airports, to financial
centers, to other critical
infrastructure.

03:09.222 --> 03:13.560 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Intelligence and law enforcement
agencies have disrupted
countless plots here and
overseas

03:13.560 --> 03:18.331 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and worked around the
clock to keep us safe.

03:18.331 --> 03:22.702 align:left position:25%,start line:73.33% size:75%
Our military and
counterterrorism professionals
have relentlessly pursued
terrorist networks

03:22.702 --> 03:28.375 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
overseas, disrupting safe havens
in several different countries,
killing Osama Bin Laden,

03:28.375 --> 03:31.745 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and decimating Al
Qaeda's leadership.

03:31.745 --> 03:39.186 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Over the last few years,
however, the terrorist threat
has evolved into a new phase. As
we've

03:39.186 --> 03:45.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
become better at preventing
complex multifaceted attacks
like 9/11, terrorists turn to
less

03:45.926 --> 03:51.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
complicated acts of violence
like the mass shootings that are
all too common in our society.

03:51.665 --> 03:57.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is this type of attack that
we saw at Fort Hood in 2009, in
Chattanooga earlier this

03:57.270 --> 04:02.242 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
year, and now in San Bernardino.

04:02.242 --> 04:08.582 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And as groups like ISIL grew
stronger amidst the chaos of war
in Iraq and then Syria, and

04:08.582 --> 04:13.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as the Internet erases the
distance between countries, we
see growing efforts by
terrorists

04:13.887 --> 04:21.761 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to poison the minds of people
like the Boston Marathon bombers
and the San Bernardino killers.

04:21.761 --> 04:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For seven years, I've confronted
this evolving threat each and
every morning in my intelligence

04:27.100 --> 04:33.106 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
briefing, and since the day I
took this office, I have
authorized U.S. forces to take
out

04:33.106 --> 04:38.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
terrorists abroad precisely
because I know how real the
danger is.

04:38.912 --> 04:44.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As commander in chief, I have no
greater responsibility than the
security of the American people.

04:44.117 --> 04:49.890 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
As a father to two young
daughters who are the most
precious part of my life, I know

04:49.890 --> 04:54.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we see ourselves with
friends and co-workers at a
holiday party like the one in
San Bernardino.

04:54.127 --> 04:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know we see our kids in the
faces of the young people killed
in Paris.

04:59.733 --> 05:04.437 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know that after so much
war, many Americans are asking
whether we are confronted by a

05:04.437 --> 05:08.642 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cancer that has no
immediate cure.

05:08.642 --> 05:14.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
OBAMA: Well, here's what I want
you to know. The threat from
terrorism is real, but we

05:14.981 --> 05:20.954 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will overcome it. We will
destroy ISIL and any other
organization that tries to harm

05:20.954 --> 05:28.495 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
us. Our success won't depend on
tough talk, or abandoning our
values or giving into fear.

05:28.495 --> 05:34.568 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what groups like ISIL are
hoping for. Instead, we will
prevail by being strong and

05:34.568 --> 05:43.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
smart, resilient and relentless.
And by drawing upon every aspect
of American power.

05:43.176 --> 05:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here's how. First, our military
will continue to hunt down
terrorist plotters in any
country

05:50.517 --> 05:56.523 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where it is necessary. In Iraq
and Syria, air strikes are
taking out ISIL leaders, heavy

05:56.523 --> 06:00.460 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
weapons, oil tankers,
infrastructure.

06:00.460 --> 06:05.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And since attacks in Paris, our
closest allies, including
France, Germany, and the United

06:05.065 --> 06:08.868 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kingdom, have ramped up their
contributions to our military
campaign which will help us

06:08.868 --> 06:13.607 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
accelerate our effort
to destroy ISIL.

06:13.607 --> 06:18.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, we will continue to
provide training and equipment
to tens of thousands of Iraqi

06:18.712 --> 06:24.718 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Syrian forces fighting ISIL
on the ground so that we take
away their safe havens.

06:24.718 --> 06:28.622 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In both countries, we're
deploying special operations
forces who can accelerate that

06:28.622 --> 06:32.926 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offensive. We've stepped up this
effort since the attacks in
Paris, and will continue to

06:32.926 --> 06:37.964 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
invest more in approaches that
are working on the ground.

06:37.964 --> 06:44.237 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Third, we're working with
friends and allies to stop
ISIL's operations, to disrupt
plots,

06:44.237 --> 06:49.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cut off their financing, and
prevent them from recruiting
more fighters.

06:49.075 --> 06:53.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Since the attacks in Paris,
we've surged merged intelligence
sharing with our European
allies.

06:53.146 --> 06:58.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're working with Turkey to
seal its border with Syria, and
we are cooperating with Muslim

06:58.952 --> 07:03.723 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
majority countries, and with our
Muslim communities here at home,
to counter the vicious ideology

07:03.723 --> 07:08.128 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that ISIL promotes online.

07:08.128 --> 07:15.602 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Fourth, with American
leadership, the international
community has begun to establish
a process

07:15.602 --> 07:22.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and timeline to pursue
cease-fires and a political
resolution to the Syrian war.

07:22.142 --> 07:26.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Doing so will allow the Syrian
people and every country,
including our allies, but also

07:26.680 --> 07:31.117 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
countries like Russia, to focus
on the common goal of destroying
ISIL, a group that threatens

07:31.117 --> 07:35.322 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us all.

07:35.322 --> 07:41.227 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is our strategy to destroy
ISIL. It is designed and
supported by our military
commanders

07:41.227 --> 07:48.034 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and counterterrorism experts,
together with 65 countries that
have joined an American-led

07:48.034 --> 07:51.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
coalition. And we constantly
examine our strategy to
determine when additional steps
are needed

07:51.738 --> 07:55.008 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to get the job done.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why I've ordered the
Departments of State and
Homeland Security to review the

07:58.545 --> 08:03.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
visa waiver program under which
the female terrorist in San
Bernardino originally came

08:03.817 --> 08:08.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to this country. And that's why
I will urge high-tech and law
enforcement leaders to make

08:08.722 --> 08:14.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it harder for terrorists to use
technology to escape from
justice.

08:14.828 --> 08:21.768 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, here at home, we have to
work together to address the
challenge. There are several

08:21.768 --> 08:26.806 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
steps that Congress should take
right away. To begin with,
Congress should act to make

08:26.806 --> 08:33.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
sure no one on a no- fly list is
able to buy a gun. What could
possibly be the argument

08:33.847 --> 08:37.817 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for allowing a terrorist suspect
to buy a semiautomatic weapon?
This is a matter of

08:37.817 --> 08:41.888 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
national security.

08:41.888 --> 08:46.126 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also need to make it harder
for people to buy powerful
assault weapons, like the

08:46.126 --> 08:51.698 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ones that were used in San
Bernardino. I know there are
some who reject any gun-safety
measures,

08:51.698 --> 08:57.003 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but the fact is that our
intelligence and law-enforcement
agencies, no matter how
effective

08:57.003 --> 09:02.142 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are, cannot identify every
would-be mass shooter, whether
that individual was motivated

09:02.142 --> 09:06.413 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
by ISIL or some other
hateful ideology.

09:06.413 --> 09:13.186 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What we can do, and must do, is
make it harder for them to kill.

09:13.186 --> 09:19.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Next, we should put in place
stronger screening for those who
come to America without a visa

09:19.325 --> 09:23.363 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
so that we can take a hard look
at whether they've traveled to
war zones. And we're working

09:23.363 --> 09:27.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with members of both parties in
Congress to do exactly that.

09:27.767 --> 09:34.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Finally, if Congress believes,
as I do, that we are at war with
ISIL, it should go ahead

09:34.240 --> 09:40.280 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and vote to authorize the
continued use of military force
against these terrorists.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.851 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For over a year, I have ordered
our military to take thousands
of air strikes against ISIL

09:44.851 --> 09:48.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
targets. I think it's time for
Congress to vote to demonstrate
that the American people

09:48.354 --> 09:54.761 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
are united and committed
to this fight.

09:54.761 --> 09:57.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My fellow Americans, these are
the steps that we can take
together to defeat the terrorist

09:57.964 --> 10:01.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
threat.

10:01.000 --> 10:08.174 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let me now say a word about what
we should not do. We should not
be drawn once more into

10:08.174 --> 10:16.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a long and costly ground war in
Iraq or Syria. That's what
groups like ISIL want. They know

10:16.349 --> 10:21.221 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they can't defeat us on the
battlefield. ISIL fighters were
part of the insurgency that

10:21.221 --> 10:26.659 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we faced in Iraq. But they also
know that if we occupy foreign
lands, they can maintain

10:26.659 --> 10:31.397 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insurgencies for years, killing
thousands of our troops and
draining our resources,

10:31.397 --> 10:36.903 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and using our presence
to draw new recruits.

10:36.903 --> 10:42.175 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The strategy that we are using
now -- air strikes, special
forces, and working with

10:42.175 --> 10:47.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
local forces who are fighting to
regain control of their own
country -- that is how we'll

10:47.647 --> 10:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
achieve a more sustainable
victory, and it won't require us
sending a new generation

10:53.219 --> 11:00.393 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of Americans overseas to fight
and die for another decade on
foreign soil.

11:00.393 --> 11:06.332 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Here's what else we cannot do.
We cannot turn against one
another by letting this fight

11:06.332 --> 11:15.675 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be defined as a war between
America and Islam. That, too, is
what groups like ISIL want.

11:15.675 --> 11:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ISIL does not speak for Islam.
They are thugs and killers, part
of a cult of death. And

11:22.882 --> 11:29.155 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they account for a tiny fraction
of a more than a billion Muslims
around the world, including

11:29.155 --> 11:34.060 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
millions of patriotic
Muslim-Americans who reject
their hateful ideology.

11:34.060 --> 11:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Moreover, the vast majority of
terrorist victims around the
world are Muslim.

11:40.533 --> 11:45.939 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we're to succeed in defeating
terrorism, we must enlist Muslim
communities as some

11:45.939 --> 11:53.913 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of our strongest allies, rather
than push them away through
suspicion and hate.

11:53.913 --> 11:58.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That does not mean denying the
fact that an extremist ideology
has spread within some

11:58.051 --> 12:05.358 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Muslim communities. It's a real
problem that Muslims must
confront without excuse.

12:05.358 --> 12:10.430 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Muslim leaders here and around
the globe have to continue
working with us to decisively

12:10.430 --> 12:16.536 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and unequivocally reject the
hateful ideology that groups
like ISIL and Al Qaeda promote,

12:16.536 --> 12:21.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to speak out against not just
acts of violence, but also those
interpretations of Islam that

12:21.908 --> 12:29.515 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are incompatible with the values
of religious tolerance, mutual
respect, and human dignity.

12:29.515 --> 12:34.454 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But just as it is the
responsibility of Muslims around
the world to root out misguided
ideas

12:34.454 --> 12:41.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that lead to radicalization, it
is the responsibility of all
Americans, of every faith, to
reject

12:41.461 --> 12:48.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
discrimination. It is our
responsibility to reject
religious tests on who we admit
into

12:48.001 --> 12:53.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
this country. It's our
responsibility to reject
proposals that Muslim-Americans
should somehow

12:53.439 --> 13:01.848 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be treated differently. Because
when we travel down that road,
we lose. That kind of
divisiveness,

13:01.848 --> 13:08.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that betrayal of our values
plays into the hands of groups
like ISIL.

13:08.354 --> 13:17.463 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Muslim-Americans are our friends
and our neighbors, our co-
workers, our sports heroes. And,
yes,

13:17.463 --> 13:22.735 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they are our men and women in
uniform who are willing to die
in defense of our country.

13:22.735 --> 13:27.540 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have to remember that.

13:27.540 --> 13:32.912 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
My fellow Americans, I am
confident we will succeed in
this mission because we are on

13:32.912 --> 13:40.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the right side of history. We
were founded upon a belief in
human dignity that no matter

13:40.086 --> 13:45.224 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who you are, or where you come
from, or what you look like or
what religion you practice,

13:45.224 --> 13:51.998 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you are equal in the eyes of God
and equal in the eyes of the
law. Even in this political

13:51.998 --> 13:57.370 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
season, even as we properly
debate what steps I and future
presidents must take to keep

13:57.370 --> 14:05.144 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our country safe. Let's make
sure we never forget what makes
us exceptional. Let's not

14:05.144 --> 14:12.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
forget that freedom is more
powerful than fear. That we have
always met challenges,

14:12.051 --> 14:18.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
whether war or depression,
natural disasters or terrorist
attacks, by coming together
around

14:18.291 --> 14:24.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our common ideals as one
nation and one people.

14:24.430 --> 14:31.971 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So long as we stay true to that
tradition, I have no doubt that
America will prevail.

14:31.971 --> 14:36.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thank you. God bless you. And
may God bless the United States
of America.

14:36.909 --> 14:42.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
[Gwen Ifill] That was president
Obama speaking from the oval
office, on the defensive from

14:42.548 --> 14:47.153 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the oval. Speaking to fear and
striving for balance. He
stressed America's commitment

14:47.153 --> 14:52.091 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to fight ISIS. Steps the
govenrment is taking at home and
abroad to keep the country safe.

14:52.091 --> 14:55.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He called on the American Muslim
community to work closely with
law enforcement to root

14:55.461 --> 14:59.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out radicalism. And he asked
Congress to pass legislation to
ensure individuals on the no

14:59.031 --> 15:01.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
fly list can't buy guns.

15:01.667 --> 15:06.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
[Judy Woodruff] I was struck
when the president said we will
destroy the Islamic State. He

15:06.672 --> 15:11.444 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said we will prevail by being
strong and smart. He talked as
you suggested about taking the

15:11.444 --> 15:16.682 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fight to where they are in Syria
and Iraq, but he also talked
about steps the United

15:16.682 --> 15:22.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
States to take to keep
individuals in this country from
becoming radicalized. And I
think

15:22.021 --> 15:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
notably there at the end he
called on the Muslim American
community to, on its own,

15:27.460 --> 15:31.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look for radicals in its midst,
but as you heard and say at the
end, Muslim Americans

15:31.964 --> 15:35.535 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are our friends and neighbors.
They're not people for us to
fear.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
[Gwen Ifill] More like George W.
Bush than like the Presidential
candidates running now.

15:38.070 --> 15:40.106 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
[Judy Woodruff] Exactly.

15:40.106 --> 15:44.443 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
[GWEN IFILL] AND THAT CONCLUDES
