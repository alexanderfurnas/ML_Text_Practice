GWEN IFILL: Call it the great
fall. An explosive
new sell-off hit the Chinese
market today,

00:06.173 --> 00:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and routed stocks around the
world. On Wall
Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average lost

00:11.879 --> 00:21.355 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
392 points to close at 16514.
The Nasdaq fell
146 points, and the S&amp;P 500
dropped 47. We

00:21.388 --> 00:25.726 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will look at what's going on in
China right
after the news summary.

00:25.759 --> 00:30.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the day's other news, a
powerful truck
bomb in Libya killed at least 47
people and

00:30.998 --> 00:37.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
wounded more than 100 others.
The target was
a police training center outside
Tripoli,

00:37.037 --> 00:42.676 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where hundreds of recruits had
gathered. Cars
lay crushed and strewn around
the area after

00:42.709 --> 00:48.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the blast. It was the country's
worst bombing
since the fall of Moammar
Gadhafi in 2011

00:48.649 --> 00:50.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it was quickly condemned.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MOHAMMAD ISMAIL, Government of
National Salvation
(through translator): We confirm
that we are

00:53.854 --> 00:58.692 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
totally committed to carrying
out a full investigation
and following developments and
updates and

00:58.725 --> 01:02.296 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
providing full disclosure that
deals with
this cowardly terrorist act.

01:02.329 --> 01:07.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The government based
in Tripoli
is an Islamist regime. A rival
government

01:07.734 --> 01:12.339 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
operates in Eastern Libya, along
with various
armed factions.

01:12.372 --> 01:18.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Yemen, dozens of Saudi
airstrikes hit the
capital city in the heaviest
bombardment yet.

01:18.211 --> 01:23.317 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Saudis and other Sunni Arab
states are
supporting Yemen's president
against Shiite

01:23.350 --> 01:29.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
rebels. Today's attacks hit the
presidential
palace in Sanaa and a rebel
military base.

01:29.289 --> 01:35.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, loyalist forces also
landed at
a key port overnight, opening a
new front.

01:35.295 --> 01:40.701 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Iran claimed its embassy in
Sanaa was hit
by the airstrikes, but there was
no visible

01:40.734 --> 01:42.569 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
damage.

01:42.602 --> 01:48.041 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Paris spent a tense anniversary
today, one
year since Islamist gunmen
attacked the satirical

01:48.075 --> 01:53.647 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
newspaper Charlie Hebdo, killing
11 people.
The city was already on edge
when an apparent

01:53.680 --> 01:59.353 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
suicide bomber, with a note
referencing the
Islamic State group, confronted
police.

01:59.386 --> 02:02.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alex Thomson of Independent
Television News
reports from Paris.

02:02.856 --> 02:07.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: It's around midday
in the Gare
du Nord in Central Paris, and a
young man

02:07.361 --> 02:12.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
carrying a butchers hatchet,
shouting Allahu
akbar and wearing what looks
like an explosive

02:12.933 --> 02:15.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
belt approaches a small police
station.

02:15.569 --> 02:21.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
heard gunshots,
four, I think. It's just across
the street

02:21.174 --> 02:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
from the school, next to the
police station,
where there's a kindergarten.

02:23.944 --> 02:29.416 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
Usually, I see
this on the television. And it's
true, it's

02:29.449 --> 02:31.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shocking to see this unfolding
live.

02:31.418 --> 02:36.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: It's a busy area.
People quickly
surrounded the body before it
was eventually

02:36.757 --> 02:43.196 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stretchered away, but only after
a remote
controlled approach to what was
initially

02:43.230 --> 02:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
assumed to be a real suicide
belt device.

02:47.034 --> 02:51.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We may well never know what this
man's motivations
were, nor if he had any real
connection with

02:51.972 --> 02:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I.S., or Da'esh, but after the
events in recent
months, not just in Paris, but
across Europe,

02:57.611 --> 03:02.215 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
anybody approaching armed
officers with a
butcher's hatchet, apparent
signs of an explosive

03:02.249 --> 03:07.354 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
device, and shouting allahu
Akbar, is signing
their own death warrant.

03:07.387 --> 03:13.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All of this a year to the day
from the massacre
across town at the satirical
magazine Charlie

03:13.193 --> 03:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hebdo -- the journalists killed
there remembered
today. And whether this man
actually had any

03:20.801 --> 03:26.807 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
connection to I.S., the
president of France
spoke today as if the incident
had been masterminded

03:26.840 --> 03:28.642 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Raqqa.

03:28.675 --> 03:33.280 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
FRANCOIS HOLLANDE, French
President (through
translator): Inside France, we
are tackling

03:33.313 --> 03:37.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it by hunting down terrorists,
dismantling
networks, drying up sources of
financing,

03:37.818 --> 03:40.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and by blocking the propaganda
of radicalization.

03:40.754 --> 03:47.194 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEX THOMSON: Later in the day,
the interior
minister, Bernard Cazeneuve,
visited the scene,

03:47.227 --> 03:52.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
expressing solidarity with
police officers.
Paris remains understandably
edgy, and today's

03:52.432 --> 03:54.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
incident merely underscores
that.

03:54.868 --> 04:00.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GWEN IFILL: The Charlie Hebdo
killings last
January were followed by the
attacks in November

04:00.107 --> 04:03.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that claimed another 130 lives.

04:03.510 --> 04:08.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South Korea is firing up its
cross-border
propaganda broadcasts against
the North again.

04:08.849 --> 04:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today's announcement came a day
after North
Korea tested what it said was a
hydrogen bomb.

04:13.787 --> 04:19.359 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The South's earlier broadcasts
ended in August
in a bid to ease tensions with
the communist

04:19.392 --> 04:25.132 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North. They're due to resume
tomorrow, the
birthday of North Korean leader
Kim Jong-un.

04:25.165 --> 04:29.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Back in this country, there's
word that efforts
to extend health insurance
coverage to all

04:29.369 --> 04:35.842 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans stalled in 2015. A
closely watched
survey out today finds nearly 12
percent of

04:35.876 --> 04:40.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S. adults still lacked health
coverage at
the end of the year. The
Gallup-Healthways

04:40.714 --> 04:46.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well-Being Index says that was
virtually unchanged
from 12 months earlier.

04:46.953 --> 04:52.292 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And 2015 officially goes down as
the second
warmest year in the United
States since they

04:52.325 --> 04:58.365 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
started keeping records 121
years ago. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration

04:58.398 --> 05:04.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
reports the average temperature
was 54.4 degrees.
That's about one degree shy of
the record,

05:04.771 --> 05:06.506 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
set in 2012.
