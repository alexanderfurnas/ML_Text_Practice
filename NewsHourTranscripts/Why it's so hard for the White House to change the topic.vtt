JUDY WOODRUFF: And to continue
our politics conversation,
we're joined now by Tamara Keith

00:04.600 --> 00:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of NPR and Stu Rothenberg,
senior editor at
Inside Elections.

00:09.400 --> 00:10.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you both.

00:10.900 --> 00:13.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's good to have you.

00:13.033 --> 00:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, Tam, you just heard Chris
Ruddy, who does talk to people
in the White House -- he said

00:16.166 --> 00:21.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he talked to the president on
Friday -- say that he thinks
the president is considering

00:22.033 --> 00:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
terminating Robert Mueller.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that something
we were aware of?

00:25.333 --> 00:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH, National Public
Radio: Certainly, there has
been stuff around on Twitter of

00:29.333 --> 00:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
other Republicans raising
questions about Mueller.

00:32.400 --> 00:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the way that Ruddy just
couched that, he made it
clear that -- and maybe he was

00:39.300 --> 00:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
protecting himself and the
president, but he made it clear
that he was basing that on

00:41.366 --> 00:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something that one of the
president's lawyers had
said on TV over the weekend.

00:48.033 --> 00:51.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other thing that stood out
to me is talking about Robert
Mueller having had a meeting

00:53.100 --> 00:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at the White House, having met
with the president, possibly to
take the job of FBI director,

00:59.000 --> 01:01.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is a job he
had held before.

01:01.533 --> 01:06.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NPR and Carrie Johnson,
my colleague at NPR,
had been reporting that
Mueller had met with

01:07.933 --> 01:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Justice Department officials
and also White House officials.

01:09.933 --> 01:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the idea that he also met
with the president himself
is new, to me at least.

01:14.333 --> 01:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu
Rothenberg, this is --
these are -- the story
just keep bubbling up about

01:21.833 --> 01:26.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Mr. Mueller, Mr. Comey,
the president, the
Russia investigation.

01:26.533 --> 01:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a White House that,
this week, is trying to get
-- clearly get away from this.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG,
Inside Elections: Right.

01:32.466 --> 01:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: They have labeled
it Workforce Development Week.

01:36.400 --> 01:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What -- can they have -- can
they make any progress in
changing direction when you have

01:42.900 --> 01:43.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this kind of
conversation going on?

01:43.900 --> 01:46.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Right.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's a great idea
that they should try to change
the discussion and narrative.

01:47.766 --> 01:51.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, in this case, as
you point out, there's
too much is going on.

01:51.733 --> 01:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
During Workforce Development
Week, tomorrow, we have the
Sessions testimony on the Hill.

01:56.633 --> 02:01.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have two attorneys general,
one from D.C., one from
Maryland, announced that they're

02:01.333 --> 02:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to sue the president
over the Emoluments Clause.

02:05.200 --> 02:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We had today the Ninth Circuit
Court issuing an opinion
upholding the travel ban.

02:12.166 --> 02:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's as if the president has
already kind of broken so
many bottles and glasses that

02:18.866 --> 02:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there is glass strewn on the
floor and any step he takes,
he's going to crunch something.

02:24.866 --> 02:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think it would be a
wonderful idea for the White
House to change the subject, but

02:26.966 --> 02:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you can see what happened
in the last 24 hours.

02:28.633 --> 02:30.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, Tam,
they're still trying.

02:30.366 --> 02:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Last week, it was
infrastructure week.

02:31.733 --> 02:32.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: And
that was not...

02:32.733 --> 02:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Mr. Comey.

02:33.733 --> 02:34.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Yes.

02:34.733 --> 02:36.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:36.233 --> 02:37.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And Mr. Comey
week is actually what it was.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so the president
is flying tomorrow.

02:40.033 --> 02:44.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to Waukesha,
Wisconsin, to tour a
technical college and talk
about apprenticeships.

02:46.033 --> 02:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On a slow news day, any other
president, that might sort of
be a headline, but it certainly

02:52.066 --> 02:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
wouldn't be a
front-page headline.

02:54.400 --> 02:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're trying to distract
some very big headlines, going
to a technical college isn't

03:00.233 --> 03:01.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
necessarily the answer.

03:01.033 --> 03:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the other thing.

03:03.033 --> 03:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been trying to press
the White House to find out
what policy change the president

03:05.966 --> 03:10.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
actually envisions or
they say that they want
more private-to-private
partnerships, to do

03:11.700 --> 03:13.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
more apprenticeships.

03:13.166 --> 03:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Around this
work force development, right.

03:14.666 --> 03:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Exactly, around
this work force development.

03:16.766 --> 03:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then they're saying, well,
you will have to wait until
Wednesday to find out exactly

03:19.200 --> 03:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what we're talking about.

03:21.233 --> 03:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's a long time to
wait and it's a long time to
expect people to pay attention

03:25.033 --> 03:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to something that is not related
to the biggest news of the day.

03:28.400 --> 03:29.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG:
Two other points.

03:29.766 --> 03:32.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
One is, are there tapes?

03:32.700 --> 03:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That hasn't been answered,
so, every day, reporters
are going to ask that.

03:35.400 --> 03:38.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the other thing
was, I think Chris Ruddy
made some news today.

03:38.766 --> 03:42.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He said the president is
considering the firing
of the special counsel.

03:42.733 --> 03:45.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Isn't that the next
week's discussion now?

03:45.566 --> 03:47.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, it's hard for me
to believe that...

03:47.700 --> 03:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, and we
couldn't tell - - as Tamara
was saying, we couldn't tell

03:50.000 --> 03:54.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
if he was just referring to
what one of the president's
lawyers is saying, but the fact

03:54.800 --> 03:56.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that he said it has...

03:56.333 --> 03:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And the way
he said it, yes, absolutely.

03:57.566 --> 03:58.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: .. has
to make us wonder.

03:58.866 --> 04:01.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Stunning.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as you
mentioned, Stu, you have got
the travel ban decision today

04:04.200 --> 04:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
by the federal court.

04:05.433 --> 04:08.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There doesn't seem
to be good news.

04:08.400 --> 04:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, health care reform
seems to be, at least for the
time being, slogged, stopped

04:14.733 --> 04:15.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
up.

04:15.933 --> 04:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Stopped up, is that
the word in the Senate?

04:16.866 --> 04:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There is nothing happening yet.

04:18.366 --> 04:19.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe it will happen.

04:19.666 --> 04:23.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We haven't seen a
tax reform plan.

04:23.033 --> 04:26.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Are we just going to
watch the news develop
every week like this?

04:26.400 --> 04:27.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And...

04:27.633 --> 04:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUART ROTHENBERG:
Yes, I think so.

04:29.333 --> 04:31.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So, there is a problem
for the White House
on a number of levels.

04:31.033 --> 04:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The president wants to
change the narrative.

04:32.933 --> 04:34.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He also wants to
accomplish things.

04:34.700 --> 04:35.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He hasn't yet.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Maybe he will.

04:37.666 --> 04:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But one of the things I believed
for many weeks and months is
that he has to worry about

04:42.866 --> 04:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the fatigue factor on
the American public.

04:44.933 --> 04:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I remember thinking back to
Bill Clinton and all the drama
in the Clinton White House.

04:48.433 --> 04:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And after a while,
people thought, ay yi yi,
another thing we have.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Oy gevalt, as we say.

04:54.733 --> 04:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is the same kind of thing.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's -- there is another
crisis every day.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And after a while, people
just -- they don't want that.

05:02.966 --> 05:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want things to
return to normal.

05:05.066 --> 05:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Donald Trump's -- the
whole premise of Donald
Trump is upsetting normal.

05:08.800 --> 05:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, you can only do that if
you accomplish certain things
and people start to feel better

05:13.633 --> 05:15.566 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
about themselves
and the country.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How much do
they recognize this at the
White House, do you think, Tam?

05:17.966 --> 05:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Well, they're
obviously trying to correct it.

05:20.800 --> 05:25.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're trying to do things that
normal presidents do, like hold
a Cabinet meeting, as they did

05:27.733 --> 05:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today, though it turned into
somewhat unusual session of
every Cabinet head praising the

05:33.600 --> 05:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president in very effusive
ways that is sort of beyond
what would be normal for one of

05:40.033 --> 05:42.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
these types of events, one
of these types of photo-ops.

05:42.066 --> 05:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to turn
you to something - - because
we do pay attention to parts of

05:45.300 --> 05:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the country, Stu, outside
of Washington occasionally.

05:48.566 --> 05:51.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But there are a couple
of elections coming up.

05:51.366 --> 05:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tomorrow in Virginia,
there's a primary as they
choose their governor.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Right.

05:56.300 --> 06:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A week from
tomorrow, there's a much-watched
vote to choose the next member

06:01.733 --> 06:03.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of Congress from the 6th
District in Atlanta, Georgia.

06:03.666 --> 06:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Yes,
and I think that special
election is a really big deal.

06:05.033 --> 06:06.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I think
Democrats have been hoping...

06:07.433 --> 06:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Georgia.

06:08.933 --> 06:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: In Georgia,
right, the Georgia 6th special.

06:09.733 --> 06:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

06:11.833 --> 06:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Democrats
have been hoping for a victory
to take off over a Republican

06:14.200 --> 06:15.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
seat.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This one was very close.

06:16.433 --> 06:19.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Donald Trump won it by
a point in November.

06:19.066 --> 06:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the Democrats feel like they
have a great opportunity here.

06:22.100 --> 06:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if they do, then we will
have another news story, another
data point that the White

06:26.500 --> 06:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
House will have to respond to.

06:28.966 --> 06:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
If the Democrats lose,
I think, after losing
in Kansas and Montana --
and, yes, the Democrats

06:35.966 --> 06:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kind of exceeded expectations
-- but losing in the Georgia
seat, there will be a sense

06:38.933 --> 06:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of just, are the voters really
turning on Donald Trump or not?

06:43.233 --> 06:44.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I think it's a big
deal for both parties.

06:44.900 --> 06:46.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is the White
House watching that one?

06:46.366 --> 06:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Oh, absolutely
they're watching it.

06:48.433 --> 06:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And just today, President
Trump was saying, look, we did
well in Kansas, we did well in

06:53.000 --> 06:56.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Montana, Democrats think they
have something going on, but,
no, they don't, look at what

06:56.900 --> 06:58.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we have done.

06:58.433 --> 07:01.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, the president himself
is watching this closely.

07:01.066 --> 07:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And he
said complimentary things
about Karen Handel, the
Republican candidate.

07:07.266 --> 07:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think
he would take it as a
personal loss if she loses.

07:12.133 --> 07:13.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Because -- is it, Stu?

07:13.066 --> 07:13.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: It would be.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It would be.

07:15.366 --> 07:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: A statement
about Donald Trump?

07:16.533 --> 07:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Oh, yes.

07:18.566 --> 07:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Neither Karen Handel, the
Democrat -- the Republican,
nor Jon Ossoff, the Democrat,

07:21.866 --> 07:22.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are perfect candidates.

07:22.933 --> 07:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have raised a lot of money.

07:24.933 --> 07:28.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is a lot of
energy, and most of it is
national money and energy.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I don't -- think
there's no doubt.

07:30.466 --> 07:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If there was a Democrat in the
White House, I would expect
the Republican to win the race

07:35.933 --> 07:38.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
easily.

07:38.033 --> 07:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now, with a controversial
Republican in the White House,
no, this election is -- it's

07:40.900 --> 07:42.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about Donald Trump.

07:42.766 --> 07:45.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stu Rothenberg,
Tamara Keith, this is
about the two of you.

07:45.300 --> 07:46.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Thank you.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

07:47.300 --> 07:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH: Thank you.
