07:49.667 --> 07:50.433
NEIGHBORHOOD

07:50.433 --> 07:51.533
WHO'S GETTING WHAT KIND OF

07:51.533 --> 07:52.000
WEAPONS?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.400
>> RIGHT, SO WHEN ASSAD STARTS

07:54.400 --> 07:56.800
TO LOSE CONTROL IN SYRIA I

07:56.800 --> 07:58.100
2012, IRAN AND SYRIA WAN

07:58.100 --> 07:59.667
HEZBOLLAH TO LEND ITS EXPERTES

07:59.667 --> 08:02.067
TO THE FIGHT

08:02.067 --> 08:03.433
HEZBOLLAH WAS RELUCTANT BECAUS

08:03.433 --> 08:05.700
OF ITS OWN DOMESTI

08:05.700 --> 08:07.333
CONSIDERATIONS INSIDE LEBANON TO

08:07.333 --> 08:08.833
SWEETEN THE DEAL, IRAN BASICALLY

08:08.833 --> 08:10.367
OFFERED HEZBOLLAH TO UPGRADE THE

08:10.367 --> 08:13.167
WEAPONS ARSENAL FROM HAVING TENS

08:13.167 --> 08:16.267
OF THOUSANDS, ABOUT 100,00

08:16.267 --> 08:18.133
UNGUIDED DUMB BOMBS AND ROCKET

08:18.133 --> 08:19.533
AND MISSILES TO HAVING SMART

08:19.533 --> 08:21.033
GUIDED, YOU KNOW, HAVING SMART

08:21.033 --> 08:23.833
GUIDED MISSILES THAT CAN HIT

08:23.833 --> 08:27.367
PRECISE TARGETS INSIDE ISRAEL.

08:27.367 --> 08:27.800
SO THE WEAPONS TRANSFERS WE'RE

08:27.800 --> 08:30.467
LOOKING AT SO FAR ARE THE SA-17.

08:30.467 --> 08:31.467
AN ANTI- -- SORT OF A HIGHLY

08:31.467 --> 08:36.100
MOBILE ADVANCED ANTI-AIRCRAF

08:36.100 --> 08:37.400
MISSILE THAT WOULD SORT OF

08:37.400 --> 08:38.533
REALLY THREATEN ISRAEL'S

08:38.533 --> 08:40.933
DOMINANCE IN THE SKIES ABOVE

08:40.933 --> 08:41.067
LEBANON.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.833
ESPECIALLY THE HELICOPTERS

08:43.833 --> 08:47.100
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE VER

08:47.100 --> 08:48.700
PRECISE, WITHIN -- CAN'T

08:48.700 --> 08:51.533
REMEMBER -- A FEW HUNDRED METERS

08:51.533 --> 08:54.033
LET'S SAY, SURFACE TO SURFAC

08:54.033 --> 08:55.133
MISSILES THAT CAN BE REACH ALL

08:55.133 --> 08:56.167
OF ISRAEL.

08:56.167 --> 08:59.067
AND SOMETHING CALLED THE SHIP --

08:59.067 --> 09:00.667
SURFACE TO SHIP ANTI-SHI

09:00.667 --> 09:02.033
MISSILE WHICH CAN TAKE OUT ALL

09:02.033 --> 09:03.300
ISRAELI -- CAN TAKE OUT AN

09:03.300 --> 09:05.933
ISRAELI SHIP PATROLLING TH

09:05.933 --> 09:07.100
MEDITERRANEAN OFF THE COAST OF

09:07.100 --> 09:07.533
LEBANON.

09:07.533 --> 09:09.133
>> THESE ARE MISSILES NOW IN

09:09.133 --> 09:10.667
LEBANON AND IN SYRIA WHERE

09:10.667 --> 09:13.800
HEZBOLLAH STORES THEM?

09:13.800 --> 09:15.367
SO HEZBOLLAH OPERATES IN LEBANON

09:15.367 --> 09:17.367
AND ALSO HAS THE PRESENCE INSIDE

09:17.367 --> 09:17.867
SYRIA.

09:17.867 --> 09:19.433
INCLUDING WAREHOUSES AND BASES

09:19.433 --> 09:20.167
AND WHATNOT.

09:20.167 --> 09:21.400
SO IN THE WAY THE TRANSFER

09:21.400 --> 09:22.700
USUALLY WORK, SYRIA TRANSFER

09:22.700 --> 09:25.167
THE WEAPONS TO HEZBOLLAH INSID

09:25.167 --> 09:29.267
SYRIA AND THEN HEZBOLLAH

09:29.267 --> 09:30.500
TRANSFERS THEM, YOU KNOW, WHEN

09:30.500 --> 09:33.767
IT WANTS TO INSIDE LEBANON

09:33.767 --> 09:36.467
IT'S NOT -- THERE IS CONFLICTING

09:36.467 --> 09:37.133
REPORTS IN HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY

09:37.133 --> 09:39.100
HAVE BEEN IN GETTING THEM INTO

09:39.100 --> 09:41.133
HEZBOLLAH'S HANDS AND INSIDE

09:41.133 --> 09:41.333
LEBANON.

09:41.333 --> 09:42.500
BUT IT APPEARS THAT WE HAV

09:42.500 --> 09:43.833
STARTED TO SEE AT LEAST SOME O

09:43.833 --> 09:46.100
THE ADVANCED WEAPONS INSID

09:46.100 --> 09:47.367
HEZBOLLAH'S HANDS, INSID

09:47.367 --> 09:47.933
LEBANON.

09:47.933 --> 09:48.500
>> RIGHT

09:48.500 --> 09:50.000
ISRAEL HAS BEEN TRYING TO STOP

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
THESE IN THE PAST YEAR THEY HAVE

09:53.000 --> 10:03.100
ACTUALLY HAD FIVE AIR ATTACK

10:03.100 --> 10:06.167
INTO SYRIA

10:06.167 --> 10:06.833
BUT WITHOUT CROSSING INTO SYRIAN

10:06.833 --> 10:07.133
AIR SPACE.

10:07.133 --> 10:07.600
HOW DO THEY DO THAT?

10:07.600 --> 10:08.233
>> ONCE ISRAEL GETS WIND OF TH

10:08.233 --> 10:09.033
TRANSACTIONS GOING ON IN 2013,

10:09.033 --> 10:09.800
ISRAEL STARTED TO LAUNCH AIR

10:09.800 --> 10:10.633
STRIKES EVERY TIME IT WAS AWAR

10:10.633 --> 10:11.500
OF ONE OF THE WEAPONS TRANSFERS.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.967
AND ISRAEL DOESN'T WANT TO GET

10:12.967 --> 10:18.333
TANGLED UP IN THE SYRIAN

10:18.333 --> 10:18.733
CONFLICT

10:18.733 --> 10:20.133
SO THEY TRIED TO TAKE OUT TH

10:20.133 --> 10:21.367
WEAPONS SHIPMENTS WITHOU

10:21.367 --> 10:24.233
CROSSING THE SYRIAN AIR SPACE.

10:24.233 --> 10:26.733
SO THEY DEPLOYED A REMARKABL

10:26.733 --> 10:27.333
TACTIC TO DO THIS.

10:27.333 --> 10:28.233
TO TAKE OUT THE WEAPONS WITHOU

10:28.233 --> 10:30.100
CROSSING THE SYRIAN AIR SPACE,

10:30.100 --> 10:34.800
THE PILOTS HAVE USED THIS TACTIC

10:34.800 --> 10:36.333
CALLED LOFTING WHERE THEY GU

10:36.333 --> 10:38.200
IT, IF THEY GUN THEIR PLANES

10:38.200 --> 10:39.800
TOWARDS SYRIAN AIR SPACE AT TH

10:39.800 --> 10:41.100
LAST MINUTE THEY ACCELERATE AN

10:41.100 --> 10:43.133
GO UP AND ON THEIR HEADS U

10:43.133 --> 10:45.467
DISPLAYS ON THEIR PLANES, THEY

10:45.467 --> 10:47.633
HAVE A BASKET ICON THAT'S TH

10:47.633 --> 10:48.400
TARGET

10:48.400 --> 10:52.800
AND HAVE TO TIME THE LAUNCH OF

10:52.800 --> 10:55.567
THE PAYLOADS OF THE ARCING -

10:55.567 --> 10:56.567
YOU KNOW, TO HIT THE TARGETS

10:56.567 --> 10:58.233
WITHOUT GOING INTO THE SYRIA

10:58.233 --> 10:59.600
AIR SPACE.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.833
>> CHARLES LEVINSON, FROM "THE

11:02.833 --> 11:06.200
WALL STREET JOURNAL," THANK YOU.

11:06.200 --> 11:12.000

11:16.400 --> 11:17.533
NATION AND THE WORLD

11:17.533 --> 11:19.367
OUR FOCUS TONIGHT A NEW APPROACH

11:19.367 --> 11:21.300
DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF

11:21.300 --> 11:22.533
PEOPLE KILLED BECAUSE OF

11:22.533 --> 11:23.800
DRINKING AND DRIVING

11:23.800 --> 11:26.033
ABOUT 10,000 AMERICANS DIE I

11:26.033 --> 11:27.133
DRUNK DRIVING ACCIDENTS EACH

11:27.133 --> 11:27.467
YEAR

11:27.467 --> 11:28.633
IT'S ALSO A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN

11:28.633 --> 11:29.567
CANADA

11:29.567 --> 11:32.100
BUT A NEW PROGRAM IN BRITISH

11:32.100 --> 11:34.167
COLUMBIA HAS BEEN VERY

11:34.167 --> 11:36.400
SUCCESSFUL REDUCING THE NUMBER

11:36.400 --> 11:37.367
OF DEATHS.

11:37.367 --> 11:41.400
NEWSHOUR CORRESPONDENT RECENTL

11:41.400 --> 11:42.767
TRAVELLED THERE AND WE

11:42.767 --> 11:44.133
ORIGINALLY BROADCAST I

11:44.133 --> 11:44.867
SEPTEMBER.

11:44.867 --> 11:46.133
>> SIX YEARS AGO, A TERRIBLE

11:46.133 --> 11:47.467
FAMILY TRAGEDY OCCURRED HERE I

11:47.467 --> 11:49.833
ROYAL BRITISH COLUMBIA

11:49.833 --> 11:50.933
BUT OVER TIME, IT BECAME MUC

11:50.933 --> 11:52.200
MORE THAN THAT

11:52.200 --> 11:54.033
THIS TRAGEDY SET IN MOTION

11:54.033 --> 11:55.933
DRAMATIC CHANGES TO THE LAWS

11:55.933 --> 11:57.433
GOVERNING DRINKING AND DRIVING

11:57.433 --> 11:59.600
CHANGES THAT SUPPORTERS SAY HAVE

11:59.600 --> 12:01.800
ALREADY SAVED DOZENS OF LIVES.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.100
THAT TRAGEDY INVOLVED

12:04.100 --> 12:04.800
4-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.467
HER NAME WAS ALEXA MIDDLEAR.

12:08.467 --> 12:09.533
>> IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL MAY LONG

12:09.533 --> 12:10.567
WEEKEND AND MY DAUGHTER LOVE

12:10.567 --> 12:11.500
THIS ONE PARTICULAR HORSE.

12:11.500 --> 12:13.567
AND SHE REALLY WANTED TO SHO

12:13.567 --> 12:15.833
HER GRANDPARENTS THAT HORSE, AND

12:15.833 --> 12:17.467
SO I REMEMBER SAYING GOOD-BYE TO

12:17.467 --> 12:17.867
HER.

12:17.867 --> 12:19.500
THEN VERY SHORTLY AFTER THAT, WE

12:19.500 --> 12:22.667
HEARD ALL KINDS OF SIRENS AND AT

12:22.667 --> 12:27.200
THAT MOMENT, I JUST -- I JUS

12:27.200 --> 12:29.467
KNEW I SAID IT'S ALEXA

12:29.467 --> 12:33.200
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO ALEXA.

12:33.200 --> 12:33.867
>> A 56-YEAR-OLD WOMAN DOING

12:33.867 --> 12:35.800
NEARLY TWICE THE SPEED LIMIT

12:35.800 --> 12:37.667
SMASHED INTO THE EXACT SPO

12:37.667 --> 12:38.933
WHERE ALEXA STOOD, FEEDING THE

12:38.933 --> 12:41.133
HORSE ON THE SIDE OF TO ROAD

12:41.133 --> 12:42.367
THE WOMAN WHO WAS LATER CONVIC

12:42.367 --> 12:44.267
AND SECOND TO PRISON ADMITTED TO

12:44.267 --> 12:45.600
POLICE SHE HAD HAD THREE GLASSES

12:45.600 --> 12:46.900
OF WINE BEFORE GETTING INTO HE

12:46.900 --> 12:48.433
CAR.

12:48.433 --> 12:50.800
>> WHEN WE KNEW ROADSIDE THA

12:50.800 --> 12:52.867
OUR DAUGHTER WAS DEAD, I

12:52.867 --> 12:54.700
REMEMBER MY HUSBAND JUST IN TH

12:54.700 --> 12:56.400
AMBULANCE, WE BOTH HELD EACH

12:56.400 --> 12:59.000
OTHER AND HE SAID, THIS WILL NOT

12:59.000 --> 12:59.667
BREAK US

12:59.667 --> 13:00.933
THIS WILL DEFINE US.

13:00.933 --> 13:04.300
THIS WILL BE SOME GOOD IN THIS

13:04.300 --> 13:06.533
>> AFTER THE ACCIDENT, ALEXA'S

13:06.533 --> 13:08.133
PARENTS MICHAEL AND LAUREL

13:08.133 --> 13:09.867
LAUNCHED A CAMPAIGN TO TRY AND

13:09.867 --> 13:10.967
CHANGE THE CULTURE AROUN

13:10.967 --> 13:12.233
DRINKING AND DRIVING, TO DETER

13:12.233 --> 13:14.367
PEOPLE FROM DOING IT

13:14.367 --> 13:15.867
THEIR EVENT BECAME A REGULAR

13:15.867 --> 13:17.833
FEATURE ON LOCAL NEWS.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.633
>> WE WILL HONOR OUR DAUGHTE

13:19.633 --> 13:20.600
AND WE WILL MAKE THE NECESSARY

13:20.600 --> 13:21.467
CHANGES THAT NUMBER ONE --

13:21.467 --> 13:22.400
>> BUT THEY SOON REALIZED IT

13:22.400 --> 13:24.200
WOULD TAKE MORE THAN THAT.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.467
THEY REALIZED THEY'D HAVE TO

13:25.467 --> 13:26.833
CHANGE THE DRUNK DRIVING LAWS,

13:26.833 --> 13:28.700
WHICH LIKE IN THE U.S. SET THE

13:28.700 --> 13:30.467
LEGAL BLOOD ALCOHOL LIMIT AT

13:30.467 --> 13:32.867
0.08%.

13:32.867 --> 13:33.767
AFTER LOBBYING THE GOVERNMEN

13:33.767 --> 13:36.133
FOR NEARLY A YEAR, ALONGSIDE

13:36.133 --> 13:37.400
GROUPS LIKE MOTHERS AGAINS

13:37.400 --> 13:38.700
DRUNK DRIVING, THEIR EFFORTS

13:38.700 --> 13:40.333
PAID OFF

13:40.333 --> 13:42.100
IN 2010, THE PROVINCIA

13:42.100 --> 13:44.100
GOVERNMENT NOT ONLY STIFFENE

13:44.100 --> 13:46.000
PENALTIES AGAINST DRIVING AT

13:46.000 --> 13:48.233
0.08, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I

13:48.233 --> 13:50.067
TARGETED DRIVERS WHO FALL BELO

13:50.067 --> 13:52.700
THAT LEVEL TO 0.05%.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.867
DRIVERS WHO ARE NOT LEGALL

13:54.867 --> 13:55.600
DRUNK.

13:55.600 --> 13:56.867
THE RATIONALE?

13:56.867 --> 13:59.367
EVEN A FEW DRINKS, AS FEW AS TWO

13:59.367 --> 14:04.200
FOR A WOMAN, THREE FOR A MAN CAN

14:04.200 --> 14:05.067
IMPAIR YOUR ABILITY TO DRIVE

14:05.067 --> 14:10.033
IF YOU'RE CAUGHT DRIVING WITH

14:10.033 --> 14:10.200
0.05% LEVEL, THE POLICE AR

14:10.200 --> 14:12.633
AUTHORIZED TO FINE YOU, SUSPEN

14:12.633 --> 14:13.800
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE AN

14:13.800 --> 14:15.167
IMMEDIATELY IMPOUND YOUR CAR FOR

14:15.167 --> 14:15.967
AT LEAST THREE DAYS.

14:15.967 --> 14:17.433
THEY WOULD GET YOU OUT OF TH

14:17.433 --> 14:18.900
VEHICLE AND A TOW TRUCK WOUL

14:18.900 --> 14:21.033
HAUL IT AWAY

14:21.033 --> 14:23.567
IN LATE 2010, POLICE BEGAN

14:23.567 --> 14:25.000
ENFORCING THE NEW LAWS AND

14:25.000 --> 14:26.567
POLICE IMPOUND LOTS ACROSS

14:26.567 --> 14:28.000
BRITISH COLUMBIA BEGAN FILLING

14:28.000 --> 14:28.333
UP

14:28.333 --> 14:31.267
THE CHANGES SPARKED AN UPROAR.

14:31.267 --> 14:33.133
CIVIL LIBERTARIANS SAID IT GAV

14:33.133 --> 14:34.767
THE POLICE TOO MUCH POWER.

14:34.767 --> 14:36.600
RESTAURANT OWNERS SAY THAT THE

14:36.600 --> 14:38.367
NEW LAWS DAMAGED THE ECONOMY

14:38.367 --> 14:41.333
HE SAID HIS BUSINESS DROPPED

14:41.333 --> 14:42.233
BETWEEN 10 AND 20%

14:42.233 --> 14:43.333
>> WHEN THE THE CHANGE CAME OUT,

14:43.333 --> 14:44.800
WE KNEW THAT WAS GOING TO HAVE A

14:44.800 --> 14:46.100
STRONG IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS.

14:46.100 --> 14:47.900
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK, THA

14:47.900 --> 14:48.300
CUSTOMERS WOULD SUDDENLY B

14:48.300 --> 14:48.767
AFRAID AND THAT THEY WOULDN'

14:48.767 --> 14:49.033
COME TO YOUR DOOR?

14:49.033 --> 14:49.967
>> WE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A

14:49.967 --> 14:55.000
LOT OF UNKNOWNS ABOUT WHAT THA

14:55.000 --> 14:56.300
MEANT, HOW MANY DRINKS COULD

14:56.300 --> 14:57.533
PEOPLE HAVE.

14:57.533 --> 14:58.700
THERE WAS LITTLE INFORMATION

14:58.700 --> 14:59.933
ABOUT HOW THAT WAS GOING TO BE

14:59.933 --> 15:00.500
ENFORCED

15:00.500 --> 15:02.600
HOW IT WAS GOING TO IMPACT WHA

15:02.600 --> 15:04.467
PEOPLE COULD DRINK

15:04.467 --> 15:06.500
WE WERE CREATING NONALCOHOLI

15:06.500 --> 15:08.333
DRINKS TO MAKE UP FOR THOSE LOST

15:08.333 --> 15:08.533
SALES.

15:08.533 --> 15:08.967
IT REALLY WAS A LOT OF FEAR.

15:08.967 --> 15:10.400
A LOT OF UNKNOWNS.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.200
AND SOME REAL CHANGES IN

15:12.200 --> 15:15.900
PEOPLE'S BEHAVIOR.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.200
>> AND THE IMPACT WAS IMMEDIATE.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.833
DURING THE FIRST YEAR THE NE

15:20.833 --> 15:21.267
LAWS WERE IN EFFECT, THE NUMBE

15:21.267 --> 15:25.033
OF DRUNK DRIVING DEATHS PLUNGED.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.200
CRITICS ARGUED FOR FIRST YEA

15:26.200 --> 15:27.433
WAS A FLUKE, BUT THE SECOND YEAR

15:27.433 --> 15:29.600
THE NUMBER DECLINED AGAIN.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.100
A 55% REDUCTION IN DEATHS IN

15:30.100 --> 15:36.100
JUST TWO YEARS

15:36.100 --> 15:39.100
THE MESSAGE IT SEEMED HA

15:39.100 --> 15:39.833
STARTED TO GET THROUGH T

15:39.833 --> 15:40.167
DRIVERS.

15:40.167 --> 15:41.233
>> SO IT WAS QUITE WEL

15:41.233 --> 15:41.600
PUBLICIZED

15:41.600 --> 15:43.467
FOR THE DETERRENTS TO WORK IT'

15:43.467 --> 15:45.600
ABOUT KNOWING AND EXPECTIN

15:45.600 --> 15:47.000
THERE BEING A CONSEQUENCE THAT

15:47.000 --> 15:48.367
ACTUALLY IS LIKELY

15:48.367 --> 15:50.167
PEOPLE'S PERCEPTION THEY'R

15:50.167 --> 15:51.867
LIKELY TO BE CAUGHT IS WAY

15:51.867 --> 15:53.200
HIGHER THAN IT WAS

15:53.200 --> 15:55.167
>> THAT'S KEY?

15:55.167 --> 15:56.633
>> IT'S KEY.

15:56.633 --> 15:59.100
>> STILL STOCKWELL IS AN EXPER

15:59.100 --> 16:01.067
ON ALCOHOL, AND HE CAN'T THINK

16:01.067 --> 16:02.933
OF A SINGLE REFORM THAT'S HA

16:02.933 --> 16:05.367
THIS BIG OF AN IMPACT, THI

16:05.367 --> 16:05.600
QUICKLY.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.167
HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAD A PEER

16:07.167 --> 16:09.633
REVIEWED ARTICLE OF THE NE

16:09.633 --> 16:10.400
LAWS

16:10.400 --> 16:14.867
>> THIS IS A PERFECT DETERRENC

16:14.867 --> 16:15.633
THEORY IN ACTION

16:15.633 --> 16:16.100
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO

16:16.100 --> 16:16.633
UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T NEE

16:16.633 --> 16:17.833
DRACONIAN, SEVERE PENALTIES.

16:17.833 --> 16:20.200
THEY HAVE TO BE SEVERE ENOUGH.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.500
IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT THE

16:22.500 --> 16:24.667
ARE CERTAIN AND THAT THEY AR

16:24.667 --> 16:25.333
SWIFT.

16:25.333 --> 16:29.967
SO ON THE SPOT, LOSING YOUR CA

16:29.967 --> 16:33.067
FOR THREE DAYS OR A WEEK, THAT'S

16:33.067 --> 16:33.700
SEVERE ENOUGH.

16:33.700 --> 16:34.933
>> THE NEW LAWS HAVE FACED SOM

16:34.933 --> 16:35.433
SETBACKS

16:35.433 --> 16:37.700
THE POLICE HAD PROBLEMS WITH

16:37.700 --> 16:39.533
SOME OF THEIR BREATHALYZERS.

16:39.533 --> 16:42.200
THE GOVERNMENT HAD TO AMEND TH

16:42.200 --> 16:45.100
LAWS WHEN THE COURTS RULED THA

16:45.100 --> 16:46.367
DRIVERS DESERVED A BETTE

16:46.367 --> 16:47.333
APPEALS PROCESS.

16:47.333 --> 16:49.500
A JUDGE RULED IN FAVOR OF

16:49.500 --> 16:51.567
DRIVER WHO APPEALED HIS 2012

16:51.567 --> 16:52.700
DRIVING SUSPENSION

16:52.700 --> 16:54.233
CRITICS SAY THAT MAY FORCE A

16:54.233 --> 16:55.833
REWRITING OF THE LAWS BUT FO

16:55.833 --> 16:59.000
NOW THAT HASN'T HAPPENED

16:59.000 --> 17:00.467
THE HEART OF THE NEW LAWS REMAIN

17:00.467 --> 17:00.900
INTACT

17:00.900 --> 17:03.633
>> WHAT ABOUT THE ARGUMENT THERE

17:03.633 --> 17:05.100
ARE SO MANY LIVES SAVED BY THE

17:05.100 --> 17:06.633
NEW RULES THAT YES, IT MAY HAV

17:06.633 --> 17:08.067
TAKEN A HIT OUT OF YOU

17:08.067 --> 17:09.667
BUSINESS, BUT THAT TO SAVE

17:09.667 --> 17:12.367
PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT'S AN OKA

17:12.367 --> 17:13.133
PRICE TO PAY

17:13.133 --> 17:15.000
>> IT'S HARD TO ARGUE THAT

17:15.000 --> 17:16.567
I'M CERTAINLY NOT GOING TO SIT

17:16.567 --> 17:18.200
HERE AND SAY, WELL, WE SHOUL

17:18.200 --> 17:19.900
ALLOW PEOPLE TO DRINK WHATEVER

17:19.900 --> 17:23.300
AND WHATEVER THE CONSEQUENCE

17:23.300 --> 17:27.200
ARE THAT'S THE WAY IT WOULD BE

17:27.200 --> 17:28.767
I WOULDN'T ADVOCATE THAT

17:28.767 --> 17:30.833
>> WHY DO YOU THINK IT'S BEEN SO

17:30.833 --> 17:31.700
EFFECTIVE?

17:31.700 --> 17:33.067
>> BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCE I

17:33.067 --> 17:33.467
FIRM

17:33.467 --> 17:36.133
I THINK PEOPLE RESPOND WHE

17:36.133 --> 17:38.467
THERE'S A HARSHER CONSEQUENCE.

17:38.467 --> 17:39.700
I THINK TOO BECAUSE IT'S ALIGNED

17:39.700 --> 17:41.367
TO THE LARGER GOAL

17:41.367 --> 17:42.433
LIKE SECONDHAND SMOKE.

17:42.433 --> 17:44.667
WE HAVE NO TOLERANCE FOR THA

17:44.667 --> 17:44.800
ANYMORE.

17:44.800 --> 17:46.767
JUST LIKE WHEN SEAT BELTS CAME

17:46.767 --> 17:48.367
IN, THERE WAS THE FUNDAMENTA

17:48.367 --> 17:49.467
SHIFT.

17:49.467 --> 17:52.233
MY GOAL HAS BEEN IS THAT THERE'S

17:52.233 --> 17:54.067
A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT THAT IT'

17:54.067 --> 17:56.633
OKAY NOT TO DRINK AND DRIVE.

17:56.633 --> 17:57.267
DRINK, ABSOLUTELY.

17:57.267 --> 17:58.200
DRINK AND PARTAKE, BUT DON'T MIX

17:58.200 --> 18:03.800
IT WITH DRIVING.

18:03.800 --> 18:07.000
>>> USING INTERACTIVE MA

18:07.000 --> 18:07.867
SHOWING THE ROLE THAT ALCOHO

18:07.867 --> 18:10.533
PLAYS IN ROAD FATALITIES AROUN

18:10.533 --> 18:16.000
THE WORLD, GO TO

18:16.000 --> 18:16.767
NEWSHOUR.PBS.ORG

18:16.767 --> 18:20.833
>>> MICHAEL BLOOMBERG LEFT

18:20.833 --> 18:24.800
OFFICE AFTER SERVING 12 YEARS OF

18:24.800 --> 18:25.833
MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY

18:25.833 --> 18:30.667
SOME POINT TO THE PLUNGING CRIME

18:30.667 --> 18:31.800
RATE AND OTHERS POINT TO INCOM

18:31.800 --> 18:31.933
INEQUALITY

18:31.933 --> 18:34.100
WHEN I SPOKE WITH THE REPORTER

18:34.100 --> 18:36.033
KATHERINE BAGLEY OF INSIDE

18:36.033 --> 18:37.600
CLIMATE NEWS, SHE SAID IT WA

18:37.600 --> 18:39.033
SOMETHING ELSE ALTOGETHER.

18:39.033 --> 18:42.233
I ASKED HER WHY SHE CONSIDER

18:42.233 --> 18:44.100
THE MAYOR'S EFFORTS TO ADDRESS

18:44.100 --> 18:45.067
CLIMATE CHANGE TO BE S

18:45.067 --> 18:45.667
SIGNIFICANT.

18:45.667 --> 18:46.900
>> SO HE'S BEEN WORKING FOR TH

18:46.900 --> 18:49.400
PAST SIX YEARS ON SUSTAINABILITY

18:49.400 --> 18:50.433
IN CLIMATE CHANGE INITIATIVES.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.667
IT'S SOMETHING THAT GETS VER

18:51.667 --> 18:53.567
LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE PUBLIC

18:53.567 --> 18:54.900
AND BY THE MEDIA

18:54.900 --> 18:56.400
AND YET, WHAT HE'S DONE IS BOT

18:56.400 --> 18:57.933
A PHYSICAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE

18:57.933 --> 18:59.867
CITY AND ALSO SOMETHING THAT A

18:59.867 --> 19:01.900
LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SEE, THING

19:01.900 --> 19:05.600
LIKE REDUCING EMISSIONS AN

19:05.600 --> 19:07.600
HARMFUL POLLUTANTS IN THE AIR.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.800
>> ALL RIGHT

19:08.800 --> 19:10.133
SO WE SEE THE BIKE LANES ALL

19:10.133 --> 19:10.633
OVER TOWN.

19:10.633 --> 19:13.200
WE SEE PERHAPS SOME OF THE

19:13.200 --> 19:14.133
IMPACTS ON TRANSPORTATIO

19:14.133 --> 19:14.367
INFRASTRUCTURE

19:14.367 --> 19:15.100
BUT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE LONGE

19:15.100 --> 19:15.467
TERM PROJECTS?

19:15.467 --> 19:16.200
WHAT'S THAT LEGACY GOING TO BE

19:16.200 --> 19:16.400
LIKE

19:16.400 --> 19:17.767
>> SO, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF WHAT

19:17.767 --> 19:19.300
THEY HAVE DONE IS TAKING THE

19:19.300 --> 19:20.867
THOUSANDS OF BUILDINGS IN NE

19:20.867 --> 19:22.467
YORK CITY AND REALLY SWITCHING

19:22.467 --> 19:25.600
THEIR HEATING FUEL SOURCE FROM

19:25.600 --> 19:27.600
THESE KIND OF REALLY HEAVILY

19:27.600 --> 19:31.800
POLLUTING FUELS TO MORE -- T

19:31.800 --> 19:35.100
CLEANER ENERGY SOURCES

19:35.100 --> 19:36.300
AND THAT IS KIND OF ONE OF THE

19:36.300 --> 19:37.300
BIG PROJECTS THAT A LOT OF

19:37.300 --> 19:38.300
PEOPLE DON'T SEE

19:38.300 --> 19:40.867
SO FAR, 5,200 BUILDINGS HAVE

19:40.867 --> 19:42.133
BEEN INVOLVED AND THERE'

19:42.133 --> 19:43.633
THOUSANDS MORE THAT HAVE T

19:43.633 --> 19:44.300
COMPLY AS WELL

19:44.300 --> 19:46.133
BUT, YOU KNOW, A LOT OF TH

19:46.133 --> 19:48.033
LONGER TERM INITIATIVES CAME I

19:48.033 --> 19:50.067
AFTER HURRICANE SANDY HIT,

19:50.067 --> 19:50.833
BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN WORKIN

19:50.833 --> 19:51.633
FOR FIVE YEARS ON MITIGATION

19:51.633 --> 19:55.800
REDUCING EMISSIONS AND

19:55.800 --> 19:56.567
INCREASING GREEN SPACE

19:56.567 --> 19:58.000
THROUGHOUT THE CITY.

19:58.000 --> 19:58.767
THINGS LIKE THAT

19:58.767 --> 20:00.100
THEN SANDY HIT AND THERE WAS

20:00.100 --> 20:02.300
KIND OF A WAKE-UP CALL ABOUT HOW

20:02.300 --> 20:04.600
VULNERABLE THE CITY WAS.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.533
THEY HAD KNOWN ABOUT HOW

20:06.533 --> 20:07.733
VULNERABLE IT WAS, BUT IT MADE

20:07.733 --> 20:08.533
IT APPARENT TO THE PUBLIC AN

20:08.533 --> 20:12.333
THERE WAS A PUSH TO BUILD TH

20:12.333 --> 20:13.567
BIGGER PROJECTS.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.133
SO YOU'LL SEE NEW YORK

20:15.133 --> 20:18.567
TRANSFERRED WITH SEA WELLS AND

20:18.567 --> 20:20.833
KIND OF THE MASSIV

20:20.833 --> 20:22.167
TRANSFORMATION PROJECTS ALL OVER

20:22.167 --> 20:23.800
THE 520 MILES OF THE NEW YOR

20:23.800 --> 20:24.533
CITY'S COASTLINES.

20:24.533 --> 20:25.767
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT TH

20:25.767 --> 20:27.300
INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUE, BUILDING

20:27.300 --> 20:28.333
INSURANCE CHANGES.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.600
THE PARK SYSTEMS CHANGE.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.133
EVEN HOW WE THINK ABOUT ENERGY

20:31.133 --> 20:32.467
IS CHANGING IN THIS CITY

20:32.467 --> 20:34.433
>> IT IS

20:34.433 --> 20:38.533
AND, YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN A

20:38.533 --> 20:40.900
GRADUAL TRANSFORMATION

20:40.900 --> 20:44.033
IT WAS NOT ONE THAT CAME EASILY.

20:44.033 --> 20:45.300
HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD TO FIGH

20:45.300 --> 20:46.467
FOR THESE THINGS TO GET DONE

20:46.467 --> 20:47.367
THEY NEVER GAVE UP

20:47.367 --> 20:49.900
YOU KNOW, THEY STARTED THEIR

20:49.900 --> 20:53.800
PLAN NYC IN 2007 IS WHEN THE

20:53.800 --> 20:54.900
OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED IT

20:54.900 --> 20:56.500
THEN YOU HAD THE RECESSION HIT

20:56.500 --> 20:57.433
NOT A YEAR LATER

20:57.433 --> 20:59.600
YOU HAD A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT

20:59.600 --> 21:01.233
SAID, WHOA, LET'S BACK OFF

21:01.233 --> 21:03.967
LET'S STOP DOING ALL THE MASSIVE

21:03.967 --> 21:05.200
PROJECTS AND START THE CITY FROM

21:05.200 --> 21:06.967
HAVING NO DEFICIT TO HAVING

21:06.967 --> 21:09.133
$4 BILLION DEFICIT IN A YEAR

21:09.133 --> 21:10.733
YET T BLOOMBERG ADMINISTRATION

21:10.733 --> 21:11.700
JUST PUSHED FORWARD.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.033
THIS WAS VERY MUCH LED BY TH

21:13.033 --> 21:15.033
MAYOR SAYING, NO, WE SAID WE'R

21:15.033 --> 21:15.733
GOING TO DO THIS

21:15.733 --> 21:17.033
WE'RE GOING TO DO THIS

21:17.033 --> 21:18.367
>> DOES HE PLAN CONTINUE DOING

21:18.367 --> 21:19.600
THIS AFTER HIS MAYORSHIP

21:19.600 --> 21:21.100
>> YEAH, WE HAD AN INTERVIEW

21:21.100 --> 21:22.333
WITH HIM IN SEPTEMBER.

21:22.333 --> 21:23.733
HE SAID THAT HE VERY MUCH WANT

21:23.733 --> 21:25.000
TO STAY INVOLVED IN CLIMAT

21:25.000 --> 21:26.900

21:32.833 --> 21:39.233

23:01.800 --> 23:03.000
IT'S A DISGRACE.

23:03.000 --> 23:06.033
>> POLLUTION IN SOME AREAS I

23:06.033 --> 23:10.033
WAY ABOVE ACCEPTABLE LEVELS.

23:10.033 --> 23:11.767
SCIENTISTS TESTING THE WATER SAY

23:11.767 --> 23:14.400
THE NARROW ENTRANCE TO THE BAY

23:14.400 --> 23:16.467
MEANS THE SEA CAN'T FLUSH IT

23:16.467 --> 23:16.900
OUT.

23:16.900 --> 23:18.367
PLUS, IT'S WHAT PEOPLE PUT I

23:18.367 --> 23:18.700
IT

23:18.700 --> 23:21.433
>> THE WATER QUALITY ISN'T GOO

23:21.433 --> 23:23.567
BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY

23:23.567 --> 23:24.500
COMMUNITIES AROUND IT,

23:24.500 --> 23:25.767
ESPECIALLY POOR ONES WHERE

23:25.767 --> 23:27.467
RUBBISH COLLECTION AND SEWAG

23:27.467 --> 23:28.633
TREATMENT SIMPLY AREN'T GOOD

23:28.633 --> 23:29.033
ENOUGH

23:29.033 --> 23:31.433
>> AROUND THE EDGES OF THE HUG

23:31.433 --> 23:33.733
BAY ARE THOUSANDS OF FILTH

23:33.733 --> 23:37.333
RIVERS AND CANALS.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.700
A POOR SUBSTITUTE FOR A PROPER

23:38.700 --> 23:40.500
SANITATION SYSTEM.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.167
IT LOOKS BAD AND BELIEVE ME IT

23:42.167 --> 23:43.000
SMELLS TERRIBLE.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.100
THE MAIN CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM IS

23:44.100 --> 23:45.400
THAT THE AUTHORITIES HAVEN'T

23:45.400 --> 23:46.667
CONNECTED UP MILLIONS OF HOMES

23:46.667 --> 23:49.933
TO A PROPERLY FUNCTIONING SEWAGE

23:49.933 --> 23:51.867
IS NEARLY 70% OF IT GETS WASHE

23:51.867 --> 23:53.733
UNTREATED OUT INTO THE BAY O

23:53.733 --> 23:56.267
THE SEA.

23:56.267 --> 23:57.967
THE AUTHORITIES SAY POLLUTIO

23:57.967 --> 23:59.667
WILL HAVE BEEN CUT BY 80% WHEN

23:59.667 --> 24:00.867
THE OLYMPICS START

24:00.867 --> 24:02.433
AND RIO 2016 THE ORGANIZER

24:02.433 --> 24:04.733

24:04.733 --> 24:16.267
