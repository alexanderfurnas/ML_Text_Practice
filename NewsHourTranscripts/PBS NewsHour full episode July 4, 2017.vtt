WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Good evening
on this Independence Day.

00:06.200 --> 00:07.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm William Brangham.

00:07.200 --> 00:09.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is off.

00:09.200 --> 00:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight: North
Korea claims it successfully
tested a long-range missile

00:13.433 --> 00:15.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
capable of reaching the U.S.

00:15.466 --> 00:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What options remain for
the Trump administration?

00:18.566 --> 00:23.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: relocating the bushmen
-- after being forced out of
their homeland, the struggle

00:23.200 --> 00:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for the few remaining
hunter-gatherers in Botswana
to preserve their culture.

00:27.533 --> 00:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Officially,
nobody is allowed to return.

00:31.700 --> 00:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the years, some have
tried to recreate life in the
villages, but they say it's just

00:37.333 --> 00:38.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not the same.

00:38.833 --> 00:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And what's
the buzz on a new beer?

00:40.966 --> 00:45.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
How a lab discovered a
new type of yeast from
bees that's changing the
game for beer makers.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB DUNN, North Carolina
State University: We actually
think, based on some work from

00:49.933 --> 00:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
colleagues in Italy, that it's
very likely that those first
beers and breads were relying

00:54.866 --> 00:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
on yeasts from insects, too.

00:56.800 --> 01:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:03.033 --> 01:05.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:05.700 --> 01:10.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It
was North Korea's own
version of fireworks
for the Fourth of July.

01:14.866 --> 01:19.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The communist state today fired
off a new missile that may
someday put the United States

01:19.833 --> 01:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
within range of its weapons.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nick Schifrin
begins our coverage.

01:23.733 --> 01:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: On this July
4, North Korea declared
independence from what it called

01:29.533 --> 01:31.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
American nuclear threats.

01:31.600 --> 01:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
The scientists and technicians
have successfully test-fired

01:35.800 --> 01:38.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the newly developed
intercontinental
ballistic missile.

01:38.666 --> 01:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Pyongyang,
North Koreans celebrated what
appears to be its most advanced

01:42.700 --> 01:46.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
test in its long pursuit
of a nuclear weapon.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The missile flew for about 40
minutes, almost straight up,
reaching an altitude of more

01:49.966 --> 01:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
than 1,500 miles, and came
straight down 580 miles
away in the Sea of Japan.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On a flatter trajectory, it's
estimated the missile could
have traveled as far as 4,000

01:59.500 --> 02:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
miles, past Anchorage, Alaska,
says scientist David Wright.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID WRIGHT, Co-Director
of Global Security,
Union Of Concerned
Scientists: If they shoot

02:04.466 --> 02:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it essentially straight up in
the air, it goes very, very
high and comes down not very

02:07.100 --> 02:09.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
far away.

02:09.133 --> 02:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they then flatten it out a
little bit, it uses all that
speed to go a much longer

02:12.233 --> 02:14.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
distance.

02:14.333 --> 02:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But the test
doesn't mean North Korea can
deliver a nuclear weapon.

02:16.966 --> 02:21.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's not known whether
it's mastered required
miniaturization or
guidance and separation

02:21.066 --> 02:23.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
systems that can take
years to develop.

02:23.233 --> 02:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WRIGHT: As you go to
longer and longer ranges, there
are just much higher stresses,

02:27.833 --> 02:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
vibrations, the acceleration,
so there are a lot of forces
on this nuclear warhead.

02:34.766 --> 02:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't know if they have
actually done the final steps to
have a warhead that they could

02:39.233 --> 02:42.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actually put into one of these
long-range missiles and have
it work the way it's supposed

02:42.966 --> 02:44.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

02:44.933 --> 02:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: As
president-elect, Donald
Trump vowed not to
let today's event ever

02:47.433 --> 02:49.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
happen.

02:49.600 --> 02:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As president, he tried to push
China to pressure North Korea,
but he recently admitted that

02:52.900 --> 02:54.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
failed.

02:54.966 --> 02:58.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, he addressed North Korean
leader Kim Jong-un, tweeting:
"Does this guy have anything

02:58.100 --> 03:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
better to do with his life?

03:00.233 --> 03:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Perhaps China will put a heavy
move on North Korea and end
this nonsense once and for all."

03:04.600 --> 03:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But, today, China didn't
show willingness to
apply more pressure.

03:08.233 --> 03:11.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENG SHUANG, Chinese Foreign
Ministry Spokesperson
(through translator):
We hope all sides can

03:11.066 --> 03:15.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
remain calm and exercise
restraint, ease the tense
situation on the peninsula.

03:15.166 --> 03:19.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And, in Moscow,
Chinese and Russian Presidents
Xi Jinping and Vladimir

03:19.266 --> 03:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin jointly called for the
U.S. and North Korea to abandon
long-held positions in order

03:25.000 --> 03:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to calm the peninsula.

03:26.966 --> 03:29.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
We agreed to actively promote

03:29.466 --> 03:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parallel freezing of
nuclear missile activities
of North Korea and
large-scale joint military

03:34.566 --> 03:36.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
drills of the U.S.
and South Korea.

03:36.600 --> 03:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: North Korea has
exploited the July 4 holiday
before, in 2006 and 2009.

03:43.066 --> 03:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But this is their most
dramatic test, and their
momentum is increasing.

03:46.300 --> 03:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have now launched more
missiles in the last three years
than in the last three decades.

03:50.366 --> 03:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID WRIGHT: I don't see a
roadblock to them being able
to continue this process until

03:57.433 --> 04:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they got a missile that
really had the ability to
reach the lower 48 states.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think it's just a
matter of time until
they reach that point.

04:05.133 --> 04:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Nick Schifrin.

04:07.666 --> 04:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: We will look
at the implications of the North
Korean test right after the news

04:12.133 --> 04:14.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
summary.

04:14.200 --> 04:18.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the day's other news: Iraqi
soldiers in Western Mosul
advanced deeper into the last

04:18.033 --> 04:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pocket still being held
by Islamic State forces.

04:21.266 --> 04:24.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Fierce fighting continued in
an area packed with civilians.

04:24.600 --> 04:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in Baghdad this evening,
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi
proclaimed a big victory over

04:29.233 --> 04:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ISIS, or Da'esh in Arabic.

04:31.333 --> 04:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HAIDER AL-ABADI, Iraqi Prime
Minister (through translator):
All the displaced must return

04:35.833 --> 04:37.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to their homes.

04:37.300 --> 04:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We are continuing to liberate
all our land from Da'esh.

04:39.666 --> 04:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Iraqi people ended the
myth of Da'esh in record time,
although the world thought

04:43.633 --> 04:46.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that this wasn't possible.

04:46.100 --> 04:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile,
in Syria, a Kurdish-led
militia has breached
the heart of the Islamic

04:49.733 --> 04:52.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
State's self-proclaimed
capital, Raqqa.

04:52.100 --> 04:56.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S.-backed forces today
punched through the wall around
the Old City and are now pushing

04:56.933 --> 05:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
into the most heavily fortified
portion of the ISIS stronghold.

05:01.566 --> 05:05.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
President Trump's first
face-to-face meeting
with Russian President
Vladimir Putin will

05:05.433 --> 05:07.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
happen this Friday.

05:07.366 --> 05:11.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They will meet on the sidelines
of the G20 summit as it
begins in Hamburg, Germany.

05:11.400 --> 05:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House says
there will be no specific
agenda for the meeting.

05:15.366 --> 05:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's word that Canada will
apologize to a Canadian citizen
for the alleged treatment

05:19.700 --> 05:22.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he received at the
Guantanamo Naval Base.

05:22.866 --> 05:26.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's widely reported
that he will also be
paid nearly $8 million.

05:26.200 --> 05:30.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Omar Khadr was captured
in Afghanistan when
he just 15 years old.

05:30.933 --> 05:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He initially admitted to
killing a U.S. soldier and
spent 10 years at Guantanamo.

05:35.266 --> 05:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Khadr says his confession was
coerced, and Canada's Supreme
Court has now ruled he was

05:40.233 --> 05:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interrogated under what it
called oppressive circumstances.

05:43.433 --> 05:47.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In New Jersey, the three-day
government shutdown is over.

05:47.966 --> 05:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democratic lawmakers reached
a budget deal last night,
and Republican Governor Chris

05:51.300 --> 05:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Christie signed it into law.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Christie had been heavily
criticized for using a
state beach on Sunday,
after it was closed

05:57.966 --> 05:59.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the public.

05:59.933 --> 06:03.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The new budget agreement allowed
state parks and beaches to
reopen for everyone just in

06:03.333 --> 06:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
time for the Fourth of July.

06:04.466 --> 06:06.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Pretty excited.

06:06.466 --> 06:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to see the Statue
of Liberty, so we're pretty
excited to be back here.

06:08.933 --> 06:13.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I saw on the news yesterday
that it was closed for budget
issues, so it's pretty cool.

06:13.100 --> 06:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: It's my first time.

06:14.433 --> 06:15.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Our first time.

06:15.933 --> 06:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Well, it's amazing
that it opened in time.

06:17.933 --> 06:19.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's very thankful,
and it's a very special
day to reopen Liberty Park.

06:19.966 --> 06:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In Maine,
Governor Paul LePage also
signed a new budget, ending a

06:24.033 --> 06:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
partial government
shutdown in his state.

06:26.833 --> 06:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Illinois, there was
no break in a budget impasse
that's now in its third year.

06:31.333 --> 06:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican Governor Bruce
Rauner vetoed a $36 billion
package, along with a major tax

06:36.900 --> 06:38.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hike.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Democratic-controlled
state Senate quickly
overrode the veto.

06:40.666 --> 06:43.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the House took
no immediate action.

06:43.500 --> 06:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the nation marked its
241st birthday today with an
array of annual celebrations.

06:50.433 --> 06:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fourth of July parades began
with one in Gatlinburg,
Tennessee, at midnight.

06:55.300 --> 06:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's been their
tradition for 42 years.

06:57.466 --> 07:01.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Washington this evening,
President and Mrs. Trump
hosted a White House picnic

07:01.466 --> 07:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for military families
before the annual fireworks
over the National Mall.

07:08.466 --> 07:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
what options does the U.S. have
after North Korea's missile

07:11.733 --> 07:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
test?; a court orders the EPA
to put an Obama era rule into
effect; farmers struggling with

07:18.633 --> 07:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a drop in crop
prices; and much more.

07:33.466 --> 07:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We return now to North Korea
and its recent missile launch.

07:36.533 --> 07:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the United States called
for a closed-door United Nations
Security Council meeting to

07:40.933 --> 07:42.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
address the threat.

07:42.933 --> 07:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what exactly are the Trump
administration's options,
and how might it respond?

07:46.533 --> 07:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For that, we turn to
Ambassador Christopher Hill.

07:49.500 --> 07:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the chief U.S. negotiator
with North Korea from 2005
until 2009, and served as

07:55.433 --> 07:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. ambassador to South Korea.

07:57.466 --> 07:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And by Mark Bowden.

07:59.800 --> 08:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a national correspondent
for "The Atlantic"
magazine, and he recently
wrote a comprehensive

08:03.200 --> 08:06.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
cover story titled "Can
North Korea Be Stopped?"

08:06.900 --> 08:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ambassador Hill, I would
like to start with you first.

08:11.733 --> 08:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Can you just give me
your initial reaction to
this most recent launch?

08:14.600 --> 08:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HILL, Former U.S.
Ambassador to Iraq: I think
it's a very serious matter.

08:17.533 --> 08:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's pretty clear they have made
progress on intercontinental
ballistic missiles.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From what I can understand,
if you sent it at a different
pitch, it could actually exceed

08:29.600 --> 08:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the 5,000 miles that qualifies
it as an intercontinental
ballistic missile.

08:32.866 --> 08:35.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it's a pretty serious matter.

08:35.066 --> 08:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we also understand they made
progress on miniaturization,
so it's not farfetched

08:39.833 --> 08:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to assume that in the next two
or three years, they will have
a deliverable nuclear weapon

08:44.500 --> 08:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
aimed at the United States.

08:46.600 --> 08:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the real question is, how is
the president going to explain
that to the American people?

08:53.033 --> 08:55.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, perhaps more immediately,
what is he going to do about it?

08:55.566 --> 08:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mark
Bowden, just as Ambassador
Hill is saying, President
Trump has said he

09:01.900 --> 09:04.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will not allow a nuclear-armed
missile to be able to be
developed in North Korea.

09:04.766 --> 09:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But this certainly
seems like a very large
step in that direction.

09:08.533 --> 09:11.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK BOWDEN, "The
Atlantic": It does.

09:11.133 --> 09:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in addition to shrinking
a nuclear weapon to go on top
of a missile like that, they

09:18.166 --> 09:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
already have chemical and
biological weapons that are
capable of mass casualties.

09:23.533 --> 09:26.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this is a really
serious development.

09:26.000 --> 09:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's easy to say you're
going to stop them from doing
it, but it's not a very easy

09:30.900 --> 09:32.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
thing to accomplish.

09:32.933 --> 09:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ambassador,
I wonder if you could give
me a sense of, what is your

09:35.600 --> 09:40.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
understanding of what Kim
Jong-un actually wants
with this nuclear program?

09:42.033 --> 09:44.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HILL: Well, you
know, opinions differ on this.

09:44.400 --> 09:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are some who believe this
is a poor, beleaguered country
surrounded by larger hostile

09:51.466 --> 09:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states who want to do it harm,
and so why not allow the North
Koreans to defend themselves?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think it's actually
a much more aggressive
purpose they have in mind.

10:00.833 --> 10:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what they're hoping is
that to hold American civilians
at risk, that is, to have

10:07.833 --> 10:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a deliverable nuclear weapon
that is deliverable to the U.S.
mainland, they can convince the

10:13.666 --> 10:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
United States not to exercise
their responsibilities in
the treaty with South Korea.

10:18.733 --> 10:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think being North Korean
is to believe that, somehow,
if they can get the U.S. out

10:22.133 --> 10:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the equation, they
could reunite the peninsula
on their own terms.

10:26.300 --> 10:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is -- seems farfetched,
but to be a North Korean is not
necessarily to believe in the

10:32.033 --> 10:34.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
conventional wisdom.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there are a lot of North
Koreans who feel there is a lot
of pro-North Korean sentiment

10:36.366 --> 10:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in South Korea, and if only
they could get the U.S. out
of the equation, they could do

10:40.333 --> 10:42.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So I think it's is a very
serious moment and, frankly,
a very dangerous moment.

10:44.533 --> 10:46.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mark Bowden,
what do you make of that?

10:46.533 --> 10:51.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is this really primarily a
development of an offensive
weapon for the potential keeping

10:52.866 --> 10:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. and others at bay
while it retakes South Korea?

10:57.266 --> 11:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK BOWDEN: I do think -- and
I agree with Ambassador Hill
that is the primary reason

11:04.266 --> 11:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for having this weapon, but it
also gives North Korea a lot
more leverage in that region

11:10.800 --> 11:13.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and certainly in dealing
with South Korea.

11:13.833 --> 11:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's conceivable, given the
overtures that the new South
Korean president has made to

11:20.800 --> 11:24.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reopen negotiations with North
Korea, that he could -- Kim
Jong-un could use the possession

11:26.366 --> 11:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a weapon like this to
pressure that those negotiations
take place without the United

11:30.266 --> 11:32.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

11:32.333 --> 11:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think his goal may well
be to get the United States
to withdraw from the Korean

11:36.600 --> 11:38.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Peninsula.

11:38.633 --> 11:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ambassador
Hill, help me understand this
a little bit more, though,

11:40.633 --> 11:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
because we are always told
that, while this regime may be
a despotic regime, that they're

11:44.933 --> 11:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
not out of their minds,
they're not irrational actors.

11:48.666 --> 11:53.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the idea that somehow
the U.S. would allow them
to invade South Korea
just seems unbelievably

11:55.133 --> 11:57.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
farfetched.

11:57.233 --> 12:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HILL: Well, I
mean, if you look at the kind
of weaponry, which tends to be

12:00.900 --> 12:05.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
very offensive, tends
to be right up there
in the front, when you
look at, as Mark pointed

12:07.733 --> 12:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
out, their capacities in
chemical weapons and biological
weapons, if you look at the

12:11.966 --> 12:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fact that they have some
14,000 artillery tubes right
up there in the front pointing

12:19.433 --> 12:22.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
right at the South Korean
civilian populations,
it looks to be a kind
of offensively minded

12:23.966 --> 12:26.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

12:26.066 --> 12:28.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, for a long time,
they have been dedicated to
the proposition that they have

12:28.933 --> 12:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to kind of decouple the U.S.
from the Korean Peninsula and
then a lot of things will fall

12:33.700 --> 12:35.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their way.

12:35.733 --> 12:38.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Mark Bowden,
your piece in "The Atlantic"
laid out what you describe

12:38.966 --> 12:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as the four main options for the
Trump administration to respond.

12:42.333 --> 12:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you imply obviously that
these are largely bad options.

12:46.433 --> 12:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you sort of explain
what suite of options that
the administration has?

12:50.333 --> 12:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK BOWDEN: Well, the obvious
one, people Always bring this
up whenever I'm interviewed

12:54.433 --> 12:58.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the subject, is that,
well, why don't we just attack
North Korea and take out their

12:58.866 --> 13:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
military and
eliminate the threat?

13:01.633 --> 13:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's certainly doable, but
the consequences of that would
be horrific, as the ambassador

13:08.266 --> 13:10.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
just pointed out.

13:10.500 --> 13:15.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Even the conventional weapons
that North Korea has could level
Seoul, a city of 26 million

13:16.133 --> 13:18.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
people.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when you add, you know,
chemical weapons and biological
weapons and potentially nuclear

13:21.066 --> 13:26.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
weapons, you have possibly
one of the greatest
catastrophes in human history.

13:26.066 --> 13:31.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The other possibility is to
sort of turn up the screws, a
series of small-scale military

13:33.066 --> 13:37.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attacks that would kind of ramp
up the pressure on North Korea,
something that could rapidly

13:39.566 --> 13:41.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
descend into an
all-out conflict.

13:41.933 --> 13:46.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Another possibility is to target
Kim Jong-un himself and try
and eliminate him and replace

13:47.700 --> 13:49.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
him.

13:49.733 --> 13:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the last bad option
is just to accept the fact that
we can't stop North Korea from

13:54.466 --> 13:57.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
building these weapons.

13:57.033 --> 14:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, deterrents
are -- you know, in
this case, it would just
be assured destruction

14:01.666 --> 14:04.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - we can hope might
prevent them from using them.

14:04.433 --> 14:06.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ambassador,
last question to you.

14:06.500 --> 14:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president seemed to imply
in his tweet that it's really
upon China to handle this

14:11.333 --> 14:13.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
situation.

14:13.333 --> 14:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have had now three
administrations that have tried
to persuade China to act with

14:16.833 --> 14:18.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
regards to North Korea.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why hasn't that happened yet?

14:20.100 --> 14:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HILL: Well, I
think the Chinese are split.

14:22.833 --> 14:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there's some Chinese
who feel that the demise of
North Korea would be perceived

14:27.233 --> 14:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their country -- that is,
in China -- as a victory for
America and a defeat for China.

14:34.133 --> 14:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they worry about the
perception of that within China,
that is, it's a domestic issue

14:38.000 --> 14:40.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
within China.

14:40.066 --> 14:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there are a lot of people
who want to go with reforms
much faster than Xi Jinping

14:44.300 --> 14:46.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
does.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if North Korea were to
go away, perhaps those people
would be in the ascendancy.

14:48.400 --> 14:53.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, a lot of party
types, security types in
China don't like to see
something that results

14:54.466 --> 14:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in something that looks
like a U.S. victory.

14:57.200 --> 15:01.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That said, I think those
three administrations
are absolutely correct.

15:01.666 --> 15:03.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We need to work more with China.

15:03.633 --> 15:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the problem is President
Trump has more of an outsourcing
notion, that, somehow,

15:08.133 --> 15:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
OK, over to you, China,
you sort this out.

15:10.933 --> 15:15.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will support you, and, by
the way, we will stop calling
you a currency manipulator and

15:15.433 --> 15:17.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
all the other bad things
that you don't like.

15:17.466 --> 15:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, China is not going to
be able to do this alone.

15:20.233 --> 15:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would keep the door open
for negotiation, not that the
North Koreans have shown any

15:24.400 --> 15:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
interest in negotiation.

15:26.466 --> 15:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But having done it for a number
of years, I think it was the
right way to keep our relations

15:30.466 --> 15:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with Japan and South
Korea together, and having
taken a lot of criticism
from people who thought,

15:36.766 --> 15:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how can you think negotiation
is the right answer?

15:39.233 --> 15:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It has to be a factor in it
if you're going to keep others
together with you on the issue.

15:46.300 --> 15:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All
right, Former Ambassador
Christopher Hill, Mark
Bowden of "The Atlantic"

15:49.500 --> 15:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
magazine, thank
you both very much.

15:52.433 --> 15:57.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK BOWDEN: You're welcome.

15:57.200 --> 16:01.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTOPHER HILL: Thank you.

16:01.966 --> 16:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Next: a
legal setback for the Trump
administration and its effort to

16:08.533 --> 16:11.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
reverse environmental
regulations from the
Obama presidency.

16:11.966 --> 16:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yesterday, an appeals court
ruled that the Environmental
Protection Agency cannot delay

16:16.833 --> 16:21.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
implementation of a rule
limiting methane emissions
from new oil and gas wells.

16:23.766 --> 16:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The court said the EPA can
rewrite the rule, but it can't
take the shortcut of suspending

16:26.833 --> 16:28.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
enforcement.

16:28.866 --> 16:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Juliet Eilperin is a reporter
for The Washington Post, and
she's been covering this story.

16:32.100 --> 16:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome back to the "NewsHour."

16:33.500 --> 16:34.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN, The
Washington Post: Of course.

16:34.133 --> 16:35.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Thanks.

16:35.666 --> 16:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Tell me, what
did the court, in essence, rule?

16:37.666 --> 16:41.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: What the
court said is that it wouldn't
necessarily stand in the way if

16:43.900 --> 16:46.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the new administration wanted
to rewrite an existing rule
on the oil and gas industry,

16:46.900 --> 16:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but the administration
couldn't simply suspend
compliance with this rule.

16:50.866 --> 16:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It had to go through a
laborious public comment
process if it wanted to do that.

16:55.366 --> 16:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, this rule
is about methane, which, as you
have reported and many others,

16:59.800 --> 17:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that methane is a particularly
potent greenhouse gas.

17:02.300 --> 17:07.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think it's 25 times
more potent with regards
to warming than CO2 is.

17:08.766 --> 17:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What did this prior, this Obama
administration rule actually do?

17:12.033 --> 17:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: It imposed
new restrictions on oil and gas
wells that are either new or

17:19.033 --> 17:23.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
modified, that if the oil
and gas industry was going to
create a new well or modify an

17:25.833 --> 17:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
existing one, it had to
have tighter restrictions
to lower the releases
of this greenhouse gas

17:33.200 --> 17:38.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as kind of a way that
the administration was
looking to reduce these
emissions across the

17:39.633 --> 17:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
oil and gas industry over time
to slow down climate change.

17:42.900 --> 17:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: EPA
Administrator Pruitt and many
in the industry argue that these

17:47.133 --> 17:52.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
rules -- to enact these
rules was too expensive,
that they also overlap
with state rules that

17:52.733 --> 17:54.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
govern methane.

17:54.766 --> 17:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the EPA also argued that
this -- their move wasn't
subject to judicial oversight,

18:00.966 --> 18:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
which I take it the judges
were not that happy to read.

18:03.200 --> 18:08.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Yes, on a 2-1
ruling -- and it's worth noting
that the majority were two

18:10.666 --> 18:14.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Democratic appointees, the
dissenter was appointed
by a Republican --
said that, essentially,

18:16.366 --> 18:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by doing this, by suspending
the rule, it's essentially
revoking it altogether, and that

18:20.166 --> 18:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is subject to judicial rule.

18:22.133 --> 18:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They also took aim with the
argument that the Environmental
Protection Agency and the

18:25.733 --> 18:30.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
American Petroleum Institute
were making that industry didn't
have sufficient input into

18:30.433 --> 18:32.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the rule.

18:32.566 --> 18:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the argument was, we can
point out all these ways in
which you had to comment and

18:35.433 --> 18:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that the rule addressed
your concerns, maybe
not to your liking, but
they did tackle those

18:40.033 --> 18:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
questions back when they
issued this rule in 2016.

18:42.500 --> 18:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: This move by
the EPA was just one of many,
many attempts by Scott Pruitt

18:49.133 --> 18:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the EPA to push back
on Obama era regulations
that they don't like.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does what the court ruled in
this particular case, in your
mind, have any bearing on those

19:00.200 --> 19:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other attempts that they're
making in other realms
to roll back regulations?

19:03.000 --> 19:06.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: This ruling
appears to have implications,
not only for Scott Pruitt and

19:06.900 --> 19:10.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the EPA, but whether
you're talking about
the Interior Department,
the Labor Department,

19:10.466 --> 19:12.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
other agencies.

19:12.466 --> 19:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are always where
there's an effort under way to
revoke these Obama era rules.

19:18.700 --> 19:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what the court said is,
at least for now, your task is
harder than you thought it was.

19:22.666 --> 19:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't just freeze them in
place, and you're going to face
serious obstacles in your way,

19:29.533 --> 19:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because there will be folks
on the outside challenging it.

19:32.033 --> 19:35.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we think they have merit
and that you need to take a
different course if you're

19:35.466 --> 19:37.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
going to revisit
some of these rules.

19:37.866 --> 19:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: With
regards to other environmental
regulations, most notably,
the president recently

19:43.900 --> 19:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
backed out of the Paris
climate accord, or said that
the U.S. would back out of it.

19:47.266 --> 19:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I know that Scott Pruitt
was among many arguing for that.

19:50.900 --> 19:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a big debate
within the administration,
as you have reported.

19:54.433 --> 19:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Does this give you a sense that,
barring today's - - barring
yesterday's ruling, rather, that

19:59.100 --> 20:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Scott Pruitt has really become
one of the more influential
Cabinet members, in as far

20:03.500 --> 20:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as his ability to do the things
that the president wants done?

20:07.033 --> 20:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JULIET EILPERIN: Absolutely.

20:09.100 --> 20:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that folks who are a
fan of what Scott Pruitt are
doing and those who oppose him

20:15.200 --> 20:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would say that he's clearly
emerged as one of the most
effective Cabinet members.

20:19.766 --> 20:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have seen him already take
action on a slew of policies.

20:22.666 --> 20:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's nearly 30 rules that --
or major decisions that he
has reversed in some ways.

20:29.733 --> 20:32.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so what we're seeing,
is even though he only has a
handful of appointees in place

20:32.966 --> 20:37.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at this point, he has managed
to manipulate the leaders of
power quite effectively in

20:39.900 --> 20:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a way that certainly it is
taking some of his counterparts
in other departments longer

20:43.900 --> 20:45.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to master.

20:45.833 --> 20:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Juliet Eilperin of The
Washington Post, thanks so much.

20:48.633 --> 20:53.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JULIET EILPERIN:
Thank you, William.

20:56.833 --> 21:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Stay with us.

21:00.966 --> 21:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": the
bushmen of the Kalahari Desert
fighting for their ancestral

21:05.833 --> 21:10.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lands; a new way to make beer
that's all the buzz; turning
national parks into classrooms;

21:13.200 --> 21:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and uncovering a creature
that roamed the Earth
13,000 years ago.

21:20.100 --> 21:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But first: It is growing
season for farmers across the
Midwest, and many are faced with

21:23.033 --> 21:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
yet another tough financial
forecast, as corn and soybean
prices remain low, which means

21:28.900 --> 21:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
less money in farmers' pockets.

21:30.966 --> 21:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Nebraska, some producers are
now coming to grips with what
some say is this new reality.

21:35.433 --> 21:38.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
From NET in Nebraska,
Jack Williams reports.

21:38.466 --> 21:43.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARL SOUCEK, Farmer: This
is our little office that we
use as kind of a break room.

21:45.533 --> 21:49.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the center where we
can on the computer or order
parts or things like that.

21:51.000 --> 21:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: On a family
farm in Prague, Nebraska, about
40 miles north of Lincoln,

21:55.033 --> 21:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Carl Soucek is right at home.

21:57.266 --> 22:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His family has been farming
this land since the late 1940s.

22:00.700 --> 22:05.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They grow mostly corn and
soybeans, but the last couple
of years haven't been easy.

22:07.633 --> 22:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
High prices for crops translated
to more income for farmers a
few years ago, but now those

22:12.233 --> 22:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
prices have tumbled, leaving
farmers in a financial ditch.

22:14.800 --> 22:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CARL SOUCEK: The best thing
that ever happened to the corn
industry was $7 corn, and the

22:21.800 --> 22:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
worst thing to happen to it
was $7 corn, because it kind of
threw everything out of balance.

22:25.400 --> 22:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think we will see
the cycle come back.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't know when it's
going to come back.

22:31.566 --> 22:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: While he waits,
Soucek is doing what he can
to cut costs on the farm.

22:38.500 --> 22:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of taking his equipment
to the local implement dealer
for repairs, he has parts

22:41.033 --> 22:44.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
delivered to the farm and
does those repairs himself.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How much money does that save
you, doing your own repairs?

22:46.800 --> 22:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you had to take your tractor
in yourself, how much would
that cost you, compared to

22:51.600 --> 22:53.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you actually doing
this yourself?

22:53.266 --> 22:58.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
CARL SOUCEK: Shop rates
can run anywhere from
$75 to $150 an hour.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And service calls, if they
come out from the dealership to
work on a piece of equipment,

23:04.666 --> 23:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
service calls could be
another $250 on top of that.

23:07.433 --> 23:12.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if it's something we can
take care of ourselves, every
time we do that, we're saving

23:13.166 --> 23:15.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little bit of money.

23:15.200 --> 23:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: Soucek doesn't
apologize for enjoying the
good times a few years ago.

23:19.533 --> 23:24.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says farming isn't always
easy, and when prices of crops
such as corn and soybeans

23:24.200 --> 23:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
shot up, many farmers' earnings
increased, and they enjoyed
a higher standard of living.

23:31.166 --> 23:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a lot different than
the days when they had to
watch every penny they spent.

23:33.300 --> 23:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CARL SOUCEK: If we need to
go back to that, we will.

23:36.233 --> 23:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think we have already.

23:38.333 --> 23:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're careful about our family
living, and been there, done
that, and we will do it again

23:43.933 --> 23:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
if we need to tighten
our belt that much.

23:45.933 --> 23:49.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: At a recent
economic workshop in Lincoln,
farmers and ranchers got a dose

23:50.366 --> 23:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of economic reality.

23:53.933 --> 23:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With falling prices of corn,
soybeans and wheat bringing
farmers less income, many are

24:00.366 --> 24:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
facing more debt, tighter
margins and an uncertain future.

24:03.166 --> 24:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're looking for guidance
as they try to navigate through
the down times without too

24:07.033 --> 24:09.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much damage.

24:09.033 --> 24:10.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAY PARSONS, University of
Nebraska-Lincoln: They have seen
the good times, they have seen

24:10.066 --> 24:11.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the bad times.

24:11.066 --> 24:13.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They know nothing lasts forever.

24:13.066 --> 24:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they keep track of things
and they monitor things and
they're aware of things.

24:16.100 --> 24:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's probably a decent
number of people out there that
haven't had that perspective

24:20.933 --> 24:24.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and are still trying to
adjust to the new situation.

24:24.033 --> 24:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: Economic factors,
such as high land costs and
skyrocketing property taxes,

24:30.466 --> 24:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are testing the resolve
of some Midwest producers.

24:33.066 --> 24:37.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that might actually
be a good thing for their
long-term financial health.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA BARRETT, Director, Nebraska
Farm Business, Inc.: Tough
times make better managers.

24:39.733 --> 24:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if I think about the
producers I work with, those
who had tough times in the '80s

24:44.700 --> 24:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are great managers today,
because they had to learn how
to make those tough choices,

24:48.633 --> 24:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they had to learn how to manage
their business like a business,
and they continued to do

24:55.466 --> 24:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that through the profitable
times and made a lot
of money through that.

JACK WILLIAMS: Dave Nielsen
is a third-generation
farmer in Lancaster County
in Eastern Nebraska,

25:04.133 --> 25:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
where he grows corn and
soybeans on about 2,000 acres.

25:07.600 --> 25:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His father and grandfather
worked this ground before him,
so he's seen the good and bad

25:12.266 --> 25:14.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
times.

25:14.333 --> 25:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says the younger farmers
who got into the business a
few years ago when prices were

25:17.066 --> 25:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
high are the ones who feel
the downturn the most.

25:20.266 --> 25:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVE NIELSEN, Farmer:
It was really tough on
young guys starting then.

25:26.666 --> 25:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Young guys starting in those
glory years, wow, this is easy.

25:28.700 --> 25:32.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a lot of youth that
came back to the farm, maybe
left jobs in town and came

25:32.766 --> 25:36.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
back to the family
farm, to the farm.

25:36.566 --> 25:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, now it's a
whole different ball game.

25:40.200 --> 25:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now it's, you really
have to watch what you're
spending on inputs and
family living and that.

25:47.100 --> 25:51.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: Nielsen probably
won't lime his soil this
year and, like Carl Soucek in

25:51.266 --> 25:55.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Prague, he's doing a lot of
his own repairs to save money.

25:55.233 --> 25:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he's taking a hard look
at the rest of his expenses.

25:57.833 --> 26:00.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
DAVE NIELSEN: Every
good operation should,
even in the good times.

26:00.933 --> 26:02.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Really, you should.

26:02.966 --> 26:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You probably -- just a little
sharper pen or a little
sharper pencil when you're in

26:07.866 --> 26:09.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the downturn.

26:09.900 --> 26:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JACK WILLIAMS: For the "PBS
NewsHour," I'm Jack Williams
in Lincoln, Nebraska.

26:18.233 --> 26:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now we
travel to Botswana in Southern
Africa to meet a tribe who are

26:27.433 --> 26:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fighting their government
to retain the right to live
on their ancestral lands.

26:32.033 --> 26:35.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They were forced off in
part because their lands
are rich with diamonds.

26:35.900 --> 26:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Special correspondent Martin
Seemungal has our story.

26:38.400 --> 26:43.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Their clothes
are modern, but their tools
of the hunt are thousands

26:44.000 --> 26:45.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of years old.

26:45.666 --> 26:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The San bushmen still use the
spear and the bow and arrow.

26:52.866 --> 26:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Botswana's enormous Central
Kalahari Game Reserve is their
home, and one of the last

26:59.833 --> 27:03.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
places on the planet where
you can find bushmen who still
hunt and gather to survive.

27:04.633 --> 27:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The San have been tracking
like this for generations.

27:07.200 --> 27:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Technically, it's illegal,
because the government
has banned hunting inside
the Central Kalahari

27:11.800 --> 27:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Game Reserve, but some
of them do it anyway.

27:14.833 --> 27:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They say it's very
difficult to stop because
it defines who they are.

27:19.300 --> 27:24.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tolme Etata's first memories
are of hunting this land.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"If we stop hunting, our culture
would be affected," he says.

27:28.733 --> 27:33.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"Hunting and gathering
is part of us."

27:35.666 --> 27:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Though it is part of them,
it is not part of the plan
for the Central Kalahari Game

27:38.533 --> 27:41.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Reserve, as Botswana's
government sees it.

27:41.900 --> 27:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The San bushmen's way of life
and culture are under threat.

27:46.500 --> 27:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their struggle to remain here,
in a place originally set
aside for them in the 1960s,

27:53.333 --> 27:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
goes back to a major discovery
in the 1980s: diamonds.

28:00.400 --> 28:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By the mid-1990s, the hunt for
precious stones in vast open pit
mines like this meant eviction

28:05.933 --> 28:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from the reserve for
the hunter-gatherers.

28:08.233 --> 28:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mohulude Moete says it was done
by soldiers and military police.

28:15.633 --> 28:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He says: "We were given
instructions: If you
don't get into the
truck, we will shoot you.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some of our water containers
were emptied into the ground.

28:23.233 --> 28:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We had no options, so we had to
go along with them or be shot."

28:30.666 --> 28:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These women were young
when the authorities came
for them, but say the
memories are unforgettable.

28:33.133 --> 28:36.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MUDIKOLELO LEMTODI,
Removed Person: All the
houses were destroyed.

28:36.433 --> 28:40.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Houses that they used
their energies to
built were destroyed.

28:40.233 --> 28:42.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL:
Wells were sealed up.

28:42.600 --> 28:46.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In spite of that, small
numbers refused to leave.

28:46.033 --> 28:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there were more evictions,
another big one in 2002.

28:49.366 --> 28:54.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The government denied any
connection between the evictions
and diamonds in the Central

28:55.100 --> 28:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kalahari Game Reserve.

28:57.133 --> 29:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It said the bushmen were
being moved out to protect
the wildlife in the reserve.

29:03.000 --> 29:04.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Botswana's president at
the time was Festus Mogae.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
QUESTION: Will you let the
bushmen go home, Mr. Mogae?

29:06.666 --> 29:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FESTUS MOGAE, President of
Botswana: Where is home?

29:08.233 --> 29:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Home is in Botswana.

29:09.266 --> 29:10.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

29:10.266 --> 29:11.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
QUESTION: In the CKGR.

29:11.266 --> 29:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Will you let them go home?

29:12.266 --> 29:14.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
FESTUS MOGAE: No, no.

29:14.300 --> 29:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: The semi-arid
Kalahari Desert is a harsh
place, but it's livable, if you

29:16.933 --> 29:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
know where to gather,
along with the hunt.

29:20.266 --> 29:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether its roots buried deep
in the sandy soil or wild
melons worth a day's water, all

29:30.100 --> 29:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of their sparse
world is put to work.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Traditional huts comes
from the desert brush.

29:35.866 --> 29:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Onjustice Xothelo says two
days' work will last a decade.

29:42.066 --> 29:44.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The roof is a type
of grassy thatch.

29:44.066 --> 29:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ONJUSTICE XOTHELO, San Bushman:
The thatching grass on top
won't allow even water to get

29:49.366 --> 29:51.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in.

29:51.366 --> 29:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: But the
government wanted fewer bushmen
staying in, and the evictions

29:53.466 --> 29:57.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
from this land continued
for nearly 10 years.

29:57.333 --> 30:00.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Bushmen were relocated
to new settlements.

30:00.500 --> 30:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This one is called New
Xade, named for the village
they were forced to leave.

30:05.200 --> 30:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
New Xade is just 50 miles from
the Kalahari, but it might
as well be 5,000 miles away.

30:11.533 --> 30:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Officially, nobody
is allowed to return.

30:14.900 --> 30:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the years, some have
tried to recreate life in the
villages, but they say it's just

30:20.500 --> 30:22.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
not the same.

30:22.366 --> 30:25.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can find those traditional
huts among the small
government-built houses.

30:25.966 --> 30:30.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"Building the structures here
is a reminder to us that we
had these huts in Kalahari,"

30:31.433 --> 30:32.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
he says.

30:32.366 --> 30:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"But our ancestors aren't here.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We build them to
remind us what we had."

30:36.700 --> 30:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
New Xade has good roads, a
modern clinic and a school.

30:41.133 --> 30:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But beyond government-related
jobs, there is little else.

30:44.533 --> 30:47.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: I'm looking
for a job, a job.

30:47.133 --> 30:48.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Right.

30:48.133 --> 30:50.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's nothing to do here?

30:50.166 --> 30:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Yes, we have nothing
to do, so, dying for
hunger, looking for job.

30:56.633 --> 31:00.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: There is a
small mountain of beer cans
outside the one building that

31:00.700 --> 31:05.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
does do big business:
the local bar.

31:05.133 --> 31:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Alcohol abuse is rampant,
leading some to criticize the
government for creating these

31:15.566 --> 31:18.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
relocated towns.

31:18.033 --> 31:22.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Survival International, an
agency that works to protect
indigenous people, has been the

31:22.766 --> 31:24.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
most vocal.

31:24.866 --> 31:29.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A spokesperson with survival
says, it is clear that it
is not a viable way of life.

31:30.000 --> 31:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It is not based on choice.

31:32.233 --> 31:36.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It deprives people of
their meaning, their
sense of well-being.

31:36.833 --> 31:41.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Survival helped the
bushmen in Botswana's
courts, a proposition
that ended up winning

31:41.266 --> 31:43.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in 2006.

31:43.200 --> 31:48.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The high court ruled the bushmen
had been removed unfairly
and should be allowed to

31:48.666 --> 31:50.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
return.

31:50.766 --> 31:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the government decided
it would read the court
ruling very selectively.

31:53.633 --> 31:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only bushmen who'd brought the
suit would be allowed to return.

31:57.800 --> 32:02.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mosetayani Matsipane was there
for the court case and heard
the judges' ruling, and could

32:03.900 --> 32:06.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
return.

32:06.433 --> 32:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ten years later, he is
the leader of Motlomelo,
one of a handful of
small bushmen settlements

32:10.866 --> 32:12.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the reserve.

32:12.900 --> 32:17.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The government says
it is working with the
villages to restore some
basic services, like

32:18.000 --> 32:19.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
access to water.

32:19.600 --> 32:23.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It also wants to focus
on community-based
tourism projects.

32:23.300 --> 32:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Matsipane is happy to be out
of New Xade, but he doesn't
think the government's attitude

32:29.266 --> 32:30.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
has changed.

32:30.733 --> 32:35.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He believes they still want
him out of the reserve.

32:35.133 --> 32:37.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"I continually get
pressure," he says.

32:37.633 --> 32:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"The government has been doing
the same thing as before.

32:40.633 --> 32:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But I would rather
they take my dead body.

32:43.100 --> 32:44.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I won't go back."

32:44.766 --> 32:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His wife, Hakanyaziwe, says
this is where she belongs.

32:51.466 --> 32:55.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
"What's important to me
is the fruit of the land
in Kalahari," she says.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"In the resettlement camps,
everything is about money.

32:58.766 --> 33:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you don't have money, people
end up stealing to survive."

33:02.366 --> 33:07.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Professor Maitseo Bolaane
is the director of the San
Research Center, a small office

33:10.733 --> 33:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
at the University of
Botswana in Gaborone.

33:13.633 --> 33:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She believes the San people
are a resource that can be used
for the good of the Kalahari

33:21.466 --> 33:23.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAITSEO BOLAANE,
Director, San Research
Center: They have ideas.

33:23.433 --> 33:26.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can contribute their
knowledge system in the
utilization of the resources.

33:26.900 --> 33:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARTIN SEEMUNGAL: Inside the
CKGR, those small communities
hold on, numbers dwindling every

33:33.900 --> 33:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
year, living in the hope that
others will be able to return.

33:37.833 --> 33:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For now, it is only them,
dancing in the desert
under the Kalahari stars.

33:45.466 --> 33:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "NewsHour,"
I'm Martin Seemungal in
the Central Kalahari.

33:53.666 --> 33:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On this
Independence Day, many Americans
will no doubt be enjoying a

34:07.766 --> 34:09.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
beer or two.

34:09.133 --> 34:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
One of the essential
ingredients in beer is yeast.

34:11.700 --> 34:16.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for 600 years, only two
species of yeast, ale yeast
and lager yeast, have been used

34:17.433 --> 34:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for traditional brewing.

34:19.433 --> 34:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But now a lab in North Carolina
may have found a third species,
and they found it in the

34:23.400 --> 34:26.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
strangest of places,
on bees and wasps.

34:26.833 --> 34:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"NewsHour" science
producer Nsikan Akpan
and our "ScienceScope"
team reveal what the buzz

34:31.533 --> 34:33.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is all about.

34:33.533 --> 34:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: It feels like
beer brewers will do anything
to spice up their booze.

34:39.433 --> 34:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's pizza beer, banana
split chocolate stout, beer
with squid ink, and, of course,

34:44.466 --> 34:48.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Rocky Mountain oyster
stout, which is flavored
with bull testicles.

34:50.566 --> 34:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All this fuss seems silly, when
the foundation of alcohol's
flavor is plain old yeast.

34:53.900 --> 34:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yeast, these little
microbes that take sugars
and ferment them into
alcohol, define a beer's

34:58.633 --> 35:01.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
character.

35:01.233 --> 35:04.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Yet, for 10,000 years,
beers have essentially
relied on two types of
bland yeast that basically

35:05.233 --> 35:07.266 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
add no flavors.

35:07.266 --> 35:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now a lab in North Carolina
has discovered a new yeast
species that produces an array

35:11.133 --> 35:13.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of flavors without
added ingredients.

35:13.900 --> 35:14.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Where did they find it?

35:14.966 --> 35:17.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
On bees.

35:17.233 --> 35:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The story of bumblebeer
begins at North Carolina
State University, in
the lab of Rob Dunn.

35:29.000 --> 35:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once a tropical forest
ecologist, Dunn now explores the
jungle that surrounds us, the

35:33.666 --> 35:35.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one filled with
bugs and microbes.

35:35.666 --> 35:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB DUNN, North Carolina State
University: At some point,
my lab shifted to focusing

35:38.233 --> 35:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more on people's daily
lives, and that includes
food, and it includes
thinking about the biology

35:42.900 --> 35:45.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of food.

35:45.333 --> 35:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: One day three
years ago, a colleague
inquired if the lab
knew of any microbes in

35:48.633 --> 35:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the environment
capable of making beer.

35:52.433 --> 35:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dunn and company instantly
considered insect pollinators,
like bees and wasps.

35:57.033 --> 35:58.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here's why.

35:58.933 --> 36:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Yeast hang out in flower
nectar, where the microbes feast
on the boatloads of sugar.

36:02.933 --> 36:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They then produce or ferment
sweet aromas, which then
attract the buzzing bugs.

36:07.800 --> 36:12.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROB DUNN: We actually
think, based on some
work from colleagues in
Italy, that it's very

36:14.733 --> 36:17.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
likely that those first beers
and breads were relying on
yeasts from insects, too.

36:17.033 --> 36:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Back then, a bug
carrying a fermenting yeast
may have fallen into some

36:21.266 --> 36:22.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wet grain.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, boom, welcome
to the booze cruise.

36:24.700 --> 36:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, some scientists argue
human agriculture started just
to mass produce grains to make

36:30.166 --> 36:31.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beer.

36:31.700 --> 36:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The more beer we drink, the
more yeast we have to grow.

36:34.500 --> 36:38.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROB DUNN: Unambiguously,
the most successful organism
in the world is yeast.

36:38.400 --> 36:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so if you think about all
of the yeasts we make everywhere
for many of the products

36:43.000 --> 36:45.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we make, they won.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: But, today, where
would you even start looking
for a new beer-making yeast?

36:49.266 --> 36:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN, North Carolina
State University: Part of this
is science, and part of this

36:52.633 --> 36:55.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
feels more like an art
that's hard to describe.

36:55.033 --> 36:58.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Meet Anne Madden,
the Dunn lab's microbe wrangler.

36:58.766 --> 37:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To search for unknown yeast,
she started by catching a
wild bee and a wild wasp.

37:05.366 --> 37:08.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She then transferred
every microbe from their
bodies to a petri dish.

37:08.233 --> 37:09.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Don't fret.

37:09.466 --> 37:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She didn't commit
mass bug-icide.

37:11.433 --> 37:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN: To make bumblebeer
and all of the different
bumblebeers that we have made

37:16.400 --> 37:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since, we have killed two bugs.

37:18.466 --> 37:22.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have likely killed more
bugs on your way to a bar to get
beer than we did in the process

37:22.666 --> 37:24.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of making it.

37:24.633 --> 37:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: A couple
days later, a forest of
microbes appear on the dish.

37:27.800 --> 37:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then, in four steps,
Madden combines her
senses with technology.

37:31.733 --> 37:35.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, she looks to separate the
yeast from bacteria or fungi.

37:35.766 --> 37:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN: It's about
understanding when something
glistens in a certain way.

37:39.833 --> 37:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Next, she picks
a handful of yeast candidates,
grows them on a new dish,

37:44.133 --> 37:46.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and then follows her nose.

37:46.166 --> 37:50.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN: You can smell
the same smell both on that
plate and in that final beer.

37:52.166 --> 37:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: Her third task
is running the DNA from these
candidates through a national

37:54.600 --> 37:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
database to ensure her
picks don't cause disease.

37:57.433 --> 38:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE MADDEN: It's almost like
a Google search through all
other species that exist that

38:03.233 --> 38:05.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have been documented.

38:05.366 --> 38:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The final step
is a chemical test, because
despite the long history of

38:08.533 --> 38:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
brewing, the genes and enzymes
responsible for fermentation
are largely unknown.

38:14.966 --> 38:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The survivors of this gauntlet
land with John Sheppard at N.C.

38:17.633 --> 38:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
State's research brew house.

38:20.266 --> 38:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN SHEPPARD, North
Carolina State University:
In traditional beers that
are lighter in character,

38:23.633 --> 38:28.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like the traditional
American lager, for
example, you don't want to
overwhelm your taste, and

38:30.366 --> 38:33.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
so what the yeast does
is very important.

38:33.533 --> 38:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A lot of wild yeasts, which
are considered contamination
in a normal brewing process,

38:40.533 --> 38:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the reason why they're not
wanted is because they produce
a lot of off-flavors that are

38:43.933 --> 38:46.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
not really desirable
in the beer.

38:46.133 --> 38:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to get a wild yeast
that doesn't produce these
off-flavors can be difficult.

38:53.100 --> 38:56.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, we did a little testing
to see whether or not the
yeast strains would be able to

38:57.033 --> 39:00.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make beer, and we selected one.

39:00.366 --> 39:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It came from a wasp, because
this special yeast not only
makes ethanol, but makes acid,

39:06.833 --> 39:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, as a result of that,
we had a natural sour beer.

39:11.533 --> 39:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NSIKAN AKPAN: The bumblebeer
yeast makes other flavors too,
like a sweet honey taste without

39:16.233 --> 39:18.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the addition of actual honey.

39:18.000 --> 39:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Craft sour beers often take
months or years to make.

39:21.266 --> 39:24.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Bumblebeer yeast can do the
same in a matter of weeks.

39:24.233 --> 39:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Local brewers have taken notice.

39:26.566 --> 39:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The first suds made with
bumblebeer yeast rolled
out earlier this year.

39:30.633 --> 39:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Until next time, I'm
Nsikan Akpan, and this
is "ScienceScope" from
the "PBS NewsHour."

39:37.566 --> 39:40.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Nsikan tasted
one of those beers and said
that it was quite delicious.

39:40.533 --> 39:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
You can read about how
scientists are using
this discovery to find
more beer-producing

39:45.233 --> 39:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
yeasts made in the wild.

39:47.400 --> 39:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

39:56.200 --> 40:01.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, on this Fourth of July,
with many Americans spending at
least part of the day outside,

40:04.433 --> 40:09.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kavitha Cardoza of our partner
Education Week returns with an
encore look at what students

40:10.833 --> 40:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can learn in the classroom
of the great outdoors.

40:12.233 --> 40:14.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's part of our weekly
series Making the Grade.

40:14.933 --> 40:17.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO, National
Park Service: Nice big circle.

40:17.166 --> 40:19.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Come on in.

40:19.166 --> 40:23.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Fourth graders
from Pennycook Elementary
School will soon see something

40:23.133 --> 40:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they have never seen before.

40:24.866 --> 40:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO: So, welcome to
the Redwood Forest, everyone.

40:27.833 --> 40:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Even though
they live in Oakland, just 45
minutes away, most have never

40:33.566 --> 40:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been to a national park.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You might call it a
sensory experience.

40:37.300 --> 40:40.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO, National Park
Service: Aaron, can you tell
us, what is another way we can

40:40.366 --> 40:41.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
observe nature?

40:41.433 --> 40:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: Like, with our nose?

40:43.933 --> 40:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO: With our noses.

40:46.433 --> 40:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Ranger
Aracely Montero leads the tour.

40:51.300 --> 40:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The children approach the
first stand of redwoods.

40:54.033 --> 40:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO: We are
now inside of the magical
forest of Muir Woods.

41:00.166 --> 41:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Oh, my God.

41:01.900 --> 41:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ARACELY MONTERO: Everyone,
take a good look up.

41:05.466 --> 41:07.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Whoa.

41:07.633 --> 41:11.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ARACELY MONTERO: We're
now standing under one
of the tallest living
things in the world.

41:13.166 --> 41:17.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: In
this classroom, students
use all their senses.

41:17.733 --> 41:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: This one feels thick.

41:19.766 --> 41:22.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: It feels really
thick, doesn't it?

41:22.633 --> 41:24.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUDENT: It smells like salt.

41:24.666 --> 41:26.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: Look up there.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Those are clusters of ladybugs.

41:28.333 --> 41:31.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It's like a
whole country of them.

41:31.233 --> 41:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Teacher Darlene
Wong says that place-based
learning, having children

41:35.000 --> 41:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
learn by experiencing subjects,
rather than simply reading
about them, teaches skills

41:39.900 --> 41:41.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
like critical thinking.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DARLENE WONG, Teacher:
Show me your evidence.

41:44.333 --> 41:48.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What evidence do you have
to prove what you're saying
or what you're writing here?

41:48.033 --> 41:49.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Whoa.

41:49.033 --> 41:51.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's so big.

41:51.566 --> 41:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The
National Park Service's
educational programs
serve approximately seven

41:56.433 --> 41:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
million children every year.

41:59.033 --> 42:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rangers conduct teacher
workshops, go on classroom
visits, and, perhaps
most importantly, create

42:04.300 --> 42:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
curriculum for these trips
based on state standards.

42:08.066 --> 42:10.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This class is learning
about California habitats.

42:10.766 --> 42:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMAN: Ooh, look what I found.

42:12.933 --> 42:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Without these
programs, Wong says she couldn't
have brought her class to

42:16.733 --> 42:18.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the forest.

42:18.700 --> 42:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DARLENE WONG: In terms of
testing and what we have to
cover in terms of curriculum and

42:22.100 --> 42:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
time, it's really -- it would
be really hard to justify it.

42:27.033 --> 42:29.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Julia Washburn
went from junior ranger...

42:29.266 --> 42:30.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIA WASHBURN, National
Park Service: It still fits.

42:30.666 --> 42:31.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: It still fits.

42:31.866 --> 42:33.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA:
... to park ranger.

42:33.866 --> 42:37.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now she oversees all
educational programs for
the National Park Service.

42:37.400 --> 42:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA WASHBURN: It's one
thing to read about a wetland,
for example, in a textbook.

42:45.366 --> 42:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a very different
thing to be standing up to your
thighs in mud in a swamp or in

42:55.433 --> 43:00.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a wetland, such
as the Everglades.

43:03.433 --> 43:05.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It just really makes
the learning tangible
and very relevant, so
students can understand

43:05.000 --> 43:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
why they're learning something,
not just what they're learning.

43:06.433 --> 43:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The
source of the excitement?

43:07.600 --> 43:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Long-legged bugs
called water striders.

43:11.500 --> 43:16.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What's not as easily
seen are the challenges
facing the Park Service.

43:17.233 --> 43:19.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Budgets are down.

43:19.266 --> 43:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's 10 percent fewer staff
than five years ago, and the
next generation of park visitors

43:22.966 --> 43:25.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is uncertain.

43:25.733 --> 43:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Using national parks
as classrooms isn't
just about learning.

43:29.533 --> 43:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's also about growing the next
generation of park visitors.

43:32.600 --> 43:35.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GRACE LEE, Executive Director,
National Park Trust: If we
don't engage young people of

43:35.966 --> 43:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
color right now with our parks,
then, 100 years from now,
we are very concerned that

43:42.933 --> 43:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
there won't be the celebration
of the 200th anniversary of
the National Park Service.

43:45.933 --> 43:48.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Grace Lee
heads the National Park Trust.

43:48.966 --> 43:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They raise money for 20,000
kids to visit parks every year.

43:52.466 --> 43:57.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GRACE LEE: They have been
studies that have done recently
that have shown, of the almost

43:57.266 --> 44:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
300 million people that have
gone to national parks in the
last couple of years each year,

44:04.266 --> 44:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that a very small percentage of
them are young people, and even
a smaller percentage of them

44:08.566 --> 44:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are children of color.

44:11.500 --> 44:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Fifty years
ago, the National Park Service
partnered with AAA and Chevrolet

44:20.033 --> 44:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to reach returning World War
II veterans and their families,
creating the generation of

44:26.433 --> 44:28.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
park users we see today.

44:28.633 --> 44:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Aging baby boomers remain
the largest percentage
of park visitors overall.

44:33.033 --> 44:36.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JONATHAN JARVIS, Director,
National Park Service:
What we're feeling now
is that there's a new

44:36.666 --> 44:40.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
generation that is more
urban, more diverse.

44:40.833 --> 44:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe they are first-generation
immigrants to the United States,
first-generation citizens.

44:47.800 --> 44:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Maybe they came from a country
that didn't have public
lands or parks or a tradition

44:50.466 --> 44:52.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of that.

44:52.533 --> 44:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so we are reaching the
kids and they're bringing
their parents to the parks.

44:58.866 --> 45:02.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Jon Jarvis,
the director of the National
Park Service, says America's

45:02.966 --> 45:06.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
parks must tell the
country's evolving story.

45:06.066 --> 45:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN JARVIS: Filling in
the gaps, as I would say,
in the American narrative.

45:09.233 --> 45:12.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We have added sites for civil
rights, like Harriet Tubman.

45:12.266 --> 45:17.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We added Stonewall, which
tells the story of the LGBT
civil rights movement as well.

45:19.233 --> 45:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We need to be telling that
story, so that all Americans
feel part of the patriotic and

45:23.800 --> 45:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
symbolic values that
this nation embodies.

45:26.733 --> 45:31.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Jarvis
says they have also
embraced technology,
Webcams, online chats,

45:34.133 --> 45:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
even video games.

45:35.633 --> 45:38.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
National Park sites are
actually Pokemon GO sites?

45:38.466 --> 45:40.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JONATHAN JARVIS: They are.

45:40.100 --> 45:42.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They are.

45:42.200 --> 45:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Pokemon GO community has
spread these little monsters
all over the National Park

45:48.533 --> 45:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Service, and we're
embracing that, because
it's getting people outside
and getting -- using

45:51.500 --> 45:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
technology in a way that sort of
connects them to these places.

45:55.200 --> 45:57.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Whoa.

45:57.300 --> 46:00.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: Here
in the Redwood Forest,
these 10-year-olds have
found something better

46:00.400 --> 46:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
than Pokemon GO characters.

46:02.033 --> 46:03.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Turkeys.

46:03.066 --> 46:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Gobble, gobble.

46:05.066 --> 46:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JONATHAN JARVIS: The evidence
shows that when kids are exposed
to the place, they learn,

46:11.266 --> 46:15.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
they retain, they become
more interested and more
excited about learning.

46:15.700 --> 46:16.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
STUDENT: Whoa.

46:16.933 --> 46:21.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: How do you
feel right now?

46:23.366 --> 46:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: Being in the Redwood
Forest makes me feel happy.

46:32.400 --> 46:34.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
STUDENT: Being in the
Redwood Forest makes
me want to meditate.

46:34.933 --> 46:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUDENT: Being in the Redwood
Forest makes me feel short.

46:35.933 --> 46:38.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

46:38.000 --> 46:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: The director
of the Park Service hopes
that using parks as classrooms

46:39.066 --> 46:41.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is just the beginning.

46:41.233 --> 46:44.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JONATHAN JARVIS: What I
wanted to do was to say
that the National Park
Service is a contributor

46:44.933 --> 46:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to American education,
both for students, but for
lifelong learning as well.

46:49.300 --> 46:54.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KAVITHA CARDOZA: For the "PBS
NewsHour" and Education Week,
I'm Kavitha Cardoza, reporting

46:54.000 --> 46:58.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the Golden Gate National
Recreation Area in California.

46:58.166 --> 47:02.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Continuing
our theme of national parks,
the Channel Islands National

47:02.666 --> 47:06.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Park -- they're off the coast
of Southern California -- was
the site of a recent discovery

47:06.800 --> 47:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of part of a Pygmy mammoth, a
species of ancient elephant that
roamed the Earth 13,000 years

47:12.833 --> 47:15.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

47:15.400 --> 47:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This story was produced
by students from Etiwanda
High School in Southern
California, part of

47:18.166 --> 47:20.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the "NewsHour"'s
Student Reporting Labs.

47:20.200 --> 47:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's narrated by rising high
school senior Nick Hinojosa.

47:23.800 --> 47:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Off the
California coast lies
Channel Islands National
Park, where archaeological

47:30.300 --> 47:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
discoveries are
still being made.

47:32.433 --> 47:36.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Laura Kirn is the chief of
cultural resources for the
Channel Islands National Park.

47:36.166 --> 47:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA KIRN, Chief of
Cultural Resources, Channel
Islands National Park:
Channel Islands national

47:37.833 --> 47:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
park is world-famous
for its archaeology.

47:40.800 --> 47:45.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Channel Islands really represent
a part of California that
doesn't exist on the mainland

47:46.300 --> 47:48.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
anymore.

47:48.333 --> 47:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And because we don't
have burrowing animals
here, the archaeological
record, the evidence

47:54.633 --> 47:57.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the ground is intact.

47:57.700 --> 48:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And that is unheard of.

48:00.233 --> 48:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: The
preservation of the islands'
archaeology has made it
possible for new artifacts

48:03.533 --> 48:08.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to be discovered, such as a
mammoth skull excavated in
fall 2016 on Santa Rosa Island.

48:10.466 --> 48:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Monica Bugbee, a preparator and
archaeologist for the mammoth
site in South Dakota, has

48:14.533 --> 48:18.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
begun the painstaking
process of removing the
skull from its plaster cast.

48:18.566 --> 48:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONICA BUGBEE, Preparator:
This is kind of an
exciting discovery
because Pygmy mammoths,

48:22.600 --> 48:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even though they're really
cool, everybody likes them
because they're small, they're

48:26.166 --> 48:28.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neat, we actually don't
know a whole lot about them.

48:28.233 --> 48:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This guy was found by a
park service intern who
was doing a stream survey.

48:32.733 --> 48:37.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, they were just doing
routine walk down a canyon,
and they happened to notice it.

48:39.700 --> 48:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: The intern who
discovered the skull, Peter
Larramendy, was a recent college

48:41.933 --> 48:45.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
graduate who recognized the
tusk sticking out of the wall
could be something much more

48:45.666 --> 48:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
than just a rock.

48:46.833 --> 48:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LAURA KIRN: He was
part of the excavation.

48:48.833 --> 48:53.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was something that you dream
about as a child, discovering
something like a dinosaur

48:54.166 --> 48:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or something really exciting.

48:56.733 --> 49:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Don Morris
is a retired archaeologist
for the National Park
Service who aided in

49:00.200 --> 49:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the excavation of
this discovery.

49:02.266 --> 49:06.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DON MORRIS, National
Park Service: I think
I can confidently say
this is the best skull,

49:07.866 --> 49:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Pygmy mammoth skull, that's
ever come off the island.

49:10.200 --> 49:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Certainly, it's the best
one I have ever seen.

49:12.933 --> 49:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MONICA BUGBEE: This skull
in particular, because
it looks like it might
be in the middle of

49:17.533 --> 49:22.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two species, Columbian and
Pygmy, it can give us a much
better idea of how that process

49:23.133 --> 49:24.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
actually worked.

49:24.833 --> 49:27.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You know, how did they
actually dwarf from
Columbians to Pygmies?

49:27.900 --> 49:32.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Scientists used
radiocarbon dating to discover
how long ago this mammoth

49:32.466 --> 49:34.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was alive.

49:34.433 --> 49:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This kind of dating is done
by measuring the amount of
carbon-14 in a sample and using

49:38.033 --> 49:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
its half-life to calculate
how old the sample is.

49:40.566 --> 49:45.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MONICA BUGBEE: There was some
charcoal that we found in the
dirt, and we radiocarbon dated

49:45.333 --> 49:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that, and it's about 15,000
years old, I believe, so this
guy's actually pretty young.

49:52.366 --> 49:55.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Justin Wilkins,
a curator at the mammoth site,
has been working with Bugbee

49:55.533 --> 49:57.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to clean and prepare
the skull for display.

49:57.600 --> 50:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUSTIN WILKINS, Curator: So
in looking at the past, we can
then access how our species

50:04.000 --> 50:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or other species handled
changes in the environment.

50:06.300 --> 50:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we look at the mammoths.

50:07.866 --> 50:09.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We look at humans.

50:09.933 --> 50:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We also look at a bunch of
small animals to see how those
animals handle these changes,

50:16.333 --> 50:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and then try to decide, predict,
based on the information and
patterns we see from these

50:19.466 --> 50:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
specimens, what patterns we're
seeing in the present, how
that's going to change in the

50:24.266 --> 50:26.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
future.

50:26.566 --> 50:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK HINOJOSA: Much
of archaeology still
depends on careful
observation and human work.

50:28.733 --> 50:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DON MORRIS: You have
got to move dirt.

50:30.800 --> 50:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have got to keep your
eyes open and pay attention
to what you're observing.

50:35.000 --> 50:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LAURA KIRN: It's incredibly
exciting to think that
these things are still
out here, they're

50:41.933 --> 50:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
still very fragile, and we
want to protect them and
study them in the right ways.

50:45.700 --> 50:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it doesn't mean that people
can't still discover exciting
new things that happen to

50:52.133 --> 50:56.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be thousands of years
old on Santa Rosa Island.

50:58.833 --> 51:02.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And now to
a "NewsHour" Shares, something
that caught our eye here

51:09.233 --> 51:11.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that may be of interest to you.

51:11.333 --> 51:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you think of the most
popular sports in the world,
even us Americans know that

51:14.866 --> 51:16.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
soccer is number one worldwide.

51:16.766 --> 51:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But what about number two?

51:18.500 --> 51:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Believe it or not, it's cricket.

51:20.600 --> 51:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now that English game
is starting to catch on
in the United States.

51:24.433 --> 51:28.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tina Martin from PBS station
WGBH in Boston reports.

51:28.466 --> 51:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Suiting up,
stretching out and getting in a
little batting practice before

51:36.366 --> 51:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a cricket match on a
remote field in Wrentham.

51:43.900 --> 51:46.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's an unusual game that
most resembles baseball,
except you have a bowler
instead of pitcher,

51:48.133 --> 51:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the ball has to
bounce before you hit it.

51:50.500 --> 51:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Games can last for hours,
even days, and scores
go into the hundreds.

51:54.966 --> 51:57.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NITIN MEWEDA, Player: I
am completely into it.

51:57.233 --> 52:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TINA MARTIN: Nitin
Meweda has played since
he was a boy in India.

52:00.566 --> 52:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says American co-workers
were often confused
about his favorite sport.

52:04.666 --> 52:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NITIN MEWEDA: That's one thing
which used to happen with me
maybe five, six years ago.

52:08.800 --> 52:10.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I would say -- they
would say, what did
you do this weekend?

52:10.800 --> 52:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I was like, oh,
I played cricket.

52:12.100 --> 52:14.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they were like,
cricket, what is that?

52:14.133 --> 52:17.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Cricket was played
in the United States back in
colonial times, but had pretty

52:17.700 --> 52:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
much died out by the Civil War.

52:20.566 --> 52:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it has thrived
in other parts of the
world, with international
matches that are among

52:27.666 --> 52:30.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the most watched
global sporting events.

52:30.133 --> 52:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
At some games, there are
even royal photo-ops.

52:33.133 --> 52:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RAVI UPPALAPATI, Organizer:
Cricket in India is a religion.

52:36.733 --> 52:41.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's more than three times
the population of the United
States, and there is one sport.

52:43.600 --> 52:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Can you imagine like, in States,
if you have one professional
sport all over the year,

52:48.300 --> 52:49.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
how crazy it would be, right?

52:49.266 --> 52:51.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It is crazy.

52:51.366 --> 52:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Most of the players
in Massachusetts are immigrants,
representing far corners of

52:55.066 --> 52:57.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the world.

52:57.200 --> 52:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAVI UPPALAPATI: Most of us
are from India, but there are
a lot of people from Pakistan,

52:59.333 --> 53:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and other countries, Sri Lanka,
and Australia, and England.

53:02.600 --> 53:07.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: Ravi Uppalapati
is one of the organizers of
the Massachusetts State Cricket

53:08.066 --> 53:09.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
League.

53:09.533 --> 53:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He says they now have
several thousand players.

53:11.600 --> 53:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RAVI UPPALAPATI: I think there
were 12 teams in Massachusetts
Cricket League in probably

53:16.100 --> 53:18.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
'97.

53:18.033 --> 53:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are more than 30-plus
teams now, so things
have picked up so much.

53:24.066 --> 53:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: The MSCL is trying
to create a new generation of
players, sponsoring clinics

53:27.700 --> 53:28.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and camps.

53:28.900 --> 53:31.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
RAVI UPPALAPATI: You
see lacrosse these days.

53:31.000 --> 53:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Last two, three years,
nobody was playing lacrosse.

53:34.300 --> 53:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kids are loving lacrosse.

53:35.933 --> 53:40.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
So it's just a matter of
like how we introduce,
where we introduce.

53:40.400 --> 53:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TINA MARTIN: A bigger
challenge might be educating
the parents on what
they're actually watching

53:44.766 --> 53:46.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their kids play.

53:46.400 --> 53:50.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Tina Martin in
Wrentham, Massachusetts.

53:50.333 --> 53:53.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And an update
on North Korea before we go.

53:53.700 --> 53:58.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
U.S. Secretary of State
Rex Tillerson confirmed
that the missile North
Korea launched today

53:58.200 --> 54:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was in fact an intercontinental
ballistic missile.

54:01.300 --> 54:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He called for stronger measures
to hold North Korea accountable.

54:04.066 --> 54:09.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the U.S. military has just
confirmed that U.S. and South
Korean forces today carried

54:11.500 --> 54:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out a military exercise
to counter what they
called North Korea's
destabilizing and unlawful

54:15.233 --> 54:17.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
actions.

54:17.333 --> 54:21.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: The electric guitar has
long been a symbol of American

54:21.133 --> 54:22.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cool.

54:22.466 --> 54:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, why is its
popularity now declining?

54:24.533 --> 54:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're hosting a Twitter chat
on Thursday at 1:00 p.m. to
discuss the art of the guitar

54:29.033 --> 54:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and the future of music.

54:30.533 --> 54:35.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Learn more on our Web
site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

54:36.566 --> 54:37.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the "NewsHour"
for tonight.

54:37.366 --> 54:38.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm William Brangham.

54:38.866 --> 54:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Join us online and again
right here tomorrow night.

54:40.733 --> 54:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour," thank
you, and see you soon.
