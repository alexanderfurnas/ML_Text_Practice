JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate Republican
leaders have spent this day
behind closed doors trying

00:05.033 --> 00:09.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win over more of
their own members in the
health care reform fight.

00:09.500 --> 00:14.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
has delayed any action until
after the Fourth of July

00:16.466 --> 00:19.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
recess, but a spokesman says
he hopes to have a revised
bill as soon as Friday.

00:21.533 --> 00:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the White House, President
Trump suggested the effort is
working along very well, despite

00:25.533 --> 00:27.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the obstacles.

00:27.033 --> 00:27.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: It's very tough.

00:27.966 --> 00:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Every state is different.

00:28.900 --> 00:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Every senator is different.

00:30.900 --> 00:35.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have to tell you, the
Republican senators had a really
impressive meeting yesterday

00:36.500 --> 00:38.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
at the White House.

00:38.666 --> 00:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we're going to get at
least very close, and I think
we're going to get it over the

00:43.100 --> 00:45.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
line.

00:45.766 --> 00:46.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Later, the
president told reporters
- - quote -- "We're going
to have a big surprise

00:46.466 --> 00:47.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on health care."

00:47.433 --> 00:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He didn't say what that meant.

00:49.566 --> 00:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will hear about all of this
from Republican Senator John
Thune after the news summary.

01:07.933 --> 01:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a pro-Russian political
party in Ukraine.

01:11.533 --> 01:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He resigned from the Trump
campaign last August, when word
of his consulting work leaked.

01:18.500 --> 01:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In March of this year, Michael
Flynn, who had been fired
as the president's national

01:21.433 --> 01:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
security adviser, also
registered as a foreign agent.

01:25.733 --> 01:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Businesses and governments
around the globe spent a second
day battling a cyber-attack.

01:32.666 --> 01:36.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The so-called ransomware assault
eased some today, but in the
U.S., a subsidiary of FedEx

01:38.000 --> 01:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was disrupted, and a
Cadbury chocolate factory in
Australia had to shut down.

01:44.300 --> 01:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In London, British Defense
Secretary Michael Fallon said
it is verging on an act of war.

01:50.433 --> 01:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL FALLON, U.K. Defense
Secretary: State or nonstate
entities, lurking behind a veil

01:55.900 --> 01:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of encryption, targeting
our national infrastructure,
as we saw with the
recent cyber-strike on

02:00.833 --> 02:04.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Parliament itself,
that isn't a cold war.

02:04.833 --> 02:08.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a gray war, permanently
teetering on the edge
of outright hostility.

02:08.500 --> 02:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The outbreak
began in Ukraine, where it has
done the most damage so far.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will take a closer
look later in the program.

The months-long unrest
in Venezuela took a
dramatic turn overnight.

police helicopter opened fire
on the nation's Supreme Court

02:28.866 --> 02:30.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and Interior Ministry.

02:30.866 --> 02:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Amateur video captured
images of the helicopter,
before it disappeared.

02:34.733 --> 02:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Officials charged the
mastermind of the plot was a
rogue police pilot and actor.

02:41.733 --> 02:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Opponents of socialist President
Nicolas Maduro suggested that
the raid could be a government

02:46.633 --> 02:49.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ploy to justify
increased repression.

02:49.966 --> 02:54.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

largest rebel group now face

into society.

people, most of them police
officials, were charged today

03:15.433 --> 03:18.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in a 1989 soccer
stadium disaster.

03:18.633 --> 03:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are accused of offenses
ranging from negligence to
manslaughter in the deaths of

03:24.366 --> 03:26.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
96 people.

03:26.400 --> 03:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

thousands of people rushed
into a crowded section of a

03:31.400 --> 03:33.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
stadium.

03:33.466 --> 03:36.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police blamed rowdy fans,
but the families finally
won a new investigation.

03:36.733 --> 03:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TREVOR HICKS, Father of
Victims: I mean, there
are no winners in this.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It doesn't bring anybody
back from the disaster.

03:42.233 --> 03:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But what it does do, it sends a
message out of accountability,
as we keep saying, that

03:47.166 --> 03:50.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
nobody, but nobody is
above the law, be it the
police or anybody else.

03:50.900 --> 03:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The accused
include the man who was leading
police operations at the stadium

03:55.866 --> 03:57.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that day.

security measures for
flights coming into the U.S.

04:05.033 --> 04:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They include enhanced
screening of electronic
devices and passengers.

04:12.066 --> 04:15.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Airlines that comply could
be exempt from an earlier
ban on carry-on laptops.

04:16.633 --> 04:20.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Those that don't comply
may face a total ban
on electronic devices.

in Britain.

04:45.433 --> 04:49.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bond first introduced the
marmalade-loving teddy in "A
Bear Called Paddington" in 1958.

04:51.800 --> 04:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That led ultimately to more
than 20 books, several TV
shows and a 2014 movie.

04:57.766 --> 04:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
