JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.933 --> 00:07.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:07.933 --> 00:11.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
On the "NewsHour"
tonight: President
Trump suggests Congress
repeal Obamacare even if

00:11.866 --> 00:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they cannot craft a replacement.

00:14.300 --> 00:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We talk with Senator Roy Blunt
of Missouri about Republicans'
push to salvage their bill.

00:21.200 --> 00:25.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then: a new approach to policing
in one of the country's most
violent cities by getting

00:26.966 --> 00:30.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
officers out of their cars
and engaged with the community
in Camden, New Jersey.

00:30.900 --> 00:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT THOMSON, Camden, New
Jersey, Police Chief: We saw,
almost instantaneously, a change

00:37.400 --> 00:39.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the atmosphere
within neighborhoods.

00:39.900 --> 00:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what people wanted
from us, and it has helped us
significantly, and for us to

00:47.400 --> 00:50.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
provide better policing
services to them as well.

00:50.066 --> 00:52.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:52.166 --> 00:57.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
From health care reform
to controversial tweets,
Mark Shields and David
Brooks analyze the

00:57.833 --> 00:59.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
weeks news.

00:59.466 --> 01:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

01:06.266 --> 01:09.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:09.100 --> 01:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senate
Republicans have begun
the Fourth of July recess
with President Trump

01:18.700 --> 01:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
urging them to get rid of
Obamacare, even if they
can't replace it yet.

01:25.666 --> 01:28.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In a tweet this morning, he
said: "If Republican senators
are unable to pass what they are

01:30.833 --> 01:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
working on now, they should
immediately repeal, and then
replace at a later date."

01:36.000 --> 01:38.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The White House said later
that it is still - - quote --
"fully committed" to getting a

01:38.266 --> 01:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
bill through the Senate.

01:40.366 --> 01:45.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president's feud with cable
news hosts Mika Brzezinski
and Joe Scarborough escalated

01:45.900 --> 01:48.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
today.

01:48.533 --> 01:51.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump drew widespread
condemnation yesterday
for crudely criticizing
Brzezinski's appearance

01:53.266 --> 01:55.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and intelligence.

01:55.300 --> 01:59.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the "Morning Joe" team
on MSNBC charged the White
House had threatened them with a

02:00.266 --> 02:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
tabloid expose last spring.

02:02.833 --> 02:07.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC: We got
a call that, hey, The National
Enquirer is going to run

02:09.000 --> 02:11.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a negative story
against you guys.

02:11.100 --> 02:16.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it was, you know --
Donald is friends with -- the
president's friends with the guy

02:16.966 --> 02:19.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that runs The National Enquirer.

02:19.133 --> 02:24.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And they said, if you
call the president up,
and you apologize for
your coverage, then

02:28.333 --> 02:32.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he will pick up the phone and
basically spike the story.

02:32.866 --> 02:37.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The
National Enquirer said
that it was unaware of
any discussions involving

02:37.666 --> 02:40.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the White House and the
"Morning Joe" hosts.

02:40.266 --> 02:44.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The president answered
Scarborough's allegation
another tweet.

02:44.266 --> 02:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He said -- quote -- "Fake news.

02:46.433 --> 02:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He called me to stop a
National Enquirer article.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I said no."

02:51.633 --> 02:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A scaled-back version of
President Trump's travel ban
is now in force, affecting six

02:57.600 --> 03:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
mostly Muslim nations
and refugees in general.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It took effect late Thursday.

03:02.600 --> 03:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There were scattered protests
in Los Angeles and other
cities, but none of the airport

03:07.300 --> 03:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
chaos that had greeted the
original order in January.

03:11.366 --> 03:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, Hawaii asked
a federal judge to
expand the list of those
eligible beyond immediate

03:17.500 --> 03:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
family members of those
already in the U.S.

03:21.566 --> 03:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
China lodged a public protest
today over U.S. plans to sell
$1.4 billion in arms to Taiwan.

03:29.166 --> 03:33.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Foreign Ministry said
that the move runs counter to
President Trump's commitment to

03:33.533 --> 03:35.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the one-China policy.

03:35.766 --> 03:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Beijing considers Taiwan
to be a renegade province.

03:39.600 --> 03:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Separately, Chinese President
Xi Jinping was in Hong Kong
to mark the 20th anniversary

03:45.666 --> 03:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the city's
handover from Britain.

03:47.633 --> 03:52.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He greeted thousands of Chinese
troops at an army garrison,
a display aimed at groups

03:53.800 --> 03:56.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
calling for Hong
Kong's independence.

03:56.200 --> 03:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Xi made clear that
China is not letting go.

03:59.333 --> 04:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
XI JINPING, Chinese President
(through translator):
After 20 years of Hong
Kong's return to the

04:03.733 --> 04:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
motherland, the practice of
one country, two systems has
gained universally acknowledged

04:08.166 --> 04:10.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
success.

04:10.533 --> 04:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, we have encountered
some new situations,
new problems and new
challenges in the practice.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is not horrible
to have problems.

04:15.966 --> 04:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The point is to figure out
some ways to solve them.

04:18.533 --> 04:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Chinese
Foreign Ministry also
caused a stir, dismissing
the 1997 agreement

04:24.700 --> 04:26.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Britain.

04:26.666 --> 04:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A spokesman said it --
quote -- "no longer has any
practical significance."

04:30.533 --> 04:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
There is word that the
flow of refugees out
of Syria has reversed.

04:35.166 --> 04:40.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.N. Refugee Agency
reports nearly half-a-million
Syrians have returned
to their homes this

04:40.700 --> 04:42.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Most have returned to areas
where government forces have
regained control after years of

04:46.500 --> 04:48.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
fighting.

04:48.533 --> 04:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Back in this country, a gunman
opened fire at a hospital in
New York City, killing one

04:54.700 --> 04:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doctor and seriously
wounding several others,
before taking his own life.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police said the shooter was also
a doctor who had once worked
at the Bronx Lebanon Hospital.

05:04.633 --> 05:07.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Emergency crews and
heavily armed police
descended on the scene.

05:07.800 --> 05:12.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Officials said it was an
isolated incident, and
not an act of terror.

05:12.666 --> 05:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Local and federal authorities
in Chicago unveiled new efforts
today to cut the flow of illegal

05:18.833 --> 05:22.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
guns, including adding
more federal agents.

05:22.066 --> 05:27.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The announcement came as
President Trump tweeted
that crime and killings
in Chicago have reached

05:28.000 --> 05:30.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
epidemic proportions.

05:30.200 --> 05:33.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Officials in the city
said there's actually
been some improvement,
but they also welcomed

05:33.966 --> 05:35.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the federal help.

05:35.966 --> 05:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOEL LEVIN, U.S. Attorney:
Significant progress is being
made in the effort to combat the

05:39.600 --> 05:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violence in Chicago, but the
level of violence continues at
an unacceptable level, and it

05:46.066 --> 05:49.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is a battle which can only be
fought with all hands on deck.

05:49.966 --> 05:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That is state, federal,
and local law enforcement.

05:52.333 --> 05:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As of Sunday,
there have been more than
1,300 shootings in Chicago this

05:57.866 --> 05:59.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
year.

05:59.366 --> 06:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's down from nearly 1,600
at the same point last year.

06:03.266 --> 06:08.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Firefighting crews are making
progress against a wildfire that
threatened to engulf an Arizona

06:08.733 --> 06:11.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
town.

06:11.233 --> 06:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials reopened a
major roadway in Prescott
Valley today, north of
Phoenix, and hundreds

06:14.300 --> 06:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of people were allowed
back into their homes.

06:16.833 --> 06:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
A few thousand others
are still in shelters.

06:20.266 --> 06:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Wall Street today, the Dow
Jones industrial average gained
62 points to close at 21349.

06:27.333 --> 06:32.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The Nasdaq fell about
four points, and the
S&amp;P 500 added three.

06:32.166 --> 06:37.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Both the Dow and the S&amp;P
were up 8 percent for the
first half of the year.

06:37.066 --> 06:40.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is the Dow's best
showing since 2013.

06:40.500 --> 06:44.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose 14 percent,
its best since 2009.

06:44.433 --> 06:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And on a lighter note,
Crayola is asking for help
naming a new shade of blue.

06:51.433 --> 06:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Out of 90,000 submissions, the
top five contenders are, dreams
come blue, star-spangled blue,

06:58.433 --> 07:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
blue moon bliss, reach
for the stars, my
favorite, and blue-tiful.

07:05.366 --> 07:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can vote on Crayola's
Web site starting tomorrow
through August 31.

07:10.533 --> 07:14.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Senator Roy Blunt joins us
to talk health care wrangling

07:14.066 --> 07:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on the hill; rebuilding a
police force in one of America's
most violent cities; President

07:21.233 --> 07:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump meets with South Korea's
president; and much more.

07:35.000 --> 07:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now to the ongoing struggle
to craft a health care reform
bill in the U.S. Senate.

07:41.966 --> 07:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republican lawmakers
are scrambling to draft
a new version of their
bill before leaving

07:44.966 --> 07:47.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Washington for the
July fourth recess.

07:47.200 --> 07:52.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A short time ago, I spoke with
Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri,
who is vice chair of the

07:53.066 --> 07:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Senate Republican Conference.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I begin by asking where
the efforts to find
compromise stand right now.

07:58.533 --> 08:00.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:00.133 --> 08:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROY BLUNT (R), Missouri: I think
it's challenging and challenged.

08:02.266 --> 08:07.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We will see what happens, but
this is a difficult topic that
touches every American family.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the more members of the
Senate and the House both know
about it, I think the harder

08:11.700 --> 08:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it is to reach that conclusion
you would like to get to.

08:14.366 --> 08:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well,
there are reports, as
you know, news reports
that the majority leader,

08:18.633 --> 08:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mitch McConnell, is trying to
come up with accommodations
to appeal to both sides of

08:22.433 --> 08:25.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
this argument, to
moderate Republicans.

08:25.366 --> 08:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the stories is that
he's considering keeping the
tax on high-income individuals

08:31.800 --> 08:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in order to pay for more of
the gaps in Medicaid coverage.

08:35.933 --> 08:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, by the way, the
Congressional Budget Office is
saying the cuts to Medicaid are

08:40.400 --> 08:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
going to be much deeper than
thought in the future years.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

08:45.633 --> 08:49.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: Well, I think what
they're saying is, in the
second 10 years, you have even

08:50.466 --> 08:52.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
more substantial savings.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, remember, there
are no cuts to Medicaid.

08:54.400 --> 08:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Every year in Medicaid, you
spend more money than you spent
the year before under this

08:58.600 --> 09:03.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan, but the growth is not
as great as it would be if you
continued to pay, for instance,

09:03.366 --> 09:07.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
100 percent for single
able-bodied adults.

09:07.033 --> 09:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have got a plan where the
states were told, OK, we will
pay 100 percent for able-bodied

09:14.100 --> 09:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
single adults, but we're only
going to pay an average of 52
percent for mothers and their

09:18.166 --> 09:19.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
young children.

09:19.900 --> 09:22.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now, there is something
wrong with the way that
system is put together.

09:22.366 --> 09:25.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But
keeping that tax on
higher-income individuals,
is that being looked at?

09:25.633 --> 09:26.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: I think it is.

09:28.700 --> 09:30.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think everything is being
looked at, both on the revenue
side and on the expenditure

09:30.866 --> 09:35.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
side and trying to reach that
point where 50 Republicans,
that might include the vice

09:35.400 --> 09:40.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president being one of the 50,
is -- are being added to that
50 is what it takes to get this

09:41.833 --> 09:43.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
done.

09:43.900 --> 09:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: One of
the other things we're
seeing, a potential
way of appealing to the

09:46.733 --> 09:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
moderates, adding $45 billion or
so for opioid abuse treatment.

09:52.900 --> 09:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that something else
that's on the table?

09:54.333 --> 09:56.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

09:56.400 --> 09:59.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: It's a problem that
Congress has really taken on
in the last couple of years.

09:59.733 --> 10:04.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I started sharing the
committee that appropriates
money for health and
human services two years

10:05.200 --> 10:06.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
ago.

10:06.933 --> 10:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We tripled that year the
money that was being - -
to be spent on opioids.

10:12.333 --> 10:13.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Legislation sort
of followed that.

10:13.266 --> 10:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then we doubled that tripling.

10:15.266 --> 10:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, at some point, there's
a limit to how many times we
can multiply that in a short

10:21.300 --> 10:23.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
period of time, but
this is a real problem.

10:23.700 --> 10:27.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In Missouri, more people
die from drug overdoses
than car accidents.

10:27.433 --> 10:32.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a first-responder
in Missouri as part of a fire
department, you're three times

10:32.000 --> 10:36.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more likely to respond to a drug
overdose than you are a fire.

10:36.466 --> 10:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So it's a problem.

10:38.633 --> 10:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't know exactly what the
right number is, but certainly
I think members of the Senate

10:41.200 --> 10:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and House are rightly
concerned about it.

10:43.233 --> 10:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to appeal
to conservatives, we're reading
that the majority leader is

10:46.700 --> 10:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
giving more options for coverage
plans, allowing people, in
other words, to have a choice of

10:53.633 --> 10:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
some less costly, cheaper
plans, in effect, that would
provide less coverage, but would

10:59.533 --> 11:00.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
give them more choices.

11:00.566 --> 11:01.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROY BLUNT: Give
them more choices.

11:03.300 --> 11:05.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It might also provide some
more up-front coverage.

11:05.400 --> 11:10.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think one of the lessons we
should have learned from what's
happened with the current

11:12.266 --> 11:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
plan is that there is insurance
coverage, but there is not
really, many times, access

11:16.200 --> 11:18.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to health care.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you have these high
deductibles, there is every --
there is a disincentive to get

11:20.666 --> 11:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the policy, because you would
have to pay another -- I think
the average of deductible

11:25.133 --> 11:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
policies on the individual
market is $6,000 per individual
before the insurance really

11:31.300 --> 11:35.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
kicked in, and if two of
you got sick, $12,000.

11:35.200 --> 11:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Makes it hard to make that
decision, particularly
when you think what
your family needs is the

11:39.766 --> 11:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first $1,000 that covers the
kids getting sick with the
flu or something like that.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you
think the chances are now that
you're going to be able to come

11:47.300 --> 11:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up with something that passes?

11:49.400 --> 11:53.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I ask this because President
Trump tweeted this morning, he
said, "If Republican senators

11:53.266 --> 11:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are unable to pass what they
are working on now, they should
immediately repeal and then

11:59.166 --> 12:00.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
replace at a later date."

12:00.900 --> 12:02.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:02.366 --> 12:05.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: Well, it's pretty
late to come up with a new plan.

12:05.533 --> 12:09.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The hypotheticals are never
legislatively what you
want to be talking about.

12:09.566 --> 12:12.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You want to be talking
about what you're
focused on at the time.

12:12.533 --> 12:17.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's fair to say that
it's hard to get 50 senators
out of 52 to vote for a package

12:20.733 --> 12:22.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this complicated.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, Judy, the more that
members know about this, in
many ways, the harder it is

12:28.833 --> 12:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to make that final decision,
because you have got so much
information, and you know how

12:31.133 --> 12:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many other things are impacted
here by one decision here
that, five decisions later,

12:37.500 --> 12:39.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has made a big difference
in somebody's life.

12:39.566 --> 12:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, if you
can't get it passed in July,
do you just set it aside?

12:42.433 --> 12:43.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:43.933 --> 12:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: Well, I think we have
had a three-step plan in mind.

12:47.066 --> 12:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We pass this bill that did as
much as we could to kind of
clear the way for Democrats and

12:55.066 --> 12:57.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Republicans to work
together later.

12:57.933 --> 13:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The secretary of health and
human services would look at
the 1,400-plus rules that the

13:04.900 --> 13:08.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
law gave that person the
ability to define and see how
those could be better defined,

13:08.400 --> 13:13.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
so they were better for
families, better for
access and then, when
that's done, get down

13:15.433 --> 13:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the real work of Republicans
and Democrats working together
to do things you can do outside

13:21.833 --> 13:24.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the budget restraints
of the way we're trying
to do this first step.

13:24.333 --> 13:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if the first step doesn't
work, then you just go to, I
guess, a two-step process, and

13:28.533 --> 13:30.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it will take longer.

13:30.633 --> 13:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Where
you do finally work with
Democrats, Democrats and
Republicans together?

13:32.533 --> 13:33.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:33.533 --> 13:34.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ROY BLUNT: Right.

13:34.533 --> 13:35.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last thing...

13:35.533 --> 13:36.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROY BLUNT: And that's
going to happen.

13:38.833 --> 13:40.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That has to happen to expand
the way more people can get
more insurance in groups, to

13:40.300 --> 13:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
look at things like more
transparency from providers.

13:43.433 --> 13:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That eventually has to happen.

13:45.466 --> 13:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it doesn't have to
happen to stabilize the
moment we're in right now.

13:49.933 --> 13:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The insurance markets,
the individual markets
are collapsing.

13:52.633 --> 13:57.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
A third of the counties
in America now only
have one company that's
willing to offer an

13:58.833 --> 14:01.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
insurance product
on the exchange.

14:01.700 --> 14:04.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The estimate for next year is
over 40 percent of the counties.

14:04.966 --> 14:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And if you only have would
be choice, you really
don't have any choice.

14:08.233 --> 14:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You either buy that policy or
pay the penalty, and all those
things will happen if we don't

14:13.966 --> 14:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
change the current law.

14:16.033 --> 14:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Last thing I want
to ask you about, Senator Blunt,
and that is the president's

14:18.166 --> 14:20.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
tweets.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A lot of attention has been
diverted in the last few
days to the president's
tweets criticizing

14:23.866 --> 14:28.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
cable news hosts Joe
Scarborough, Mike
Brzezinski, in her case in
very harsh personal terms.

14:30.700 --> 14:31.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What's your reaction?

14:31.833 --> 14:33.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:33.866 --> 14:37.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: Well, there's no
doubt that cable news hosts can
say things that the president

14:37.533 --> 14:40.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States
shouldn't say, and people
can be harsh at you.

14:40.433 --> 14:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That doesn't mean you
benefit by being harsh back.

14:44.166 --> 14:49.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think, generally,
the president's tweets
are not helpful to him.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, he's figured
out a way to communicate with
people in ways that no other

14:54.600 --> 14:56.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
president has, or he
wouldn't be president.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do those
tweets help his agenda
and the Republican agenda?

15:00.566 --> 15:02.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:02.066 --> 15:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: They sometimes they
do and they sometimes don't.

15:04.133 --> 15:08.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there needs to be
a much more significant
filter on those tweets.

15:09.733 --> 15:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's OK to have some unspoken
and untweeted thoughts.

15:12.933 --> 15:16.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Senator Roy
Blunt of Missouri, thank you
very much for joining us.

15:16.966 --> 15:17.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:17.966 --> 15:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROY BLUNT: Nice to be with you.

15:21.600 --> 15:26.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to
President Trump's repeated
and unsubstantiated
claim that three to five

15:34.666 --> 15:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
million votes were cast
illegally in the 2016 election.

15:39.500 --> 15:44.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He set up a special
commission to investigate,
but one of its first acts
has drawn condemnation

15:45.233 --> 15:46.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
from across the country.

15:46.833 --> 15:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Hari Sreenivasan
is here with that.

15:48.800 --> 15:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yesterday, the
vice chair of that commission
sent a letter to all 50

15:55.466 --> 15:58.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
states asking for voter data
that includes addresses,
party I.D., voter history, and

16:00.366 --> 16:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Social Security information.

16:02.400 --> 16:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The commission asked that data
be sent to the White House
by mid-July, but didn't say

16:06.766 --> 16:11.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
how it would be used,
other than to examine for
vulnerabilities in the system.

16:12.933 --> 16:14.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We take a closer look
now with Rick Hasen.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He is a law professor
at the University of
California, Irvine.

16:17.166 --> 16:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He writes the Election Law blog.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Rick, the "NewsHour"'s
been reaching out to
states all day long.

16:22.533 --> 16:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have got nine definite
no's, 18 that might comply in
whole or in part, and a few

16:27.433 --> 16:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other states that are
still looking at it.

16:29.533 --> 16:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Often, what we hear there is
that there are apparently laws
on the books in certain states

16:33.700 --> 16:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that prohibit, even if it's
public information, who can look
at the information and why it

16:38.200 --> 16:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
can be looked at.

16:39.333 --> 16:41.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Explain.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK HASEN, University of
California, Irvine: Well, some
of this information, depending

16:43.300 --> 16:45.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
on the state, is
available publicly.

16:45.300 --> 16:46.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People can buy it.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Some of this is not available.

16:48.300 --> 16:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, in fact, just before we
came on, I saw a story that Kris
Kobach himself, the personal

16:54.533 --> 16:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
who has asked for this
information, he himself
cannot produce the
Social Security numbers

16:56.833 --> 17:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that he has demanded because
that would violate the law
in the state of Kansas.

17:00.600 --> 17:03.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This doesn't seem to have
been very well thought out.

17:03.266 --> 17:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Not only do we not know what
the information is going
to be used exactly to do.

17:07.400 --> 17:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't appear that this
information even legally can be
provided by a lot of the states.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, Kris
Kobach, as his role as secretary
of state of Kansas, can't

17:14.566 --> 17:16.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
provide the information
that he's asking for, right?

17:16.333 --> 17:17.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN: To himself.

17:17.333 --> 17:18.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That's right.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Got it.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All right, what about the
scope of the investigation?

17:22.833 --> 17:26.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There seems to be a lot of
focus on measuring or protecting
the integrity one person, one

17:26.800 --> 17:28.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
vote.

17:28.800 --> 17:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't see any description in
here about any Russian meddling
that might have happened.

17:31.133 --> 17:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK HASEN: Well, so it's
not clear exactly what this
commission is going to do.

17:35.000 --> 17:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Initially, the president said
he wanted to look into the
potential for voter fraud.

17:39.400 --> 17:43.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a couple of Democrats
on the commission who said that
they wanted to look into Russian

17:43.566 --> 17:45.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
meddling.

17:45.666 --> 17:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kobach said he might be open
to that, but that wasn't on
the list of questions that

17:49.166 --> 17:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was sent to various
state election officials.

17:52.100 --> 17:55.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's not clear what this
group is going to do, what
it's going to produce.

17:55.066 --> 17:59.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I'm concerned that
it's going to be something
that is just going to try
to support the president's

17:59.566 --> 18:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
agenda, claiming that there's
a lot of voter fraud, and use
that to make it harder for

18:03.533 --> 18:06.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people to be able
to register to vote.

18:06.066 --> 18:09.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is this
the kind of information
that a campaign really
would pay money for?

18:09.800 --> 18:14.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICK HASEN: Well, in some
states, campaigns do pay money
for this kind of information.

18:16.800 --> 18:20.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The fact that the
information is going to
sent to the president's
office is concerning.

18:22.433 --> 18:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Rather than having
outside professional staff
or rather than having
social scientists who

18:25.733 --> 18:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
study this information, we know
that this information is going
literally to the executive

18:31.466 --> 18:32.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
office of the president.

18:32.666 --> 18:34.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We don't know how
it's going to be kept.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We don't know how secure
it's going to be, on
what kind of servers.

18:36.100 --> 18:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't have any information.

18:38.133 --> 18:41.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the concerns about privacy,
about identity theft, about
the information being used for

18:41.433 --> 18:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
political purposes, I think
these are all legitimate
questions to be asked.

18:44.766 --> 18:48.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And, finally,
is there a question here on the
role of the federal government?

18:48.533 --> 18:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There seemed to be some pushback
from states when it came to
the Department of Homeland

18:51.833 --> 18:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Security going out to them,
saying we have this potential
for hacking, we would like

18:55.000 --> 18:56.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to help you secure
your networks.

18:56.466 --> 18:58.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN: Absolutely.

18:58.666 --> 19:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There has been this long
tradition, especially on
the Republican side, of
talking about federalism

19:02.066 --> 19:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and states' rights in this area.

19:04.066 --> 19:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're even seeing some
pushback now from states like
Mississippi that are saying they

19:07.433 --> 19:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are not going to cooperate
with providing this information
to the federal government.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All
right, Rick Hasen, a
professor at University
of California, Irvine,

19:13.633 --> 19:14.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
thanks so much.

19:14.633 --> 19:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
RICK HASEN: Thank you.

19:19.433 --> 19:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

19:29.266 --> 19:34.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
Mark Shields and David Brooks
take on the week's news;

19:34.166 --> 19:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and the dangers of
relying on statistics
and numbers in medicine.

19:38.700 --> 19:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But first: President
Trump hosted South Korea's
new president at the
White House today, the

19:45.700 --> 19:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
first meeting between the two
leaders, who are looking for
a common approach to dealing

19:49.300 --> 19:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with North Korea.

19:50.866 --> 19:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has that.

19:52.900 --> 19:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: President
Moon Jae-in arrived at the White
House with tensions over North

19:57.466 --> 19:59.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Korea still running high.

19:59.966 --> 20:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the Rose Garden, President
Trump pressed again for ending
the North's nuclear and weapons

20:04.233 --> 20:06.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
programs.

20:06.333 --> 20:09.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP, President
of the United States:
The era of strategic
patience with the North

20:09.700 --> 20:12.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Korean regime has failed.

20:12.366 --> 20:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Many years, and it's failed.

20:14.533 --> 20:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And, frankly, that
patience is over.

20:18.900 --> 20:23.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're working closely with
South Korea and Japan as well
as partners around the world

20:23.300 --> 20:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
on a range of diplomatic
security and economic
measures to protect
our allies and our own

20:32.900 --> 20:37.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
citizens from this menace
known as North Korea.

20:37.633 --> 20:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: North
Korea, led by Kim Jong-un, has
already test-launched more than

20:44.300 --> 20:47.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a dozen missiles this
year, all in defiance of
international sanctions.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
South Korea President Moon has
long advocated for diplomatic
engagement with Pyongyang.

20:52.733 --> 20:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And since taking office just
last month, he's delayed full
deployment of the U.S. THAAD

20:58.933 --> 21:01.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
anti-missile defense
system in his country.

21:01.266 --> 21:05.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, though, he warned
of a stern response
to any provocations.

21:05.066 --> 21:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MOON JAE-IN, South Korean
President (through translator):
The North Korean nuclear issue

21:08.333 --> 21:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
must be resolved, without fail.

21:10.500 --> 21:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I also urge Pyongyang
to promptly return to
the negotiating table
for denuclearization

21:16.000 --> 21:18.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of the Korean Peninsula.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
President Trump and I
will employ both sanctions
and dialogue in a
phased and comprehensive

21:21.366 --> 21:23.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
approach.

21:23.433 --> 21:26.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And based on this, we both
pledged to seek a fundamental
resolution of the North Korean

21:26.133 --> 21:28.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
nuclear problem.

21:28.133 --> 21:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Meanwhile,
the U.S. has sought China's
help in trying to rein in North

21:31.700 --> 21:34.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Korea.

21:34.366 --> 21:37.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
However, yesterday, the
administration announced
sanctions against Chinese
companies and individuals

21:39.166 --> 21:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
over their alleged illicit
dealings with North Korea.

21:41.500 --> 21:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But U.S. officials insisted
they weren't targeting
the Chinese government.

21:45.566 --> 21:49.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today, neither President
Trump nor President
Moon mentioned China.

21:49.333 --> 21:54.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On a different subject,
Mr. Trump again criticized
the U.S. trade deficit
with South Korea, and

21:55.566 --> 21:59.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
blamed a 2011 free trade
deal for the imbalance.

21:59.566 --> 22:03.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He called for new action
to reduce trade barriers
between the two countries.

22:03.833 --> 22:06.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For his part, Moon played
down the trade issue.

22:06.600 --> 22:11.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he announced that the
president and Mrs. Trump have
accepted his invitation to visit

22:11.366 --> 22:13.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
South Korea later this year.

22:13.400 --> 22:17.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, where do things
stand between the U.S.
and South Korea, and
how will the two nations

22:17.666 --> 22:19.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
deal with the North?

22:19.233 --> 22:21.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For that, we turn
to Robert Gallucci.

22:21.200 --> 22:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was the chief U.S. negotiator
back in 1994 when the Clinton
administration persuaded

22:28.533 --> 22:31.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the North Koreans to dismantle
their plutonium-based
nuclear program in exchange
for economic benefits.

22:33.333 --> 22:37.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is now a professor
at Georgetown University
and chair of the U.S.
Korea Institute at Johns

22:37.266 --> 22:38.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Hopkins University.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Welcome to the "NewsHour."

22:40.000 --> 22:42.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI, Georgetown
University: Thanks very much.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
today's meeting between Moon and
Trump will help forge a clearer

22:44.233 --> 22:46.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
plan for how to deal
with North Korea?

22:46.233 --> 22:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: I think today's
meeting is a success, in the
sense that the United States

22:53.133 --> 22:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
end and the South Koreans
clearly indicated that they
value the alliance very much and

22:56.800 --> 23:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the alliance is important
to the security of both our
countries and the stability of

23:02.400 --> 23:04.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Northeast Asia.

23:04.466 --> 23:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The way you framed that
question, that it's
going to lead to the
resolution of the issue

23:08.500 --> 23:13.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
with North Korea, is a
bit of a reach from at
least what I could take
away from the meeting.

23:13.100 --> 23:17.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You
and several other former
Cabinet officials and
senators wrote a letter

23:17.266 --> 23:22.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to the Trump administration
where you urged that they take
direct immediate talks with

23:24.100 --> 23:27.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the North Koreans, possibly
send a high-ranking
envoy to North Korea,.

23:27.433 --> 23:29.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why do you think
that's a good idea?

23:29.266 --> 23:32.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: For
a variety of reasons.

23:32.000 --> 23:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that people who favor
negotiations do so partly
because the alternatives are

23:36.800 --> 23:38.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
miserable.

23:38.933 --> 23:42.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There are fundamentally
three options in dealing
with North Korea, and
there always have been

23:42.766 --> 23:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
since the end of the Korean War.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One is to contain
the North Koreans.

23:48.366 --> 23:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we have been doing that,
and we have done it for decades.

23:50.933 --> 23:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we have been doing that
actually for the eight years
of the Obama administration.

23:54.033 --> 23:58.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I would say that was a
containment or strategic
patience type of policy.

23:58.766 --> 24:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem with containment is
that it doesn't stop with North
Koreans from developing assets

24:03.500 --> 24:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and capabilities and threat that
we would rather they not have.

24:06.966 --> 24:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, a second option is to
negotiate and to see whether we
cannot reach an agreement with

24:13.933 --> 24:18.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the North Koreans where they
agree to give up a capability
which we believe they shouldn't

24:18.666 --> 24:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have and is threatening
to friends and allies.

24:21.033 --> 24:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is what we attempted
to do in 1994 with
the agreed framework.

24:25.833 --> 24:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A third option is to use
military force, something
which we are proud
always to say is on the

24:31.766 --> 24:33.266 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
table, something
we haven't done.

24:33.266 --> 24:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, by that, we do not mean
launching another Korean War.

24:36.533 --> 24:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We mean the use of military
force in some limited way
to attack the capability.

24:43.533 --> 24:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, it's not only the
nuclear weapons, but it's those
long-range, ICBM-range ballistic

24:46.433 --> 24:48.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
missiles.

24:48.933 --> 24:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In your
letter, though, you're
clearly arguing for
point two negotiation.

24:51.033 --> 24:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are some people, as
you well know, in the foreign
policy establishment who say

24:54.833 --> 24:57.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you cannot negotiate
with the North Koreans.

24:57.100 --> 24:59.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I'm just curious
how you respond to that.

24:59.166 --> 25:03.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: I think
it's a fair thing to
say that negotiations
with the North Koreans

25:04.633 --> 25:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
are not guaranteed to succeed.

25:06.666 --> 25:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, certainly, through
the years of the Bush
administration, Bush
43, the 2000s, there

25:13.333 --> 25:16.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
were many efforts by
very capable people to
negotiate with the North
Koreans, and it didn't

25:17.233 --> 25:19.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
produce very much.

25:19.633 --> 25:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And even the agreement
which stuck for eight
years, the agreed framework
I mentioned before,

25:25.300 --> 25:29.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stuck for a while and stopped
the plutonium program from
producing nuclear weapons.

25:29.333 --> 25:31.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Ultimately, it
collapsed as well.

25:31.366 --> 25:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there is reason to say that
negotiations with the North
Koreans are not easy, they

25:36.300 --> 25:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may not succeed, but they may
be a way of getting to where
we want to get to, limiting

25:43.333 --> 25:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the capability of the North
Koreans to do harm to us and
our allies without the use

25:48.300 --> 25:50.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of military force and
without the risk of a major
war in Northeast Asia.

25:50.433 --> 25:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Chinese
have floated another possible
entreaty to the North Koreans,

25:56.933 --> 26:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's for the U.S. and
the South Koreans to stop these
annual military exercises.

26:02.066 --> 26:04.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How important is that to
the North Koreans and do you
think that that's a good idea?

26:04.400 --> 26:09.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: The North
Koreans have said frequently
that they are very unhappy about

26:10.266 --> 26:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the U.S.-ROK military exercises.

26:14.833 --> 26:17.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I do believe they
are unhappy about them.

26:17.133 --> 26:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You actually
had some recent meetings with
North Korean officials and you

26:20.233 --> 26:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
heard this very same issue.

26:22.300 --> 26:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: It was the
first thing on their agenda
that they were most concerned

26:24.866 --> 26:26.900 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about.

26:26.900 --> 26:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What's interesting about that,
of course, is that, from our
perspective, the alliance

26:30.233 --> 26:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
between the United States and
Republic of Korea is key to
both our countries' security,

26:34.800 --> 26:39.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and a manifestation of the
strength of that alliance
are those military exercises.

26:41.233 --> 26:44.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that will be not high on
our agenda to give up easily.

26:44.266 --> 26:48.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that something that might
be on the table, along with
the nuclear weapons program of

26:48.566 --> 26:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the North Koreans?

26:50.000 --> 26:51.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Plausibly.

26:51.233 --> 26:52.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But that's pretty
much down the road.

26:52.533 --> 26:55.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I wouldn't imagine
negotiations would begin there.

26:55.666 --> 26:59.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They would begin with
talks about talks, I think,
without preconditions.

26:59.333 --> 27:01.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Last night.

27:01.566 --> 27:03.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do you think the Trump
administration has any
interest in any of the
things you're taking

27:03.766 --> 27:05.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
about?

27:05.566 --> 27:08.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT GALLUCCI: I don't
know what the Trump
administration is interested in.

27:08.466 --> 27:13.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There have been mentions by the
secretary of state, secretary
of defense and even the

27:14.833 --> 27:17.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
president of possibly talking
with the North Koreans.

27:17.066 --> 27:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I worry that, in their minds,
are preconditions that will make
negotiations someplace between

27:22.966 --> 27:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
difficult and impossible.

27:24.933 --> 27:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Robert
Gallucci, Georgetown University,
thank you very much for being

27:27.733 --> 27:29.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
here.

27:29.033 --> 27:34.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ROBERT GALLUCCI:
Thank you very much.

27:36.800 --> 27:41.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Next: a
look at how one police
force is rethinking
the way its officers do

27:44.900 --> 27:46.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their job.

27:46.866 --> 27:50.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the aftermath of a succession
of deadly police shootings,
law enforcement officials

27:50.633 --> 27:55.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the country have grappled
with how police officers
might better interact with

27:55.633 --> 27:57.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the public.

27:57.766 --> 28:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Camden, New Jersey,
new procedures meant
to bring officers into
closer face-to-face

28:03.600 --> 28:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
contact with the people
they serve seem to be
having a positive effect.

28:08.733 --> 28:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Hari recently traveled to
Camden, and has this report.

28:11.600 --> 28:16.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Officer
Vidal Rivera is a native son
of Camden, New Jersey, a street

28:18.533 --> 28:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cop who can see the
blocks he patrols through
eyes that grew up here.

28:21.733 --> 28:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VIDAL RIVERA, Camden Police
Department: Out here,
it was like a market,
like a flea market.

28:28.666 --> 28:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You could go to any corner
and get whatever you need, or
whatever they were looking for.

28:33.133 --> 28:35.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They was coming
out to buy drugs.

28:35.166 --> 28:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: He's referring
to customers from Philadelphia
who came across the Delaware

28:38.333 --> 28:40.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
River to buy drugs.

28:40.033 --> 28:42.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They still come in,
but in smaller numbers.

28:42.833 --> 28:47.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
By day, Rivera is
police, by night, a young
professional boxer.

28:49.433 --> 28:51.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But he says, as a
boy, his mother didn't
let him play outside.

28:51.633 --> 28:55.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VIDAL RIVERA: It was
just too dangerous.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There was just
too much going on.

28:57.200 --> 29:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She feared that something could
happen, someone high, driving
a car, a shoot-out, everything.

29:04.566 --> 29:09.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Rivera is part
of a revamped force, rebuilt
more or less from the ground

29:09.466 --> 29:13.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
up in 2014.

29:13.533 --> 29:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The faces in the squad room
during morning roll call are
notably young, new officers

29:19.733 --> 29:21.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
recruited to replace an
ineffective department.

29:21.766 --> 29:26.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VIDAL RIVERA: I remember
being a kid that, something
happened, you weren't allowed to

29:26.100 --> 29:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
say nothing to the police.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: You weren't
allowed to tell the police
because you didn't trust them?

29:30.466 --> 29:31.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VIDAL RIVERA: You
didn't trust them.

29:31.833 --> 29:33.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It was the fear that you had.

29:33.933 --> 29:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Historically,
one of the country's most
impoverished and violent cities,

29:38.633 --> 29:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Camden is home to some 77,000
people, nearly all of them
Latino and African-American.

29:45.533 --> 29:48.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And a number of the department's
newer officers have been
recruited from the community.

29:50.666 --> 29:54.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police Chief Scott Thomson
also grew up in Camden, and he
has been largely responsible

29:54.533 --> 29:56.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for the reforms.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His entire career has
been with the Camden P.D.

29:58.500 --> 30:03.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He ordered his officers to leave
their cars, patrol neighborhoods
on foot, knock on doors,

30:05.466 --> 30:09.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
look in on shopkeepers, get
to know and become known
to the people they served.

30:12.300 --> 30:17.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT THOMSON, Camden, New
Jersey, Police Chief: We saw,
almost instantaneously, a change

30:18.866 --> 30:22.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in the atmosphere
within neighborhoods.

30:22.566 --> 30:27.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's what people wanted
from us, and it has helped us
significantly, and for us to

30:29.000 --> 30:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
provide better policing
services to them as well.

30:31.766 --> 30:36.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One, we have greater lines of
communication now, which has
given us a tremendous ability

30:38.633 --> 30:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to not only solve crime,
but prevent crime from
occurring in the first place.

30:41.833 --> 30:45.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
statistics back that up.

30:45.866 --> 30:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Since transitioning from the
old force to the new in 2014,
the number of murders dropped

30:50.366 --> 30:55.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by almost 70 percent,
burglaries by 27 percent,
robberies 33 percent,
and even an eye-catching

30:57.533 --> 31:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
143 percent spike in rapes that
the department attributes to
increased reporting, as well

31:04.066 --> 31:06.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
as new broader federal
guidelines on what
constitutes rape.

31:06.866 --> 31:11.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Overall, the city's
crime numbers are the
lowest in decades.

31:11.166 --> 31:15.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are impressive statistics
for any police department, and
residents don't dispute them.

31:15.800 --> 31:20.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But some say seeing them
in a report vs. feeling
the difference every
day are two different

31:20.533 --> 31:21.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

31:21.666 --> 31:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: I see prostitutes
on my street.

31:24.066 --> 31:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I see drug transactions
on my street, in broad
daylight, every day.

31:28.800 --> 31:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This local
business owner was one of
several people who asked not to

31:32.433 --> 31:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
be identified, citing
concerns that his remarks
could complicate relations
with local police

31:38.166 --> 31:39.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
officers he knows.

31:39.666 --> 31:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The crimes, he suspects, are
visible to police as well.

31:43.333 --> 31:48.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: Those must be caught on
camera, but I can't tell that
it makes a lot of difference

31:51.000 --> 31:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in how much of it or
little of it is happening.

31:54.400 --> 31:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Surveillance
cameras are a major piece
of Chief Thomson's formula.

31:58.733 --> 32:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some 200 of them are
deployed throughout the city.

32:02.366 --> 32:05.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The chief showed us the
Central command Center.

32:05.700 --> 32:10.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On these screens are the
real-time video feeds
from every camera, the
location of every officer

32:11.600 --> 32:13.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on patrol.

32:13.600 --> 32:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are also gunshot-detecting
microphones placed at certain
locations, meaning police

32:20.133 --> 32:25.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
know the location of the shots
to within a few meters seconds
after it happens, and can

32:26.300 --> 32:29.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
begin responding before
anyone even calls 911.

32:29.300 --> 32:32.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Still, not everyone is won over.

32:32.033 --> 32:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Camden resident sees both
the opportunities and costs
of increased surveillance.

32:36.533 --> 32:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: I feel it's a violation
of civil rights, on some level,
with the cameras, because now

32:43.566 --> 32:47.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you're unknowingly filming
people who didn't give you
permission to film them.

32:49.233 --> 32:53.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I have also been on the side
where family members has lost
other family members to violence

32:56.133 --> 33:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the cameras had assisted
in the apprehension of the
person who committed the crime.

33:03.133 --> 33:06.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: If the police department
came to me and said, you're
going to have to give up all

33:08.566 --> 33:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your privacy, but we're going
to reduce crime, then make you
a little bit safer, I would

33:12.633 --> 33:13.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
probably say no.

33:13.900 --> 33:16.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Nobody came to me
and asked me that.

33:16.000 --> 33:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Is there
a concern that people could
feel like their civil rights

33:19.200 --> 33:20.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are being violated?

33:20.700 --> 33:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: We don't have any secret
cameras stored away in the city.

33:24.500 --> 33:25.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Everything is overt.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're up there on a pole.

33:27.033 --> 33:29.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They're not hidden.

33:29.100 --> 33:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're sensitive to the fact
that there's people that may
not necessarily want the camera

33:32.433 --> 33:33.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

33:33.933 --> 33:36.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But what we have found is the
majority of people do want them.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN:
Another major focus of
reform is de-escalation,
training officers to use

33:42.833 --> 33:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
force only as a last resort,
a tactic that played out
dramatically in this video shot

33:47.933 --> 33:49.966 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
two years ago.

33:49.966 --> 33:54.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A man was wielding a knife at a
restaurant, then began walking
down the street brandishing

33:54.633 --> 33:56.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the weapon.

33:56.666 --> 33:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Rather than taking him down,
police formed a containment
bubble around him, then followed

33:59.366 --> 34:02.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
him for blocks until
he could be disarmed.

34:02.200 --> 34:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That restraint and patience
earned praise from the chief.

34:06.300 --> 34:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
SCOTT THOMSON: We're
handling them exactly
the way that we want to.

34:09.333 --> 34:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at the end of the day,
you know, what's happening is,
more people are being returned

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to their family.

34:16.000 --> 34:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And every time that an
officer pulls the trigger,
it's life-altering for them.

34:22.633 --> 34:25.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: His
department's records show
that, since 2014, the
frequency of officers

34:25.566 --> 34:28.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
using force has
dropped by 24 percent.

34:28.766 --> 34:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And citizen complaints
of police using excessive
force are down 49 percent.

34:33.400 --> 34:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But do these methods put an
officer's own life at risk?

34:36.633 --> 34:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MAN: Sir, drop the knife,
or I will Tase you.

34:39.866 --> 34:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT THOMSON: What we're
telling officers to do is slow
it down, is -- that which we're

34:46.766 --> 34:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
training officers to do is
actually safer for the officers,
when, historically, officers

34:52.533 --> 34:56.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have been rushing into
situations because
that's the training we
provide, and it's been

34:56.233 --> 35:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
dangerous for them, and often
leaving them with the only
option that's left is deadly

35:02.566 --> 35:04.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
force.

35:04.633 --> 35:07.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: That's
counter to the more
militarized approaches
taken by other cities.

35:07.866 --> 35:09.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What's the hardest part
about changing culture?

35:09.933 --> 35:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SCOTT THOMSON: So, for
us, it was that transition
from warrior to guardian.

35:14.000 --> 35:19.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You still have to have
the warrior mentality and
the ability to trigger
that warrior element

35:20.800 --> 35:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
when the time calls for it.

35:22.500 --> 35:26.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
However, that shouldn't
be your operating premise.

35:26.366 --> 35:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That should be the anomaly.

35:28.033 --> 35:29.200 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

35:29.200 --> 35:30.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That should be the
exception, not the rule.

35:30.800 --> 35:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The rule should be,
you're a guardian.

35:34.233 --> 35:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You're in this neighborhood.

35:36.200 --> 35:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Throughout
this story, I spoke to a number
of people sitting on their

35:38.633 --> 35:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stoops and sitting on their
porches, but none of them
wanted to talk to me on camera.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't because they felt
that the new police practices
were helping their neighborhood

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or hurting.

35:49.000 --> 35:51.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It was a mixed bag.

35:51.066 --> 35:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was because they felt
that talking to me would
invite unwanted attention.

35:55.133 --> 35:57.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some feared a police they
still didn't fully trust.

35:57.566 --> 36:02.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And others feared drug
dealers, who may have
left street corners, but
are now behind closed

36:03.033 --> 36:05.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
doors.

36:05.133 --> 36:07.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM GALLAGHER, Social Worker:
There were just dime bags and
needles all over the place.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Tim
Gallagher is a social worker
at Guadalupe Family Services.

36:09.366 --> 36:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He works on a block that's
seen tremendous improvement,
but he is still cautious.

36:13.900 --> 36:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM GALLAGHER: I think
their Manning concerns
are that it could happen
again, that the good

36:20.833 --> 36:22.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
cops who are here will leave,
and that other cops will replace
them who won't really know

36:22.966 --> 36:25.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the neighborhood.

36:25.033 --> 36:28.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Good cops
like Vidal Rivera, who is 6-0 in
the ring, undefeated, but knows

36:30.833 --> 36:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the fight for the streets
of his hometown is
just getting started.

36:33.733 --> 36:38.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm Hari Sreenivasan
in Camden, New Jersey.

36:44.166 --> 36:49.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And to the
analysis of Shields and Brooks.

36:51.700 --> 36:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist
Mark Shields and New York
Times columnist David Brooks.

36:56.466 --> 36:58.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome, gentlemen.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
David is joining us from
the Rocky Mountains,
Aspen, Colorado.

37:00.433 --> 37:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, let's start, both of you,
by talking about health care.

37:04.166 --> 37:08.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark, we just heard a little
while ago on the program
Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri

37:08.166 --> 37:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying it's going to be hard,
he said, to get to 50 votes.

37:12.300 --> 37:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What are you hearing?

37:14.266 --> 37:18.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: It's an
understatement by Senator Blunt,
a masterpiece of understatement.

37:19.633 --> 37:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy, never say never.

37:22.766 --> 37:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think it's about
time to say never.

37:25.233 --> 37:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, this is not
being put together.

37:28.466 --> 37:33.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Quite frankly, the motion to
proceed, not to get inside
baseball, but that's when the

37:33.100 --> 37:36.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
majority leader -- means
bringing up a bill.

37:36.233 --> 37:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I have never seen a motion
to proceed, which is just
asking that the bill be brought

37:41.966 --> 37:44.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
up for debate, fail.

37:44.066 --> 37:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Mitch McConnell's
reputation as an inside
player has taken a big hit.

37:48.666 --> 37:52.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there is not -- there is
not majority on what to do.

37:52.766 --> 37:55.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And it's not there.

37:55.433 --> 38:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I will just back to
one Republican has spoken
the absolute abject
truth on this subject.

38:02.500 --> 38:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he said, "In the 25 years
I have served in the Congress,
Republicans have never, not

38:05.500 --> 38:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one time ever agreed
on a health care plan."

38:08.833 --> 38:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That was Speaker John
Boehner this year.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I think it remains true.

38:13.233 --> 38:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David,
what are you picking up?

38:15.600 --> 38:20.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, I'm hearing
negative vibes, but not
quite as negative as Mark.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I still think there's a chance.

38:22.833 --> 38:26.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you hear is frustration
over, one, it's hard
to take away a benefit
people have already

38:26.933 --> 38:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
been given by law.

38:28.966 --> 38:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two, the Republicans are
more ideologically divided
than they thought they were.

38:32.200 --> 38:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Three, it's very hard to pass
a bill without a White House.

38:35.733 --> 38:39.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the president basically
ineffective here, and the
vice president barely more so.

38:39.766 --> 38:41.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so they're trying
to do it without him.

38:41.900 --> 38:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I think what they're
beginning to hear, as
the calls come in, is
that this is a proposal

38:45.733 --> 38:48.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that hits a lot of
Republicans really hard.

38:48.066 --> 38:52.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a 60-year-old white
male in Ohio, this can be
devastating to you, both in the

38:52.466 --> 38:57.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
coverage loss and in
the deductibles and the
out-of-pocket expenses,
so the calls are coming

38:57.400 --> 38:58.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
into the offices.

38:58.633 --> 39:00.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's making
people skittish.

39:00.633 --> 39:02.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's an uphill fight.

39:02.066 --> 39:04.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I don't think it's quite
as impossible maybe.

39:04.566 --> 39:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I was
struck, Mark, that Senator
Blunt was saying the
more the senators learn

39:07.800 --> 39:09.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
about what's in here,
the harder it gets.

39:09.733 --> 39:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: That's right.

39:10.733 --> 39:12.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, that's absolutely -- and
I would just add to it, Judy,
there is no public argument,

39:15.266 --> 39:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a case to be made for this.

39:17.466 --> 39:22.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Blunt answered
your specific questions
well, but there is no --
there is not a rallying

39:24.433 --> 39:28.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
cry for, whether it's
preexisting condition
or, you know, that
everybody's child can be

39:29.633 --> 39:32.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on until the age of 26.

39:32.133 --> 39:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Obamacare, the
Affordable Care Act, they
could make a public case
for it, that everybody

39:37.566 --> 39:39.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
is in, that rates
will not be higher.

39:39.933 --> 39:41.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's none here.

39:41.766 --> 39:43.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's
a real problem.

39:43.866 --> 39:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David's point about there
is no political air cover
from the White House.

39:47.700 --> 39:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Quite the opposite.

39:48.933 --> 39:52.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I mean, the White House
has been a liability.

39:52.033 --> 39:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president has been
unhelpful, uninformed,
and this morning tweeting,
let's repeal, which,

40:01.733 --> 40:06.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CBO, the Congressional Budget
Office, has a score on, would
put 26 million people uninsured

40:11.433 --> 40:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
immediately, so, you
know, off of insurance.

40:15.366 --> 40:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this is not a
recipe for success.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
David, that's right.

40:21.866 --> 40:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, the president did tweet
this morning, well, if they
can't agree, they should repeal

40:25.200 --> 40:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now and replace it later.

40:27.033 --> 40:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes, it's the
definition of bad leadership.

40:30.133 --> 40:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He had a more sensible position
not too long ago, which is
you do both things at the same

40:34.000 --> 40:36.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
time.

40:36.533 --> 40:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you repeal in the
fantasy that you're going
to replace later, when
you can't replace now,

40:39.466 --> 40:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's just not a realistic
way to make policy.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think Senator Blunt made
a good point, that, we got
a piece of legislation.

40:44.666 --> 40:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you can't agree on this,
there's not some mythical future
piece of legislation out there

40:48.366 --> 40:50.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that's going to pass.

40:50.466 --> 40:54.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The basic problem is
that this is a bill that
massively redistributes
wealth from the poor

40:55.333 --> 40:57.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the rich.

40:57.333 --> 41:01.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there are a lot of senators,
including Bob Corker of
Tennessee and Portman of Ohio

41:03.533 --> 41:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Susan Collins of Maine,
who are just uncomfortable
with the level of upward
redistribution that

41:06.100 --> 41:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this bill entails.

41:08.200 --> 41:11.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And then there are other
senators on the right,
the Ted Cruzes, who
just want to get rid of

41:11.333 --> 41:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
what they call
job-killing taxes.

41:13.666 --> 41:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And that's just a diverse party.

41:15.700 --> 41:20.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And McConnell is trying super
hard to find some formula
that will please both sides,

41:20.166 --> 41:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but it just may be an
unsolvable problem.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I will
just add one thing, Judy.

41:24.066 --> 41:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You had an interview earlier
this week with Senator John
Thune of South Dakota, ranking

41:28.433 --> 41:30.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Republican.

41:30.466 --> 41:34.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you asked him about one
little mishap, which was that
Dean Heller, the most vulnerable

41:36.400 --> 41:40.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Republican incumbent in the
country, up in Nevada next
year, in the only state where

41:40.933 --> 41:45.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Republicans running for
reelection that Hillary
Clinton carried in
2016, expressed his own

41:47.900 --> 41:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
reservations, misgivings,
doubts, opposition to the
bill as proposed last Friday.

41:52.266 --> 41:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And what happened?

41:54.333 --> 41:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining the state's governor,
who pointed out that the
rate of uninsured children in

41:59.766 --> 42:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the state had been cut by
one-half under Obamacare because
of the Medicaid extension.

42:05.733 --> 42:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he back -- he hollered
backed at the governor,
at which point the
president's own political

42:09.766 --> 42:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
action committee, staffed
by the president's own
political aides and
apparatchiks, organized

42:17.300 --> 42:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a $1 million, expressed attack
ad series on him, Heller,
which Senator Thune objected

42:24.833 --> 42:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to, that Senator
McConnell opposed.

42:27.233 --> 42:31.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is the political equivalent
of coming down from the hills
and shooting the wounded.

42:31.633 --> 42:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so they had to back off.

42:34.500 --> 42:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you talk about White
House-congressional relations.

42:38.166 --> 42:41.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, this is just -- it's
more than counterproductive.

42:41.833 --> 42:42.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's stupid.

42:42.833 --> 42:45.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You're right.

42:45.033 --> 42:47.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Senator Thune -- David,
Senator Thune's comment,
that wouldn't be a good
time to go after members

42:47.666 --> 42:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of your own party.

42:48.833 --> 42:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

42:50.300 --> 42:52.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

42:52.366 --> 42:56.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, it's -- the relations are
-- it's interesting to watch
even the reactions to the tweets

42:57.066 --> 42:58.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and everything else.

42:58.266 --> 43:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They can't get
away from this guy.

43:00.333 --> 43:02.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And what's been interesting,
talking to members of Congress,
is, it would be one thing if

43:02.366 --> 43:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he would just sort of disappear,
but they have to spend so much
of their time just reacting.

43:09.266 --> 43:11.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's just very hard to make
policy, aside from the problem
of just making policy from

43:11.800 --> 43:13.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Capitol Hill, which is
difficult to start with.

43:13.866 --> 43:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, speaking
of the tweets, David, we have
seen some eyebrow-raisers.

43:19.566 --> 43:21.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have heard some gasps.

43:21.666 --> 43:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I guess the president's
tweet yesterday morning about
the "Morning Joe" MSNBC cable

43:26.933 --> 43:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hosts, Joe Scarborough and
Mika Brzezinski, where the
president tweeted very personal

43:31.200 --> 43:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
insults, low I.Q.,
face-lift, and so forth, it
seemed to reach a new low.

43:38.733 --> 43:42.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Do we learn anything new about
this president at this point?

43:42.133 --> 43:46.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DAVID BROOKS: Well, one of the
nice things, if we can find a
silver lining here, is, it's

43:46.766 --> 43:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
possible for everybody
to be freshly appalled,
that we are not inured
to savage, misogynistic

43:53.900 --> 43:55.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
behavior of this sort.

43:55.366 --> 43:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I saw a lot
of people around.

43:57.433 --> 44:01.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I certainly felt in
myself a freshness, a
freshness of outrage.

44:01.600 --> 44:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I must say, when I hear
Roy Blunt say it's unhelpful
to himself, well, that's true,

44:06.100 --> 44:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but it's more than
unhelpful to Donald Trump
to tweet in this way.

44:09.033 --> 44:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's morally objectionable.

44:10.300 --> 44:12.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I do wish more
senators would say that.

44:12.833 --> 44:16.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Lindsey Graham and Ben
Sasse have said it, but
a lot of others, oh,
it's just not helpful.

44:16.566 --> 44:18.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's more than that.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the issue here is the
corruption of our public sphere.

44:20.800 --> 44:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what Donald Trump
does with these things.

44:23.100 --> 44:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it makes it harder for us,
our country, to ever get back
to normal, when these things

44:26.433 --> 44:28.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are corrosive to just the way
people talk to each other.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Corruption
of the public sphere, Mark.

44:31.100 --> 44:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I think David
is guilty of understatement.

44:34.266 --> 44:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
No, I think he put it very well.

44:38.066 --> 44:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is hateful
and it's hurtful.

44:40.766 --> 44:45.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Judy, I don't know what
a parent or a grandparent
is supposed to say to a
10-year-old or a 12-year-old

44:47.700 --> 44:51.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who said anything comparable to
this and was sent -- banished
to their room or whatever

44:53.800 --> 44:57.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
else for it, I mean, that the
president of the United States
can talk this way, and there

44:58.333 --> 45:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are no consequences.

45:00.833 --> 45:05.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The irony is that he's more
engaged on the back-and-forth
with Joe Scarborough and Mika

45:07.933 --> 45:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Brzezinski on this than
he has been on health
care or any other issue.

45:14.066 --> 45:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He obviously -- this
is what matters to him.

45:16.733 --> 45:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's just that classic
-- not to be sectionally
biased, but it's sort
of a New York bully

45:24.833 --> 45:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
approach to life, I mean,
that you say anything,
you do anything, because
the important thing

45:30.433 --> 45:32.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is winning.

45:32.466 --> 45:36.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I just -- you know, I
don't know what else there is
to say, other than you want

45:38.900 --> 45:41.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to put yourself through a
car wash after you listen to
the president talk this way.

45:41.600 --> 45:43.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are there
consequences, David?

45:43.733 --> 45:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, I heard what you
said about some senators
are just saying, well,
it's not helpful, but

45:47.800 --> 45:52.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
other senators are going
further and saying,
this is really wrong.

45:53.666 --> 45:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But are there ever consequences?

45:56.366 --> 45:57.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do we just go on like this?

45:57.733 --> 45:59.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: Yes.

45:59.633 --> 46:02.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, we will see if
people eventually get
disappointed and get tired.

46:02.433 --> 46:06.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I do think if it -- one of the
things that may begin to offend
people is potential mafioso

46:06.933 --> 46:08.866 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behavior.

46:08.866 --> 46:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One of the things we heard
this morning in the op-ed
piece in The Washington Post by

46:11.033 --> 46:16.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the two hosts was that the
White House sort of threatened
sort of extortion, that, if

46:18.000 --> 46:21.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the show becomes more
Trump-friendly, then
a National Enquirer
investigation into their

46:21.566 --> 46:23.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
relationship will be spiked.

46:23.566 --> 46:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's sort of mafioso,
extortion behavior.

46:27.333 --> 46:28.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's beyond normal
White House behavior.

46:28.966 --> 46:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's beyond political hardball.

46:31.333 --> 46:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's sort of using your media
allies, The National Enquirer
and the Trump administration,

46:37.066 --> 46:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to take down enemies.

46:39.166 --> 46:42.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's not something we
have seen in America since
maybe Nixon, or maybe never.

46:42.766 --> 46:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's true,
Mark, we haven't seen
anything like this in a while.

46:47.233 --> 46:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: We haven't.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I think David's
point about extortion
certainly strengthens
the position of James

46:52.466 --> 46:57.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Comey, that threats
and extortion or a hint
of extortion is part
of the modus operandi.

47:00.466 --> 47:02.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
To Republicans...

47:02.100 --> 47:03.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I mean,
we should say the White
House is denying it.

47:03.300 --> 47:05.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: The White
House is denying it.

47:05.266 --> 47:08.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jared Kushner, I guess, is
denying it, or perhaps somebody
else through him is denying

47:08.600 --> 47:11.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

47:11.033 --> 47:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the fact that there's
negotiations going back
and forth or communications
on this subject,

47:14.033 --> 47:19.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you do this and we won't print
an injurious and harmful article
in The National Enquirer,

47:21.666 --> 47:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
one of the great
publications of our time.

47:24.133 --> 47:28.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, Judy, I remember
when Republicans used
to get upset and angry
at Bill Clinton because

47:28.200 --> 47:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he didn't wear a suit and
tie in the Oval Office.

47:31.866 --> 47:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Donald Trump, who
is supposed to be this
great deal-maker, I mean,
Joe and Mika Brzezinski

47:36.533 --> 47:41.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a morning show which is a
show that watched very much in
this area, but it doesn't have

47:43.033 --> 47:46.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a great national
audience, and probably 1
percent of the people.

47:46.000 --> 47:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he just made them a
national -- everybody now
knows about this show.

47:50.866 --> 47:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's probably increased their
ratings, juiced them up.

47:53.933 --> 47:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I don't understand
where -- if anything,
it's but counterproductive
in every sense.

48:00.933 --> 48:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is true,
David, that this is -- it's
hard to find you said there

48:06.700 --> 48:10.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
may be a silver lining in
fresh outrage, but beyond
that, I'm not sure where it is.

48:10.100 --> 48:11.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DAVID BROOKS: No.

48:11.533 --> 48:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And, you know, the big question
for me is, do we snapback?

48:14.133 --> 48:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do the norms that used to govern
politics reestablish themselves
after the Trump administration,

48:18.833 --> 48:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or are we here forever?

48:20.800 --> 48:24.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And I hope, from the
level of outrage, that
we have a snap back.

48:24.266 --> 48:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But the politics is
broken up and down.

48:26.966 --> 48:31.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Trump may emerge from a
reality TV world that is much
more powerful than we think.

48:33.900 --> 48:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there is the prospect
that this is where we are,
which is an horrific thought.

48:35.800 --> 48:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Horrific thought.

48:36.800 --> 48:39.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Yes, it is that.

48:39.066 --> 48:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Mark Shields,
David Brooks, we thank you both.

48:42.333 --> 48:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

48:49.266 --> 48:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally tonight:
Often lost in the health care
debate are the individual

48:59.566 --> 49:04.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stories of fear and
uncertainty that come
with a medical diagnosis.

49:06.600 --> 49:09.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Elizabeth Silver is
an author and attorney
who was unexpectedly
plunged into a world

49:09.533 --> 49:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of statistics and probability.

49:12.033 --> 49:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She offers her Humble Opinion
on how to consider a prognosis.

49:15.900 --> 49:20.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ELIZABETH SILVER, Author, "The
Tincture of Time": When my
daughter was six weeks old,

49:20.866 --> 49:25.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
she suffered a serious stroke
and spent two weeks in the
neonatal intensive care unit.

49:27.833 --> 49:31.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As new parents, my husband
and I spent that time beside
her, waiting for answers and,

49:32.200 --> 49:34.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
at the end, were given very few.

49:34.233 --> 49:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At home, with a single click,
we could watch videos, read
articles, and, most importantly,

49:41.066 --> 49:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
stumble across numbers
that would send us either
rejoicing or panicking.

49:44.600 --> 49:48.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Like many parents, we
had nothing to hold
onto but statistics.

49:48.900 --> 49:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to one I read, her
stroke carried a 20 percent
chance of death and 90 percent

49:55.033 --> 49:57.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
chance of severe
neurological damage.

49:57.066 --> 50:01.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I focused on the 90 percent,
and imagined very different
versions of our lives.

50:01.766 --> 50:06.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the next year, as we
weaved in and out of doctors'
offices, I recalled the aphorism

50:08.333 --> 50:11.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that physicians are
supposed to treat the
patient, not the paper.

50:11.600 --> 50:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hippocrates, the ancient Greek
philosopher and physician,
said that it is more important

50:16.300 --> 50:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to know what sort of person
has a disease than to know
what sort of disease a person

50:20.766 --> 50:22.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
has.

50:22.466 --> 50:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
In other words, we must
remember that patients
are people with stories.

50:26.166 --> 50:31.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I took a step back and began
looking at these statistics,
these abstract medical studies

50:33.200 --> 50:37.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and numbers, and started to
view them just as I would
a story, a novel or a film.

50:39.066 --> 50:43.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
After all, a statistic is only
a particular version of a story.

50:43.100 --> 50:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as with all
stories, there are always
multiple perspectives
and multiple truths.

50:50.033 --> 50:53.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can analyze them
like literature: When
was that statistic taken?

50:53.100 --> 50:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Who was the source group?

50:54.566 --> 50:56.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Was it self-selecting?

50:56.100 --> 50:59.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What else do the
subjects have in common?

50:59.100 --> 51:04.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When looking at a statistic
in a medical study,
you don't have the full
picture of your prognosis,

51:04.000 --> 51:08.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
unless you have every
perspective, every
detail in the story.

51:08.500 --> 51:13.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is something you
will never get from a number.

51:15.400 --> 51:18.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Three years later, my daughter
escaped all her damning
statistics and is living a full,

51:19.700 --> 51:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
happy life, as if
it never happened.

51:22.233 --> 51:26.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When I look closer at her
story in its totality,
those statistics didn't
differentiate based

51:26.666 --> 51:31.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on age, my prenatal
care, or even the actual
size of the stroke.

51:33.633 --> 51:38.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all know that statistics
are useful, but if we rely on
them with too much weight, this

51:39.433 --> 51:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
can only lead to a breakdown
of trust with medicine.

51:42.000 --> 51:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We end up focusing on the 90
percent chance of things going
wrong, and, in the process,

51:48.366 --> 51:51.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
neglect the 10 percent
chance of things going right.

51:51.366 --> 51:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Perhaps my daughter's story
might one day be counted in a
future study, and her success

51:56.033 --> 52:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
will serve as a tick
against those frightening,
bigger numbers, because
there is an alternate

52:02.633 --> 52:06.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ending that includes
the full picture, and
it can be beautiful.

52:06.233 --> 52:10.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Elizabeth Silver.

52:10.233 --> 52:15.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" online right
now: We get a jump on the
July 4 holiday with five book

52:16.666 --> 52:19.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recommendations that explore
America's complex history.

52:19.800 --> 52:24.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:24.700 --> 52:26.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And tune in later tonight.

52:26.166 --> 52:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
"Washington Week" takes a closer
look at health care reform.

52:29.733 --> 52:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Robert Costa and his
panel explore if there
is a bipartisan solution.

52:37.133 --> 52:40.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And tomorrow's edition
of "PBS NewsHour Weekend"
takes a look at how
climate change is affecting

52:40.766 --> 52:43.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
working-class Americans.

52:43.233 --> 52:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This is
not after Hurricane Sandy.

52:49.433 --> 52:51.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is after what
kind of weather?

52:51.500 --> 52:53.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN UPTON, Climate Central:
Just yesterday, I was retweeting
some pictures from the street,

52:53.533 --> 52:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arizona Avenue, Atlantic Avenue,
that were flooding simply
because there was a high tide

52:57.366 --> 52:59.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
associated with a full moon.

52:59.366 --> 53:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time, there was a
storm, so you have tide actually
rising up in the streets

53:03.566 --> 53:05.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
coming through the
storm water drains.

53:05.633 --> 53:09.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time as that,
you have any rain or even any
rain, and the rain can't drain

53:09.733 --> 53:12.133 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
away.

53:12.133 --> 53:14.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, what you get is
a very substantial
flooding in some of these
neighborhoods that are built

53:14.166 --> 53:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
along bays in Atlantic City.

53:15.900 --> 53:19.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: That's Saturday
on "NewsHour Weekend."

53:19.466 --> 53:21.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

53:21.000 --> 53:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:22.000 --> 53:27.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:28.200 --> 53:32.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thank you, and we
will see you soon.
