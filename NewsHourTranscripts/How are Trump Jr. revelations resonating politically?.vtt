JUDY WOODRUFF: We return now
to the top story of the day,
Donald Trump Jr.'s release of

00:04.266 --> 00:09.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
e-mails showing he met with
a Russian lawyer during the
2016 presidential campaign, in

00:10.800 --> 00:14.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
hopes of gaining
damaging information
about Hillary Clinton.

00:14.533 --> 00:19.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For a closer look at the
political fallout from all this,
we turn to Karine Jean-Pierre,

00:19.066 --> 00:24.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a senior adviser to
MoveOn.org and a veteran of
the Obama administration.

00:26.133 --> 00:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And Matt Schlapp, he's
the chairman of the
American Conservative
Union and the former

00:29.400 --> 00:33.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
deputy political director
for President George W. Bush.

00:33.566 --> 00:35.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's great to have you
both back on the program.

00:35.633 --> 00:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you for being here.

00:36.633 --> 00:38.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, Karine, to you first.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How damaging is all this
information about the
Donald Trump Jr. meeting?

00:40.666 --> 00:43.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE,
Democratic Strategist: I
think it's pretty damaging.

00:43.266 --> 00:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We finally have evidence,
e-mails, that were not
fake news, because it
was actually delivered,

00:49.266 --> 00:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
released by Don Jr., that shows
that a foreign - - he met --
he and Paul Manafort and Jared

00:54.766 --> 00:59.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Kushner met with a foreign
agent in the sole, sole purpose
of trying to get information

01:01.400 --> 01:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
given by a foreign
adversary, intelligence
from a foreign adversary.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I think that's
pretty damaging.

01:07.000 --> 01:10.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, for a long time,
Republicans have been
moving that goalpost, right?

01:10.633 --> 01:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have been saying,
oh, there's no meeting.

01:13.333 --> 01:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Oh, well, if there's no meeting,
there's no proof of collusion.

01:16.533 --> 01:19.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Nobody on the campaign
knows any -- or have
any Russian connections.

01:19.400 --> 01:23.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, now we're at a point
where, yes, there's a meeting.

01:23.033 --> 01:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It looks like there potentially
could have been collusion.

01:25.333 --> 01:26.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And now what?

01:26.333 --> 01:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now what do Republicans do?

01:27.866 --> 01:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Matt, how do
you see the damage, or not?

01:29.866 --> 01:31.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP, Former White House
Director of Political Affairs:
Well, you know, my -- what

01:31.866 --> 01:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have said continually is,
is that my guess is, in the
presidential campaign, they will

01:36.800 --> 01:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have e-mails or phone
conversations or meetings
with people that were
trying to be helpful

01:41.400 --> 01:42.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to the campaign.

01:42.700 --> 01:45.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, this doesn't come
as a big shock to me.

01:45.333 --> 01:49.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the big mistake
they have made is whenever
you're involved in one
of these investigations

01:51.800 --> 01:53.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
- - and I was in a White
House that had a special
counsel -- you search
your e-mails immediately.

01:53.866 --> 01:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You go through -- if you
have phone logs, and you look
through all your information,

01:57.133 --> 02:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and you just fully comply,
you're as completely
as transparent as
you possibly can be.

02:01.266 --> 02:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Actually, the reason we know
this is because Jared Kushner
and Paul Manafort updated the

02:08.166 --> 02:10.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
disclosure to the government,
and they were much more
fulsome in the information they

02:10.800 --> 02:12.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
gave, which was the
right thing to do.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It just would have been
better if that could have
done as soon as possible.

02:15.633 --> 02:19.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the drip, drip, drip that
gives the press the ability to
write another story and another

02:19.766 --> 02:21.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
story.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the underlying facts still
prove absolutely no criminality.

02:23.733 --> 02:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Absolutely
no criminality?

02:26.033 --> 02:28.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We had a discussion
about this a few minutes
ago with two lawyers.

02:28.666 --> 02:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.

02:29.833 --> 02:31.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Well, we don't
know that for sure.

02:31.266 --> 02:34.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, look, to me, it looks
like textbook collusion.

02:34.633 --> 02:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It looks like campaign finance
violation, at least for me,
someone who worked on campaigns

02:39.400 --> 02:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and, just like yourself,
worked in the White House.

02:41.266 --> 02:42.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

02:42.800 --> 02:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes, but you guys
were never under investigation.

02:43.833 --> 02:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Right.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We were never under
investigation.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Thanks goodness, Obama,
no investigation.

02:47.433 --> 02:48.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Because
we were pretty nice.

02:48.266 --> 02:49.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We were pretty nice.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

02:50.766 --> 02:53.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: But, look --
but I think this is the problem.

02:53.466 --> 02:57.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they want true transparency
-- this is they, the Trump
administration -- why don't

02:57.800 --> 02:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just they put it all out there?

02:59.400 --> 03:01.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

03:01.366 --> 03:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: That's why
Donald Trump Jr. did this,
because it's the right thing to

03:01.900 --> 03:03.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes, but
the only reason they do it is
because you have The Washington

03:06.000 --> 03:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Post out there and The New
York Times doing the work and
putting out the information in

03:09.933 --> 03:11.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
piecemeal.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Then the drip, drip,
drip stuff happens.

03:13.333 --> 03:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Or maybe they're
being leaked inside the White
House or inside the apparatus.

03:14.866 --> 03:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Well, then
that's Donald Trump's problem.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Can I go,
Judy, to this question
of an FEC violation?

03:17.800 --> 03:19.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Yes.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Because
I saw the conversation
in the show as well.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the FEC has put
on their Web site...

03:23.500 --> 03:24.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: This is the
Federal Elections Commission.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Right.

03:26.133 --> 03:28.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can go on their Web
site and check it out.

03:28.233 --> 03:31.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But they already said
that the idea that you
could prove criminality
unless there was cash

03:31.633 --> 03:35.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
that went directly to
a candidate is almost
impossible to prove.

03:35.633 --> 03:38.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So I think the FEC
violations here are absurd.

03:38.533 --> 03:42.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The idea that this is treason,
that this was taking up arms
against your own country, I

03:42.666 --> 03:44.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think, is absurd.

03:44.633 --> 03:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then you have this question
of collusion, which isn't
really a legal term.

03:47.433 --> 03:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then I love this, potential
collusion, and I don't even
know where you go on that.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, the bottom line
is, we want to know this.

03:53.233 --> 03:57.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Did anybody on team Trump
do anything illegal with
the Putin government
that somehow subverted

03:59.433 --> 04:01.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the elections?

04:01.466 --> 04:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's a pretty big
charge, but an easy charge
to eventually answer.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we all just
want to get that answer and
close the books on this.

04:08.066 --> 04:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The American people are
fair, and let's move on.

04:10.100 --> 04:14.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Is the standard
of legality, Karine, going
to be the only standard that

04:14.200 --> 04:15.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
matters here?

04:15.700 --> 04:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: So, I
think that matters as well.

04:17.666 --> 04:21.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we do have -- we cannot
forget that Russians actually
attacked our country.

04:21.300 --> 04:23.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They tried to undermine
our democracy.

04:23.633 --> 04:26.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that is actually
still happening.

04:26.166 --> 04:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was a Washington
Post recent reporting
that showed that Russians
were currently trying

04:31.400 --> 04:33.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to hack into our infrastructure.

04:33.466 --> 04:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so this is what I'm not
understanding why Republicans
aren't just standing up and

04:37.900 --> 04:41.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying something and keeping
Trump administration and
his associates accountable.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I agree with this.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what Russia has tried
to do in this most recent
election and previous elections

04:46.633 --> 04:48.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is wrong.

04:48.633 --> 04:51.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think it's wrong what the DNC
was doing with the government
of Ukraine to try to help

04:51.033 --> 04:52.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton.

04:52.300 --> 04:53.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think these things
really should be...

04:53.533 --> 04:54.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Not the same.

04:54.533 --> 04:57.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not the same.

04:57.033 --> 04:57.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Well, but
it is -- if you shouldn't
deal with a foreign
national, then you shouldn't

04:57.966 --> 04:59.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
deal with a foreign national.

04:59.466 --> 05:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Russia
is a foreign adversary.

05:00.333 --> 05:01.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not the same.

05:01.133 --> 05:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The DNC denied it.

05:02.333 --> 05:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But Russia is not --
is a foreign adversary.

05:03.866 --> 05:04.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I want to come
to something, because there...

05:04.666 --> 05:07.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Sure.

05:07.233 --> 05:10.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What has
struck me, Matt Schlapp,
is the comments from
conservative commentators

05:12.233 --> 05:14.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in the last day or so
about what's happening,
Charles Krauthammer,
who said last night:

05:14.633 --> 05:17.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been defending
this White House, this
administration for months.

05:17.566 --> 05:22.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now I find out what they
were doing, and I'm left
basically hanging out to dry.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Are you seeing some Republicans,
some conservatives feeling as if
the administration hasn't been

05:30.733 --> 05:31.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
straight with them?

05:31.533 --> 05:33.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: Of course.

05:33.866 --> 05:37.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you're seeing from
Republicans and conservatives,
when you see the drip,
drip, drip, and with

05:37.333 --> 05:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this revelation that there
was a meeting, it does
get people concerned.

05:43.766 --> 05:45.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They say, well, I didn't think
there was going to be a meeting.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I thought I would have
learned this by now.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That's why getting all
the information out
is awfully important.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Get it all out.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
My advice is to anybody
listening on the Trump
team, get the e-mails
out, get the calendar

05:54.466 --> 05:55.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
items out.

05:55.466 --> 05:56.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Get everything out.

05:56.966 --> 05:59.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you have nothing to hide,
just put it all out there.

05:59.033 --> 06:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that's what now they
have done with the refiling
of their disclosures, which is

06:03.566 --> 06:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
why we know about this meeting.

06:05.033 --> 06:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, it was their disclosure
that is the reason we know this.

06:07.666 --> 06:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Jr., yes, he put out
his e-mails, but it was also
true that the media had gotten

06:11.533 --> 06:13.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
them.

06:13.600 --> 06:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, having full disclosure
will calm people down, because
all really conservatives care

06:16.833 --> 06:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about at the end, Judy,
is, was there wrongdoing?

06:19.100 --> 06:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karine, we are
seeing, in poll after poll --
I haven't seen polls since this

06:23.666 --> 06:28.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
latest information came
out -- but the conservative
- - Donald Trump's voting
base, they are sticking

06:30.100 --> 06:31.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with him.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They're saying, we don't care
about Russia, for the most part.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Yes.

06:34.166 --> 06:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I'm making a bit
of a blanket statement here.

06:36.233 --> 06:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But they're saying, what we
want to see is, we want to see
something done about health

06:38.200 --> 06:39.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
care, we want to see jobs.

06:39.633 --> 06:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: I
think that's exactly right.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But here's the thing.

06:43.833 --> 06:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Voters didn't care about
Watergate, until they did.

06:46.833 --> 06:51.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the issue that I have with
that is, these elected officials
on the Hill have a duty,

06:53.533 --> 06:56.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they have a responsibility,
regardless if
voters care or not.

06:56.066 --> 07:01.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They took an oath to
protect the Constitution,
to defend the Constitution
against all enemies,

07:01.800 --> 07:03.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
foreign or domestic.

07:03.900 --> 07:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so, therefore, they
should care that there was
an attack on our country.

07:06.266 --> 07:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think that is what is
really kind of getting under
my skin, is, this is truly,

07:12.166 --> 07:13.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
truly important.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you
do have the committees
doing the investigation.

07:15.866 --> 07:17.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: Yes, the only
thing I would say to that
is, is that what Russia tries

07:17.966 --> 07:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do with our cyber-security
in our society on a daily basis
with espionage is a big problem.

07:23.800 --> 07:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I agree with you on that.

07:25.833 --> 07:28.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I actually the Obama
administration -- he was
in charge during this
period of time -- he

07:28.566 --> 07:30.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
actually left us vulnerable.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He left our potentially -- if
you're making the charge that
they had something to do with

07:33.066 --> 07:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
our election system, he
was the sheriff in town.

07:35.033 --> 07:37.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The DNC was hacked.

07:37.066 --> 07:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that what we need to
do is make sure that we work in
a bipartisan way to make sure

07:39.966 --> 07:41.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that they can't affect
our society this way.

07:41.733 --> 07:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: But
Republicans are making
this a partisan issue.

07:44.033 --> 07:45.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not being bipartisan.

07:45.566 --> 07:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MATT SCHLAPP: I think there is a
little bit of that to go around.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Mitch
McConnell hasn't stood up basic
rhetoric, not real conversation

07:49.766 --> 07:51.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
about it, and Paul Ryan.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They need to stand
up and speak louder.

07:52.666 --> 07:54.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right.

07:54.633 --> 07:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We may have another chance
to talk about this again.

07:57.333 --> 07:59.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It may not be the last chance.

07:59.066 --> 08:00.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

08:00.133 --> 08:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE: Sorry, Judy.

08:01.300 --> 08:02.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Karine Jean-Pierre.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's all right.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Matt Schlapp.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Thank you both for being here.

08:05.233 --> 08:06.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MATT SCHLAPP: I'm
hopeful for a new topic.

08:06.066 --> 08:07.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

08:07.066 --> 08:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I bet you are.

08:08.233 --> 08:09.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
KARINE JEAN-PIERRE:
Thanks, Judy.

08:09.166 --> 08:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Thank you.
