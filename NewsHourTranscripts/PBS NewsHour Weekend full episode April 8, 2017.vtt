WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION,

02:46.733 --> 02:48.802 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEN IT'S MAKING THAT POINT.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.537 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

EVERYBODY HAS NOW IS NOT JUST

02:58.979 --> 03:00.013 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY WHAT SYRIA'S

03:00.013 --> 03:01.581 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSE, BUT WHAT'S BIG

03:01.581 --> 03:03.450 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BROTHER RUSSIA'S RESPONSE.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, I THINK IT'S

03:05.752 --> 03:07.054 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT GOING TO BE AS BAD AS SOME

03:07.054 --> 03:08.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PREDICTING.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK RUSSIA MUST HAVE BEEN

03:10.290 --> 03:11.858 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY EMBARRASSED BY SYRIA'S USE

03:11.858 --> 03:13.193 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS BECAUSE IT

03:13.193 --> 03:15.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY UNDERCUT PUTIN'S ROLE

03:15.262 --> 03:17.864 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BACK IN 2013 IN SAYING HE HAD

03:17.864 --> 03:19.232 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELPED GET RID OF SYRIA'S

03:19.232 --> 03:20.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEAPONS.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.469 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WHAT'S TRULY STRIKING IS

03:22.469 --> 03:24.304 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY GOT HOURS OF ADVANCE NOTICE

03:24.304 --> 03:25.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE STRIKE, AND THERE WERE NO

03:25.539 --> 03:26.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS KILLED AND NO RUSSIAN

03:26.907 --> 03:29.076 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HELICOPTERS HIT, BUT THERE WERE

03:29.076 --> 03:30.744 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIAN SOLDIERS KILLED AND

03:30.744 --> 03:32.679 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIAN AIRPLANES HIT.

03:32.679 --> 03:33.713 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK THAT MIGHT BE AN

03:33.713 --> 03:34.781 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INDICATION THAT RUSSIA DIDN'T

03:34.781 --> 03:35.816 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TELL SYRIA THAT THE STRIKE WAS

03:35.816 --> 03:37.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMING.

03:37.084 --> 03:38.718 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> DOUG, WHAT ABOUT THAT?

03:38.718 --> 03:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THERE ENOUGH DAYLIGHT BETWEEN

03:40.687 --> 03:41.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIA AND RUSSIA THERE, AT LEAST

03:41.888 --> 03:43.957 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THIS SPECIFIC ISSUE,

03:43.957 --> 03:45.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONSIDERING HOW GEOGRAPHICALLY

03:45.692 --> 03:47.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPORTANT SYRIA IS TO RUSSIA'S

03:47.561 --> 03:48.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE MIDDLE

03:48.929 --> 03:50.063 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EAST?

03:50.063 --> 03:51.264 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, CERTAINLY IN THE LARGER

03:51.264 --> 03:52.999 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PICTURE, SYRIA'S VERY IMPORTANT

03:52.999 --> 03:54.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO RUSSIA, MUCH MORE IMPORTANT

03:54.167 --> 03:56.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN IT IS TO US, AND THEREFORE

03:56.336 --> 03:57.604 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE VERY VESTED.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I REALLY AGREE WITH

03:58.572 --> 03:59.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY'S ANALYSIS.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE RUSSIANS HAD TO BE

04:01.141 --> 04:02.109 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBARRASSED BY THIS.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.376 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO GET

04:03.376 --> 04:05.479 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MY HEAD INSIDE THE LOGIC OF THE

04:05.479 --> 04:07.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIAN REGIME, WHY THEY WOULD DO

04:07.447 --> 04:08.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS, WHY THEY WOULD PROVOKE THE

04:08.782 --> 04:10.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,

04:10.016 --> 04:11.251 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMBARRASS THEIR PATRONS, THE

04:11.251 --> 04:12.052 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS.

04:12.052 --> 04:13.487 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS SEEMS TO MAKE NO SENSE TO

04:13.487 --> 04:14.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ME.

04:14.287 --> 04:16.123 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I TOTALLY AGREE WITH

04:16.123 --> 04:17.491 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIMBERLY,IT'S NOT BEYOND THE

04:17.491 --> 04:19.292 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIANS TO LET THEM FEEL THE

04:19.292 --> 04:20.627 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BRUNT OF THE ATTACK SO THEY

04:20.627 --> 04:22.062 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT

04:22.062 --> 04:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGAIN.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: REX TILLERSON

04:24.164 --> 04:25.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS SUPPOSED TO GO TO MOSCOW NEXT

04:25.365 --> 04:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEK.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.301 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW DOES THAT CONVERSATION GO?

04:28.301 --> 04:29.603 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, PUTIN IS

04:29.603 --> 04:31.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEBODY WHO REALLY RESPECTS

04:31.338 --> 04:33.640 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRENGTH, AND I THINK THIS MIGHT

04:33.640 --> 04:35.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN QUITE INTENTIONAL AS A

04:35.609 --> 04:37.911 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAY OF SHOWING RUSSIA AND

04:37.911 --> 04:39.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOWING PUTIN IN PARTICULAR

04:39.346 --> 04:41.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS NOT

04:41.148 --> 04:42.782 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO TAKE LYING DOWN

04:42.782 --> 04:44.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHATEVER IT IS THAT RUSSIA DOES

04:44.317 --> 04:45.719 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

04:45.719 --> 04:47.287 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND WE SHOULD BE CONCERNED THAT

04:47.287 --> 04:48.722 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUSSIA IS ALSO INCREASING ITS

04:48.722 --> 04:51.725 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY INFLUENCE IN EGYPT,

04:51.725 --> 04:53.493 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POTENTIALLY IN LIBYA, ALSO IN

04:53.493 --> 04:54.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFGHANISTAN.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.730 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO I THINK A MESSAGE OF

04:56.730 --> 04:58.098 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRENGTH HERE IN SYRIA IS

04:58.098 --> 04:59.065 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY

04:59.065 --> 05:00.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BENEFIT TILLERSON IN GETTING A

05:00.800 --> 05:02.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOOD DEAL IN MOSCOW.

05:02.435 --> 05:03.236 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: DOUG, WHAT

05:03.236 --> 05:05.105 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT THAT INFLUENCE THAT RUSSIA

05:05.105 --> 05:06.840 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAS BEEN INCREASING THROUGHOUT

05:06.840 --> 05:08.008 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MIDDLE EAST?

05:08.008 --> 05:10.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, AS KIMBERLY POINTED

05:10.577 --> 05:12.746 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT, IT HAS-- IT HAS NOT HAD A

05:12.746 --> 05:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

05:14.247 --> 05:15.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE COUNTRIES SHE MENTIONED,

05:15.682 --> 05:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH AFGHANISTAN, WITH LIBYA,

05:16.983 --> 05:18.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH EGYPT.

05:18.084 --> 05:19.286 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S CERTAINLY TRYING TO EXTEND

05:19.286 --> 05:21.821 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TENTACLES INTO THOSE REGIMES.

05:21.821 --> 05:22.556 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S NOT THE SAME KIND OF

05:22.556 --> 05:23.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RELATIONSHIP THEY HAVE WITH

05:23.690 --> 05:25.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYRIA, BUT CERTAINLY THEY'RE

05:25.058 --> 05:26.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STARTING TO EXPAND THEIR

05:26.826 --> 05:27.994 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INFLUENCE IN THE REGION.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I STILL MAINTAIN THIS STRIKE WAS

05:29.863 --> 05:31.431 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH MORE ABOUT CHEMICAL WEAPONS

05:31.431 --> 05:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN ABOUT THE SYRIAN CIVIL WAR

05:33.400 --> 05:34.901 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OR RUSSIAN INFLUENCE OR ANYTHING

05:34.901 --> 05:35.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELSE.

05:35.869 --> 05:36.770 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IF THE RUSSIANS ARE

05:36.770 --> 05:38.271 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLING TO TAKE AWAY A MESSAGE

05:38.271 --> 05:39.906 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF U.S. STRENGTH FROM THIS, I

05:39.906 --> 05:40.740 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CERTAINLY HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH

05:40.740 --> 05:41.508 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.342 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: KIMBERLY, THIS

05:42.342 --> 05:44.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASN'T AN ISSUE ABOUT SORT OF

05:44.077 --> 05:45.212 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. VERSUS RUSSIA, MORE

05:45.212 --> 05:46.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIFIC, NOT EVEN ABOUT REGIME

05:46.780 --> 05:47.914 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE, BUT REALLY SPECIFICALLY

05:47.914 --> 05:49.516 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT CHEMICAL WEAPONS.

05:49.516 --> 05:50.317 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> YES, IT WAS.

05:50.317 --> 05:52.819 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT DID FOLLOW A DAY OF

05:52.819 --> 05:54.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DISCUSSION IN THE U.N. SECURITY

05:54.454 --> 05:55.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNCIL ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED

05:55.322 --> 05:57.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN SYRIA, AND SO IT WASN'T OUT

05:57.524 --> 05:58.592 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE BLUE.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.960 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE WOULD

05:59.960 --> 06:01.661 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT BE A U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL

06:01.661 --> 06:03.663 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESOLUTION THAT CONDEMNED SYRIA

06:03.663 --> 06:05.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE SYRIA IS RUSSIA'S ALLY,

06:05.498 --> 06:06.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND RUSSIA HAS A VETO IN THE

06:06.566 --> 06:08.501 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL, BUT AT

06:08.501 --> 06:11.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEAST THERE WAS AN ATTEMPT MADE

06:11.037 --> 06:12.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO GET THE INTERNATIONAL

06:12.205 --> 06:13.173 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMUNITY THINKING ABOUT THIS.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.609 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN FACT, WHAT WE SEE IS THAT

06:15.609 --> 06:17.077 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MAJORITY OF U.S. ALLIES ARE

06:17.077 --> 06:18.511 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON BOARD BEHIND WHAT THE U.S.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DID.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.347 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: THERE WAS ALSO

06:20.347 --> 06:21.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TALK THAT THE TREASURY SECRETARY

06:21.815 --> 06:23.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAID WE WERE GOING TO IMPOSE NEW

06:23.583 --> 06:26.019 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON SYRIA.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.721 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUG, IS THAT GOING TO

06:27.721 --> 06:29.923 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE ANY MORE OF AN IMPACT?

06:29.923 --> 06:31.458 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THEY'RE PRETTY ISOLATED NOW,

06:31.458 --> 06:33.093 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH MORE

06:33.093 --> 06:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACT THIS WILL ACTUALLY HAVE

06:34.861 --> 06:36.596 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN TANGIBLE TERMS, BUT, AS A

06:36.596 --> 06:38.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SYMBOLIC GESTURE OF, AGAIN,

06:38.231 --> 06:39.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'RE NOT JUST GOING TO PUNISH

06:39.466 --> 06:41.334 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE POOR PILOTS ON THE GROUND

06:41.334 --> 06:43.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO WERE ON THE RECEIVING END OF

06:43.136 --> 06:44.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MISSILES BUT THE REGIME

06:44.938 --> 06:46.306 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTORS THEMSELVES WHO ARE

06:46.306 --> 06:47.807 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS STRATEGIC

06:47.807 --> 06:49.876 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECISION, THAT, AGAIN, SENDS A

06:49.876 --> 06:51.411 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY, VERY STRONG MESSAGE.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, AGAIN, I SUSPECT THE PEOPLE

06:53.280 --> 06:54.848 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS AIMED AT PERIPHERALLY

06:54.848 --> 06:56.149 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE NOT SO MUCH OTHER PLAYERS IN

06:56.149 --> 06:58.485 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AREA BUT THE NORTH KOREANS

06:58.485 --> 07:00.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND MAYBE ALSO THE IRANIANS.

07:00.320 --> 07:01.588 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A W.M.D. MESSAGE.

07:01.588 --> 07:02.489 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WE TALKED

07:02.489 --> 07:03.890 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
QUITE A BIT ABOUT SYRIA AND IT'S

07:03.890 --> 07:05.825 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BY NO MEANS THE ONLY COUNTRY IN

07:05.825 --> 07:09.896 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MIDDLE EAST; AND THERE IS

07:09.896 --> 07:10.964 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFGHANISTAN, WHERE THE U.S. HAS

07:10.964 --> 07:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN AT WAR SINCE 2001, AND THE

SPILLOVER AGAINST ISLAMIC

SIDE OR ANOTHER.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOUG, THINKING ABOUT THIS IN THE

07:32.952 --> 07:34.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGIONAL CONTEXT, DOES THIS

07:34.354 --> 07:36.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGE THE EQUATION AT LEAST HOW

07:36.323 --> 07:38.058 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTORS IN THESE PLACES SEE

07:38.058 --> 07:40.393 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ROLE OF THE UNITED STATES?

07:40.393 --> 07:41.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, TALKING TO MY FRIENDS

07:41.528 --> 07:42.929 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE REGION, IT SOUNDS LIKE

07:42.929 --> 07:45.265 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE-- THE LEADERS IN MIDDLE EAST

07:45.265 --> 07:46.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE THRILLED TO SEE THIS.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE THRILLED TO SEE A STRONG

07:49.903 --> 07:52.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MIDDLE EAST, MOST OF THESE

07:52.205 --> 07:53.707 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGIMES WERE NOTABLY NOT HAPPY

07:53.707 --> 07:55.442 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE LAST ADMINISTRATION.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.643 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME OF THEM WERE VERY HAPPY TO

07:56.643 --> 07:58.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SEE THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION, AND
