THERE ARE COMPETITORS TO        

26:50.262 --> 26:51.576
BIG BANG.                       
THERE ARE COMPETITORS TO        
INFLATION BUT NONE OF THEM WERE 

26:51.578 --> 26:53.195
THERE ARE COMPETITORS TO        
INFLATION BUT NONE OF THEM WERE 
REALLY QUITE AS WELL PUT        

26:53.197 --> 26:56.538
INFLATION BUT NONE OF THEM WERE 
REALLY QUITE AS WELL PUT        
TOGETHER AS INFLATION EVER WAS  

26:56.540 --> 26:58.056
REALLY QUITE AS WELL PUT        
TOGETHER AS INFLATION EVER WAS  
AND INFLATION MADE THIS VERY    

26:58.058 --> 26:59.676
TOGETHER AS INFLATION EVER WAS  
AND INFLATION MADE THIS VERY    
SPECIFIC PREDICTION THAT THE    

26:59.678 --> 27:00.891
AND INFLATION MADE THIS VERY    
SPECIFIC PREDICTION THAT THE    
COMPETITORS REALLY DIDN'T MAKE. 

27:00.893 --> 27:02.478
SPECIFIC PREDICTION THAT THE    
COMPETITORS REALLY DIDN'T MAKE. 
SO RIGHT NOW INFLATION IS WAY   

27:02.480 --> 27:03.997
COMPETITORS REALLY DIDN'T MAKE. 
SO RIGHT NOW INFLATION IS WAY   
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE WE KNOW   

27:03.999 --> 27:05.650
SO RIGHT NOW INFLATION IS WAY   
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE WE KNOW   
WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING  

27:05.653 --> 27:06.865
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE WE KNOW   
WHEN IT COMES TO UNDERSTANDING  
THE EARLY UNIVERSE.
