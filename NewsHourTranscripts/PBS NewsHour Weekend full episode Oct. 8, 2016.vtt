04:05.278 --> 04:06.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR MORE ON THESE DEVELOPMENTS

04:06.446 --> 04:07.481 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE

04:07.481 --> 04:08.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTION, I AM JOINED FROM

04:08.548 --> 04:10.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WASHINGTON BY ROGER SIMON.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.685 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S THE CHIEF COLUMNIST FOR

04:11.685 --> 04:12.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
"POLITICO."

04:12.786 --> 04:14.654 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ROGER, WELCOME.

04:14.654 --> 04:16.323 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M CURIOUS, WHEN YOU FIRST SAW

04:16.323 --> 04:18.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS VIDEOTAPE, THIS RECORDING,

04:18.992 --> 04:20.861 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?

04:20.861 --> 04:23.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, I THINK LIKE 99% OF

04:23.697 --> 04:25.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICA, I WAS ABSOLUTELY

04:25.632 --> 04:27.734 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUNNED.

04:27.734 --> 04:31.938 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I WAS FLOORED THAT, YOU KNOW, A

04:31.938 --> 04:35.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUY WHO IS 59 YEARS OLD SHOULD

04:35.375 --> 04:36.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE BEHAVING THIS WAY AND ACTING

04:36.476 --> 04:38.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAY.

04:38.512 --> 04:40.947 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS FRAT BOY CULTURE, BUT

04:40.947 --> 04:44.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S NO LONGER A FRAT BOY.

04:44.584 --> 04:47.254 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: IN MOST

04:47.254 --> 04:48.088 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CIRCUMSTANCES, IN MOST

04:48.088 --> 04:49.256 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUSINESSES, THIS TALK OF PREYING

04:49.256 --> 04:51.091 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON WOMEN LIKE THIS WOULD GET YOU

04:51.091 --> 04:52.826 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIRED, BUT TRUMP IS IN THIS

04:52.826 --> 04:54.227 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNUSUAL POSITION WHERE HE'S

04:54.227 --> 04:55.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEWHAT BULLET-PROOF.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.530 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE'S THE NOMINEE.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.732 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE SAYS HE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

04:58.732 --> 05:02.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS WIFE SAID I'VE FORGIVEN HIM.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.003 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LET'S MOVE ON.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.571 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THE G.O.P. LEADERSHIP WANTED

05:04.571 --> 05:05.972 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO SOMETHING AND GET HIM OFF

05:05.972 --> 05:07.340 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TICKET IS THERE ANY

05:07.340 --> 05:08.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRACTICAL WAY THEY COULD DO

05:08.141 --> 05:08.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT?

05:08.642 --> 05:09.409 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I THINK THEY COULD.

05:09.409 --> 05:11.211 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT WOULD BE LEGALLY

05:11.211 --> 05:11.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MESSY.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I THINK THE ONLY THING WORSE

05:16.983 --> 05:19.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAN DOING IT MIGHT BE NOT DOING

05:19.653 --> 05:20.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS IS

05:21.888 --> 05:24.524 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE

05:24.524 --> 05:28.261 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALREADY VOTED, USING EARLY

05:28.261 --> 05:28.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALLOTS.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.364 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY'VE MARKED BALLOTS FOR

05:31.364 --> 05:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIM, AND FOR HILLARY CLINTON,

05:32.832 --> 05:37.637 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SO WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THOSE

05:37.637 --> 05:38.138 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BALLOTS?

05:38.138 --> 05:39.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU REALLY--

05:39.372 --> 05:42.142 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY REALLY

05:42.142 --> 05:45.745 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECIDED THAT HE MUST GO, THEN

05:45.745 --> 05:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU CAN JUST HOPE THAT IT WOULD

05:47.247 --> 05:49.849 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE LIKE RICHARD NIXON, WHERE THE

05:49.849 --> 05:50.917 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELDERS OF THE PARTY GO TO HIM

05:50.917 --> 05:53.620 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND SAY, "MR. PRESIDENT, YOU

05:53.620 --> 05:57.390 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOTTA STEP DOWN, "OR "MR. TRUMP,

05:57.390 --> 05:59.159 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU'VE JUST GOT TO STEP DOWN FOR

05:59.159 --> 06:01.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GOOD OF THE PARTY."

06:01.061 --> 06:02.696 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: WELL, IN THE

06:02.696 --> 06:04.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CURRENTLY CURRENT POLITICAL

06:04.164 --> 06:04.664 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LANDSCAPE.

06:04.664 --> 06:06.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO ARE THOSE ELDERS?

06:06.366 --> 06:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
( LAUGHTER )

06:06.866 --> 06:08.034 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.736 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

06:09.736 --> 06:11.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE REPUBLICAN LEADERS OF

06:11.671 --> 06:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONGRESS, AND IT WOULD HAVE TO

06:13.573 --> 06:17.377 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE-- I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE

06:17.377 --> 06:18.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HIS-- PENCE, HIS VICE

06:18.878 --> 06:23.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE, WHO HAS

06:23.650 --> 06:25.051 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONE SUPPORT FOR HIM, BUT I

06:25.051 --> 06:27.887 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOULDN'T CALL IT UNLIMITED

06:27.887 --> 06:28.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPORT.

06:28.388 --> 06:32.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS HEDGED A LITTLE BIT.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.461 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I THINK PENCE WAS LEAVING

06:34.461 --> 06:37.564 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DOOR OPEN FOR SAYING, YOU

06:37.564 --> 06:39.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW, IF ANYTHING MORE COMES

06:39.966 --> 06:41.635 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUT, I'M JUST GOING TO STEP AWAY

06:41.635 --> 06:42.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THIS TICKET.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY CAN

06:44.437 --> 06:46.940 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIND A NEW VICE PRESIDENTIAL

06:46.940 --> 06:47.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOMINEE.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.075 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: I MEAN, YOU HAVE,

06:49.075 --> 06:50.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY, COVERED A LOT OF

06:50.210 --> 06:50.810 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTIONS.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.512 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I'M JUST CURIOUS, WE ARE

06:52.512 --> 06:53.613 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEKS AWAY FROM AN ELECTION.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE HAVE A CAN CAN BE IN ANOTHER

06:55.682 --> 06:56.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAY.

06:56.016 --> 06:58.218 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

06:58.218 --> 06:58.585 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS?

06:58.585 --> 07:01.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOES THIS STRIKE YOU AS AN

07:01.087 --> 07:01.755 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT?

07:01.755 --> 07:05.025 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I KNOW WE'VE HAD A LOT IN THIS

07:05.025 --> 07:05.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN.

07:05.525 --> 07:07.294 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT STRIKES ME AS AN

07:07.294 --> 07:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNPRECEDENTED MOMENT.

07:08.628 --> 07:10.230 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN ASKED THAT A

07:10.230 --> 07:12.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOT ABOUT PAST CRISES IN THIS

07:12.198 --> 07:12.699 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAMPAIGN.

07:12.699 --> 07:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I DON'T USE THE WORD LOOSELY,

07:15.268 --> 07:17.804 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE

07:17.804 --> 07:22.108 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
1976, AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN A

07:22.108 --> 07:24.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN LIKE THIS.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.278 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: I MEAN,

07:25.278 --> 07:26.246 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY, ONE OF THE THINGS

07:26.246 --> 07:28.148 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THIS HAS IT TO PUT A LOT OF

07:28.148 --> 07:30.150 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESSURE ON IS DOWN-BALLOT

07:30.150 --> 07:30.550 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IN THE NEXT

07:32.118 --> 07:33.320 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAYS, MANY OF THEM HAVE ALREADY

07:33.320 --> 07:35.155 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COME OUT, AND SOME OF THEM ARE

07:35.155 --> 07:37.490 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO WALK THAT LINE BETWEEN

07:37.490 --> 07:39.192 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECRYING HIS COMMENT AND-- BUT

07:39.192 --> 07:40.360 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YET NOT SAYING THAT THEY'RE NOT

07:40.360 --> 07:42.429 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GOING TO SUPPORT HIM.

07:42.429 --> 07:43.863 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T THIS PUT PRESSURE ON

07:43.863 --> 07:45.231 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERY SINGLE DOWN-BALLOT

07:45.231 --> 07:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN WHO IS IN A CAN CLOSE

07:47.133 --> 07:49.369 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RACE TO RECKON WITH THESE AWFUL

07:49.369 --> 07:49.869 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COMMENT?

07:49.869 --> 07:52.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT DOES PUT PRESSURE ON THEM.

07:52.539 --> 07:58.144 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT'S WHY SOME ARE STEPPING

07:58.144 --> 07:59.245 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AWAY FROM HIM.

07:59.245 --> 08:00.113 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE DESERTING HIM IN THE

08:00.113 --> 08:01.348 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SENSE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO

08:01.348 --> 08:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO OUT AND CAMPAIGN FOR HIM OR

08:03.983 --> 08:04.584 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH HIM.

08:04.584 --> 08:07.153 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS HE'S

08:07.153 --> 08:08.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RUNNING HIS RACE.

08:08.154 --> 08:10.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'M RUNNING MINE.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST FORGET ABOUT HIM.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCENTRATE ON ME.

08:13.893 --> 08:16.796 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IF THERE'S ONE OTHER GROUP I

08:16.796 --> 08:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN MENTION IN HERE, IT'S THE

08:20.033 --> 08:21.968 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WOMEN OF THE UNITED STATES.

08:21.968 --> 08:23.570 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE REALLY

08:23.570 --> 08:26.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN VICTIMIZED HERE-- NOT THE

08:26.239 --> 08:28.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GUYS IN CONGRESS WHO HAVE NICE

08:28.341 --> 08:31.644 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOBS AND MIGHT BE RE-ELECTED OR

08:31.644 --> 08:32.579 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT RE-ELECTED.

08:32.579 --> 08:36.916 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT WHEN YOU EXAMINE MR. TRUMP'S

08:36.916 --> 08:39.652 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATEMENTS, HE-- IT IS A

08:39.652 --> 08:42.355 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATEMENT OF A SERIAL SEXUAL

08:42.355 --> 08:44.457 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PREDATOR, AND WE REALIZE THAT

08:44.457 --> 08:48.228 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OUR MOTHERS AND SISTERS AND

08:48.228 --> 08:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAMILY MEMBERS ARE TREATED THIS

13:01.681 --> 13:02.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO TELL ME

13:02.915 --> 13:03.583 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYTHING.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT HE SAID WE'RE OKAY.

13:05.418 --> 13:09.322 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO, WIND INSTEAD OF WATER.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'LL TAKE THAT BECAUSE WATER, WE

13:10.757 --> 13:14.027 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

13:31.711 --> 13:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SECTION OF ST. AUGUSTINE WHERE

13:37.517 --> 13:38.918 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE SAW SOME PEOPLE THAT WERE

13:38.918 --> 13:40.987 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRYING TO DRY OUT THEIR HOUSES.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY PROBABLY HAD 10, 14 INCHES

13:42.522 --> 13:42.889 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF WATER.

13:42.889 --> 13:44.824 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IS NOTHING COMPARED TO

13:44.824 --> 13:46.793 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER SECTION JUST ABOUT TWO

MILES AWAY CALLED VELANNO BEACH.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.996 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AREA IS STILL CLOSED OFF

13:49.996 --> 13:51.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BECAUSE THERE'S PROBABLY THREE

13:51.097 --> 13:52.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

WHO TRIED TO RIDE OUT THE STORM.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AREA HAS BEEN DECLARED

13:57.203 --> 13:57.704 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CATASTROPHIC.

13:57.704 --> 13:58.871 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE HOMES THAT HAVE KIND

13:58.871 --> 14:00.339 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF COLLAPSED ON TO EACH OTHER.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.341 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

BACK-SLOG, IF YOU WILL.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.949 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS AN AREA THAT IS TO HAVE

14:09.949 --> 14:11.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO TAKE SEVERAL DAYS TO TRY TO

14:11.517 --> 14:12.952 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITERALLY PUMP THE WATER OUT

14:12.952 --> 14:14.253 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

EFFORTS?

14:17.256 --> 14:18.591 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE YOU SEEING FEMA OR THE RED

WHAT DOES THE RECOVERY EFFORT

14:20.660 --> 14:24.697 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK LIKE WHERE YOU ARE?

>> Sreenivasan: SO, THERE HAVE

14:25.431 --> 14:26.532 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN RED CROSS SHELTERS THAT

14:26.532 --> 14:27.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN SET UP, UP AND DOWN

14:27.333 --> 14:28.634 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COAST.

14:28.634 --> 14:30.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONE OF THE IRONIES IS TODAY,

14:30.103 --> 14:32.238 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GLORIOUS SUNNY DAY, TOMORROW IS

14:32.238 --> 14:33.606 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO GOING TO BE THE SAME.

14:33.606 --> 14:34.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE PEOPLE STAYING IN THESE

14:34.474 --> 14:35.742 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHELTERS DURING THE DAY, THEY'RE

14:35.742 --> 14:37.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUST ANXIOUS TO TRY TO GET BACK

14:37.110 --> 14:38.478 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTO THEIR HOMES, ESPECIALLY IF

14:38.478 --> 14:40.580 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT WAS IN THOSE AREAS THAT HAS

14:40.580 --> 14:41.114 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN SEALED OFF.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.381 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THEY WANT TO GET THERE.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND, OF COURSE, THE AUTHORITIES

14:43.282 --> 14:44.617 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T WANT TO LET THEM BACK

14:44.617 --> 14:45.084 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO POWER.

14:46.119 --> 14:46.786 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE ARE STILL POWER LINES

14:46.786 --> 14:47.186 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.087 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S NO WATER.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.388 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT HAS BEEN TURNED OFF.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.357 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO BASIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT

14:51.357 --> 14:52.425 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE TO LET THESE PEOPLE BACK

14:52.425 --> 14:52.992 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN.

14:52.992 --> 14:56.729 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S A LONG, SLOW PHASE-BACK.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.365 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

THROUGH.

14:59.766 --> 15:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY

15:00.466 --> 15:02.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPECTED AS MUCH OF THE

15:02.568 --> 15:03.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

15:06.639 --> 15:08.007 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT, AS THE PICTURES WE'VE BEEN

15:08.941 --> 15:10.309 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INCREDIBLE DAMAGE AND THERE'S

15:10.309 --> 15:11.878 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN SOME LOSS OF LIFE THERE,

15:11.878 --> 15:13.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THIS WAS PREDICTED TO BE

15:13.780 --> 15:14.647 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH WORSE.

15:14.647 --> 15:15.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THERE ANY SENSE FROM PEOPLE

15:15.548 --> 15:16.616 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE BEEN TALKING TO THAT

15:16.616 --> 15:19.118 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY MIGHT HAVE DODGED A MUCH

15:17.784 --> 15:21.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BIGGER BULLET?

15:20.820 --> 15:22.989 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, EVERYBODY AROUND HERE

15:22.989 --> 15:24.557 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WAS WATCHING ALL THE LOCAL NEWS

16:34.660 --> 16:35.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN YOU GIVE US A SENSE OF WHAT

YOU'VE BEEN SEEING?

16:36.863 --> 16:39.498 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOW BAD IS IT THERE RIGHT NOW?

16:41.701 --> 16:43.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HURRICANE MATTHEW IS ONLY

16:43.636 --> 16:45.705 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EMERGING NOW.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.773 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HARDEST HIT AREA, IN THE

16:47.773 --> 16:49.842 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTHERN PENINSULA, WAS HIT

16:49.842 --> 16:51.577 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CATASTROPHICALLY.

16:51.577 --> 16:53.379 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN TERMS OF PORT-AU-PRINCE,

16:53.379 --> 16:54.981 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PORT-AU-PRINCE IS RESUMING

16:54.981 --> 16:55.681 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NATURAL ACTIVITY.

16:55.681 --> 16:56.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S BEEN TWO DAYS OF

16:56.682 --> 16:58.751 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUNSHINE.

16:58.751 --> 17:01.354 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE WATERS ARE RECEDING, BUT THE

17:01.354 --> 17:03.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WORST HIT, CATASTROPHICALLY FOR

17:03.122 --> 17:05.291 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE COUNTRY ON AN ECONOMIC,

17:05.291 --> 17:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECOLOGICAL, HUMANITARIAN SCALE

17:08.527 --> 17:11.297 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS THE SOUTHERN REGION,

17:11.297 --> 17:13.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHICH COMPRISES HAITI.

17:13.866 --> 17:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:14.767 --> 17:17.136 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TODAY, TOMORROW, EARLY NEXT

17:17.136 --> 17:18.204 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEEK, WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST

17:18.204 --> 17:20.106 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHALLENGES FACING RESCUERS AND

17:20.106 --> 17:21.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AID AGENCIES?

17:21.474 --> 17:24.110 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES

17:24.110 --> 17:25.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE GETTING TO THE AREA.

17:25.011 --> 17:27.546 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I SPOKE TO THE WORLD FOOD

17:27.546 --> 17:29.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROGRAM YESTERDAY, AND THEY SAID

17:29.548 --> 17:31.050 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT AS OF NOW, THEY STILL DON'T

17:31.050 --> 17:33.886 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW HOW TO GET SUPPLIES TO THE

17:33.886 --> 17:35.154 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREA, ALTHOUGH THEY DID HAVE

17:35.154 --> 17:38.057 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOME PREPOSITIONED BEFOREHAND.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.692 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT, OF COURSE, NOT ENOUGH FOR

17:39.692 --> 17:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

17:40.893 --> 17:42.395 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE THAT ARE STRANDED THAT

17:42.395 --> 17:44.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WERE VICTIMS OF THE HURRICANE.

17:44.130 --> 17:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE PEOPLE ARE NEEDING WATER,

17:47.266 --> 17:49.568 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE NEEDING FOOD, ARE NEEDING

17:49.568 --> 17:51.103 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEDICAL SUPPLIES, ARE NEEDING

17:51.103 --> 17:53.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHELTERS.

17:53.572 --> 17:54.874 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM EARLY REPORTS THAT CAME IN

17:54.874 --> 17:58.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YESTERDAY, THE WHOLE AREA WAS

17:58.477 --> 18:00.980 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FLATTENED COMPLETELY.

18:00.980 --> 18:01.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: I UNDERSTAND THAT

18:01.847 --> 18:02.815 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TOMORROW IS GOING TO BE THE

18:02.815 --> 18:04.483 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN HAITI.

18:04.483 --> 18:05.551 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S NOT GOING TO

18:05.551 --> 18:06.752 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPEN AT THIS POINT.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.255 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT DOES THIS POWER VACUUM-- I

18:09.255 --> 18:10.122 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S THE RIGHT

18:10.122 --> 18:11.624 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERM FOR IT-- DOES THIS HAVE ANY

18:11.624 --> 18:13.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEARING ON HOW THE RESCUE

18:13.392 --> 18:14.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EFFORTS ARE GOING FORWARD?

18:14.827 --> 18:15.761 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> I DON'T BELIEVE SO BECAUSE

18:15.761 --> 18:17.196 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THE INTERNATIONAL

18:17.196 --> 18:18.764 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES THAT WERE

18:18.764 --> 18:20.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HERE FOR THE EARTHQUAKE IN

18:20.800 --> 18:22.835 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JANUARY 2010 ARE HERE AND PRETTY

18:22.835 --> 18:24.904 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MUCH TAKING OVER THE

18:24.904 --> 18:26.372 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HUMANITARIAN EFFORT FOR THE

18:26.372 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE ISLAND.

18:28.074 --> 18:30.776 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT, HOWEVER, IT'S ANOTHER STORM

18:30.776 --> 18:32.378 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR HAITI, A POLITICAL STORM.

18:32.378 --> 18:35.548 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MUCH-AWAITED ELECTIONS HAVE

18:35.548 --> 18:37.350 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN POSTPONED, AND THIS IS

18:37.350 --> 18:40.119 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFTER TWO FAILED ATTEMPTS TO

18:40.119 --> 18:41.854 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECT A PRESIDENT SINCE FORMER

18:41.854 --> 18:44.757 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT LEFT OFFICE IN APRIL

18:44.757 --> 18:46.359 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF 2015.

18:46.359 --> 18:48.561 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE, YOU KNOW, INSTITUTIONS

18:48.561 --> 18:49.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CANNOT FUNCTION.

18:49.895 --> 18:51.197 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MINISTRIES WILL HAVE TO BE

18:51.197 --> 18:52.198 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REELECTED.

18:52.198 --> 18:55.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IT'S HANDICAPPED GOVERNANCE.

18:55.534 --> 18:56.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Brangham: YOU HAVE BEEN

18:56.435 --> 18:57.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COVERING HAITI SINCE THE

18:57.903 --> 18:59.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MID-1980s, AND OBVIOUSLY THE

18:59.605 --> 19:00.806 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
COUNTRY IS STILL DEALING WITH

19:00.806 --> 19:01.741 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE AFTER-EFFECTS OF THE

19:01.741 --> 19:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKE IN 2010.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.677 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT IS YOUR SENSE ABOUT THE

19:04.677 --> 19:07.346 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LONG-TERM ABILITY OF HAITI TO

19:07.346 --> 19:09.482 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RECOVER FROM THAT BLOW AND NOW

19:09.482 --> 19:11.083 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS BLOW?

19:11.083 --> 19:13.753 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, THE 2010 JANUARY

19:13.753 --> 19:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EARTHQUAKE LEFT HAITI BASICALLY

19:17.023 --> 19:19.959 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
50 YEARS BACK ECONOMICALLY AND

19:19.959 --> 19:21.293 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN TERMS OF RECONSTRUCTION SINCE

19:21.293 --> 19:23.496 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CAPITAL WAS FLATTENED.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MOVING FORWARD TO TODAY,

19:25.965 --> 19:31.170 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HURRICANE MATTHEW HAS CARVED YET

19:31.170 --> 19:34.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANOTHER DISASTROUS DENT INTO

19:34.440 --> 19:35.941 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAITI'S EFFORTS TO RECOVER FROM

19:35.941 --> 19:37.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE EARTHQUAKE.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.477 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE ELECTION BEING

19:38.477 --> 19:41.280 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POSTPONED, THAT MEANS THAT THERE

19:41.280 --> 19:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS ISN'T REALLY A-- THE

19:42.948 --> 19:44.016 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOLID INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE

19:44.016 --> 19:45.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEEDED TO DEAL WITH THESE KINDS

19:45.818 --> 19:47.686 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DISASTERS ARE NOT REALLY

19:47.686 --> 19:49.221 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORMED, AND THEY WON'T BE FORMED

19:49.221 --> 19:51.223 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNTIL THERE'S A FORMAL PRESIDENT

19:51.223 --> 19:55.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ELECTED, AND THAT TAKES OFFICE.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.162 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR NOW, THEY'VE BEEN FLOATING

19:56.162 --> 19:57.096 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONG.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.164 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HOWEVER, I JUST WANT TO ADD, IN

19:58.164 --> 20:00.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERMS OF HURRICANE MATTHEW'S

20:00.766 --> 20:03.636 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DAMAGE, WHAT'S EMERGING IS AN

20:03.636 --> 20:06.205 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ECOLOGICAL DISASTER.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.907 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TREES WERE RIPPED OUT IN

20:07.907 --> 20:09.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS AREA, WHICH IS THE

20:09.141 --> 20:12.344 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AGRICULTURAL BASKET OF HAITI.

20:12.344 --> 20:13.879 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALL THEIR AGRICULTURAL EXPORTS--

20:13.879 --> 20:16.582 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANGO, RICE, CORN, PAPAYAS--

20:16.582 --> 20:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EVERYTHING ELSE.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.418 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND AS WE KNOW ALREADY, HAITI

20:19.418 --> 20:21.520 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUFFERS FROM DEFORESTATION, 90%

20:21.520 --> 20:22.688 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF THE COUNTRY.

20:22.688 --> 20:24.290 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS WAS POSSIBLY THE ONLY

20:24.290 --> 20:26.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGION THAT WAS AS RICH IN SOIL

20:26.392 --> 20:28.394 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND IN VEGETATION.

20:28.394 --> 20:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IT'S A HUGE, HUGE, HUGE

20:32.798 --> 20:34.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IMPACT ECONOMICALLY.

20:34.200 --> 20:34.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
