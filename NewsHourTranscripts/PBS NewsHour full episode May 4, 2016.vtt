Judy Woodruff.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.474 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
Then there were three. Donald
Trump is now

00:11.311 --> 00:16.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the Republican Party's
presumptive nominee
for president, as Bernie Sanders
scores a

00:16.383 --> 00:18.552 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
win against Hillary Clinton in
Indiana.

00:18.652 --> 00:22.990 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead
this Wednesday:
on the ground in Iraq after ISIS
fighters

00:23.090 --> 00:26.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
kill a member of the U.S. Navy
SEALs in a
large-scale attack near Mosul.

00:27.027 --> 00:32.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Plus: Are today's
kids addicted
to their digital devices? We
hear from the

00:32.599 --> 00:34.701 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
creator of the new documentary
"Screenagers."

00:34.801 --> 00:39.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON, Filmmaker,
"Screenagers":
I knew, as a mom, that, every
day, there was

00:39.706 --> 00:44.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tension in the house, and I felt
completely
out of control on what to do,
what kind of

00:44.778 --> 00:47.714 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
limits to set, how this was
affecting them.

00:47.814 --> 00:50.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:50.384 --> 00:54.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:54.721 --> 01:07.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Republican
presidential
race is effectively over as of
tonight, and

01:07.567 --> 01:12.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the party's new leader is
looking ahead. At
the same time, detractors now
face a decision:

01:12.973 --> 01:15.342 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
how to reconcile with the new
reality.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
John Yang has our report.

01:17.244 --> 01:22.716 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On his first day as
the apparent
Republican nominee, Donald Trump
said he's

01:22.816 --> 01:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
confident the party will fall in
behind him,
but that some were welcome to
leave.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP (R), Presidential
Candidate:
I don't think it's imperative
that the entire

01:31.124 --> 01:36.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party come together. I don't
want everybody.
I don't even want certain people
that were

01:36.196 --> 01:38.799 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
extraordinarily nasty. Let them
go their own
way.

01:38.899 --> 01:43.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Trump, who rails
against politics
as usual, said he's looking for
a running

01:43.437 --> 01:47.474 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mate with a political background
to help him
navigate Washington.

01:47.574 --> 01:54.548 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took just a little more than
300 days for
the outsider to demolish a field
of 16 rivals,

01:54.648 --> 01:59.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including current and former
officeholders
with more than a century of
combined government

01:59.853 --> 02:01.588 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
experience.

02:01.688 --> 02:05.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Late today, the last opponent
standing, Ohio
Governor John Kasich, made it
official.

02:06.026 --> 02:11.365 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
GOV. JOHN KASICH (R-OH),
Presidential Candidate:
As I suspend my campaign today,
I have renewed

02:11.465 --> 02:20.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
faith, deeper faith that the
lord will show
me the way forward and fulfill
the purpose

02:21.041 --> 02:22.743 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of my life.

02:22.843 --> 02:26.646 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Ted Cruz quit last
night after
Trump routed him in the Indiana
primary.

02:26.747 --> 02:31.952 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
We gave it everything we have
got, but the

02:32.052 --> 02:34.521 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
voters chose another path.

02:34.621 --> 02:40.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Party chairman Reince
Priebus said
it's time for the party to get
behind Trump

02:40.293 --> 02:42.129 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and start working toward
November.

02:42.229 --> 02:44.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
REINCE PRIEBUS, Republican
National Committee
Chairman: We have got to unify.
We need time

02:44.598 --> 02:51.471 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to unify. And -- and we will
unify. But this
is what today starts, which is
this unification

02:51.571 --> 02:53.440 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
process.

02:53.540 --> 02:56.843 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But a parade of
prominent Republicans
is heading for the exits, some
even burning

02:56.943 --> 02:59.413 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their voter registration cards.

02:59.513 --> 03:04.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Freshman Senator Ben Sasse of
Nebraska said
he could never vote for Trump,
tweeting last

03:04.518 --> 03:12.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
night: "Reporters keep asking if
Indiana changes
anything for me. The answer is
simple. No."

03:12.192 --> 03:17.497 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And one-time Trump rival senator
Lindsey Graham
tweeted, "If we nominate Trump
we will get

03:17.597 --> 03:20.901 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
destroyed, and we will deserve
it."

03:21.001 --> 03:26.540 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Despite losing Indiana,
Democratic front-runner
Hillary Clinton now claims 93
percent of the

03:26.640 --> 03:32.312 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
delegates needed to clinch her
party's nomination.
But Bernie Sanders made clear
last night he's

03:32.412 --> 03:34.347 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
not going anywhere.

03:34.448 --> 03:37.717 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (VT-I),
Presidential Candidate:
I understand that Secretary
Clinton thinks

03:37.818 --> 03:44.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that this campaign is over. I
have got some
bad news for her.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.326 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:46.426 --> 03:50.530 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Clinton, meanwhile,
turned her
attention to Trump, as she did
today on CNN.

03:50.630 --> 03:54.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (D),
Presidential Candidate:
I have seen the presidency up
close from two

03:54.568 --> 03:58.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different perspectives, and I
think I know
what it takes. And I don't think
we can take

03:58.738 --> 04:02.442 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a risk on a loose cannon like
Donald Trump
running our country.

04:02.542 --> 04:07.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Already launching a
general election
campaign, while still working to
secure her

04:07.914 --> 04:09.616 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
own nomination.

04:09.716 --> 04:12.018 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm John
Yang.

04:12.119 --> 04:17.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We will
explore the new
lay of the land on both sides of
the presidential

04:17.624 --> 04:19.392 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
race after the news summary.

04:19.493 --> 04:23.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: A
wildfire burned its way into
Canada's main

04:23.997 --> 04:30.337 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
oil sands city and forced almost
90,000 people
to flee. Everyone was ordered
out of Fort

04:30.437 --> 04:35.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McMurray, Alberta, and the
province declared
a state of emergency. The fire
has raged across

04:35.976 --> 04:39.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
tinder-dry woodlands and
consumed entire suburbs.

04:40.013 --> 04:44.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Many people headed south. Others
sheltered
in nearby camps, and some
criticized the way

04:45.085 --> 04:46.887 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
it was handled.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOAN BATES, Resident: Well, it's
a disaster,
and I find that it is not fair.
They didn't

04:50.524 --> 04:55.996 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
even let us take our things when
we asked
them, so we lost everything now.

04:56.096 --> 05:01.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau
said today the country's
military stands ready

05:01.535 --> 05:03.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to help if needed.

05:03.403 --> 05:07.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: From fire to
water, President
Obama made a long-awaited visit
to Flint,

05:07.140 --> 05:10.911 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Michigan today, where the
drinking water has
been contaminated with lead.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.913 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

05:13.013 --> 05:17.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The president
was greeted
by gray skies and a line of
Michigan officials,

05:18.084 --> 05:22.822 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
including Republican Governor
Rick Snyder
and Flint Mayor Karen Weaver. He
urged parents

05:22.923 --> 05:27.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in Flint to have their kids
tested for lead
exposure and to use filters on
their tap water.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.362 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then, he took a drink himself.

05:29.462 --> 05:34.034 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Generally, I have not been doing
stunts here,

05:34.134 --> 05:38.638 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
but -- and this used a filter.

05:38.738 --> 05:42.542 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: His visit was
prompted in
part by a letter from Mari
Copeny, an 8-year-old

05:42.642 --> 05:44.477 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
girl in Flint.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.247 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARI COPENY, Flint Resident: I
am one of the
children that is affected by
this water, and

05:47.347 --> 05:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been doing my best to
march in protest
and speak out for all the kids
that live here

05:54.721 --> 05:56.489 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
in Flint.

05:56.590 --> 05:59.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Known as
Little Miss Flint,
she and other residents had the
chance to

05:59.526 --> 06:01.328 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
meet with the president today.

06:01.428 --> 06:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: You should be
angry, but channel
that anger. You should be hurt,
but don't

06:08.935 --> 06:18.645 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sink into despair. And most of
all, do not
somehow communicate to our
children here in

06:18.745 --> 06:27.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this city that they're going to
be saddled
with problems for the rest of
their lives,

06:27.354 --> 06:30.457 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
because they will not. They will
do just fine.
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All of this
comes two years
after the city's water source
was switched

06:30.557 --> 06:35.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to the Flint River to save
money. After months
of complaints of tainted water,
officials

06:35.495 --> 06:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
acknowledged the river water
wasn't treated
properly and had leached lead
from old pipes

06:40.300 --> 06:42.102 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into people's water supply.

06:42.202 --> 06:46.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The city has stopped using the
river, and
lead levels are gradually
falling. But questions

06:47.007 --> 06:51.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
persist about who knew what and
when about
the lead contamination.

06:51.678 --> 06:55.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Julie Mack is a reporter at
Michigan-Live,
a state newspaper consortium.
She was part

06:56.049 --> 07:00.320 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of an investigative team looking
into e-mails
and documents from Governor
Snyder and his

07:00.420 --> 07:02.155 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
inner circle.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Julie Mack, MLive.Com: There was
something
obviously seriously wrong with
the water.

07:05.258 --> 07:11.965 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People are coming to showing off
jugs of brown
water for a year, you know, 17
months, before

07:12.065 --> 07:17.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they did anything. And that
remains a puzzle
of, why did it take so long for
there to be

07:17.837 --> 07:18.471 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
action?

07:18.571 --> 07:19.606 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BOOING)

07:19.706 --> 07:21.441 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
GOV. RICK SNYDER (R), Michigan:
Good afternoon.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Snyder himself
was heckled
and booed today at his speech in
Flint, and

07:24.010 --> 07:28.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he apologized again, saying --
quote -- "Your
government failed you."

07:28.448 --> 07:33.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Looking ahead, the mayor of
Flint estimates
it will cost $55 million to
remove and replace

07:33.987 --> 07:40.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Flint's old lead pipes. The
Michigan legislature
has approved $67 million since
October, but,

07:40.327 --> 07:42.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so far, the money has been slow
to reach residents.

07:43.063 --> 07:48.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A congressional package of $100
million for
the water system and $50 million
for health

07:48.702 --> 07:52.739 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
care needs associated with lead
poisoning
is still awaiting action.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
William Brangham.

07:55.108 --> 08:00.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.S. Justice
Department
warned North Carolina today not
to enforce

08:00.246 --> 08:07.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a new LGBT law. The statute
limits protections
for gays, lesbians, bisexual and
transgender

08:07.987 --> 08:12.459 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people. The Justice Department
said it violates
federal civil rights laws. The
department

08:12.559 --> 08:17.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
notified Republican Governor Pat
McCrory that
the state could lose hundreds of
millions

08:17.831 --> 08:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of dollars in federal funding.

HARI SREENIVASAN: The biggest
automotive recall
in U.S. history will get even
bigger. Japan's

08:24.270 --> 08:29.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Takata Corporation is adding up
to 40 million
additional air bag inflators on
top of almost

08:29.342 --> 08:34.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
30 million already recalled. In
some cases,
the devices can fire metal
shards when they

08:34.781 --> 08:39.085 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go off. But federal regulators
acknowledged
today that replacing all of them
is a huge

08:39.185 --> 08:41.020 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
job.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.956 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK ROSEKIND, Administrator,
National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration:
There is already

08:43.056 --> 08:45.024 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concern about supply being
available. Part
of the issue here is to make
sure we accelerate

08:45.125 --> 08:49.562 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and as quickly as possible get
the replacements,
but we do not want to introduce
new safety

08:49.662 --> 08:51.898 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
risks by pushing too fast too
hard.

08:51.998 --> 08:56.336 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The Takata air
bags have
been linked to at least 11
deaths.

08:56.436 --> 09:00.840 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In Syria, the
government and
moderate rebel factions have
agreed to restore

09:00.940 --> 09:06.713 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a fragile cease-fire in Aleppo,
after days
of fierce fighting. The U.S. and
Russia worked

09:06.813 --> 09:12.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out the agreement, on the heels
of similar
deals in Damascus and Latakia
province. The

09:12.552 --> 09:17.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Syrian military said later that
the Aleppo
truce is good for only 48 hours.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The global
tobacco industry
was dealt a double blow today.
The European

09:22.028 --> 09:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Union's highest court upheld
requirements
that cigarettes be sold in plain
packages.

09:26.666 --> 09:31.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The rules also limit advertising
for e-cigarettes.
Separately, India's Supreme
Court ordered

09:31.371 --> 09:35.508 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that health warnings cover 85
percent of a
cigarette pack's surface.

09:35.608 --> 09:39.879 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, the federal
Transportation Security
Administration is

09:39.979 --> 09:44.517 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
moving to address long lines at
the busiest
U.S. airports.

09:44.617 --> 09:50.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Officials said today they're
adding more screeners
and bomb-sniffing dogs to
expedite screening.

09:50.190 --> 09:55.728 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Airlines have voiced concerns
that growing
wait times will affect the peak
summer travel

09:55.829 --> 09:57.630 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
season.

09:57.730 --> 10:00.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And on Wall
Street, stocks
sagged after a private survey of
job creation

10:00.633 --> 10:04.737 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turned in disappointing numbers.
The Dow Jones
industrial average lost 99
points to close

10:04.838 --> 10:11.377 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at 17651. The Nasdaq fell 37
points, and the
S&amp;P 500 slipped 12.

10:11.478 --> 10:15.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
will the
GOP finally rally around Donald
Trump? We

10:16.049 --> 10:21.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
get takes from political
reporters and former
presidential candidate Ben
Carson; the U.S.

10:21.521 --> 10:28.695 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
role in fighting ISIS under fire
after a Navy
seal is killed in Iraq; why half
of all teenagers

10:28.795 --> 10:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
say they're addicted to their
phones; and
much more.

10:36.069 --> 10:48.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On this day with
more than
its share of political tumult,
the questions

10:48.815 --> 10:54.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
abound. How exactly did Donald
Trump upend
the Republican Party to become
its presumptive

10:54.921 --> 10:59.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
nominee for president? And how
does Bernie
Sanders' decision to stay in the
race affect

10:59.959 --> 11:01.928 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Hillary Clinton?

11:02.028 --> 11:07.901 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For some answers, we turn to
Susan Page, Washington
bureau chief for USA Today, and
Karen Tumulty,

11:08.001 --> 11:10.904 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
national political correspondent
for The Washington
Post.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.805 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

11:12.906 --> 11:17.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's fair to say
that, a year
ago, hardly anybody thought
Donald Trump would

11:17.176 --> 11:22.882 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
have sewn up his party's
nomination by now,
Susan, much less before Hillary
Clinton sews

11:22.982 --> 11:24.817 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
up hers. How did he do it?

11:24.918 --> 11:26.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE, Washington Bureau
Chief, USA Today:
You know, he didn't have the
best campaign

11:26.886 --> 11:30.557 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
organization. He didn't have
experienced people
around him. He didn't have the
best pollster,

11:30.657 --> 11:32.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the best ads. He didn't spend
the most money.

11:32.559 --> 11:35.962 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had a message. He had a
message and an
understanding of the mood of the
part of the

11:36.062 --> 11:41.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
American electorate that almost
no one else
did, at how angry and frustrated
and how much

11:41.200 --> 11:46.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a desire of a different kind of
politics -- that
group of Republicans in these
primaries, the

11:46.873 --> 11:48.508 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of politics they were ready
to embrace.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.343 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karen, what would
you add?

11:50.443 --> 11:52.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY, The Washington
Post: Well,
I think not only did he have
that. He had

11:53.012 --> 11:54.714 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it early.

11:54.814 --> 12:03.189 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The fact is, Donald Trump, six
days after
the 2012 election, filed the
paperwork to

12:03.289 --> 12:08.628 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trademark the phrase that would
become the
signature of his campaign, which
is "Make

12:08.728 --> 12:13.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America great again." He not
only had a sense
of the electorate, but he had it
early, and

12:13.733 --> 12:19.672 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had it at a time when the
Republican Party
elders thought that there -- you
know, that

12:19.772 --> 12:24.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what they needed to be doing was
sort of softening
the edges of the party, you
know, appealing

12:24.243 --> 12:27.380 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to women and Hispanics and young
people.

12:27.480 --> 12:32.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Donald Trump sensed that what
would win this
primary race was exactly the
opposite.

12:32.986 --> 12:37.256 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, here we are
now. He's sewn
it up. All day long, I think, we
have been

12:37.357 --> 12:41.995 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
watching a parade of
Republicans, conservatives
either saying never Donald
Trump, they're

12:42.095 --> 12:47.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to go with him, Susan,
or some of
them gradually falling in line.

12:47.166 --> 12:51.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How serious opposition -- is the
opposition
that he faces in his own party?

12:51.270 --> 12:54.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: I think the
opposition is not
serious in terms of getting the
nomination.

12:54.374 --> 12:59.445 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that battle is over, and
he is now
the face of the Republican
Party.

12:59.545 --> 13:04.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you do see some fervent
supporters, most
of them not really elected
senior Republicans,

13:04.350 --> 13:07.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
mostly in the electorate. You
see a couple
of people saying they won't vote
for him.

13:07.854 --> 13:11.224 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But you know the favorite line
of the Republicans
who are running for the Senate
this year is

13:11.324 --> 13:15.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that I'm going to summit the
nominee, without
saying Donald Trump's name.

13:15.928 --> 13:20.299 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, this is a distinction that
I think Democratic
ad makers, Democratic opponents
aren't going

13:20.400 --> 13:24.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to recognize. But it's an effort
to not break
with the party, and yet not get
too close

13:24.871 --> 13:30.143 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to Donald Trump, because while
he succeeded
in winning this nomination, he
is at odds

13:30.243 --> 13:34.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the kind of coalition that
we think you
need to have to actually win the
presidency.

13:34.947 --> 13:39.118 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Karen, you
actually interviewed
Donald Trump last night as the
results from

13:39.218 --> 13:44.891 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Indiana were coming in. What are
the challenges
that he faces now heading into
this general

13:44.991 --> 13:46.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
election?

13:47.060 --> 13:50.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: Well, I think
that the challenges
are going to be presenting
himself to an electorate

13:51.097 --> 13:57.203 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
that goes beyond the most
fervent conservative
-- most fervent grassroots
Republicans.

13:57.303 --> 14:05.244 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is going to be transforming
himself into
something and somebody who the
broader swathe

14:05.344 --> 14:10.183 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the electorate can actually
imagine in
the Oval Office. The other
thing, and what

14:10.283 --> 14:15.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he told me in the interview, he
has decided
that what he has to do is make
Hillary Clinton

14:15.555 --> 14:17.290 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
unacceptable to them.

14:17.390 --> 14:23.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he plans to do that, he told
me, not by
focusing on her ideas and what
she would do

14:23.696 --> 14:29.202 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for the country, but rather her
past, that
he thinks that that is a lot of
fertile territory.

14:29.302 --> 14:33.639 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Susan, how
does she counterñ
that? She said in an interview
today on CNN

14:33.740 --> 14:38.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
she views him as a loose cannon.
She used
that term over and over again.
What are we

14:38.544 --> 14:40.413 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
looking at?

14:40.513 --> 14:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: So, we're looking at
two candidates
who are each going to spend
their time talking

14:42.014 --> 14:45.284 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about the how terrible the other
one is, right?

14:45.384 --> 14:48.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is what I think you do in
an election
where both candidates have
negative ratings

14:48.921 --> 14:53.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of above 50 percent. There's
limits to how
much they can persuade people
that they're

14:53.826 --> 14:57.563 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the optimistic candidate of the
future they
ought to embrace. But they need
to make the

14:57.663 --> 15:02.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
case that the other guy is
simply unacceptable,
so Donald Trump talking about
Hillary Clinton

15:02.402 --> 15:04.203 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that way.

15:04.303 --> 15:07.306 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Hillary Clinton describing
Donald Trump as
not an acceptable commander in
chief, I think

15:07.406 --> 15:10.643 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that's a particular theme we're
going to see
her hit over and over again, and
someone who

15:10.743 --> 15:12.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
doesn't have the temperament you
need to be
president.

15:12.979 --> 15:17.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, meantime,
Karen, Hillary
Clinton still faces a challenger
in her own

15:17.750 --> 15:23.523 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
party. Bernie Sanders, as we
know, won the
Indiana primary. He's likely or
expected to

15:23.623 --> 15:28.327 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
win some of the primaries coming
up between
now and the convention.

15:28.427 --> 15:35.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How much of -- how does that
affect Hillary
Clinton's path from now until
the convention

15:36.002 --> 15:37.837 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in Philadelphia?

15:37.937 --> 15:41.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: You know, it
probably doesn't
affect her chances of winning
the nomination.

15:41.741 --> 15:46.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What it could affect -- and this
ball is very
much in Bernie Sanders' court --
what it could

15:46.913 --> 15:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
affect is how enthusiastic
Bernie Sanders'
supporters are about supporting
her, about

15:53.319 --> 16:00.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
turning up and voting for her in
the fall.
And this is a choice as -- you
know, the Clinton

16:00.226 --> 16:05.398 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
campaign has said but it's a
real choice as
to, you know, what kind of tone
he takes for

16:05.498 --> 16:10.069 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the remainder of the primary,
whether it's
talking about his ideas and how
he wants to

16:10.169 --> 16:15.575 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
shape the Democratic agenda or
whether it
is beating up on the most likely
nominee.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.610 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see
that Democratic
contest, Susan?

16:17.710 --> 16:21.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SUSAN PAGE: Well, you know, I
think it's a
constant reminder of some of
Hillary Clinton's

16:21.314 --> 16:27.086 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
weaknesses to have Bernie
Sanders not only
out there running, but beating
her in primaries,

16:27.186 --> 16:29.021 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as he did last night.

16:29.121 --> 16:31.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it prevents her from doing
what we traditionally
see candidates do, which is move
a little

16:31.757 --> 16:35.828 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
bit to the middle after securing
their party's
nomination. She is, I think, not
able to do

16:35.928 --> 16:39.131 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that. She needs to stay -- she's
been pulled
a little bit to the left, tugged
to left by

16:39.232 --> 16:41.434 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
him, particularly, say, on the
issue of trade.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's going to keep her there.
And that's a
battle that I think we will see
fought out

16:44.537 --> 16:48.074 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
over the platform when you come
to the Democratic
Convention in July.

16:48.174 --> 16:53.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, meantime,
Karen, still,
so much attention on Donald
Trump and what

16:53.446 --> 16:56.449 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he has been able to pull off and
what he needs
to do.

16:56.549 --> 17:02.755 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From your conversation with him,
what kind
of sense did you get of how he
sees his own

17:02.855 --> 17:06.092 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenge in the next months --
in the months
to come?

17:06.192 --> 17:11.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KAREN TUMULTY: You know, he --
he sounded
pretty happy with the kind of
campaign he

17:11.364 --> 17:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
has run, and seems to believe
that he can
continue to do that.

17:15.368 --> 17:22.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think, however, that a general
election
campaign is going to require a
different kind

17:22.608 --> 17:28.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of campaign operation. A lot of
people are
worried that he may not have the
-- because

17:28.414 --> 17:33.986 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he's been self-funding, he may
not have the
fund-raising capacity that he
will need to

17:34.086 --> 17:40.092 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
go into what one -- one --
Stuart Stevens,
Mitt Romney's former strategist,
described

17:40.192 --> 17:45.631 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to me as a billion-dollar buzz
saw that the
Democrats are preparing for him.

17:45.731 --> 17:49.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump points out, well, they
have spent all
this money already in the
Republican primary,

17:49.835 --> 17:51.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and it didn't do a thing to me.

17:51.771 --> 17:54.640 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, just
quickly, Susan,
a lot of people think, well, he
is a billionaire.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.608 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
He can pay his own way.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.509 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But it's not that simple.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: It's not.

17:58.511 --> 18:00.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And look at how carefully the
Clinton people
are pursuing this. You know
where Hillary

18:00.479 --> 18:03.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Clinton was last night? She was
in Ohio. That
is going to be a swing state.
They are already

18:04.083 --> 18:05.284 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
laying the groundwork there.

18:05.384 --> 18:07.920 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Susan Page, Karen
Tumulty,
we thank you both.

18:08.020 --> 18:08.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
SUSAN PAGE: Thank you.

18:08.821 --> 18:10.623 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
KAREN TUMULTY: Thank you.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And there's more
to come. We
will be back a little later in
the program

18:12.525 --> 18:23.436 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
to talk with
Trump-rival-turned-supporter
Dr. Ben Carson.

18:23.536 --> 18:31.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There were
more details
today about the death of Navy
SEAL Charles

18:31.610 --> 18:35.614 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Keating in a firefight yesterday
with ISIS
militants in Northern Iraq.

18:35.715 --> 18:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. has moved in more
troops and materiel
recently to support Iraqi
military efforts

18:41.187 --> 18:45.825 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
against the group. At the same
time, there
is political turmoil in Baghdad,
where the

18:45.925 --> 18:51.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
government of Prime Minister
Haider al-Abadi
is facing challenges from rival
Shia groups.

18:51.197 --> 18:55.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For more, I'm joined now by The
Washington
Post's Baghdad bureau chief,
Loveday Morris.

18:55.901 --> 18:59.372 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She just returned from the front
lines in
Northern Iraq.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.240 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Loveday Morris, thanks for
joining us.

19:01.340 --> 19:04.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You were near the front lines of
this battle.
Describe the situation there.
What did you

19:04.176 --> 19:05.945 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
see?

19:06.045 --> 19:08.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS, The Washington
Post: What
we are seeing on the front lines
at the moment

19:08.547 --> 19:14.153 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is an increased U.S. troop
presence outside
of the more established Iraqi
bases.

19:14.253 --> 19:20.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The line where I was at, south
of Mosul, now
there's a U.S. artillery base
which is relatively

19:21.060 --> 19:28.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
close to the front lines. And
the problem
with these front lines are that,
that scrappy

19:28.100 --> 19:32.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
line, you have suicide bombers
penetrating
the lines regularly.

19:32.271 --> 19:42.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, as we see more troops, more
U.S. troops
coming, there were more
announced by the president,

19:42.748 --> 19:46.352 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
there is an increased risk for
them.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What do you
know now about
how this SEAL died?

19:49.355 --> 19:57.296 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LOVEDAY MORRIS: What the
Pentagon is saying
that, at around 7:30 a.m., a
large-scale ISIS

19:57.396 --> 20:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
attack broke through the Kurdish
Peshmerga
at the line.

20:01.233 --> 20:08.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
These Navy SEALs, they came as a
part of a
rapid reaction force, and this
SEAL sadly

20:08.474 --> 20:10.543 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
died while trying to assist
them.

20:10.643 --> 20:14.113 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Yesterday, the
secretary
of defense said that this was a
combat death.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.850 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then the White House said
this soldier
wasn't on a combat mission.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.854 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How would you describe what U.S.
forces are
doing on the ground in Iraq?

20:21.954 --> 20:26.759 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS: I think a lot of
people are
confused, and I can see why.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The problem is, if you have U.S.
forces dotted
along front lines that are
scrappy front lines,

20:28.527 --> 20:30.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and getting entangled when there
are ISIS
attacks, calling for assistance,
and then

20:30.362 --> 20:38.137 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
becoming involved in firefights,
I mean, is
that -- do you clock that as
combat, or do

20:38.237 --> 20:43.175 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you clock that as advise and
assist?

20:43.275 --> 20:55.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Iraqis that were around --
we talked to
a lot of Iraqis that were around
when this

20:55.521 --> 21:00.860 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
incident happened actually on
Tuesday, and
they actually seemed to be under
the impression

21:00.960 --> 21:05.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that these SEALs were assisting
them take
back the town. They seemed to
think that they

21:05.197 --> 21:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were part of a counteroffensive
to take back
the town.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.037 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We have seen
quite a bit
of protests and demonstrations
against the

21:12.138 --> 21:15.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Iraqi government, due to
corruption and lack
of services.

21:15.574 --> 21:18.944 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's the political situation
like, and how
is that affecting what's
happening on the

21:19.044 --> 21:20.479 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
battlefield?

21:20.579 --> 21:24.416 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS: At the moment,
the political
situation is a big worry.

21:24.517 --> 21:28.454 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There's a worry that it's going
to delay plans
for any Mosul offensive. The
prime minister,

21:28.554 --> 21:36.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi,
he is the
commander in chief of the armed
forces. He's

21:36.295 --> 21:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
America's main partner when it
comes to fighting
ISIS on the ground in Iraq.

21:41.233 --> 21:45.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His position is in question.
He's fighting
for his political survival.
Everyone's very

21:45.971 --> 21:55.614 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
worried about the potential for
a political
vacuum. That would have a huge
impact on the

21:55.714 --> 22:01.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
U.S.' campaign. They're here at
the invitation
of the Iraqi government. What
happens if you

22:01.687 --> 22:05.591 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have a power vacuum here? It's
definitely
a big concern for them.

22:05.691 --> 22:10.029 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Loveday Morris
of The Washington
Post, joining us via Skype from
Baghdad, thanks

22:10.129 --> 22:12.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so much.

22:12.131 --> 22:19.605 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOVEDAY MORRIS: Thank you.

22:19.705 --> 22:24.176 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Stay with us.

22:24.276 --> 22:29.148 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
shocking number
of deaths attributed to
preventable medical

22:29.248 --> 22:42.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
errors; the life of James Brown,
a metaphor
for our struggle with race and
class; and

22:42.895 --> 22:50.102 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, first, a new report looks
at how digital
devices are taking a toll on
kids and families.

22:50.202 --> 22:55.808 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The report issued yesterday by
Common Sense
Media found half of all young
people feel

22:55.908 --> 23:01.013 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they are addicted to their
devices. Almost
60 percent of adults think their
kids are

23:01.113 --> 23:07.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
addicted too. And a third of
parents and teens
say that they argue daily about
screen time.

23:07.820 --> 23:12.925 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now a new documentary explores
this topic
and offers ideas about what
families can do

23:13.025 --> 23:14.960 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to navigate these waters.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.429 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
William Brangham is back with
our look.

23:17.529 --> 23:23.469 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
documentary is called
"Screenagers," and, in it, Dr.
Delaney Ruston

23:23.569 --> 23:28.474 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
explores the complex
relationship teenagers
have with their screens, both
the pleasures

23:28.574 --> 23:33.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they take in sharing their lives
online with
their friends, as well as the
darker side,

23:33.812 --> 23:37.650 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
those who lose control of their
digital habits,
and spiral into damaging
behavior.

23:37.750 --> 23:44.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN: When I went to hug him, I
could feel
the bones in his back. And that
was scary.

23:44.323 --> 23:48.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The film also
looks at the
latest research about the impact
all this

23:48.627 --> 23:50.763 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
screen time has on the brains of
young people.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SHERRY TURKLE, Massachusetts
Institute of
Technology: You have a brain
that is wired

23:54.066 --> 23:58.404 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for what in psychology is called
seeking behavior,
the kind of thing that a Google
search gives

23:58.504 --> 24:01.173 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you, something new, something
stimulating,
something different.

24:01.273 --> 24:06.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Throughout the
film, Ruston
also turns the camera on
herself, exploring

24:06.679 --> 24:11.483 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the real and all-too-common
conflicts that
flare up as she and her family
haggle over

24:11.583 --> 24:13.319 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
screen time.

24:13.419 --> 24:15.020 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON, Filmmaker,
"Screenagers":
What should the rules be?
Because we don't

24:15.120 --> 24:16.855 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have any right now.

24:16.955 --> 24:20.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TESSA, Daughter: I think the
rules should
be there is no rule. It's not
like I'm on

24:20.959 --> 24:22.795 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it 24/7.

24:22.895 --> 24:26.198 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON: When you
have it, you're
always checking it. And I --
don't you think

24:26.298 --> 24:28.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
that...

24:28.200 --> 24:31.804 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TESSA: Well, if you put this in
front of me,
yes, I will go on it, and, yes,
I can find

24:31.904 --> 24:33.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
something to do on it.

24:33.739 --> 24:42.948 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON: Tessa, why
are you so
mad? OK. Just get dressed. I'm
sorry you're

24:43.048 --> 24:44.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
crying.

24:44.650 --> 24:48.287 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I met with
Delaney Ruston
last week in Washington, D.C.

24:48.387 --> 24:52.191 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I wonder, what was that --
initially, what
made you want to do this film?

24:52.291 --> 24:56.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON: Well, I was
having a really
hard time as a mom with my two
kids. You know,

24:56.895 --> 25:01.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
my son wanted to play video
games a lot and
my daughter really wanted more
and more social

25:01.567 --> 25:04.603 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
media, and I felt completely out
of control.

25:04.703 --> 25:10.376 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And, as a doctor, I was
thinking, what is
the impact of all this screen
time? I knew,

25:10.476 --> 25:15.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as a mom, that, every day, there
was tension
in the house, and I felt
completely out of

25:15.981 --> 25:20.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
control on what to do, what kind
of limits
to set, how this was affecting
them.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.989 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now that you
have done all
this research, what was it, I'm
curious, that

25:24.089 --> 25:25.924 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
most surprised you that you
found?

25:26.024 --> 25:28.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON: Well, I
think one thing
that really helped me to start
to be a better

25:28.894 --> 25:35.801 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
parent around this is to learn
that the dopamine
that's secreted in the brain's
pleasure center

25:35.901 --> 25:42.307 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
when we get new bits of
information and we
look at the screens, that center
of the brain

25:42.408 --> 25:45.944 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is most activated when we're
kids and we're
teenagers.

25:46.044 --> 25:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, knowing that they are so
pulled into these
in a way that we can't even
understand has

25:53.485 --> 25:59.858 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
made me not be as angry at them,
but realize
there's a lot more I need to do
as -- in my

25:59.958 --> 26:01.860 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
parenting.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.929 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: So, these are
little electronic
drug delivery devices? I know
that's a crude

26:04.029 --> 26:05.631 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
way to put it, but that's what
you're saying.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON: Absolutely.

26:07.666 --> 26:12.971 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, it's amazing that
there's many studies
that look at MRI scans of the
brain of kids

26:13.071 --> 26:17.976 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who play a lot of video games,
20 hours or
more of video games a week. And
when they

26:18.076 --> 26:23.081 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
compare them to people who are
addicted to,
say, drugs or alcohol, their
brains scans

26:23.182 --> 26:29.455 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are similar. So, something is
really happening
on a physiological level. It's
not just psychological.

26:29.555 --> 26:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN: We exposed young mice to
switching sounds
and light.

26:33.091 --> 26:37.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: In the film,
Ruston talks
with researchers who are
studying what multitasking,

26:37.329 --> 26:42.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
switching rapidly back and forth
between digital
devices, does to the brain
function of mice.

26:42.434 --> 26:46.405 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Afterwards, we looked at
the effect on
learning and found that the
ability of these

26:46.505 --> 26:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
young mice to learn new things
was very much
compromised.

26:52.311 --> 26:57.916 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It took them three times longer
or more to
learn how to go through a maze
than the non-exposed

26:58.016 --> 27:04.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
young mice. We are exposing a
whole generation
of children to this rapid-paced
media, and

27:04.790 --> 27:08.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we have no clue what it does to
the brain.
And if it's the same as we see
in the mice,

27:08.627 --> 27:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
then this is very shocking news.

27:10.863 --> 27:15.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I mean, does
that kind of
stuff terrify you? Or do you
think this research

27:15.367 --> 27:19.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is not necessarily analogous? I
mean, how
are people supposed to process
this information?

27:19.171 --> 27:23.876 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON: You know, I
think it's
a question about how much we're
giving kids

27:23.976 --> 27:29.648 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
full potential in everything
that they do.
And, to me, a big issue is how
much time they

27:29.748 --> 27:35.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have with all sorts of skills
that they're
learning offline, social
engagement, competency,

27:36.088 --> 27:37.856 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
talking to people face to face.

27:37.956 --> 27:42.427 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think, if we're giving
them a lot of
those situations, that even if
there's some

27:42.528 --> 27:49.234 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
concern about attention span and
possibly
some changes in the brain, I
think that humans

27:49.334 --> 27:54.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are resilient enough -- and
already we're
seeing that people are not, you
know, dropping

27:54.239 --> 27:58.977 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
like flies from screen time. I
don't think
we're at that place yet where we
need to be

27:59.077 --> 28:00.913 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
really alarmist.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's say I'm
a parent and
I come to you and I say, I have
a young kid,

28:04.216 --> 28:08.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
maybe a 10-year-old daughter.
When should
I get her a phone? What would
you tell this

28:08.554 --> 28:10.355 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
parent?

28:10.455 --> 28:13.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON: I think, you
know, obviously,
every kid is different, and
that's really

28:13.692 --> 28:16.461 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
important. And every situation
in the home
is different.

28:16.562 --> 28:23.035 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But I do worry that it is
getting younger
and younger. And when we bring
them -- start

28:23.135 --> 28:27.239 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
having them in elementary
school, we have
to wonder, when is it too young
that they're

28:27.339 --> 28:32.477 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not going to be able to resist
the impulse
to check or to post?

28:32.578 --> 28:36.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MAN: Every girl in the picture
is locked into
her phone. Peralta knocks it
into center.

28:36.715 --> 28:44.222 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
David tonight 2-2, a leadoff
single here in
the fourth, and nobody noticed.

28:44.323 --> 28:48.060 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to -- can we do an
intervention?

28:48.160 --> 28:54.399 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON: This is all
about teaching
kids self-control, and what we
have learned

28:54.499 --> 29:00.238 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
through the research is that
it's absolutely
teachable. So, I would really
discourage a

29:00.339 --> 29:05.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
family from getting a child a
device when
they don't feel like they are
going to be

29:05.877 --> 29:09.781 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
able to control themselves from
when they
use it.

29:09.881 --> 29:15.887 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Ruston has
been taking her
film across the country
recently, holding

29:15.988 --> 29:21.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
screenings in dozens of cities,
encouraging
parents and kids to come, to
watch, and to

29:21.860 --> 29:23.629 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
then continue the conversation
at home.

29:23.729 --> 29:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. DELANEY RUSTON: You know
what I think
is really exciting, is that kids
and teenagers

29:26.932 --> 29:29.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
actually want to talk about
these issues.

29:29.434 --> 29:35.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that it doesn't take
that long
in homeroom or in some other
setting to ask

29:36.074 --> 29:41.680 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
these questions about, what are
you struggling
with, with your screen time, or
what do you

29:41.780 --> 29:47.853 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
see happening on social media?
And once we
say we want to hear from you,
then they care,

29:47.953 --> 29:52.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as opposed to what I see so
often is this
message of zero tolerance, let's
just take

29:52.724 --> 29:54.559 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
everything away and get mad at
you.

29:54.660 --> 29:58.597 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's not going to get kids to
open up and
feel comfortable to be a part of
this, and

29:58.697 --> 30:00.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that's really what this is going
to take.

30:00.465 --> 30:11.243 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For the "PBS
NewsHour,"
I'm William Brangham in
Washington, D.C.

30:11.343 --> 30:21.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: For the better
part of two
decades, there's been a growing
recognition

30:22.054 --> 30:25.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that medical errors kill too
many patients
in the U.S.

30:25.857 --> 30:31.430 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
While exact numbers are elusive,
a new analysis
and estimate portrays an even
grimmer picture.

30:31.530 --> 30:38.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new paper finds that as many
as 250,000
people die each year from errors
in hospitals

30:38.537 --> 30:43.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
and other health care
facilities. That would
make it the third leading cause
of death in

30:43.608 --> 30:47.412 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the U.S., ahead of respiratory
disease, accidents
and even stroke.

30:47.512 --> 30:50.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Dr. Martin Makary, a professor
of surgery
at the Johns Hopkins University
School of

30:51.049 --> 30:53.085 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Medicine who led the research,
joins me now.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, how did we get to this
number? What did
your research find?

30:55.854 --> 30:57.622 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARTIN MAKARY, Professor of
Surgery, Johns
Hopkins University School of
Medicine: Well,

30:57.723 --> 31:01.827 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we took the best available
studies, the data
from the medical literature, and
we basically

31:01.927 --> 31:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
came up with a meta-analysis
point estimate,
and then asked, where would that
fall if medical

31:07.566 --> 31:09.468 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
error were counted as a disease?

31:09.568 --> 31:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It turns out that we learned
that the CDC
doesn't consider medical error
to be a cause

31:15.006 --> 31:20.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of death in listing our national
health statistics
each year, even though the point
estimate

31:20.345 --> 31:24.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
comes right in between number
two and number
three on the list, which means
medical error

31:24.616 --> 31:28.286 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the number three cause of
death in the
United States. We're just not
measuring it.

31:28.386 --> 31:30.555 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: OK. So, let's
talk a little
bit about the methodology.

31:30.655 --> 31:36.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If the numbers are scarce, are
these studies
representative enough sample
sets to be able

31:36.428 --> 31:38.263 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to extrapolate this
quarter-million?

31:38.363 --> 31:42.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARTIN MAKARY: These are
studies of hundreds
of thousands of hospitalizations
in the top

31:42.667 --> 31:48.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
medical journals. And they are
updating the
1999 Institute of Medicine
report.

31:48.707 --> 31:53.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's broad consensus that
the range
is somewhere between 200,000 and
400,000.

31:53.779 --> 31:59.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Our analysis came up with
251,000. No matter
what number you pick, it is well
above the

31:59.384 --> 32:04.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
currently listed number three
cause of death.
And it turns out that the reason
it's not

32:04.322 --> 32:10.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
being counted is that the system
relies on
billing codes to compile our
national health

32:10.328 --> 32:12.197 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
statistics.

32:12.297 --> 32:17.369 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But people don't always die of a
billing code.
They can die from diagnostic
errors, fragmented

32:17.469 --> 32:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
care, preventable complications.
These are
not things that are captured in
national health

32:22.107 --> 32:26.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
statistics. That list of most
common causes
of death in the United States,
that list is

32:26.711 --> 32:28.680 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a big deal.

32:28.780 --> 32:33.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It informs all of our research
funding priorities
as a country, all of our public
health campaigns.

32:33.718 --> 32:38.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We spend a lot of time and money
on heart
disease and cancer, but we
haven't even really

32:38.323 --> 32:46.131 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
recognized that the third
leading burden on
health in America in terms of
death is medical

32:46.231 --> 32:47.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
error in its many forms.

32:48.099 --> 32:51.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, how do
systems change
to try to adapt for this? I
remember there

32:51.503 --> 32:55.841 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was a book written a while ago
about the checklist,
and actually preventing surgical
errors just

32:55.941 --> 32:57.709 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by something as simple as that.

32:57.809 --> 33:01.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are there systemic improvements
that we can
make to try to decrease this
error rate?

33:01.947 --> 33:06.351 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARTIN MAKARY: Well, there
are so many
great homegrown ideas by doctors
around the

33:06.451 --> 33:09.988 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
country, hospital associations,
national collaboratives.

33:10.088 --> 33:15.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the important work that
they're doing
is vastly underfunded and
underappreciated.

33:15.393 --> 33:19.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our large research center in
patient safety
at Johns Hopkins has applied for
numerous

33:19.531 --> 33:24.669 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
federal grants, and we keep
getting message
back, this is not within the
scope of the

33:24.769 --> 33:28.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NIH. This is not within the
scope of the National
Cancer Institute.

33:28.840 --> 33:33.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of these grants are
relegated to a
very small agency with a
fraction of the budget,

33:34.012 --> 33:38.783 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
$300 million for the entire
agency, including
the grants. If you look at the
number of people

33:38.884 --> 33:43.321 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that die from breast cancer,
it's about a
fourth or a fifth of the number
of people

33:43.421 --> 33:45.824 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that die from medical care gone
wrong.

33:45.924 --> 33:52.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And yet they have billions more
because of
the great lobbying efforts and
the vocal advocacy

33:52.364 --> 33:57.936 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
work of that group. Well, it
turns out that
it's not proportional to the
burden of preventable

33:58.036 --> 33:59.938 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health in America.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How do you
capture the number
of people who might not be
killed by a medical

34:03.742 --> 34:08.747 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
error, but might be with some
serious negative
health outcomes when they leave
the hospital?

34:08.847 --> 34:13.018 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARTIN MAKARY: Well, studies
in -- even
in "The New England Journal of
Medicine" show

34:13.118 --> 34:17.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that as many as one in four
patients in the
hospital will have some medical
error that

34:17.689 --> 34:21.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they experience, almost always
nonconsequential.

34:21.126 --> 34:26.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's estimated that about
half of 1 percent
to a little more than 1 percent
of these errors

34:26.531 --> 34:31.736 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
could actually be fatal. If you
extrapolate
the numbers to all U.S.
hospitalization, that's

34:31.836 --> 34:37.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
where this 250,000 estimate
comes from. That's
not even counting people that
die at home

34:37.542 --> 34:43.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or sometimes through limited
insurance networks
or cracks in the system that
result in deaths.

34:43.515 --> 34:49.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't include outpatient
office deaths
or ambulatory surgery deaths.
So, we think

34:49.387 --> 34:53.992 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that the estimate is a solid
estimate. There's
broad consensus in the field.
It's in that

34:54.092 --> 34:57.696 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
range. And it doesn't even
include a lot of
other types of medical errors
that lead to

34:57.796 --> 34:59.597 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
death.

34:59.698 --> 35:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
I'm a patient.
How do I figure out the hospital
I might be

35:01.633 --> 35:07.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
taken to or that I'm already in
is kind of
the lowest that it can be on
these error rates?

35:08.073 --> 35:11.710 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Or what do I do to inform
myself? What kind
of questions do I ask a doctor
or a hospital

35:11.810 --> 35:13.645 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about my care?

35:13.745 --> 35:15.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. MARTIN MAKARY: Well, on a
national level,
this is exactly why we need to
measure the

35:15.981 --> 35:17.749 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
problem.

35:17.849 --> 35:22.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On a bedside level, you should
always go into
your office visit or your
hospitalization

35:22.287 --> 35:26.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with a loved one or family
member. They're
an important safety net. And,
certainly, patients

35:26.725 --> 35:32.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that we see that come in with
that support
system are often critical in
coordinating

35:32.163 --> 35:33.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
care.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.468 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also, ask about a second
opinion. If you're
going to have something major,
like an operation

35:36.568 --> 35:41.439 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
or start a medication,
sometimes, it's worth
getting a second opinion,
because about 20

35:41.539 --> 35:45.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
percent of second opinions are
different than
the first opinion. So, it's good
to know all

35:45.477 --> 35:48.580 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the treatment options, be
well-read, and come
in with a loved one.

35:48.680 --> 35:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, Dr.
Martin Makary
of Johns Hopkins, thanks so
much.

35:53.485 --> 36:02.627 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
DR. MARTIN MAKARY: Great to be
with you.

36:02.727 --> 36:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return to the
presidential
race now and to a man who once
challenged

36:08.833 --> 36:12.170 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, but now supports
him, Dr. Ben
Carson.

36:12.270 --> 36:17.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, it was announced that he
will assist
the Trump campaign in selecting
a running

36:17.175 --> 36:18.877 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
mate.

36:18.977 --> 36:22.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the record, I knew Dr.
Carson before he
was a candidate, when he was a
doctor for

36:22.180 --> 36:23.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
one of my children.

36:23.415 --> 36:26.951 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he joins me now from Palm
Beach Gardens,
Florida.

36:27.052 --> 36:29.921 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Welcome back to the "NewsHour,"
Dr. Carson.

36:30.021 --> 36:38.096 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now that Donald Trump has sewn
up this nomination,
what do you expect from him? Do
you think

36:38.196 --> 36:44.636 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he will change the message he's
been giving
to the American people, change
his presentation,

36:44.736 --> 36:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
or do you think it will stay the
same?

36:46.704 --> 36:50.642 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. BEN CARSON (R), Former
Presidential Candidate:
Well, you know, getting to the
process of

36:50.742 --> 36:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gaining the nomination involves
a mud-fight.

36:54.379 --> 37:00.452 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, that's been largely taken
care of. And
now you can turn your focus a
little bit more

37:00.552 --> 37:05.757 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to some of the issues and some
of the innovative
solutions that really haven't
been talked

37:05.857 --> 37:12.163 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about before, and really trying
stabilize
the economic situation of our
country.

37:12.263 --> 37:16.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think you're going to see
a lot of pivoting
there. That doesn't mean there
won't be some

37:16.367 --> 37:22.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
more mud-fighting when the
actual election
comes up with Hillary Clinton.
But, right

37:22.107 --> 37:24.075 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
now, I think you're going to see
a little
bit different.

37:24.175 --> 37:28.546 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you expect to
see him take
a position or positions that
will surprise

37:28.646 --> 37:30.415 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the American people?

37:30.515 --> 37:40.959 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. BEN CARSON: I think people
will be very
pleasantly surprised by what he
really has

37:41.059 --> 37:46.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an opportunity to explain,
because many have
said, oh, he doesn't have any
understanding

37:46.331 --> 37:54.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of foreign policy, doesn't
really, truly understand
how the system works. I think
they will be

37:54.172 --> 37:55.974 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
surprised at that.

37:56.074 --> 38:01.146 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think people will also be
surprised at some
of the individuals who will be
selected for

38:01.246 --> 38:06.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
different positions. They will
be, I think,
very pleasantly surprised when
they see the

38:06.551 --> 38:08.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
list of Supreme Court
possibilities.

38:08.753 --> 38:14.592 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As you know, a
number of prominent
Republicans are saying -- yes,
some are saying

38:14.692 --> 38:17.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they will support him, but there
are a number
of prominent Republicans saying
they will

38:17.428 --> 38:19.864 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
never support him.

38:19.964 --> 38:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We heard again today from the
Senator from
Nebraska Ben Sasse. He said --
he said: I

38:25.803 --> 38:31.242 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stick with my view that I have
expressed before
that Donald Trump is a
destructive force bent

38:31.342 --> 38:33.912 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on dividing the country.

38:34.012 --> 38:39.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Does Donald Trump try to change
the minds
of people like Senator Sasse, or
does he just

38:39.984 --> 38:41.819 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
move on?

38:41.920 --> 38:46.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. BEN CARSON: Well, you know,
early on,
you will hear a lot of that, as
you have always

38:46.724 --> 38:49.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
heard when there's controversy
in a selection.

38:49.294 --> 38:56.134 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Over the course of time, that
tends to melt
away as people begin to consider
the alternative.

38:56.234 --> 39:01.406 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now, there may be some
Republicans who, you
know, prefer a more progressive
ideology,

39:01.506 --> 39:08.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
prefer, you know, more debt,
prefer withdrawal
from the world and allowing our
enemies to

39:08.513 --> 39:11.282 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
multiply and destruction of our
military.

39:11.382 --> 39:14.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those people probably should
-- should
move on.

39:14.352 --> 39:19.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you think it's
significant,
Dr. Carson, that both former
Presidents George

39:19.123 --> 39:26.064 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
H.W. Bush and George W. Bush are
saying today
that they don't plan to get
involved in this

39:26.164 --> 39:30.001 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election, they don't plan to
express their
view one way or another?

39:30.101 --> 39:33.538 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In other words, they're not
going to get behind
this candidacy, they're saying.

39:33.638 --> 39:39.811 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. BEN CARSON: Well, again, we
must recognize
that, you know, what Donald
Trump represents

39:39.911 --> 39:47.218 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is really quite alien to the
traditional political
system, Democrats or
Republicans. You know,

39:47.318 --> 39:52.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they're used to having people
who are part
of the system, who have
obligations to this

39:52.757 --> 39:54.759 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
group or this group.

39:54.859 --> 40:01.065 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
To have somebody who is
completely uncontrollable
is a very difficult thing for
the system to

40:01.165 --> 40:06.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
adjust to. But, hopefully, they
will. The
people have adjusted to it. And
the people

40:06.104 --> 40:11.776 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have decided that they will
supersede the
system and vote in such numbers
that it wouldn't

40:11.876 --> 40:13.745 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
be thrown into a contested
situation.

40:13.845 --> 40:18.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, of course,
you're referring
to some or most of those who
vote in these

40:18.850 --> 40:21.319 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Republican primaries.

40:21.419 --> 40:25.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I know you're familiar with the
polls, Dr.
Carson, that show Donald Trump
has a problem

40:25.923 --> 40:33.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with different groups of voters,
Hispanics,
African-Americans, women. How
does he begin

40:33.998 --> 40:38.002 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to win those important parts of
the electorate
over?

40:38.102 --> 40:43.908 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. BEN CARSON: Well, I think
he's going to
begin to address those,
certainly going to

40:44.008 --> 40:49.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
begin talking about the kinds of
programs
that provide ladders of
opportunity that will

40:49.914 --> 40:56.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
give a person the ability to
climb out of
a state of dependency, utilizing
their own

40:56.254 --> 40:59.557 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
God-given talents and strengths
and hard work.

40:59.657 --> 41:03.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will do things to try to
facilitate
that. We will be talking about
how we can

41:04.028 --> 41:09.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
make education more widely
available. And
I'm talking about good
education. You look

41:09.867 --> 41:13.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
at our inner cities, you look at
some of those
high schools, we have more than
50 percent

41:13.304 --> 41:17.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of people dropping out, not
because they don't
want to be educated, but because
they're not

41:17.408 --> 41:19.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
being educated, and they say,
what's the point
in being here?

41:19.811 --> 41:24.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have to change that, because
we need all
of those people. We only have
330 million

41:24.649 --> 41:29.287 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people. We have to compete
against China with
1.3 or 1.4 billion. We can't
afford to lose

41:29.387 --> 41:34.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
any of our people. We need to
start talking
about, you know, our justice
system and how

41:34.292 --> 41:39.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
we prevent such an influx of
people, because
we can't afford to be losing all
these people.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.532 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is great talent.

41:41.632 --> 41:45.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I saw another
comment today,
this one from the former
governor of Utah,

41:45.203 --> 41:49.006 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republican Mike Leavitt. He
said, "Donald
Trump is going to have to
demonstrate he has

41:49.107 --> 41:52.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the temperament to be
president."

41:52.243 --> 41:54.011 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How does Donald Trump do that?

41:54.112 --> 42:01.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. BEN CARSON: I think he --
you know, we
all have our weaknesses. There's
no question

42:01.152 --> 42:03.020 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about that.

42:03.121 --> 42:08.993 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, he has sometimes
had a little
difficulty letting something go
when somebody

42:09.093 --> 42:17.502 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
insults him. But I think he
realizes that
this will be a trick that his
opponents will

42:17.602 --> 42:23.074 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
use to try to get him off track.
And I think
he's much smarter than people
think. And he's

42:23.174 --> 42:24.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
just not going to fall for that.

42:25.076 --> 42:30.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Finally, you
mentioned Supreme
Court names. Glad to have you
share any of

42:30.314 --> 42:32.250 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
those with us.

42:32.350 --> 42:35.553 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, also, as I mentioned, he
said that -- Donald
Trump said you're going to be on
the committee

42:35.653 --> 42:41.492 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
looking at a possible running
mate. Are you
interested in that position
yourself?

42:41.592 --> 42:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. BEN CARSON: I prefer to work
from the
outside.

42:48.733 --> 42:54.839 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I also recognize that myself
as a running
mate would just start the
feeding frenzy again

42:54.939 --> 43:01.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
on behalf of some of the media
who just couldn't
stand the thought of me doing
anything. Rather

43:01.846 --> 43:05.950 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
than become a distraction in
that sense, you
know, I would rather help from
the outside.

43:06.050 --> 43:10.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And are there
some names of
individuals you think would make
a good running

43:10.822 --> 43:13.357 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
mate for him? Do you have people
in mind?

43:13.458 --> 43:19.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DR. BEN CARSON: I think there's
a whole host
of terrific people.

43:20.031 --> 43:27.038 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, you know, I would rather
allow, you know,
Donald Trump himself to reveal
those names.

43:27.138 --> 43:30.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you're going
to be working
closely with him during this
campaign, during

43:30.341 --> 43:31.976 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the remainder of this campaign?

43:32.076 --> 43:37.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DR. BEN CARSON: We will be
working during
the campaign to do everything we
possibly

43:37.915 --> 43:39.684 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
can.

43:39.784 --> 43:45.056 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, my goal is to make
sure that we
have a thriving and vibrant
America for the

43:45.156 --> 43:49.627 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
next generation. You know, my
whole life has
been about children and making
things better

43:49.727 --> 43:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for them. And that's not going
to happen unless
we fix the economy and create a
safe environment.

much, Judy.

HARI SREENIVASAN: Now a new look
at the hardest
working man in show business, a
man of many

44:19.757 --> 44:24.095 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contradictions, highs and lows,
whose musical
legacy opened doors and
influenced black and

44:24.195 --> 44:25.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
white musicians alike.

44:26.063 --> 44:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has this newest
addition to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf.

44:29.767 --> 44:39.076 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: He was the
Godfather of Soul,
an incredible entertainer, by
any measure

44:39.176 --> 44:44.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
one of the most important and
influential
American musicians of the 20th
century.

44:44.515 --> 44:55.726 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But who was James Brown, the
man, and what
shaped him? Those questions are
taken up by

44:55.826 --> 45:01.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
musician and writer James
McBride, best known
for his memoir "The Color of
Water" and his

45:01.666 --> 45:04.302 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
National Book Award-winning
novel "The Good
Lord Bird."

45:04.402 --> 45:10.474 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
McBride's new book is "Kill 'Em
and Leave:
Searching for James Brown and
the American

45:10.575 --> 45:12.343 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Soul."

45:12.443 --> 45:17.348 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We talked recently at the Howard
Theatre in
Washington, D.C., AN historic
hall where James

45:17.448 --> 45:18.549 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Brown regularly performed.

45:18.649 --> 45:22.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I asked first about the
power of Brown's
music.

45:22.153 --> 45:23.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE, Author, "Kill 'Em
and Leave:
Searching for James Brown and
the American

45:24.088 --> 45:27.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Soul": Well, there's no music in
America that
you can listen to that doesn't
have some James

45:27.224 --> 45:28.993 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Brown in it.

45:29.093 --> 45:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, the whole creation of
the synthesizers
and these guitar parts and the
beat, that

45:35.433 --> 45:41.372 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was James Brown. Elvis Presley
shook America
up, and James Brown shook the
world up, because

45:41.472 --> 45:49.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his whole persona was that of
someone whose
consumed by this music, this
sound.

45:49.513 --> 45:54.051 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, he was a phenomena. And he
was really
seen as a kind of a scream at
the end of the

45:54.151 --> 45:55.486 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
dial, where black radio lived.

45:55.586 --> 45:57.722 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: A scream at the
end of the
dial? Yes.

45:57.822 --> 46:01.225 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE: Yes, he was this
-- he was
-- because everyone knows, "Wo,
I feel good."

46:01.325 --> 46:03.094 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes.

46:03.194 --> 46:05.930 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE: But, musically,
he was very
sophisticated. There is a lot of
counterpoint

46:06.030 --> 46:07.898 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in James Brown's music.

46:07.999 --> 46:12.937 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: This is not a
traditional biography,
though, that you have written,
right? The

46:13.037 --> 46:18.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
subtitle says tell us that is
searching for
the American soul. And that
means taking us

46:18.709 --> 46:19.677 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to some deep places.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.579 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES MCBRIDE: Well, yes.

46:21.679 --> 46:26.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I think James Brown's life
is a metaphor
really for how America has
evolved. And it

46:26.350 --> 46:31.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is a metaphor for how we can't
talk about
the business of race and class
and North and

46:31.122 --> 46:35.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
South, because, in many ways,
James Brown
was much more a Southerner than
he was a black

46:35.726 --> 46:37.662 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
man. Everything about the...

46:37.762 --> 46:39.530 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what does
that mean?

46:39.630 --> 46:42.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE: Well, everything
about the
way he lived, everything about
his lifestyle

46:42.433 --> 46:48.439 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and his choices, personal and
professional
choices, were dictated by the
decorum and

46:48.539 --> 46:52.576 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the pride and the honor and
integrity of Southern
life.

46:52.677 --> 46:57.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, you know the whole business
of him doing
his hair, for example, and
always being proper,

46:57.915 --> 47:03.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and not showing his pain, the
whole business
of trust in the South, and
especially in James

47:03.287 --> 47:08.793 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Brown's world, and you talk to
Southerners,
this -- this whole mentality of,
if we trust

47:08.893 --> 47:14.498 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
you, we will trust you with our
life, but
if you betray that trust, our
journey is over.

47:14.598 --> 47:24.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And James Brown really typified
that in many
ways.

47:24.909 --> 47:35.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you also talk
about the
idea of putting on a face,
right, not presenting

47:35.519 --> 47:40.157 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
your true self, partly out of
fear as a black
man in the South.

47:40.257 --> 47:43.928 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE: Well, that's
right. He had
a lot of fear of white people as
well, because

47:44.028 --> 47:47.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he grew up in a segregated part
of the world,
and he grew up in a world where
there was

47:47.765 --> 47:52.603 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a lot of cruelty, in a world
where everyone
had to stay in their own lane.

47:52.703 --> 48:00.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think his fear of white
people and his
fear of being broke and his fear
of people

48:00.311 --> 48:04.482 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
trying to -- taking what he had,
including
the government and the IRS,
which cleaned

48:04.582 --> 48:08.786 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
him to the walls twice, made him
a very lonely
and fearful person.

48:08.886 --> 48:13.624 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he never showed that to
people. His face
was that of bravado and pride
and smiling.

48:13.724 --> 48:19.196 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He never wanted to show -- he
didn't want
people to know him.

48:19.296 --> 48:33.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes, that comes
through. Right?
I mean, he's a very hard man to
know, even

48:33.144 --> 48:35.112 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by those you talked to who were
very close
to him.

48:35.212 --> 48:38.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE: Well, you know,
he compartmentalized
people.

48:38.449 --> 48:41.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, he had his black
friends. He had
his white friends. He had his
manager that

48:41.519 --> 48:44.021 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he trusted with his money, and
his accountant
that he trusted with his money.
And he had

48:44.121 --> 48:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this promoter that he trusted
and that one
he didn't.

48:46.891 --> 48:54.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lived in a world of many
rooms. I don't
know if he is that different
from any of us.

48:54.331 --> 49:00.304 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he is an exaggeration of all
of us, because
he doesn't know how to quite
function comfortably

49:00.404 --> 49:02.239 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in any one place.

49:02.339 --> 49:06.210 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And what about
the way he was
treated, seen? I mean, you are
talking about

49:06.310 --> 49:10.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
him rocking the universe. Elvis
Presley, though,
of course, gets much more -- got
much more

49:10.981 --> 49:11.549 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
attention.

49:11.649 --> 49:13.450 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JAMES MCBRIDE: Of course.

49:13.551 --> 49:17.588 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Well, I mean, listen, the whole
business of
the evolution of black music in
America is

49:17.688 --> 49:22.293 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a difficult subject to talk
about without
sounding like a racist
malcontent. But I have

49:22.393 --> 49:23.861 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
spent most...

49:23.961 --> 49:25.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But you have made
it part of
the story here of James Brown.

49:25.896 --> 49:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE: I had to. You
can't avoid it.
It is like -- it's the elephant
in the room.

49:30.201 --> 49:35.272 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, most black musicians,
including James
Brown, walked through department
stores and

49:35.372 --> 49:40.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
hear ninth chords borrowing from
their history.
There is no pension for the guys
who created...

49:40.544 --> 49:41.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

49:41.779 --> 49:43.347 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean the
Muzak, the music
in the...

49:43.447 --> 49:43.948 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)
JAMES MCBRIDE: Yes, the music --
the music
that plays into the...

49:44.048 --> 49:45.983 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes. Yes.

49:46.083 --> 49:48.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE: They hear their
own music piped
back to them, as they're living
lives of relative

49:48.819 --> 49:50.621 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
poverty and anonymity.

49:50.721 --> 49:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, I mean, history has gobbled
up most black
musicians' contributions. I
never thought

49:56.427 --> 49:59.263 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it would eat James Brown alive,
but it has
to some degree.

49:59.363 --> 50:01.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So did he ever
get his proper
due?

50:01.765 --> 50:04.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE: I don't think
he's gotten his
just due, because I don't think
he has seen

50:04.935 --> 50:09.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- he is such a phenomena, that
people remember
him and they just remember he
just gave them

50:10.007 --> 50:12.509 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
such a good time.

50:12.610 --> 50:28.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They forget that, musically, he
was brilliant,
and that, personally, despite
his personal

50:28.292 --> 50:33.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
struggles, which were painful to
him and to
others, that he put that aside
in order to

50:34.098 --> 50:38.168 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
try to make people happy, and to
try to make
people, most importantly, get
along.

50:38.269 --> 50:42.339 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Was it an easy
story to tell?
Was he an easy man to find in
the end?

50:42.439 --> 50:46.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JAMES MCBRIDE: No, this was the
hardest book
I have ever done, because even
after finishing

50:46.877 --> 50:49.079 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this book, I don't really feel I
know him
completely.

50:49.179 --> 50:53.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't think he wanted to --
it's clear he
didn't want to be known. But I
have enough

50:53.517 --> 51:00.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the ghost of the man, the nub
of the man,
to tell the story in a way that
I think people

51:00.824 --> 51:02.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would relate to.

51:02.793 --> 51:08.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is hard to know someone who
spent his entire
life not wanting to be known.
Michael Jackson

51:08.799 --> 51:12.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was the same way. In fact, a lot
of the celebrities
are the same way. They have this
penchant

51:13.003 --> 51:16.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for privacy because they don't
want to show
you the pain that powers them.

51:16.640 --> 51:21.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the story -- you know, the
story is the
pain that powers them. That's
the fuel. That

51:21.445 --> 51:27.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is the motor in the car. And so
-- and dissecting
that with James Brown, you
realize that a

51:27.117 --> 51:31.488 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
lot of what motored him along
was his desire
for people to see beyond the
color of his

51:31.588 --> 51:37.328 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
skin. And that is something we
still have
a hard time working out in this
country.

51:37.428 --> 51:41.031 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, the
book is "Kill
'Em and Leave: Searching for
James Brown and

51:41.131 --> 51:41.899 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the American Soul."
