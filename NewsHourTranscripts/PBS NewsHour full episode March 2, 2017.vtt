HARI SREENIVASAN: The nation's
new attorney
general has spent this day under
growing fire.

00:04.571 --> 00:09.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now, Jeff Sessions says
someone else will
oversee any investigation of
Russian meddling

00:09.610 --> 00:14.548 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the election and of contacts
between the
Trump campaign and the Russians.

00:14.648 --> 00:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Lisa Desjardins begins our
coverage.

00:16.617 --> 00:21.421 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: The new
attorney general,
three weeks on the job, came to
the Justice

00:21.521 --> 00:24.258 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Department briefing room this
afternoon to
make his statement.

00:24.358 --> 00:28.028 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. Attorney
General: My staff
recommended recusal.

00:28.128 --> 00:34.001 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said that, since I had
involvement with
the campaign, I should not be
involved in

00:34.101 --> 00:37.237 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
any campaign investigation.

00:37.337 --> 00:41.541 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have studied the rules and
considered their
comments and evaluation.

00:41.642 --> 00:45.712 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believe those recommendations
are right
and just.

00:45.812 --> 00:52.352 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Therefore, I have recused myself
in the matters
that deal with the Trump
campaign.

00:52.452 --> 00:56.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This after The
Washington
Post reported that, during the
campaign, when

00:56.690 --> 01:01.561 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Jeff Sessions was a senator and
Trump campaign
adviser, he met with the Russian
ambassador

01:01.662 --> 01:03.497 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the U.S. twice.

01:03.597 --> 01:08.368 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then-Senator Sessions had more
than 25 conversations
with foreign ambassadors last
year.

01:08.468 --> 01:11.738 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Two of those were with Sergey
Kislyak, the
Russian envoy.

01:11.838 --> 01:16.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At his news conference, Sessions
took issue
with any suggestion of
impropriety.

01:16.576 --> 01:23.750 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: Let me be clear:
I never had
meetings with Russian operatives
or Russian

01:23.850 --> 01:26.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intermediaries about the Trump
campaign.

01:26.186 --> 01:31.625 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: He also
defended answers
he gave during his Senate
confirmation.

01:31.725 --> 01:35.295 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Minnesota Democrat Al Franken
cited U.S. intelligence
documents.

01:35.395 --> 01:37.130 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:37.230 --> 01:40.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AL FRANKEN (D), Minnesota: These
documents,
also allegedly, say -- quote --
"There was

01:40.867 --> 01:48.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a continuing exchange of
information during
the campaign between Trump
surrogates and

01:48.308 --> 01:51.712 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
intermediaries for the Russian
government."

01:51.812 --> 01:56.483 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: Senator Franken,
I'm not aware
of any of those activities.

01:56.583 --> 02:02.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I have been called a surrogate
at a time or
two in that campaign, and I did
not have communications

02:02.990 --> 02:04.558 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with the Russians.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.127 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: This afternoon,
Sessions
said he never meant to be
misleading.

02:07.227 --> 02:13.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFF SESSIONS: My reply to the
question of
Senator Franken was honest and
correct as

02:13.467 --> 02:16.203 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I understood it at the time.

02:16.303 --> 02:21.708 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I appreciate that some have
taken the view
that this was a false comment.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.577 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is not my intent.

02:23.677 --> 02:24.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That is not correct.

02:25.078 --> 02:27.814 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: But Democrats
in Congress
weren't buying it.

02:27.914 --> 02:29.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senate Minority Leader Chuck
Schumer:

02:29.483 --> 02:31.318 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:31.418 --> 02:32.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: I don't
think that is the way most think
people would

02:32.352 --> 02:33.487 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
interpret it.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's why we need to have a
thorough
investigation.

02:36.023 --> 02:40.327 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Schumer and
House Minority
Leader Nancy Pelosi demanded
that Sessions

02:40.427 --> 02:41.328 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
resign.

02:41.428 --> 02:43.196 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:43.296 --> 02:45.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: The standard for
remaining
attorney general and certainly
for conducting

02:46.066 --> 02:48.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
investigations is not just, did
you break
the law?

02:49.002 --> 02:49.903 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You have to be above reproach.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.772 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.141 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), House
Minority Leader:
He has proved that he is
unqualified and unfit

02:54.241 --> 02:56.743 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to serve in that position of
trust.

02:56.843 --> 03:00.847 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Seventeen
Democrats on the
House Judiciary Committee
formally asked for

03:00.947 --> 03:05.952 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a criminal investigation of
Sessions for allegedly
lying to Congress.

03:06.053 --> 03:09.256 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats are also pushing for a
special prosecutor
in the case.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.958 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But there was also pressure from
Republicans.

03:12.059 --> 03:16.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Several called for Sessions to
recuse himself
from the Russia investigation
before he eventually

03:16.496 --> 03:18.031 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
did so.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.201 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But Speaker of the House Paul
Ryan played
down such talk.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.536 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

03:22.636 --> 03:23.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL RYAN (R-WI), Speaker of the
House: Asked
him questions.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.672 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, honestly, we meet with
ambassadors all
the time.

03:25.772 --> 03:30.277 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, I did a reception about
100 yards
that way with like 100
ambassadors last year.

03:30.377 --> 03:34.381 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: And this
afternoon, Sessions'
boss weighed in, in Newport
News, Virginia,

03:34.481 --> 03:36.216 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
aboard the aircraft carrier
Gerald R. Ford.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.451 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
QUESTION: Mr. President, do you
still have
confidence in the attorney
general?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
Total.

03:39.653 --> 03:45.192 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: The president
said he believes
Sessions probably did speak
truthfully to

03:45.292 --> 03:47.094 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Senate.

03:47.194 --> 03:50.797 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He also said he didn't think
Sessions should
recuse himself, but, 90 minutes
later, the

03:50.897 --> 03:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
attorney general did just that.

03:52.933 --> 03:57.637 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The revelations come just two
weeks after
then-National Security Adviser
Michael Flynn

03:57.737 --> 03:59.573 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
was forced out.

03:59.673 --> 04:04.377 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He'd told Vice President Mike
Pence that he
didn't meet discuss sanctions
with a Russian

04:04.478 --> 04:07.147 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
official, when, in fact, he had.

04:07.247 --> 04:11.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in a further development,
The New York
Times reported today officials
in the Obama

04:11.485 --> 04:16.690 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
administration rushed to spread
intelligence
of any contacts between the
Trump campaign

04:16.790 --> 04:19.526 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Russians before leaving
office.

04:19.626 --> 04:20.594 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Their goal?

04:20.694 --> 04:23.096 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To ensure a trail remained for
investigators.

04:23.196 --> 04:26.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Lisa
Desjardins joins me
now.

04:26.166 --> 04:29.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lisa, this happened late in the
afternoon,
about a 4:00 press conference.

04:29.236 --> 04:31.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What was the reaction to this
from the people
on the Hill that you have spoken
to?

04:32.072 --> 04:34.908 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There's a full
spectrum of
reaction on Capitol Hill, Hari.

04:35.008 --> 04:39.045 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There are some Republicans who
say they do
not believe that Attorney
General Sessions

04:39.146 --> 04:40.447 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
should have recused himself.

04:40.547 --> 04:42.015 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
These are folks that are his
colleagues.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.517 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They see him as an honest man.

04:43.617 --> 04:46.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were saying all day
long that he
shouldn't do anything new.

04:46.753 --> 04:50.924 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But there are other Republicans
who will tell
you privately that they are
relieved, that

04:51.024 --> 04:54.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
they saw this as a problem for
their party,
especially at a time when
they're trying to

04:54.861 --> 04:57.831 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
focus on other things, like, oh,
the Affordable
Care Act.

04:57.931 --> 05:02.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Those Republicans, one told me
privately,
are hoping that this means there
will be a

05:02.135 --> 05:05.972 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pause in the daily questions
they have been
receiving on Russia.

05:06.072 --> 05:08.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that brings us to the third
reaction up
here, Democrats.

05:09.042 --> 05:10.010 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They have a different plan.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.546 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They do not plan on pausing
these questions.

05:12.646 --> 05:18.852 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, House and Senate
Minority Leaders
Pelosi and Schumer instantly
sent out responses

05:18.952 --> 05:21.922 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
saying that they are again
demanding a special
prosecutor.

05:22.022 --> 05:27.761 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They say that Attorney General
Sessions' recusal
just adds to the need for a
special prosecutor.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.496 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they are still calling for
him to resign.

05:29.596 --> 05:31.998 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
it sounds
like some critics are doubling
down.

05:32.098 --> 05:36.002 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What about some of the reports
that we also
had later this afternoon about
more meetings

05:36.102 --> 05:38.305 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
between members of the Trump
camp and Russians?

05:38.405 --> 05:40.607 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: These were new
developments
today as well.

05:40.707 --> 05:46.112 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The New York Times reporting,
quoting a White
House official, Hope Hicks, as
confirming

05:46.213 --> 05:52.252 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that Jared Kushner, President
Trump's son-in-law
and a senior adviser, was at a
meeting with

05:52.352 --> 05:57.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Russian ambassador, and
Michael Flynn,
the former national security
adviser, at Trump

05:57.557 --> 05:59.492 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Tower.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.462 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This gets confusing, because now
we're seeing
more and more players here, but
this is significant,

06:02.562 --> 06:06.466 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because now we're adding more
members of the
Trump team who were meeting with
this Russian

06:06.566 --> 06:08.268 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
ambassador.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that point, it was Kushner,
Flynn and the
ambassador at Trump Tower in
December.

06:11.805 --> 06:17.611 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That's when the Obama
administration was working
on ramping up sanctions, a very
critical timeline

06:17.711 --> 06:19.512 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think overall it just adds
to the map
in this entire kind of
Russia-Trump situation.

06:22.849 --> 06:28.288 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I will say the White House
says that Mr.
Kushner met with many
international dignitaries,

06:28.388 --> 06:30.257 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Russian ambassador was
just one.

06:30.357 --> 06:33.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
Lisa Desjardins
joining us from Capitol Hill,
thanks so much.

06:33.460 --> 06:38.465 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In the day's other news: The
president carried
his call for a major military
buildup to a

06:38.565 --> 06:40.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
U.S. Navy audience.

06:40.567 --> 06:44.938 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Trump spoke aboard the newly
built aircraft
carrier Gerald R. Ford in
Newport News, Virginia,

06:45.038 --> 06:46.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and touted his plan for Naval
expansion.

06:46.906 --> 06:54.180 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: After years of
endless budget
cuts, that have impaired our
defenses, I am

06:54.281 --> 06:58.451 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calling for one of the largest
defense spending
increases in history.

06:58.551 --> 07:05.325 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our military requires sustained,
stable funding
to meet the growing needs placed
on our defense.

07:05.425 --> 07:08.561 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The
president's draft budget
calls for boosting overall
defense spending

07:08.662 --> 07:11.765 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
by $54 billion, or 10 percent.

07:11.865 --> 07:16.603 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. struck hard at al-Qaida
militants
today in Yemen, with more than
20 airstrikes.

07:16.703 --> 07:20.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Local officials reported at

region.

It follows a raid in January
when a U.S. Navy
SEAL died and a number of Yemeni
civilians

07:31.351 --> 07:33.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

They were hit in a tribal region
near the
Afghan border.

07:47.867 --> 07:52.305 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is the first such strike

Syrian army troops drove out the
militants
for the second time in a year.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.453 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were backed by Hezbollah
fighters from
Lebanon and Russian airstrikes.

08:06.553 --> 08:11.458 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ISIS fighters have already
destroyed many
of Palmyra's ancient Roman
sites.

planning initiatives.

08:18.298 --> 08:23.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's after President Trump
reinstated a
U.S. ban -- a ban on U.S.
funding for organizations

08:23.203 --> 08:29.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

from some 50 nations at a
conference in Brussels

08:29.376 --> 08:31.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
dubbed She Decides.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.547 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ALEXANDER DE CROO, Belgian
Deputy Premier:
I think that the Trump
administration decision

08:34.647 --> 08:36.449 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is the wrong decision.

08:36.549 --> 08:47.093 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I have never seen any
evidence that supports
that decision, but we have a
voice and we

08:47.193 --> 08:48.995 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
have a choice.

08:49.095 --> 08:51.765 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Conference
organizers say
the U.S. funding cutoff left a
global shortfall

08:51.865 --> 08:55.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of about $600 million for family
planning
efforts.

that oil and

08:59.973 --> 09:03.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gas interests report information
on methane
emissions.

09:03.843 --> 09:06.479 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Obama administration issued
that rule
in November.

09:06.579 --> 09:10.784 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In a statement, the new EPA
administrator,
Scott Pruitt, said withdrawing
the rule will

09:10.884 --> 09:15.121 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ease burdens on business, while
he conducts
a full review.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.390 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

Perry to be energy secretary.

09:23.663 --> 09:26.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They were sworn in this
afternoon by Vice
President Pence.

09:26.566 --> 09:30.136 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Carson is a retired neurosurgeon
who ran for
president last year.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.806 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Perry is a former governor of
Texas.

09:32.906 --> 09:37.177 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The new interior secretary, Ryan
Zinke, made
a memorable entrance today for
his first day

09:37.277 --> 09:39.179 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the job.

09:39.279 --> 09:43.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%

rode a National
Park Service horse several

headquarters.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Once there, he dismounted to
greet hundreds
of staffers.

09:47.320 --> 09:51.958 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street, stocks gave
back a big
chunk of yesterday's big gains,
as investors

09:52.058 --> 09:53.760 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
took profits.

09:53.860 --> 09:57.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Dow Jones industrial average
lost 112

later in the program.

10:06.406 --> 10:10.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also ahead on the "NewsHour": a
closer look
at the implications of Jeff
Sessions' meeting

10:10.810 --> 10:15.415 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russian ambassador; a
shoe company
upending the traditional
business model with

10:15.515 --> 10:28.061 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a little fun; and much more.

10:28.161 --> 10:33.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The reaction to Attorney General
Jeff Sessions'
announcement late this afternoon
was swift.

10:33.433 --> 10:37.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Critics say his decision to
recuse himself
from any current and future
investigations

10:37.270 --> 10:41.207 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
into the Trump campaign's
dealings with Russia
doesn't go far enough.

10:41.307 --> 10:45.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of those critics, Democratic
Senator Richard
Blumenthal of Connecticut, he
serves on the

10:45.578 --> 10:48.848 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judiciary and Armed Services
Committee and
joins us now.

10:48.948 --> 10:50.750 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Senator Blumenthal, why isn't it
far enough?

10:50.850 --> 10:52.585 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

10:52.685 --> 10:56.756 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D),
Connecticut: It is
nowhere near far enough, because
he owes an

10:56.856 --> 10:58.858 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
explanation to the Judiciary
Committee.

10:58.958 --> 11:03.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He should be brought back to the
Judiciary
Committee and give an
explanation as to why

11:03.997 --> 11:11.170 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
he omitted and denied key
relevant facts in
the course of our hearing on his
nomination.

11:11.271 --> 11:15.775 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
If he fails to provide a
credible explanation,
he should resign.

11:15.875 --> 11:21.114 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's also nowhere near
enough, because
the scope of his recusal is
still somewhat

11:21.214 --> 11:22.949 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
undefined.

11:23.049 --> 11:26.486 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He referred to the campaign, but
really the
investigation from which he
should recuse

11:26.586 --> 11:33.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
himself relates to the entire
cyber-attack
and act of cyber-warfare on our
democratic

11:33.359 --> 11:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
institutions and the potential
complicity,
connection, contact between the
Trump transition,

11:40.166 --> 11:46.573 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as well as the campaign, and the
administration
since the inaugural with the
Russians.

11:46.673 --> 11:53.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, as more news develops, the
Jared Kushner
meeting, for example, the need
for that broader

11:53.479 --> 11:55.281 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recusal becomes all the more
necessary.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Senator, if
you can get
the attorney general back in
front of your

11:58.985 --> 12:01.254 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
committee, what more do you hope
to learn
from him?

12:01.354 --> 12:03.189 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

12:03.289 --> 12:08.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: First and
foremost, why
he denied meetings that clearly
he recalled

12:08.561 --> 12:12.365 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and that were relevant to the
investigation.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.334 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What was said during those
meetings?

12:14.434 --> 12:20.773 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What does his staff recall, and
what do their
notes reflect, and what
connection was to

12:20.873 --> 12:28.715 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Russians involving those
conversations
involving the cyber-attack on
the United States,

12:28.815 --> 12:31.117 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
our democratic institutions?

12:31.217 --> 12:32.919 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Make no mistake.

12:33.019 --> 12:36.422 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This cyber-attack was an act of
warfare on
the United States.

12:36.522 --> 12:44.364 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the potential complicity of
Trump Organization
or campaign or administration
officials is

12:44.464 --> 12:45.431 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
very, very serious.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the American people deserve
the truth.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.569 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It needs to be uncovered.

12:49.669 --> 12:55.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The cover-up, if there is one,
would be as
bad or worse than the crime
itself, because

12:55.408 --> 12:57.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
we need to deter this kind of
attack going
forward.

12:57.343 --> 13:00.380 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: What about the
attorney
general's defense that he was
answering the

13:00.480 --> 13:02.715 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
question that he was asked and
nothing more?

13:02.815 --> 13:04.550 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:04.651 --> 13:06.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Looking at
the record,
he was asked that question not
just once,

13:06.853 --> 13:08.655 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
but several times during his
testimony.

13:08.755 --> 13:13.192 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was asked that question not
just once,
but several times in writing.

13:13.292 --> 13:21.401 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And to say that he may have
misunderstood
the question, when, in fact,
everybody knows

13:21.501 --> 13:25.772 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he had to have been prepped for
that question,
it was an obvious and
challenging question

13:25.872 --> 13:31.210 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that had to be briefed to him,
and he had
to go through that preparation.

13:31.310 --> 13:37.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And remember also Jeff Sessions
is a prosecutor,
as I was United States attorney
for Connecticut,

13:37.216 --> 13:41.020 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the chief federal prosecutor,
state attorney
general of Connecticut.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.458 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We know the importance of every
word under
oath.

13:45.558 --> 13:48.728 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so I find that explanation
inadequate.

13:48.828 --> 13:52.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: If the recusal
is not enough,
is a special counsel necessary?

13:52.465 --> 13:53.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: A special
prosecutor is
absolutely necessary.

13:56.169 --> 14:03.142 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that raises another
question: How will
that special counsel or
prosecutor be chosen?

14:03.242 --> 14:09.449 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it should be someone who is
completely
independent, impartial,
objective, a professional

14:09.549 --> 14:15.188 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who can uncover the truth and
follow the facts
and the evidence wherever they
lead.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they may lead to the
attorney general.

14:17.757 --> 14:21.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They could lead higher and to
other administration
officials.

14:21.928 --> 14:26.499 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That appointment or designation
will be critical
to the trust and credibility of
the Department

14:26.599 --> 14:28.434 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Justice.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Remember, the attorney general
of the United
States and the Department of
Justice are not

14:30.369 --> 14:35.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
just any Cabinet position or
agency in the
government.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.276 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are responsible for law
enforcement.

14:37.376 --> 14:45.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are the legal conscience
and moral compass
of our federal enforcement
establishment and

14:45.985 --> 14:47.653 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
even of the nation in many
respects.

14:47.754 --> 14:49.889 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And they need to be beyond doubt
or reproach.

14:49.989 --> 14:54.260 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Should there
be an investigation
into perjury of your former
colleague?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.195 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

14:56.295 --> 14:59.799 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: The
investigation should
be into any violation of law
that has occurred

14:59.899 --> 15:01.734 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
by anyone.

15:01.834 --> 15:05.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it should be by a special
prosecutor who
will uncover the truth, so that
the American

15:05.605 --> 15:11.978 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
people know about the
cyber-attacks on this
nation and know about any
cooperation or complicity

15:12.078 --> 15:15.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or support the Russians received
from anybody
in the United States.

15:15.681 --> 15:19.285 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The attorney
general today,
along with Speaker Ryan and
others, said,

15:19.385 --> 15:23.823 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
listen, this is part of the job
as a senior
member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.125 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They meet with ambassadors all
the time.

15:26.225 --> 15:28.060 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

15:28.161 --> 15:33.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: This
ambassador was from
Russia at the height of the
political campaign

15:33.766 --> 15:43.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and of the Russian interference
and cyber-attack
on this nation, through not only
hacking into

15:43.176 --> 15:49.182 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Democratic and Republican
National Committees,
but also the campaign propaganda
and misinformation

15:49.282 --> 15:51.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and fake news.

15:51.250 --> 15:58.658 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, the contacts with the
ambassador in terms
of timing, who it was, what
country and what

15:58.758 --> 16:03.196 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was going on is certainly more
than just routine.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.332 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have never met with the
Russian ambassador.

16:06.432 --> 16:11.771 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And the meeting here is
certainly more than
just a passing occurrence.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.774 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But how do you
fix this
in the future?

16:14.874 --> 16:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If members of Congress should be
meeting with
diplomats or foreign dignitaries
when they're

16:19.579 --> 16:25.751 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
interested or in the interest of
their constituents,
should there be a public record
of every one

16:25.852 --> 16:26.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of these meetings?

16:26.853 --> 16:28.721 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: The safer
course might
have been to have a public
record or to postpone

16:32.391 --> 16:34.327 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the meeting.

16:34.427 --> 16:42.602 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
One of the questions to be asked
of Attorney
General Sessions is, why then,
what was discussed?

16:42.702 --> 16:48.374 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If it was as a member of the
Armed Services
Committee, what purpose was
there in the discussion?

16:48.474 --> 16:55.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was it to discuss the Russians'
violation
of the 1987 ballistic missile
treaty, which

16:55.915 --> 16:57.617 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they are doing now?

16:57.717 --> 17:03.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Was it to discuss other acts of
aggression
in Ukraine and elsewhere in the
world?

17:03.489 --> 17:04.390 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What was discussed?

17:04.490 --> 17:06.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We have a right to those
explanations.

17:06.459 --> 17:09.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Senator
Richard Blumenthal
of Connecticut, thank you very
much.

17:10.062 --> 17:10.963 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.865 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Thank you.

17:12.965 --> 17:16.035 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Questions
about Attorney
General Sessions' meetings with
the Russian

17:16.135 --> 17:18.504 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ambassador aren't limited to
Capitol Hill.

17:18.604 --> 17:22.208 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We explore some of those now
with John McLaughlin,
a career intelligence official.

17:22.308 --> 17:25.311 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He was a former deputy director
of the CIA.

17:25.411 --> 17:29.115 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He was also acting director of
the agency
in 2004.

17:29.215 --> 17:34.487 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And Michael Mukasey, he served
as President
George W. Bush's attorney
general from 2007

17:34.587 --> 17:35.488 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to 2009.

17:35.588 --> 17:38.724 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mr. Mukasey, I want to he start
with you.

17:38.824 --> 17:42.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At those hearings, at the
confirmation hearings
for Jeff Sessions, I noticed you
sat right

17:42.862 --> 17:44.130 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behind him.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am assuming that you are in
support of his
recusal today.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.101 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY, Former U.S.
Attorney General:
Yes.

17:49.201 --> 17:55.174 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I think that the step he took
was quite routine.

17:55.274 --> 18:00.413 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he said is, if there is a
criminal investigation,
then I should recuse myself, and
I do recuse

18:00.513 --> 18:02.248 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
myself.

18:02.348 --> 18:07.453 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he pointed out that there is
-- there
are regulations and there's law
on that subject,

18:07.553 --> 18:09.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as contained in the code of
federal regulations.

18:09.956 --> 18:12.792 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was quite supportable
and quite routine.

18:12.892 --> 18:16.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mr. Mukasey,
staying with
you for a second, Attorney
General Sessions

18:16.929 --> 18:21.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is somebody who is known for his
specificity
of word choice, and he expects
that, especially

18:21.701 --> 18:23.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of the people that are
testifying in front
of him.

18:23.602 --> 18:29.675 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So what do you think accounts
for either the
forgetfulness or not answering
the question?

18:29.775 --> 18:31.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Really, what's gotten us into
this?

18:31.610 --> 18:35.881 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: There was
neither forgetfulness
nor not answering oft question.

18:35.982 --> 18:41.087 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if Senator Blumenthal is
looking for an
explanation of the response, he
ought to look

18:41.187 --> 18:44.957 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in the transcript of the hearing
before his
committee.

18:45.057 --> 18:46.993 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I hope he was paying attention.

18:47.093 --> 18:54.834 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question that was asked by
Senator Franken
was related to contacts between
the Russians

18:54.934 --> 18:57.403 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the Trump campaign relating
to the campaign.

18:57.503 --> 19:00.506 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have got the paper in
front of me.

19:00.606 --> 19:04.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He, among other things, quoted a
report that
said: "There was a continuing
exchange of

19:05.011 --> 19:10.116 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
information during the campaign
between Trump
surrogates and intermediaries of
the Russian

19:10.216 --> 19:11.984 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
government.

19:12.084 --> 19:15.421 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Now, again, I'm telling you this
as it's coming
out, so you know, but, if it's
true, it's

19:15.521 --> 19:20.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
obviously extremely serious, and
if there
is any evidence that anyone
affiliated with

19:20.326 --> 19:24.630 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Trump campaign communicated
with the Russian
government in the course of this
campaign,

19:24.730 --> 19:25.698 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what will you do?"

19:25.798 --> 19:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's all related to that kind of
communication.

19:27.967 --> 19:31.570 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
His response was: "Senator
Franken, I'm not
aware of any of these
activities.

19:31.670 --> 19:36.709 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I have been called as a
surrogate at a time
or two in that campaign, and I
did not have

19:36.809 --> 19:38.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
communications with the
Russians.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.945 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm unable to comment on it."

19:40.046 --> 19:43.849 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The kind of communication that
Senator Franken
was asking about, that other
members of the

19:43.949 --> 19:46.385 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
committee asked about, he didn't
have.

19:46.485 --> 19:50.656 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He had a meeting in September
with -- not
only with the Russian
ambassador, but with

19:50.756 --> 19:55.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
about 20 or 21 other ambassadors
from other
countries, all discussing what
the possible

19:55.895 --> 20:02.068 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
foreign relations of the United
States would
be in the Trump administration
going forward.

20:02.168 --> 20:04.470 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This was only one of a number of
meetings.

20:04.570 --> 20:09.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And if he wants to find out what
the content
of that meeting was, maybe he
can get a transcript

20:09.108 --> 20:14.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the attorney general's press
conference
today, where he disclosed that
he had an argument

20:14.880 --> 20:18.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the Russian ambassador
about Russian
activities in the Ukraine.

20:18.384 --> 20:21.087 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John
McLaughlin, was this
recusal enough?

20:21.187 --> 20:25.491 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, Former Acting
CIA Director:
I think it's the minimum that
the attorney

20:25.591 --> 20:27.393 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
general can do in this
circumstance.

20:27.493 --> 20:28.661 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I think it was the right
thing to do.

20:28.761 --> 20:29.995 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Should there
be more?

20:30.096 --> 20:32.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: At this point,
I wouldn't
recommend more.

20:32.898 --> 20:36.635 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I think Attorney General
Sessions is an honorable
man.

20:36.735 --> 20:40.506 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think he made a mistake here.

20:40.606 --> 20:43.409 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One can argue endlessly about
whether it was
really a mistake or not.

20:43.509 --> 20:49.181 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The point is, the perception has
taken root,
and I think he had no choice but
to do a recusal.

20:49.281 --> 20:53.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I don't think that that is the
end of this
story.

20:53.319 --> 20:59.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I don't think that the
administration
can investigate itself on this
issue.

20:59.391 --> 21:01.894 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
Mukasey, I want
to ask you.

21:01.994 --> 21:06.799 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then-Senator Sessions was one of
a group of
Trump supporters who took out an
op-ed and

21:06.899 --> 21:11.370 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
said that they would like a
special counsel
to investigate then-Attorney
General Loretta

21:11.470 --> 21:16.308 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Lynch about her conversation
with President
Clinton on a tarmac, again,
during the campaign.

21:16.408 --> 21:17.543 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Why is this different?

21:17.643 --> 21:19.879 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: It's different
for a couple
reasons.

21:19.979 --> 21:25.651 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Number one, her conversation
with the former
president on a tarmac was
anything but routine.

21:25.751 --> 21:30.089 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He got onto her plane, I don't
know how, and
had a conversation, to which
there were no

21:30.189 --> 21:35.394 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
witnesses, at a time when his
wife was under
investigation.

21:35.494 --> 21:37.263 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This is light years from that.

21:37.363 --> 21:40.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John
McLaughlin, the attorney
general said today that, look,
he -- as a

21:40.466 --> 21:44.470 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
senator -- and I asked this of
Richard Blumenthal
as well -- this is commonplace
for them to

21:44.570 --> 21:46.338 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
meet with ambassadors.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Why is this particular
conversation with this
particular individual, why
should that be

21:48.474 --> 21:49.742 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
treated differently?

21:49.842 --> 21:52.211 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Well, I think
this is entirely
about context.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.946 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They're right.

21:54.046 --> 21:57.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People meet with ambassadors all
the time
all over Washington, and
certainly senators

21:57.316 --> 21:59.118 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
do.

21:59.218 --> 22:03.589 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The context here is one that of
a president
who has been elected in an
environment where

22:03.689 --> 22:08.661 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he clearly spoke favorably often
about Russia,
where there are questions that
remain about

22:08.761 --> 22:10.529 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his relationship with Russia.

22:10.629 --> 22:13.899 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Leave aside whether there's
anything to it
or not, those questions are
there.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's an evidentiary base for
raising them.

22:16.635 --> 22:23.275 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's in that context that
the meeting
with Ambassador Kislyak gains
salience and

22:23.375 --> 22:26.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
prominence and stands out and is
worth talking
about.

22:26.612 --> 22:28.414 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I think it's entirely that.

22:28.514 --> 22:34.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think, ultimately, we will
need either
a special prosecutor or a
9/11-type commission

22:34.920 --> 22:36.822 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to get to the bottom of this.

22:36.922 --> 22:41.527 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think those options would
be ones that
would actually favor the
fortunes of the Republican

22:41.627 --> 22:43.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Party and the nation as a whole.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.097 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: How so?

22:45.197 --> 22:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Well, I think,
you know,
this is going to hang around the
party's neck

22:48.300 --> 22:56.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and around the president's neck
unless there
is an absolutely, certain,
dispassionate view

22:56.542 --> 22:59.778 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by independent observers of what
happened
here, a determination.

22:59.878 --> 23:06.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Among other things, at some
point -- and I
think the president has the
right idea when

23:06.785 --> 23:10.823 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he says, our relationship with
Russia needs
to be improved.

23:10.923 --> 23:14.293 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I was in Russia in October, and
I saw just
how bad it is.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.529 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It really is very close to a
second Cold War.

23:17.630 --> 23:22.568 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At that time, I came back and
said, look,
we're only one miscalculation
away from a

23:22.668 --> 23:24.637 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shooting war somewhere with
these people.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.572 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's that tense.

23:26.672 --> 23:32.411 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, the problem is, for the
president, though,
in trying to maneuver into a
different kind

23:32.511 --> 23:36.548 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of relationship, a more
effective, cooperative
relationship with Russia, it's
going to hang

23:36.649 --> 23:38.350 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
around his neck.

23:38.450 --> 23:44.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And people will not trust
whatever he comes
up with in that relationship
with Russia,

23:44.189 --> 23:46.625 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
unless this is all put to rest.

23:46.725 --> 23:50.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I doubt, personally, that
the Congress
can do this, because it's too
politically

23:50.829 --> 23:52.064 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
hot.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Michael
Mukasey, what about
that point?

23:54.099 --> 23:57.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
For the good of the party, for
the integrity
of the office, should there be
an independent

23:57.236 --> 24:00.973 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
counsel or a special prosecutor
assigned to
this?

24:01.073 --> 24:05.678 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: A special
prosecutor would
have to specially prosecute a
crime.

24:05.778 --> 24:09.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so far as I'm aware, nobody
has identified
any crime that was committed
here.

24:10.015 --> 24:12.418 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't have people who are
independent of
a government.

24:12.518 --> 24:16.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have a Constitution that
establishes three
branches of government.

24:16.588 --> 24:17.523 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
One is Article I.

24:17.623 --> 24:18.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
That's the Congress.

24:18.624 --> 24:19.525 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Article II is the executive.

24:19.625 --> 24:20.526 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Article III is the
judiciary.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.494 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have got to be in one or the
other.

24:22.594 --> 24:26.365 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There's no such thing as a
free-flying independent
investigation.

24:26.465 --> 24:33.539 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can have an investigation
that's conducted
by a special counsel, if that's
warranted,

24:33.639 --> 24:38.010 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
but first somebody has to
identify the commission
of a crime and identify evidence
of a crime.

24:38.110 --> 24:39.645 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And so far that hasn't happened.

24:39.745 --> 24:44.016 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The only crime that was
committed here is
the hacking by the Russians.

24:44.116 --> 24:45.884 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nobody is denying that.

24:45.984 --> 24:49.188 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But that's not the subject, as I
understand
it, of the current dispute.

24:49.288 --> 24:53.859 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mr. Mukasey,
staying with
you for a second, something I
sort of asked

24:53.959 --> 24:55.828 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mr. McLaughlin as well.

24:55.928 --> 24:58.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Adam Entous of The Washington
Post said today
they reached out to all -- they
reached all

24:59.064 --> 25:03.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
26 members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee,
and Sessions was the only one
that met with

25:03.569 --> 25:04.570 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kislyak from Russia.

25:04.670 --> 25:06.338 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does that raise any flags?

25:06.438 --> 25:10.609 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL MUKASEY: No, because he
met also with
about 20 or 25 other
ambassadors.

25:10.709 --> 25:15.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the reason they sought
out those meetings
-- and it was Kislyak who sought
out the meeting,

25:15.914 --> 25:20.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
as did the other ambassadors --
was that,
by that time, Senator Sessions
was involved

25:20.886 --> 25:22.121 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the campaign.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They wanted to know what the
American foreign
policy would be.

25:24.523 --> 25:30.262 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And all of those ambassadors met
sequentially,
one after another, with Senator
Sessions to

25:30.362 --> 25:37.269 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
dope out what the foreign policy
of a Trump
administration would be if Mr.
Trump were

25:37.369 --> 25:41.507 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
elected and to see if they could
press their
points of view.

25:41.607 --> 25:46.912 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Apparently, Kislyak pressed his
point of view
on the subject of Ukraine with
no great success,

25:47.012 --> 25:49.381 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as was reported today by the
attorney general.

25:49.481 --> 25:52.651 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Mr.
McLaughlin, I finally
want to ask you, what about
reports that members

25:52.751 --> 25:56.922 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the Obama administration left
essentially
an intelligence trail of bread
crumbs or made

25:57.022 --> 26:00.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
sure that certain matters were
at different
levels of clearance, so that
they could be

26:00.926 --> 26:01.994 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
accessed later on?

26:02.094 --> 26:03.962 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN MCLAUGHLIN: Yes, I have
heard that reporting.

26:04.062 --> 26:08.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Of course, we don't know from
the reporting
precisely what they were
leaving, the nature

26:08.867 --> 26:15.073 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the reports, other than the
allegation
by, I guess, anonymous sources
again that

26:15.174 --> 26:20.479 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
they somehow showed a
relationship between
campaign officials of Trump's
campaign and

26:20.579 --> 26:22.314 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the Russians.

26:22.414 --> 26:27.453 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I think what the Obama
administration was
doing here is, I don't think
they had come

26:27.553 --> 26:32.991 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- this is my view -- I don't
think they had
come to a firm conclusion that
there was complicity,

26:33.091 --> 26:37.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but they saw enough to raise the
question
in their mind and to convince
them that some

26:37.729 --> 26:40.199 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
further investigation was
required.

26:40.299 --> 26:44.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I suspect they believed,
once again in
that context that I described,
that, should

26:44.870 --> 26:48.740 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump be elected, someone would
have an impulse
to not pursue this.

26:48.841 --> 26:52.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think they were just
trying the guarantee
that it would continue to be
pursued.

26:52.578 --> 26:58.917 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: John
McLaughlin, Michael
Mukasey, thank you both.

26:59.017 --> 27:11.864 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Stay with us.

27:11.964 --> 27:16.902 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": why
the stock
market just keeps going up;
seeing war through

27:17.002 --> 27:22.007 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the lens of art; and a brief
take on what
it's like to be a female
comedian.

27:22.107 --> 27:27.779 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But first: You might know
retailer Zappos
for the shoes it sells and its
emphasis on

27:27.880 --> 27:29.581 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
customer service.

27:29.681 --> 27:33.719 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What you may not know about is
its quirky
corporate culture, and why the
company is

27:33.819 --> 27:36.722 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
banking on that for its
long-term success.

27:36.822 --> 27:40.626 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Our economics correspondent,
Paul Solman,
reports, as part of his weekly
series, Making

27:40.726 --> 27:42.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sense, which airs every
Thursday.

27:42.828 --> 27:51.036 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: Definitely the best
port-a-potty experience
I have ever had.

27:51.136 --> 27:56.742 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: From its Porta
Party P.R. to
its campus in downtown Vegas,
Zappos, the

27:56.842 --> 27:59.545 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
online shoe monger, is devoted
to different.

27:59.645 --> 28:03.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON BROWN, Zappos: Let me give
you these
three rules about wearing
wallflowers, as

28:03.982 --> 28:04.883 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we like to call them.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.318 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Wallflowers?

28:06.418 --> 28:07.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JASON BROWN: Wallflowers,
because you see
we have got the wall?

28:07.753 --> 28:09.454 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we call them wallflowers.

28:09.555 --> 28:13.926 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Front desk dress
code enforcer
Jason Brown gives visitors three
options.

28:14.026 --> 28:17.529 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JASON BROWN: First one is to
take it off if
it holds sentimental value to
you.

28:17.629 --> 28:21.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The next one is to wear it
around your head
in a bandana, John Rambo-style.

28:21.366 --> 28:24.202 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then the last one is to cut,
and it becomes
part of the collection.

28:24.303 --> 28:29.741 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Thankfully, my tie
was deemed
passably peculiar and thus
spared a spot on

28:29.841 --> 28:31.743 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the wall.

28:31.843 --> 28:40.185 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Amidst decor both seasonal,
lanterns for Chinese
new year, and longstanding, like
the ShoeZaphone.

28:40.285 --> 28:47.025 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tony Hsieh took over Zappos 17
years ago,
after selling his online ad
network, LinkExchange,

28:47.125 --> 28:49.595 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to Microsoft for a cool $265
million.

28:49.695 --> 28:54.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY HSIEH, CEO, Zappos: What a
lot of people
actually don't know is the real
reason why

28:54.366 --> 28:55.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we ended up selling the company.

28:55.634 --> 28:57.402 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: And that is?

28:57.502 --> 29:00.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: And it's because the
company culture
just ended up going completely
downhill.

29:00.806 --> 29:04.876 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I myself dreaded getting out of
bed in the
morning to go to my own company.

29:04.977 --> 29:08.714 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: History wouldn't
repeat itself,
Hsieh vowed.

29:08.814 --> 29:12.751 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, at Zappos, culture comes
first.

29:12.851 --> 29:15.220 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that starts with hiring
people who will
fit.

29:15.320 --> 29:19.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL BROWN: I remember coming
in, and one
of the things was, we're not
trying to hire

29:19.224 --> 29:21.259 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
based off of your education.

29:21.360 --> 29:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to hire based off of
someone I would
want to go have a beer with
after lunch.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well, I would want
to have a
beer with you, and I barely know
you.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.501 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL BROWN: Yes.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.502 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I wouldn't have a beer.

29:30.602 --> 29:31.503 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We could have a shot.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.405 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

29:33.505 --> 29:39.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Zappos' core values
are an obsession:
embrace change, be humble,
create fun and

29:39.611 --> 29:43.515 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a little weirdness.

29:43.615 --> 29:50.389 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Musician Tyler Williams heard it
was harder
to get into Zappos than Harvard.

29:50.489 --> 29:55.694 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So to be more than a face in the
crowd, he
sent a video valentine.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And when it earned him an
interview:

29:57.663 --> 30:00.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TYLER WILLIAMS, Zappos: I think
one of the
craziest questions is they
asked, on a scale

30:00.432 --> 30:02.534 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of one to 10, how weird are you?

30:02.634 --> 30:06.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I'm a definitely a 10 on
that scale, so
I was worried I was a little too
weird for

30:07.072 --> 30:08.840 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Zappos.

30:08.940 --> 30:15.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Nope, Williams is
now a fungineer,
the brains behind company galas
and other

30:16.081 --> 30:19.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
so-called experiences, like Tutu
Tuesdays.

30:20.018 --> 30:25.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TYLER WILLIAMS: We -- probably
at the pinnacle
of its popularity, we had 50, 60
people that

30:25.323 --> 30:27.459 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
would wear tutus on Tuesday.

30:27.559 --> 30:32.931 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Another core value,
build a positive
team and family spirit.

30:33.031 --> 30:35.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TYLER WILLIAMS: So, we put these
games on
the elevator to hopefully...

30:35.867 --> 30:37.636 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ah.

30:37.736 --> 30:42.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TYLER WILLIAMS: That was good --
to hopefully
stop and play the game, have
collisions, have

30:42.407 --> 30:47.012 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
conversations, and get off on
the wrong floor,
so people would visit different
areas that

30:47.112 --> 30:48.146 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
they normally wouldn't.

30:48.246 --> 30:52.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Zappos invests
lavishly in morale.

30:52.217 --> 30:58.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Impress a colleague and H.R.
will pay you
Zollars to redeem for Zappos
swag.

30:58.423 --> 31:05.764 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Each month, employees can reward
a co-worker
with a $50 company bonus for
going above and

31:05.864 --> 31:06.965 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
beyond.

31:07.065 --> 31:10.335 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And company largess begets acts
of random
kindness.

31:10.435 --> 31:14.906 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LETHA MYLES, Zappos: I took a
picture of a
particular bouquet that I liked,
and I posted

31:15.006 --> 31:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on Facebook, like, oh, I love
flowers.

31:17.042 --> 31:20.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Letha Myles started
in customer
service nine years ago.

31:20.445 --> 31:24.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LETHA MYLES: The next day, there
was a bouquet
of flowers sitting on my desk,
along with

31:24.116 --> 31:27.953 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a note saying: "You make us
smile, so we thought
we would make you smile."

31:28.053 --> 31:30.489 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Birthday balloons
abound.

31:30.589 --> 31:33.625 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cubicle self-expression is de
rigueur.

31:33.725 --> 31:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, look, what can the business
rationale
be for all this?

31:37.963 --> 31:44.136 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Why would Amazon pay more than a
billion dollars
for Zappos in 2009 and then let
it spend so

31:44.236 --> 31:48.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
generously for so long just to
make its employees
happy?

31:48.106 --> 31:53.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: I think it's pretty
hard to give
great, amazing service if you're
an unhappy

31:53.345 --> 31:54.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
employee.

31:54.546 --> 31:56.815 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Turns out Zappos'
business is
service.

31:56.915 --> 32:01.553 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It started with shoes, as Amazon
did with
books, aims to branch out.

32:01.653 --> 32:07.259 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: We have talked about
one day there
could be a Zappos airlines or a
Zappos hotel

32:07.359 --> 32:10.762 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that's just about the very best
customer service
and customer experience.

32:10.862 --> 32:18.103 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Well-known service,
like the
365-day free shipping return
policy, managed

32:18.203 --> 32:27.245 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
by customer service reps who
start at $14
an hour and comprise a third of
all employees

32:27.345 --> 32:29.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and above-and-beyond service.

32:29.414 --> 32:34.786 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two flight attendants told me
Zappos, when
asked, sent pizza to an
auditorium full of

32:34.886 --> 32:36.721 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
new JetBlue hires.

32:36.822 --> 32:40.158 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: In fact, we just had
our longest
phone call ever, which was well
over 10 hours'

32:40.258 --> 32:41.159 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
long.

32:41.259 --> 32:42.160 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Ten hours?

32:42.260 --> 32:43.261 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
TONY HSIEH: Yes.

32:43.361 --> 32:44.663 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But what were they
talking about?

32:44.763 --> 32:46.565 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: I wasn't there, but
I think they
-- they bonded.

32:46.665 --> 32:51.803 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, for you, to
hear that somebody
spent 10 hours on the phone with
a customer

32:51.903 --> 32:55.373 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bonding, that's a good thing,
not a waste
of time?

32:55.473 --> 32:56.608 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: That's an amazing
thing.

32:56.708 --> 32:58.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But what's the
payoff?

32:58.610 --> 33:02.514 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: 2008 was the first
year we hit
a billion dollars in gross
merchandise sales.

33:02.614 --> 33:05.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We're doing several times that
now.

33:05.550 --> 33:09.287 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the number one driver
through all that
history has been through repeat
customers

33:09.387 --> 33:11.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and word of mouth.

33:11.223 --> 33:15.794 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So, Amazon has kept
hands-off,
while Zappos proselytizes its
happy, weird

33:15.894 --> 33:20.665 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ways, offering daily tours and
advising companies
that want to emulate it.

33:20.765 --> 33:22.868 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Now CEO Hsieh can be impish.

33:22.968 --> 33:26.972 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: Rachel, do you want
me to leave?

33:27.072 --> 33:27.939 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Get it?

33:28.039 --> 33:29.241 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Leave?

33:29.341 --> 33:31.276 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But he can also be
seriously
controversial.

33:31.376 --> 33:37.015 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's introduced a system called
holacracy
that, among other things, does
away with bosses

33:37.115 --> 33:39.084 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
entirely.

33:39.184 --> 33:45.657 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All Zappos' 1,500 employees now
belong to
some 500 self-governing teams
called circles.

33:45.757 --> 33:49.261 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS PEAKE, Zappos: We're going
to start
like we do every holacracy
meeting with a

33:49.361 --> 33:50.228 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
check-in round.

33:50.328 --> 33:52.130 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Just call out your distractions.

33:52.230 --> 33:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Get here, get ready to process
some tensions
today and share what you know
with others.

33:55.901 --> 33:59.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN: I'm only distracted
because I have
a super long day of meetings.

33:59.905 --> 34:06.344 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WOMAN: I'm super, super
distracted because
the application window is open
for intern

34:06.444 --> 34:10.048 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
candidates again for the summer,
which means
we have thousands and thousands
of applicants,

34:10.148 --> 34:12.918 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
in the span of a week, up to
like 5,000.

34:13.018 --> 34:18.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So-called tactical
meetings are
run by a facilitator, according
to a rigid

34:18.123 --> 34:20.125 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
format, using holacratic lingo.

34:20.225 --> 34:22.193 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRIS PEAKE: Let's move on to
triage, you
guys.

34:22.294 --> 34:24.162 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can just go ahead and yell
those tensions
out.

34:24.262 --> 34:26.932 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, Rachel, as our secretary,
will go ahead
and capture those for you.

34:27.032 --> 34:30.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: In the closing
round, kudos for
efficiency.

34:30.168 --> 34:32.037 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRIS PEAKE: A ton of actions.

34:32.137 --> 34:36.708 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We covered seven items in less
than a half-an-hour,
and we have like a zillion
outputs, which

34:36.808 --> 34:39.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is really great, but, with that,
everyone
have a great day.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.180 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Chris Peake helped
with the holacracy
rollout.

34:42.280 --> 34:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRIS PEAKE: I would say the
best thing about
this process is the commitment
to action and

34:46.985 --> 34:49.154 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
projects and the transparency to
those.

34:49.254 --> 34:53.725 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would say probably the most
challenging,
with Zappos' culture, you
introduced a really

34:53.825 --> 34:56.127 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
rigid process within meeting
spaces.

34:56.227 --> 35:01.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hsieh believes
self-management
is key to Zappos' longevity,
allowing it to

35:01.800 --> 35:05.303 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
grow not like a top-down
corporation, but
a city.

35:05.403 --> 35:11.710 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: Most companies, as
they get bigger,
they become less nimble, less
innovative,

35:11.810 --> 35:13.678 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
less productive.

35:13.778 --> 35:17.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time the size of a city
doubles, innovation
or productivity per resident
increases by

35:17.649 --> 35:19.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
15 percent.

35:19.617 --> 35:25.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When you get more people in a
relatively smaller
area in a city, then you get
this crossover

35:25.423 --> 35:28.927 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of ideas from different creative
types and
entrepreneurs and businesses.

35:29.027 --> 35:32.197 align:left position:25%,start line:80% size:75%
PAUL SOLMAN: But
self-organization wasn't
for everyone.

35:32.297 --> 35:37.869 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, two years ago, Hsieh offered
a liberal
severance package to those not
sold on the

35:37.969 --> 35:41.172 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
new structure, in fact, to
everyone.

35:41.272 --> 35:47.779 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Eighteen percent took buyouts,
hiking the
firm's yearly turnover rate for
2015 to almost

35:47.879 --> 35:53.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
30 percent, though there's
plenty of turnover
at customer service firms and
plenty in Las

35:53.485 --> 35:55.186 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Vegas, period.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.255 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But Letha Myles is sticking with
it.

35:57.355 --> 36:01.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LETHA MYLES: The people who
stayed are pretty
much saying that they're willing
to commit

36:01.993 --> 36:05.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to learning it and practicing
it.

36:05.230 --> 36:10.235 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, let's still remember,
we're friends,
we're family, and I think that
helps us stay

36:10.335 --> 36:11.603 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
true to the process.

36:11.703 --> 36:14.773 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TYLER WILLIAMS: It felt like it
took the humanity
out of it.

36:14.873 --> 36:18.343 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we have worked that back
into the process,
I feel.

36:18.443 --> 36:23.815 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And everybody's voice gets
heard, which, usually,
in the past, it was just the
loudest person

36:23.915 --> 36:25.750 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the room, right?

36:25.850 --> 36:29.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Williams points out
that Zappos
is now canine-friendly, because
it was deemed

36:29.687 --> 36:33.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
safe enough to try, a key idea
in holacracy.

36:33.558 --> 36:37.128 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TYLER WILLIAMS: In the past,
that had been
shut down multiple times.

36:37.228 --> 36:40.231 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And through holacracy, we were
able to push
that through.

36:40.331 --> 36:43.301 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I know that's not a huge deal,
but it's a
big deal to our employees.

36:43.401 --> 36:49.307 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Hsieh thinks
self-management
will accomplish something much
bigger: saving

36:49.407 --> 36:53.111 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Zappos from the fate of most
large companies.

36:53.211 --> 36:59.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TONY HSIEH: If you look at the
Fortune 500
list, which I think came out in
1955 originally,

36:59.484 --> 37:04.255 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something like 85 percent, maybe
more, are
no longer on that list.

37:04.355 --> 37:07.092 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The default fate for most
companies is actually
death.

37:07.192 --> 37:11.763 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want this company to still be
around 500
years from now.

37:11.863 --> 37:16.734 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is economics
correspondent
Paul Solman, still wearing my
tie, reporting

37:16.835 --> 37:20.839 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Las Vegas.

37:20.939 --> 37:31.850 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Now let's turn
to the markets
and the remarkable rally of
late, one that's

37:31.950 --> 37:35.153 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
led to new records since
President Trump was
elected.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.021 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

37:37.122 --> 37:40.425 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Dow Jones
and other
indexes were already doing well
when Donald

37:40.525 --> 37:42.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump won the presidential
election.

37:42.627 --> 37:47.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, from the lows of the
2008 financial
crisis through President Obama's
time in office,

37:47.799 --> 37:50.902 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the Dow climbed back by about
150 percent.

37:51.002 --> 37:55.607 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And while markets closed lower
today, the
overall jump of recent weeks has
accelerated

37:55.707 --> 38:02.380 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
mightily, rising from just over
18000 on Election
Day to breaking 21000 this week.

38:02.480 --> 38:06.284 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In fact, it jumped by 1,000
points in just
24 days.

38:06.384 --> 38:09.187 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's the quickest rise since
1999.

38:09.287 --> 38:12.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For some analysis of what's
happening, I'm
joined now by Neil Irwin.

38:12.524 --> 38:13.958 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He's an economics writer for The
New York
Times.

38:14.058 --> 38:14.959 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Welcome.

38:15.059 --> 38:16.261 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN, The New York Times:
Thanks.

38:16.361 --> 38:18.496 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Pretty amazing
market out
there right now.

38:18.596 --> 38:19.497 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Can you explain?

38:19.597 --> 38:20.999 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
What is going on?

38:21.099 --> 38:23.902 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN: So, the simplest
version is, Donald
Trump is president.

38:24.002 --> 38:25.703 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His agenda is to cut corporate
taxes.

38:25.803 --> 38:27.572 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
His agenda is to deregulate.

38:27.672 --> 38:30.341 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are things that are good
for the bottom
line for major companies.

38:30.441 --> 38:33.578 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Throw in some more military
spending, maybe
some infrastructure spending,
that's good

38:33.678 --> 38:35.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
for the bottom line for
corporate America.

38:35.580 --> 38:39.384 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Add in also, this is a global
economy the
is kind of getting on its feet
after a rough

38:39.484 --> 38:41.986 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
couple of years, rough patch.

38:42.086 --> 38:46.057 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And you combine those things
into one period
of a few months, and that's how
you get these

38:46.157 --> 38:47.926 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kinds of rallies that we have
seen.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As you say,
Donald Trump
certainly would like to take
credit and has

38:50.495 --> 38:51.996 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
taken credit for this.

38:52.096 --> 38:53.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Does he deserve credit for this?

38:54.065 --> 38:57.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN: Yes, there is no
question that
the Trump agenda is something
that's making

38:57.635 --> 39:01.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
stock investors confident,
that's leading
them to believe that after-tax
profits, which

39:01.206 --> 39:04.442 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is what matters if you're a
stock investor,
are going to be on the rise in
the years ahead.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.411 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Some of the math is pretty
simple.

39:06.511 --> 39:10.915 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
If you're a bank and you can --
your capital
requirements gets dropped, if
you're a military

39:11.015 --> 39:14.052 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
contractor and your military
spending gets
increased, that is going to go
straight to

39:14.152 --> 39:15.520 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
your bottom line.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Lower taxes, good for the bottom
line . That's
all good for stocks.

39:17.622 --> 39:19.791 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there's no question that's
part of the
Trump agenda.

39:19.891 --> 39:22.460 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, that said, most of those
policies haven't
actually happened yet.

39:22.560 --> 39:25.897 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So there is still the question
of, will the
Trump administration deliver the
things that

39:25.997 --> 39:26.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Wall Street is now expecting?

39:27.065 --> 39:28.499 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It's an
anticipatory effect.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.401 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEIL IRWIN: Exactly.

39:30.501 --> 39:33.671 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You wrote
recently that
the real question is, how much
slack is there

39:33.771 --> 39:35.173 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
in the economy?

39:35.273 --> 39:37.942 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What do you mean by slack, and
why is that
important?

39:38.042 --> 39:41.746 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN: Every economy, every
country has
some kind of economic speed
limit.

39:41.846 --> 39:42.847 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's only so many people.

39:42.947 --> 39:44.983 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They can only produce so much
stuff.

39:45.083 --> 39:49.187 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The question for the economy is
how close
we are to that speed limit in
the United States.

39:49.287 --> 39:50.888 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How low can the unemployment
rate go?

39:50.989 --> 39:55.059 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How many more -- how much unused
capacity
is there in the manufacturing
sector?

39:55.159 --> 39:57.028 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's the big question
going forward.

39:57.128 --> 40:00.231 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is there room for the economy to
grow 3 percent
or 4 percent, like Donald Trump
said he wanted

40:00.331 --> 40:02.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to see during the campaign?

40:02.267 --> 40:05.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Or are we pretty much as fast as
we can -- are
we growing as fast as we can,
something like

40:05.870 --> 40:07.739 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
2 percent?

40:07.839 --> 40:10.475 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that's the big question of
whether this
kind of outstanding growth that
is being priced

40:10.575 --> 40:13.411 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
into financial markets really
can be delivered
in the years ahead.

40:13.511 --> 40:15.647 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you know
the answer to
that question?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.448 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you had to guess, where are
we?

40:17.548 --> 40:18.650 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN: We're getting close.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.251 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Look, we're at under 5 percent
unemployment.

40:20.351 --> 40:23.588 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, there's a lot of people
outside the labor
market who might come back in.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.390 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So there is some slack out
there.

40:25.490 --> 40:28.760 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There is some room to grow, but
probably not
as much as there was a year or
two ago.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.463 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that will become the binding
constraint
in these next couple of years.

40:32.563 --> 40:36.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: A booming
market is certainly
great if you're in that market,
but not all

40:36.367 --> 40:38.803 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
sectors are booming equally.

40:38.903 --> 40:45.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
How does this booming market
translate, though,
for people -- does it add to
growth that makes

40:45.109 --> 40:47.111 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a real impact in people's lives?

40:47.211 --> 40:52.583 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN: Look, stock wealth
is held predominantly
by the affluent, so the
distributional effects

40:52.684 --> 40:57.488 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of a higher stock market are
definitely not
even across the population.

40:57.588 --> 41:02.126 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, to the degree that a
higher stock
market, a rising sense of
confidence in corporate

41:02.226 --> 41:05.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America leads to more hiring,
more capital
expenditures, that can have
broad impacts.

41:06.097 --> 41:10.935 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, there is reason -- if these
numbers hold
up, if what markets are pricing
in, in the

41:11.035 --> 41:15.473 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Trump administration actually
happens, that's
a good sign for growth, for job
growth, for

41:15.573 --> 41:17.342 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
expansion of all kinds of
businesses.

41:17.442 --> 41:22.780 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Given this
economy and what
you know of Trump's proposed
policies, what

41:22.880 --> 41:26.517 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
specifically about those
policies are you
looking most closely at?

41:26.617 --> 41:28.286 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NEIL IRWIN: I think it's
execution.

41:28.386 --> 41:31.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this big corporate income tax
cut that
the president says he wants to
see, is that

41:31.656 --> 41:32.657 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
really going to happen?

41:32.757 --> 41:33.925 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How soon will it happen?

41:34.025 --> 41:35.760 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How big will it be?

41:35.860 --> 41:41.199 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
On the regulatory front, how
much of the shift
away from regulation really will
be things

41:41.299 --> 41:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that benefit corporate America?

41:43.000 --> 41:45.470 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How much -- is there going to be
new infrastructure
spending?

41:45.570 --> 41:46.471 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He wants a trillion dollars.

41:46.571 --> 41:47.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Is that actually going to
happen?

41:48.039 --> 41:49.841 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Congress isn't so sure.

41:49.941 --> 41:52.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So seeing if some of these
things go from
an idea on a chalkboard to
actual legislation,

41:52.877 --> 41:54.779 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
actual policy, that's the big
question right
now.

41:54.879 --> 41:58.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I know you're
an analyst
and an economics writer, and you
don't buy

41:59.083 --> 42:04.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and sell stocks, but if you had
to be advising
me, do you think this rally is
going to continue?

42:04.355 --> 42:05.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Can it keep up like this?

42:05.757 --> 42:07.058 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NEIL IRWIN: Look, stocks are
priced for protection
right now.

42:07.158 --> 42:09.961 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're very -- they're highly
priced relative
to earnings.

42:10.061 --> 42:10.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's all prospective.

42:11.062 --> 42:12.430 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, you're not buying current
earnings.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.631 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're buying the future.

42:13.731 --> 42:16.534 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the future is as uncertain
as it's ever
been.

42:16.634 --> 42:20.705 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That said, is there plenty of
reason to think
that earnings could grow as the
market is

42:20.805 --> 42:21.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
now predicting?

42:21.806 --> 42:23.141 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Certainly.

42:23.241 --> 42:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To count on it, think it's
assured makes it
a bit of a risky bet.

42:25.343 --> 42:29.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Neil Irwin of
The New York Times, thank you
very much.

42:29.180 --> 42:35.253 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
NEIL IRWIN: Thank you.

42:35.353 --> 42:41.526 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: This April
marks 100 years
since the United States joined
the side of

42:41.626 --> 42:43.528 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Allies in World War I.

42:43.628 --> 42:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Great War wasn't only joined
in the trenches,
but in the culture in different
ways as well.

42:49.233 --> 42:54.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An exhibit in Philadelphia
explores how American
artists grappled with a divisive
conflict

42:54.405 --> 42:57.809 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that produced powerful images
for and against
it.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.544 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has the story.

42:59.644 --> 43:05.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: I Want You, about
as direct
as it gets, an iconic image from
World War

43:05.349 --> 43:07.218 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
I.

43:07.318 --> 43:11.022 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Flower of Death, an
evocative title for
a painting by an American
soldier named Claggett

43:11.122 --> 43:15.626 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Wilson, that captures some of
the close-up
horror of the war.

43:15.726 --> 43:21.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just some of the ways American
artists responded
to a cataclysmic,
world-shattering and -shaping

43:21.132 --> 43:26.704 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
event, the subject of a major
new exhibition
at the Pennsylvania Academy of
Fine Arts in

43:26.804 --> 43:30.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Philadelphia titled World War I
and American
Art.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.210 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Co-curator Robert Cozzolino:

43:32.310 --> 43:35.446 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COZZOLINO, Co-Curator: At
heart, this
is a human interest story.

43:35.546 --> 43:37.381 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: You mean the
whole war, as
big as it was?

43:37.482 --> 43:43.254 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COZZOLINO: You have these
artists who
are thinking, basically, here's
this huge

43:43.354 --> 43:45.089 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
global conflict going on.

43:45.189 --> 43:46.958 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How do I make sense of it?

43:47.058 --> 43:53.865 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And how do I also bring it down
to a human
level and express either
dissent, an urgency

43:53.965 --> 43:59.637 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for America to take part in it,
or to just
express what's at stake?

43:59.737 --> 44:05.176 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The Great War
began in Europe
in 1914.

44:05.276 --> 44:10.615 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The U.S. didn't join until three
years later,
after an intense public debate
over entering

44:10.715 --> 44:12.183 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a foreign conflict.

44:12.283 --> 44:15.319 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Artists weighed in on both
sides.

44:15.419 --> 44:22.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Sloan's After the War, a
Medal, Maybe
a Job in 1914 was one of the
earliest anti-war

44:22.460 --> 44:23.361 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
drawings.

44:23.461 --> 44:25.229 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Marsden Hartley was conflicted.

44:25.329 --> 44:29.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He lived in Germany and fell in
love with
a German military officer killed
in the war,

44:30.067 --> 44:32.870 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who Hartley depicted in a series
of paintings.

44:32.970 --> 44:38.342 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Childe Hassam on the other hand,
active in
the pro-interventionist movement
in New York,

44:38.442 --> 44:42.480 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
streamed flags across his
canvasses in support
of the allies.

44:42.580 --> 44:47.685 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And George Bellows, an early
opponent of the
war, was moved to support it by
a U.S. government

44:47.785 --> 44:50.855 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
report, later disputed, of
German atrocities.

44:50.955 --> 44:54.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ROBERT COZZOLINO: He's swayed
that he has
to show what happened.

44:54.191 --> 44:57.762 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And he swayed,
big time, because
this is an atrocity painting,
right, on a

44:57.862 --> 44:59.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
large scale.

44:59.830 --> 45:01.332 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COZZOLINO: Yes, he makes
these history
paintings about this
contemporary event, and

45:01.432 --> 45:06.103 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he's showing the brutality of
these atrocities
being committed to citizens.

45:06.203 --> 45:08.072 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's showing it at its most
visceral.

45:08.172 --> 45:12.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: More directly,
the U.S. government
commissioned artists to create
propaganda

45:12.276 --> 45:18.115 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
posters as part of an agency to
influence
public opinion, calls to enlist
in the military,

45:18.215 --> 45:22.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and invest in the war effort,
questioning
the masculinity of fighting age
men, and the

45:23.020 --> 45:25.122 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
consequences of inaction.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.592 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anne Classen Knutson is another
of the show's
curators.

45:27.692 --> 45:30.194 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
ANNE CLASSEN KNUTSON,
Co-Curator: You have
seen this image a hundred
different times,

45:30.294 --> 45:31.195 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and this is where it begins.

45:31.295 --> 45:33.064 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

45:33.164 --> 45:36.167 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE CLASSEN KNUTSON: James
Montgomery Flagg,
a famous illustrator, created
Uncle Sam.

45:36.267 --> 45:42.373 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He loved himself so much, he
created Uncle
Sam in his own visage, so this
is James Montgomery

45:42.473 --> 45:43.374 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Flagg as Uncle Sam.

45:43.474 --> 45:44.375 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oh, really?

45:44.475 --> 45:46.077 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ANNE CLASSEN KNUTSON: "I want
you."

45:46.177 --> 45:48.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was so well-known, it was
reused over
and over again in the 20th
century.

45:48.446 --> 45:51.749 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Right next to it,
though, a
very different kind of image.

45:51.849 --> 45:55.820 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANNE CLASSEN KNUTSON: One of the
subtexts
of this, people before the war
were very worried

45:55.920 --> 45:58.489 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that immigrants were going to
come -- and
these are not my words -- these
are their

45:58.589 --> 46:03.361 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
words -- and dilute our white
American bloodlines.

46:03.461 --> 46:05.796 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So this is an image of that,
that fear of
immigrants.

46:05.896 --> 46:08.065 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Immigrants, and
also African-Americans,
I assume.

46:08.165 --> 46:11.936 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ANNE CLASSEN KNUTSON: Also using
-- Tarzan
was a hot topic at the time.

46:12.036 --> 46:15.239 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The novels were coming out, and
he was using
caricatures of African-
Americans as well.

46:15.339 --> 46:18.042 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And they were very feared during
the war and
not treated well.

46:18.142 --> 46:23.047 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Other work from
the era countered
that imagery, showing a
normalized, patriotic

46:23.147 --> 46:27.051 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
black life in a culture that
continued to
discriminate against it.

46:27.151 --> 46:29.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kelli Morgan is a curatorial
fellow with academy.

46:29.487 --> 46:31.889 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
KELLI MORGAN, Pennsylvania
Academy of Fine
Arts: We have families.

46:31.989 --> 46:39.130 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
African-American people are,
like I said,
a very integral piece of the
American fabric,

46:39.230 --> 46:41.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that we are meant to be here.

46:41.966 --> 46:44.669 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is our country, just as
much as it is
anybody else's.

46:44.769 --> 46:51.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And also to really show -- or to
play up that
narrative of, these are
America's sons.

46:51.175 --> 46:52.543 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
These are America's husbands.

46:52.643 --> 46:55.680 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These are America's fathers,
just like their
white counterparts.

46:55.780 --> 47:00.718 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Blacks served
with distinction
abroad, but faced renewed
discrimination back

47:00.818 --> 47:02.653 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
home.

47:02.753 --> 47:06.157 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And soon after the war, race
riots broke out
around the country, a kind of
backlash, says

47:06.257 --> 47:08.092 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Morgan.

47:08.192 --> 47:11.829 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
KELLI MORGAN: Because there was
a sense that
African-American men,
particularly veterans,

47:11.929 --> 47:17.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
had kind of gotten out of their
place, so
this idea of bravery and
subjectivity and

47:17.435 --> 47:20.738 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
autonomy in particular couldn't
stand.

47:20.838 --> 47:25.643 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The war would be
represented
in numerous other ways.

47:25.743 --> 47:30.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Georgia O'Keeffe, conflicted
about the U.S.
role and worried about a brother
about to

47:30.314 --> 47:34.618 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
be sent to fight, painted this
red flag enveloped
in smoke.

47:34.719 --> 47:38.723 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Official artists, including
George Harding,
were embedded in the fighting, a
first for

47:38.823 --> 47:40.624 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the U.S. military in a foreign
war.

47:40.725 --> 47:44.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COZZOLINO: You get this
heightened
sense of what it must have felt
like to have

47:44.128 --> 47:48.999 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a tank running towards -- moving
towards the
trench you're in.

47:49.100 --> 47:53.504 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Edward Steichen
served as an
aerial photographer, as planes
were used on

47:53.604 --> 47:55.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a wide scale in war for the
first time.

47:56.073 --> 48:00.511 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Photographs like these, shown in
newspapers,
influenced abstract paintings by
the likes

48:00.611 --> 48:02.379 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of John Marin.

48:02.480 --> 48:07.284 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One strikingly direct and
haunting use of
art in the war, masks made by
sculptor Anna

48:07.384 --> 48:10.387 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Coleman Ladd for disfigured
soldiers.

48:10.488 --> 48:15.359 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The painter Horace Pippin
fought, was injured,
and wrestled with the aftermath
of his experience

48:15.459 --> 48:17.294 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for years to come.

48:17.394 --> 48:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
An African-American, he served
with the famed
Harlem Hellfighters, a renowned
infantry of

48:22.333 --> 48:24.135 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
black soldiers.

48:24.235 --> 48:28.139 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COZZOLINO: The war has
these echoes
for all the people who lived
through it into

48:28.239 --> 48:30.107 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the 1920s and '30s.

48:30.207 --> 48:35.913 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It stays with them and it
becomes an integral
part to the kinds of art that
they're making.

48:36.013 --> 48:40.918 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Perhaps the most
famous artistic
image of World War I is the
epic, 20-foot-long

48:41.018 --> 48:46.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
painting by John Singer Sargent
titled Gassed,
a line of wounded soldiers
blinded in a gas

48:46.891 --> 48:53.264 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
attack, a mustard yellow pallor,
a game of
soccer in the background, as
life goes on,

48:53.364 --> 48:55.132 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
while figures writhe in the
foreground.

48:55.232 --> 49:00.437 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT COZZOLINO: And it seemed
to him the
perfect analogy for the way
people have been

49:00.538 --> 49:03.674 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
talking about the First World
War, the blind
leading the blind.

49:03.774 --> 49:09.446 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: In all, some 17
million soldiers
and civilians would die in the
war, including

49:09.547 --> 49:13.017 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
more than 100,000 American
military personnel.

49:13.117 --> 49:18.322 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It brought huge changes, but
wasn't, as first
claimed, the war to end all
wars.

49:18.422 --> 49:23.594 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The exhibition's final room
shows work from
its aftermath, and two that
bookend its heights

49:23.694 --> 49:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and depths, the flag-waving
celebration of
George Benjamin Luks' Armistice
Night and

49:29.466 --> 49:35.940 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Steuart Curry's Parade to
War allegory
from 1938, as soldiers again
march toward

49:36.040 --> 49:42.880 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a great foreign war, their faces
already becoming
skeletons, images of war that
reverberate

49:42.980 --> 49:44.682 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to today.

49:44.782 --> 49:48.419 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Pennsylvania Academy of
Fine Arts,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

49:48.519 --> 49:52.890 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The World War
I exhibition
will travel next to New York in
the spring

49:52.990 --> 50:01.832 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and then to Nashville in the
fall.

50:01.932 --> 50:09.340 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Finally, our Brief But
Spectacular series,
where we ask interesting people
to share their

50:09.440 --> 50:11.141 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
passions.

50:11.242 --> 50:14.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Tonight, comedian Michelle
Collins on the
abundance of white men hosting
late-night

50:14.245 --> 50:15.145 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
talk shows.

50:15.246 --> 50:16.480 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHELLE COLLINS, Comedian: I'm
tall.

50:16.580 --> 50:18.682 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I come from tallish people.

50:18.782 --> 50:20.150 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm 6'1''.

50:20.251 --> 50:21.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In roller blades, I'm like
6'9''.

50:21.919 --> 50:24.088 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Its great for dating.

50:24.188 --> 50:26.757 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have a lot of guys who are
like, we love
she's so big.

50:26.857 --> 50:27.758 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We love that so much.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.693 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

50:29.793 --> 50:33.330 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHELLE COLLINS: What if I had
a full meltdown
and just, Barbara Walters,
started sobbing?

50:33.430 --> 50:35.399 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I am so happy with how life
turned out for
me.

50:35.499 --> 50:36.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's great.

50:36.500 --> 50:37.968 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I found a place that sells long
jeans.

50:38.068 --> 50:42.907 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, ever since then, it's
been just
like really, really wonderful.

50:43.007 --> 50:52.283 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Like namaste, but classy.

50:52.383 --> 50:53.284 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love makeup.

50:53.384 --> 50:55.653 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm a Sephora rouge member.

50:55.753 --> 50:58.355 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means they just take it
directly out
of my paycheck.

50:58.455 --> 51:01.091 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When people are like, what's
your look, I
always say slutty panda.

51:01.191 --> 51:03.527 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, smoke me out here to the
hairline.

51:03.627 --> 51:09.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Do like a pop of gloss,
Amadeus-style, center
of the lips, and just push me
into traffic.

51:09.366 --> 51:11.101 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I love a contour.

51:11.201 --> 51:14.004 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Men are very unlucky, because,
if you are
like a bloated man, well, you're
pretty much

51:14.104 --> 51:15.005 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(EXPLETIVE DELETED).

51:15.105 --> 51:16.407 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to bleep it.

51:16.507 --> 51:18.242 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
It's PBS.

51:18.342 --> 51:22.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Women, we can paint a day of the
dead skull
on top of our own face and
pretend that that

51:23.047 --> 51:23.948 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
is what we look like.

51:24.048 --> 51:25.249 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
My mom is my biggest publicist.

51:25.349 --> 51:26.517 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She is in Miami.

51:26.617 --> 51:27.818 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She used to work at J. Crew.

51:27.918 --> 51:28.819 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Her name is Judy (ph).

51:28.919 --> 51:30.654 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They called it Judy Crew.

51:30.754 --> 51:33.857 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time people came into J.
Crew, she,
with their pants, would like
submit a head

51:33.958 --> 51:36.427 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
shot of mine, be like, enjoy
your cashmeres.

51:36.527 --> 51:37.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is my daughter.

51:37.528 --> 51:38.429 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She lives in New York.

51:38.529 --> 51:39.964 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She's very successful.

51:40.064 --> 51:43.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The big picture for me has
always been having
my own late-night show.

51:43.400 --> 51:44.868 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Let me do that again
late-nighty.

51:44.969 --> 51:48.138 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's all white guys hosting
late-night shows
right now.

51:48.238 --> 51:49.139 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's fine.

51:49.239 --> 51:50.474 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I don't think it's a problem.

51:50.574 --> 51:52.910 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I love that Samantha Bee is
hosting "Full
Frontal" on TBS.

51:53.010 --> 51:56.981 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I just feel like talking about
white guys
in late night is the new white
guy on late

51:57.081 --> 51:57.982 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
night.

51:58.082 --> 51:58.983 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's so boring.

51:59.083 --> 51:59.984 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's so played out.

52:00.084 --> 52:00.985 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We all know what's happening.

52:01.085 --> 52:02.519 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Let's just move on and change
it.

52:02.619 --> 52:04.321 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If you're a really funny woman,
of course
it's a great time right now.

52:04.421 --> 52:07.291 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think it was a great time 10
years ago,
when you had Kathy Griffin; 20
years ago,

52:07.391 --> 52:08.292 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you had Joan Rivers.

52:08.392 --> 52:10.060 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Can I be honest?

52:10.160 --> 52:13.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I find it annoying that funny
women always
have to talk about being a funny
woman.

52:13.163 --> 52:15.532 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's frustrating to me, because
I feel like
I'm above that.

52:15.632 --> 52:17.034 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm a funny person.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.636 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like, why do I have to now harp
on how many
funny women there are?

52:19.737 --> 52:20.704 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're not charity cases.

52:20.804 --> 52:21.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We're talented.

52:21.805 --> 52:22.706 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's, like, done.

52:22.806 --> 52:24.508 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I am Michelle Collins.

52:24.608 --> 52:28.345 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And this is my Brief But
Spectacular take
on stop asking me what it's like
to be a woman

52:28.445 --> 52:30.114 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
