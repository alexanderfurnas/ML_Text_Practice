JUDY WOODRUFF: As I was
starting to say, one
clear challenge facing
Democrats and Republicans,

00:05.000 --> 00:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
staying on message, when
the president can so quickly
stir up a new controversy.

00:08.833 --> 00:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, will a shakeup in the
White House communications
team change all that?

00:12.966 --> 00:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our Politics Monday duo is here
to weigh in, Amy Walter of The
Cook Political Report, Tamara

00:17.500 --> 00:19.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Keith of NPR.

00:19.433 --> 00:23.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But because you both were
sitting here as I was just
talking to Tom Perez, Tam, let's

00:24.533 --> 00:25.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
start by talking about that.

00:25.766 --> 00:27.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What do you make of the
Democrats' effort now?

00:27.766 --> 00:32.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You hear him saying, we're
trying to get back to business
here, to go to appeal to voters

00:32.166 --> 00:33.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
where they are.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TAMARA KEITH, National
Public Radio: Yes.

00:35.433 --> 00:38.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a struggle when I
covered the Clinton campaign
that they had, which he was sort

00:38.666 --> 00:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of getting at a little bit,
which is the thing where they
would want to talk about issues,

00:43.333 --> 00:46.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they would want to talk about
policy, they would want to
have an affirmative message,

00:46.600 --> 00:51.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and then Donald Trump
would do something and
they would just slip back
into being the opposition

00:53.066 --> 00:55.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the other person who
is running for president.

00:55.400 --> 01:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Democrats, I think,
struggle with that now in, you
know, are they the resistance

01:01.300 --> 01:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or are they for something?

01:03.800 --> 01:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And today was an effort to sort
of begin talking about what
they are for, at the same time

01:10.233 --> 01:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're also talking about
what they're against still.

01:11.433 --> 01:12.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
they're against.

01:12.233 --> 01:14.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Amy, can they do this?

01:14.233 --> 01:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook
Political Report: Yes, I
think that's very doable.

01:16.300 --> 01:20.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The biggest challenge
for Democrats -- I think
we discussed this the
last time -- is that

01:20.200 --> 01:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
they're the out party, so
they don't set the agenda.

01:22.200 --> 01:24.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Republicans set the agenda.

01:24.266 --> 01:27.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have to respond to
an agenda that's being set
by the Republican Party.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The other question is not just
so much about the message.

01:30.366 --> 01:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They can put together a
big messaging strategy,
but the messenger matters.

01:34.266 --> 01:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in 2016, it was pretty
clear that the messenger that
Democrats had wasn't seen as

01:37.833 --> 01:39.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believable on a lot
of these issues.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Hillary Clinton.

01:41.366 --> 01:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The Hillary Clinton
campaign had - - how many
reams of policy papers did you

01:44.300 --> 01:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
go through, Tam, about
all of these issues?

01:45.833 --> 01:47.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: I think there were
like 10,000 pages of policy...

01:47.433 --> 01:49.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:49.566 --> 01:50.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It's not that she
didn't and the campaign didn't
have a plan on the economy.

01:50.866 --> 01:52.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

01:52.133 --> 01:54.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: I think it
was a million words.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But not like they didn't
have a plan for the economy.

01:56.633 --> 02:01.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's that the messenger wasn't
seen as an effective messenger
or believable messenger.

02:01.233 --> 02:04.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the challenge, I think,
for Democrats right now going
into the midterm election

02:04.366 --> 02:09.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is finding candidates who
fit the districts, who have a
message that fits their specific

02:10.866 --> 02:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
area, and that they're
believable, that
they're authentic.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, they say
they are -- they are saying
they recruiting more people to

02:18.533 --> 02:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
run, at least at the
congressional level.

02:20.366 --> 02:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And they are.

02:21.366 --> 02:22.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
They are.

02:22.366 --> 02:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
At the congressional level.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And you just
heard Tom Perez talking about
the state and local races, too.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: It's always
the challenge and
the good and the bad.

02:31.733 --> 02:34.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You have tons of candidates
now on the Democratic
side either running or
talking about running.

02:36.566 --> 02:39.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That means big primaries and
that means you don't know who's
going to come out of a primary,

02:41.633 --> 02:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
potentially the candidate
who doesn't fit as the right
messenger for that district.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Meaning?

02:46.200 --> 02:50.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Meaning that you
get somebody in a district
that fits that district really

02:52.366 --> 02:56.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
well, but loses in a 10- or
eight-way primary to a different
kind of Democratic candidate.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there is not much that
the party can do about that.

03:00.433 --> 03:03.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But they're
going to try, aren't they, Tam?

03:03.866 --> 03:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Because, right now, Tom Perez
cited this poll that shows most
people think all the Democrats

03:10.500 --> 03:12.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
stand for or mostly what
they stand for is being
against Donald Trump.

03:12.466 --> 03:17.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: And they have
been pretty loudly against
Donald Trump, but you know what?

03:17.000 --> 03:20.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a long way out from
that midterm election.

03:20.833 --> 03:25.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And there's a lot of time
to actually hear a message.

03:25.066 --> 03:28.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We don't even know who the
candidates are at this point,
and the candidates do matter,

03:28.366 --> 03:30.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
as Amy says.

03:30.900 --> 03:34.366 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right,
speaking of Donald Trump,
Amy Walter, he chose
a new communications

03:36.300 --> 03:39.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
director late last
week, as press secretary
and communications
director Sean Spicer has

03:40.600 --> 03:42.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
now left the White House.

03:42.566 --> 03:47.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Anthony Scaramucci out on
all the weekend talk shows,
saying he loves this president,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that they're going to have
a new approach, and they're
going to be positive and they're

03:52.600 --> 03:54.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going to do well.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: The new approach
is a lot like the old approach,
which is, let Donald Trump

03:56.000 --> 03:57.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be Donald Trump.

03:57.133 --> 03:58.566 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
You're not going
to manage Trump.

03:58.566 --> 04:01.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm not going to micromanage
his Twitter account.

04:01.666 --> 04:06.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What works best is when Donald
Trump works in the mode that
he likes to operate in, as

04:07.533 --> 04:09.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
he did in the 2016 campaign.

04:09.900 --> 04:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The challenge, of course, with
any communications shakeup at
the White House is that we know

04:14.633 --> 04:18.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that there is one communications
director at the White House,
and his name is Donald

04:18.533 --> 04:20.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
J. Trump.

04:20.066 --> 04:22.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It doesn't matter who else gets
a title over at the White House.

04:22.933 --> 04:27.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, if you think what's been
working right now at the
White House has been effective

04:29.833 --> 04:31.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or what they're doing at the
White House has been effective,
then you're going to keep

04:31.666 --> 04:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - you're going
to say that's OK.

04:34.333 --> 04:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the fact is, their
legislative agenda is stalled.

04:37.433 --> 04:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That hasn't been working.

04:39.533 --> 04:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Letting Donald Trump be
Donald Trump hasn't helped
with his approval ratings.

04:41.700 --> 04:44.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They're stuck now
somewhere at 40 percent.

04:44.266 --> 04:48.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As we just discussed, it's
not helping in terms of
the 2018 midterm elections.

04:48.200 --> 04:53.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Democrats are energized,
Republicans not as energized.

04:55.233 --> 04:56.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The strategy is basically to
keep doing things the way that
we have been doing them, but,

04:56.833 --> 05:00.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
right now, six months
in, it hasn't been
particularly effective.

05:00.233 --> 05:04.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How does this
look to somebody who covers the
White House all the time, Tam?

05:04.033 --> 05:09.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: It looks like
there's a new person who, as
you said, he talks about loving

05:10.966 --> 05:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Donald Trump, about, you know
-- he definitely will be someone
who is a salesman for the

05:16.700 --> 05:18.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
president's message.

05:18.733 --> 05:23.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But if you look at the Sunday
show appearances, you had Sarah
Huckabee Sanders, who is the

05:24.333 --> 05:26.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
new press secretary,
saying one thing.

05:26.133 --> 05:30.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You had Scaramucci
saying another thing.

05:30.433 --> 05:35.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you had the president
of the United States tweeting
something somewhere in between.

05:36.833 --> 05:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And we're still
trying to figure this out.

05:38.933 --> 05:43.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
One of the things going
on in the tweeting,
Amy, is the president
continuing to criticize

05:43.466 --> 05:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or to say to Republicans,
you have got to come on
board with health care.

05:47.900 --> 05:49.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He's been tweeting about
it just a few minutes ago.

05:49.866 --> 05:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: He's been
tweeting about it.

05:51.900 --> 05:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then, of course, he stood
in the White House today and
basically put an ultimatum

05:54.766 --> 05:59.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in front of his party
that said, you are either
with me or you're not.

06:00.966 --> 06:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the marker has
been put right there.

06:03.133 --> 06:07.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so the choice for
Republicans tomorrow
is, are they going to
defy their president,

06:07.066 --> 06:10.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
after saying -- after
he told them this will
be in defiance of me?

06:10.900 --> 06:13.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: He said there
are going to be consequences
if we don't -- if you don't

06:13.133 --> 06:15.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
support this.

06:15.133 --> 06:18.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMARA KEITH: Meanwhile, he
was talking about members of
his own party as they, as if it

06:18.433 --> 06:22.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was not -- as if they weren't
part of the same team.

06:22.166 --> 06:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he was highly critical of
senators, saying, if you don't
do this, then you're breaking

06:25.900 --> 06:28.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
a promise and there
are consequences.

06:28.466 --> 06:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And he made a tiny little
aside sort of indicating
that he wanted voters
to call their senators

06:35.333 --> 06:39.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
or get in touch or make
it painful for their
senators, which is a turn.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's him, the president,
publicly advocating for
a piece of legislation.

06:42.766 --> 06:46.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And just very
quickly, he's also putting
pressure on his own attorney

06:46.433 --> 06:51.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
general, Amy, in just
a few seconds, saying
our beleaguered A.G.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
If you're Jeff Sessions, what
are you thinking right now?

06:53.900 --> 06:54.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

06:54.900 --> 06:56.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As with many people in the Trump
administration, if you work
for him, you have to know that

06:58.500 --> 07:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
your job is always precarious.

07:00.966 --> 07:04.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
