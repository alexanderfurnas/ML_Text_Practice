MANY WERE EVACUATED SHOWIN

04:12.967 --> 04:23.167
SIGNS OF MALNUTRITION.

04:23.167 --> 04:24.933
>>> EARLIER THIS WEEK, TEN BIG

04:24.933 --> 04:26.400
DRUG COMPANIES THAT RARELY SHARE

04:26.400 --> 04:28.367
THEIR SECRETS AGREED TO WORK

04:28.367 --> 04:30.067
TOGETHER WITH THE NATIONAL

04:30.067 --> 04:30.833
INSTITUTES OF HEALTH

04:30.833 --> 04:32.733
THEIR GOAL, FINDING CURES FOR

04:32.733 --> 04:34.333
NUMBER OF MAJOR DISEASES

04:34.333 --> 04:36.133
INCLUDING DIABETES AND

04:36.133 --> 04:36.433
ALZHEIMER'S.

04:36.433 --> 04:38.033
THE PROJECT WILL LAST FIVE

04:38.033 --> 04:39.967
YEARS, COST $230 MILLION, AND AT

04:39.967 --> 04:41.800
THE END, ALL THE FINDINGS WILL

04:41.800 --> 04:43.167
BE FREE FOR ANYONE TO USE.

04:43.167 --> 04:44.367
HERE TO HELP WILL US UNDERSTAN

04:44.367 --> 04:47.267
IT ALL IS MONICA LANGLEY FRO

04:47.267 --> 04:48.467
THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

04:48.467 --> 04:50.433
HAS ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER BEEN

04:50.433 --> 04:54.100
TRIED BEFORE ON THIS SCALE

04:54.100 --> 04:56.333
>> NO, NOTHING HAS BEEN TRIED ON

04:56.333 --> 04:58.167
THIS SCALE WITH THIS MAN

04:58.167 --> 04:58.567
DISEASES

04:58.567 --> 05:00.500
AND WITH THIS MUCH

05:00.500 --> 05:02.867
COLLABORATION.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.667
ALL IS THEY'RE GOING TO PUT AL

05:04.667 --> 05:06.200
THEIR DISCOVERIES OUT TO THE

05:06.200 --> 05:06.433
PUBLIC

05:06.433 --> 05:09.833
SO THE BIG PHARMACEUTICA

05:09.833 --> 05:15.267
COMPANIES OR THE LITTLEST STAR

05:15.267 --> 05:17.867
UP WILL HAVE ACCESS AND CA

05:17.867 --> 05:18.133
COMPETE.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.767
>> ALMOST FOLLOWING STRAIGHT OUT

05:19.767 --> 05:23.700
OF THE PLAY BOOK OF THE SOFTWARE

05:23.700 --> 05:23.833
MODEL OF OPEN SOURCE

05:23.833 --> 05:25.600
>> AND THIS IS WHAT IS UNUSUAL

05:25.600 --> 05:27.600
THERE STARTED TO AN FEW MORE

05:27.600 --> 05:28.967
COLLABORATIONS IN THE LAST FEW

05:28.967 --> 05:30.200
YEARS, BUT NOTHING OF THIS

05:30.200 --> 05:30.600
SCALE.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.000
AND THIS ACTUALLY TOOK TWO YEARS

05:32.000 --> 05:32.933
TO GET IT DONE

05:32.933 --> 05:33.767
AND IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.800
THERE WERE A LOT OF SHARP ELBOWS

05:35.800 --> 05:37.667
AND A LOT OF HURT FEELINGS ALONG

05:37.667 --> 05:38.233
THE WAY.

05:38.233 --> 05:40.133
AND NOT ALL THE DRUG COMPANIES

05:40.133 --> 05:41.900
THAT PARTICIPATED ULTIMATELY

05:41.900 --> 05:42.633
SIGNED UP.

05:42.633 --> 05:44.267
BUT TEN BIG ONES DID AND THE

05:44.267 --> 05:45.833
HOPE TO COME UP WITH SOM

05:45.833 --> 05:46.500
BLOCKBUSTER DRUGS.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.300
>> SO WHAT ARE THE SPECIFI

05:48.300 --> 05:49.400
DISEASES AND HOW DO THEY NARRO

05:49.400 --> 05:51.433
DOWN THE LIST OF WHAT TO TACKLE?

05:51.433 --> 05:52.333
>> OKAY.

05:52.333 --> 05:54.433
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION

05:54.433 --> 05:56.667
AT FIRST, THE HEAD OF THE NIH IS

05:56.667 --> 05:59.000
FRANCIS COLLINS, AND HE IS THE

05:59.000 --> 06:01.433
ONE WHO SEQUENCED -- OR WHO LE

06:01.433 --> 06:03.167
THE HUMAN GENOME EXPERIMENT.

06:03.167 --> 06:06.667
AND HE WANTED TO LIKE MAP AL

06:06.667 --> 06:06.867
DISEASES

06:06.867 --> 06:07.767
THAT WAS HIS GRAND IDEA.

06:07.767 --> 06:09.567
AND THE DRUG COMPANIES WERE LIKE

06:09.567 --> 06:10.833
ARE YOU CRAZY?

06:10.833 --> 06:12.767
WE CAN'T THINK OF SOME BIG

06:12.767 --> 06:13.833
THEORETICAL EXPERIMENT LIK

06:13.833 --> 06:14.000
THAT

06:14.000 --> 06:15.400
WE WANT SOMETHING THAT WILL GO

06:15.400 --> 06:19.167
INTO OUR PIPELINE AND HELP U

06:19.167 --> 06:21.100
MAKE MONEY

06:21.100 --> 06:25.467
SO THEY LOOKED AT DISEASES WHA

06:25.467 --> 06:26.667
PATIENTS REALLY NEEDED AND THE

06:26.667 --> 06:33.267
CAME UP WITH ALZHEIMER'S

06:33.267 --> 06:36.667
DIABETES, AND THEY ALSO CAME U

06:36.667 --> 06:39.067
WITH TWO AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS,

06:39.067 --> 06:40.400
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND LUPUS

06:40.400 --> 06:42.833
SO THEY FOCUSED ON THOSE FOU

06:42.833 --> 06:44.267
FOR THIS INITIAL FIVE YEAR

06:44.267 --> 06:44.433
PROJECT.

06:44.433 --> 06:47.133
>> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS $230

06:47.133 --> 06:47.367
MILLION.

06:47.367 --> 06:49.167
PUT THAT IN PERSPECTIVE ABOU

06:49.167 --> 06:50.200
HOW MUCH THESE COMPANIES WOULD

06:50.200 --> 06:52.267
SPEND IF THEY WEREN'T PART O

06:52.267 --> 06:53.100
THIS TRIAL

06:53.100 --> 06:55.200
>> THIS IS PEANUTS TO BE HONES

06:55.200 --> 06:58.633
WITH YOU FOR THE PHARMACEUTICA

06:58.633 --> 06:58.900
COMPANIES.

06:58.900 --> 07:00.700
BUT -- BECAUSE THEY SPEND LIKE

07:00.700 --> 07:02.067
OVER 200 SOMETHING BILLION A

07:02.067 --> 07:02.667
YEAR WORLDWIDE

07:02.667 --> 07:04.367
BUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING HERE IS

07:04.367 --> 07:05.733
SOMETHING MONEY CAN'T BUY.

07:05.733 --> 07:07.267
THEY'RE -- THEY HAVE AGREED TO

07:07.267 --> 07:09.633
GIVE THEIR BEST SCIENTISTS A LOT

07:09.633 --> 07:11.967
OF THEIR TISSUE AND BLOO

07:11.967 --> 07:15.067
SAMPLES AND ALL THEIR DATA FOR

07:15.067 --> 07:18.100
THE PAST AND KRPTD CLINICA

07:18.100 --> 07:19.333
TRIALS ON THESE FOUR DISEASE

07:19.333 --> 07:22.000
WITHIN THE RESEARCH PLAN

07:22.000 --> 07:24.533
AND BY WUTPUTTING ALL THIS

07:24.533 --> 07:25.533
TOGETHER, THEY THINK THEY CA

07:25.533 --> 07:28.700
COME UP WITH WAYS TO MAP DOE

07:28.700 --> 07:32.800
HIS DISEASES THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

07:32.800 --> 07:35.400
ABLE R UNABLE TO DO OF ALONE

07:35.400 --> 07:38.000
>> HOW MUCH OF THIS IS JUS

07:38.000 --> 07:42.000
FUNDING DRYING UP?

07:42.000 --> 07:44.800
>> THAT'S TRUE

07:44.800 --> 07:46.300
THE SCIENTIFIC COMPONENT I

07:46.300 --> 07:47.333
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE SCIENTIFIC

07:47.333 --> 07:48.733
INFORMATION NOW, THEY DON'T KNOW

07:48.733 --> 07:51.067
WHICH MOLECULAR PATHWAYS T

07:51.067 --> 07:51.433
FOLLOW

07:51.433 --> 07:53.700
THE SECOND IS THE BUSINESS

07:53.700 --> 07:54.333
REASON

07:54.333 --> 07:58.833
THESE GUYS, THE PHARMACEUTICAL

07:58.833 --> 08:00.433
EXECUTIVES TOLD ME IT TAKES TE

08:00.433 --> 08:02.067
YEARS AND $1 BILLION TO GET ON

08:02.067 --> 08:03.700
DRUG FROM DISCOVERY TO MARKET.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.733
AND SO THEY ARE JUST, YOU KNOW

08:05.733 --> 08:09.467
THEIR PIPELINES ARE DRYING UP,

08:09.467 --> 08:11.333
GENERICS ARE COMING OUT, SO THEY

08:11.333 --> 08:12.600
NEED HELP FINDING RIGHT DRUGS.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.500
>> MONICA, THANKS SO MUCH.

08:14.500 --> 08:44.300
>> MY PLEASURE

08:44.300 --> 08:45.933
>>> WE CONTINUE OUR COVERAGE O

08:45.933 --> 08:50.033
THE PENSION PERIL, THE SHORTFALL

08:50.033 --> 08:54.167
IN FUNDING FOR RETIREMEN

08:54.167 --> 08:54.867
BENEFITS

08:54.867 --> 08:55.900
VALLEJO, CALIFORNIA WENT BUS

08:55.900 --> 08:57.100
DURING THE GREAT RECESSION AFTER

08:57.100 --> 09:00.500
A SERIES OF BUDGET CUTS EMERGE

09:00.500 --> 09:02.367
FROM BANKRUPTCY THREE YEAR

09:02.367 --> 09:02.767
LATER.

09:02.767 --> 09:07.600
BUT NOW SOME FEAR HAVE A LAY

09:07.600 --> 09:11.067
VALLEJO COULD FACE A SECON

09:11.067 --> 09:12.767
BANKRUPTCY UNLESS THEY REDUC

09:12.767 --> 09:16.967
WHAT THEY PAY THE RETIREES

09:16.967 --> 09:18.200

CALIFORNIA

09:34.867 --> 09:37.300
ABOUT 50 MILES NORTH OF SA

09:37.300 --> 09:37.533
FRANCISCO.

09:37.533 --> 09:38.733
HE'D ONLY BEEN A BELIEVER FOR

09:38.733 --> 09:40.733
FEW YEARS WHEN HE DECIDED TO G

09:40.733 --> 09:42.233
INTO THE MINISTRY.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.467
BUT HE WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS

09:43.467 --> 09:44.933
HIS CALLING AND THE CHANCE T

09:44.933 --> 09:46.667
SERVE HIS COMMUNITY.

09:46.667 --> 09:48.567
>> I'VE HAD A GOOD LIFE.

09:48.567 --> 09:50.533
AND IF I CAN HELP SOMEONE ELSE

09:50.533 --> 09:52.167
HAVE A BETTER LIFE, THAT'S WHA

09:52.167 --> 09:53.067
LIFE IS ABOUT.

09:53.067 --> 09:54.267
WHEN WE LEAVE HERE, WE DON'T

09:54.267 --> 09:55.667
TAKE ANYTHING WITH US.

09:55.667 --> 09:57.467
I DON'T TAKE MY RETIREMENT

09:57.467 --> 09:59.033
BENEFITS, MY MEDICAL, UP IN OF

09:59.033 --> 09:59.667
THOSE THINGS

09:59.667 --> 10:04.800

10:04.800 --> 10:05.800
NEW CAREER BECAUSE HE RETIRE

10:05.800 --> 10:08.200
FROM HIS OLD ONE WITH BENEFITS

10:08.200 --> 10:09.633
FOR NEARLY 30 YEAR, HE WAS A

10:09.633 --> 10:12.667
POLICE OFFICER IN THE BAY AREA

OF A LITTLE OVER $108,000

10:21.367 --> 10:21.467
YEAR

10:21.467 --> 10:22.700
>> I KNEW THAT I WASN'T GOING TO

10:22.700 --> 10:24.633
HAVE TO COUNT ON A CHURCH SALARY

10:24.633 --> 10:26.967
TO CARRY ME THROUGH MY

10:26.967 --> 10:27.600
RETIREMENT, I WAS GOING TO

10:27.600 --> 10:29.433
DEFEND ON MY LAW ENFORCEMENT

10:29.433 --> 10:30.300
RETIREMENT TO DO THAT.

10:30.300 --> 10:31.867
>> IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD

10:31.867 --> 10:34.300
PRETTY GOOD SENSE THAT WHEN YO

10:34.300 --> 10:35.233
RETIRED, VALLEJO WOULD CONTINU

10:35.233 --> 10:37.167
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

10:37.167 --> 10:38.400
>> I KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO I

10:38.400 --> 10:39.933
A CARE OF ME

10:39.933 --> 10:42.733
THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID THEY WOULD

10:42.733 --> 10:42.867
DO

10:42.867 --> 10:44.067
>> Reporter: BUT THAT IS TAKIN

10:44.067 --> 10:46.300
A TOLL ON THE CITY'S FINANCES.

10:46.300 --> 10:49.300
REIREMENT BENEFITS WILL COST THE

10:49.300 --> 10:51.367
CITY $21 MILLION IN THE CURREN

10:51.367 --> 10:53.000
FISCAL YEAR.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.767
NEARLY $4 MILLION MORE THAN TH

10:55.767 --> 10:56.267
YEAR BEFORE.

10:56.267 --> 10:58.067
TWO YEARS AGO, THEY ACCOUNTE

10:58.067 --> 10:59.667
FOR 19% OF THE BUDGET.

10:59.667 --> 11:02.000
THIS YEAR THEIR SHARE IS NEARL

11:02.000 --> 11:02.267
26%.

11:02.267 --> 11:04.600
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW, THE CIT

11:04.600 --> 11:06.400
PROJECTS IT WILL BE ALMOST 30%

11:06.400 --> 11:08.367
THAT IS BAD NEWS FOR A CITY WITH

11:08.367 --> 11:11.833
A $5 MILLION BUDGET DEFICIT.

11:11.833 --> 11:13.100
STEPHANIE GOMES FEELS LIKE SHE'S

11:13.100 --> 11:15.867
WATCHING HISTORY REPEAT.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.533
>> WE COULD GO BANKRUPT AGAIN.

11:17.533 --> 11:19.367
THE FIRST ONE IS HARD ENOUGH

11:19.367 --> 11:21.833
I CAN'T EVEN BEGIN TO IMAGINE

11:21.833 --> 11:22.467
SECOND ONE

11:22.467 --> 11:27.267
>> Reporter: GOMES HAD A FRONT

11:27.267 --> 11:29.600
ROW SEAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL I

11:29.600 --> 11:29.767
2008

11:29.767 --> 11:30.867
THE CITY NEVER RECOVERED FRO

11:30.867 --> 11:34.367
THE BLOW IT TOOK IN 1996 WHE

11:34.367 --> 11:35.633
THE SHIP YARD CLOSED AND

11:35.633 --> 11:37.867
THOUSANDS OF RESIDENTS LOS

11:37.867 --> 11:38.100
JOBS

11:38.100 --> 11:39.867
THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF THE

11:39.867 --> 11:41.700
RECESSION WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE

11:41.700 --> 11:44.267
MUNICIPAL BUDGET

11:44.267 --> 11:45.667
FOR GOMES, THE WORST PART OF THE

11:45.667 --> 11:47.067
CRISIS WAS JUST BEFORE THE CIT

11:47.067 --> 11:48.300
FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY

11:48.300 --> 11:50.300
>> BECAUSE BEFORE IS WHEN YOU'RE

11:50.300 --> 11:51.233
SCRAMBLING TRYING TO FIGURE OU

11:51.233 --> 11:53.367
HOW NOT TO GO INTO BANKRUPTCY.

11:53.367 --> 11:57.333
SO WE HAD TO CUT FIXING OU

11:57.333 --> 12:00.267
ROAD, TRIMMING OUR TREES, HOUR

12:00.267 --> 12:04.267
AT THE LIBRARY, YOU KNOW

12:04.267 --> 12:05.167
ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING.

12:05.167 --> 12:06.733
>> Reporter: THERE WAS ONE THING

12:06.733 --> 12:08.933
THE CITY COULDN'T CUT.

12:08.933 --> 12:09.200
PENSIONS

12:09.200 --> 12:12.433
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW, VALLEJ

12:12.433 --> 12:13.833
WAS PROHIBITED FROM CUTTIN

12:13.833 --> 12:14.300
THEM

12:14.300 --> 12:15.033
PENSIONS COST THE CITY SO MUCH

12:15.033 --> 12:17.600
BECAUSE IT PAYS IT WORKERS S

12:17.600 --> 12:18.067
MUCH

12:18.067 --> 12:19.833
THE FIFTH HIGHEST WAGES FO

12:19.833 --> 12:21.233
MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES IN THE

12:21.233 --> 12:21.767
STATE.

12:21.767 --> 12:23.233
AND THE HIGHEST WAMGS IN THE

12:23.233 --> 12:25.900
CITY ARE PAID TO POLICE.

12:25.900 --> 12:33.400
>> IN VALLEJO, WE PAID $150,000,

12:33.400 --> 12:38.467
$175,000, $200,000, $300,000, SO

12:38.467 --> 12:40.600
YOU HAVE PEOPLE RETIRING WIT

12:40.600 --> 12:41.667
90% OF THAT.

12:41.667 --> 12:45.900
>> Reporter: BOB LEE ARGUE

12:45.900 --> 12:48.933
FIREFIGHTES AND POLICE OFFICES

12:48.933 --> 12:49.067
EARN IT.

12:49.067 --> 12:50.500
HE LOST TWO FRIENDS IN THE LIN

12:50.500 --> 12:50.867
OF DUTY.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.867
WHEN HE WAS GROWING UP, FE

12:52.867 --> 12:54.400
CITIES HAD A PROBLEM WITH CRIME.

12:54.400 --> 12:55.833
BUT WHEN CRACK COCAINE CAME TO

12:55.833 --> 12:57.200
UP TO, THE CITY'S CRIME PRISON

12:57.200 --> 12:57.767
GOT WORSE.

12:57.767 --> 13:00.533
>> PEOPLE WERE CRYING OUT FO

13:00.533 --> 13:01.500
SOMETHING TO BE DONE ABOUT THE

13:01.500 --> 13:01.800
CRIME.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.633
SO THE CITY STARTED PAYING MOR

13:03.633 --> 13:04.833
FOR POLICE OFFICERS, THE

13:04.833 --> 13:05.967
STARTED PROVIDING BETTER

13:05.967 --> 13:08.433
BENEFITS TO ATTRACT GOOD

13:08.433 --> 13:09.967
OFFICERS AND WE BUILT A VERY

13:09.967 --> 13:11.067
GOOD POLICE DEPARTMENT, ONE THAT

13:11.067 --> 13:12.733
WAS LOOKED UP TO BY MANY

13:12.733 --> 13:13.667
AGENCIES IN THE STATE.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.500
>> Reporter: LAST YEAR WHEN TH

13:14.500 --> 13:16.333
CITY HAD TO CUT SPENDING AGAIN

13:16.333 --> 13:17.667
TO DEAL WITH ITS $5 MILLIO

13:17.667 --> 13:19.133
DEFICIT, THE COUNCIL TURNED TO

13:19.133 --> 13:21.400
THE POLICE BUDGET.

13:21.400 --> 13:23.367
LAST DECEMBER, THE COUNCIL

13:23.367 --> 13:24.700
CHAMBERS FILLED UP WIT

13:24.700 --> 13:26.633
RESIDENTS, POLICE IN UNIFORM AND

13:26.633 --> 13:28.900
RETIRED COPS AS THE COUNCIL TOOK

13:28.900 --> 13:30.867
UP A PROPOSAL TO CUT HEALTH CARE

13:30.867 --> 13:33.767
BENEFITS FOR RETIRED POLICE BY

13:33.767 --> 13:34.967
$2 MILLION A YEAR.

13:34.967 --> 13:35.967
STEPHANIE GOMES AND THE REST O

13:35.967 --> 13:38.233
THE COUNCIL LISTENED AS BOB LE

13:38.233 --> 13:40.467
TOLD THEM THAT THE PROPOSAL WA

13:40.467 --> 13:40.667
UNFAIR

13:40.667 --> 13:43.967
>> THOSE OF YOU SITTING OU

13:43.967 --> 13:44.333
HERE, YOU PICTURE YOURSELF

13:44.333 --> 13:45.800
RETIRING 15, 20 YEARS FROM NOW

13:45.800 --> 13:47.067
WITH WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE

13:47.067 --> 13:48.933
GOING TO GET HAVING BEEN TAKEN

13:48.933 --> 13:49.567
AWAY

13:49.567 --> 13:51.967
>> Reporter: GOMES CAN EMPATHIZE

13:51.967 --> 13:52.800
WITH THE POLICE.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.833
THEIR DEPARTMENT WAS THE LAS

13:53.833 --> 13:56.300
ONE HER HUSBAND WORK THIS HA

13:56.300 --> 13:59.867
BEFORE HE RETIRED.

13:59.867 --> 14:03.367
BUT SHE WANTED THE CUT TO BE HER

14:03.367 --> 14:05.100
LAST MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT.

14:05.100 --> 14:05.167
THE COUNCIL VOTED 6-0 TO MAK

14:05.167 --> 14:13.200
THE CUT.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.467
BOB LEE LOST THEIR INSURANCE

14:14.467 --> 14:18.800
NOW THEY PAID A TOTAL OF $769

14:18.800 --> 14:19.367
MONTH FOR THEMSELVES

14:19.367 --> 14:21.667
>> I AM DISAPPOINTED AND

14:21.667 --> 14:24.100
FRUSTRATED THAT THE CITY HAS

14:24.100 --> 14:25.467
DONE THIS.

14:25.467 --> 14:27.667
TO ME AND FOR OTHER RETIREES

14:27.667 --> 14:31.333
THEY HAVE LET US DOWN.

14:31.333 --> 14:32.900
AND IN SOME WAYS IT SEEMS LIKE

14:32.900 --> 14:34.767
THEY HAVE TAKEN THE EASY ROUTE

14:34.767 --> 14:37.300
TO FILL A MONETARY GAP B

14:37.300 --> 14:40.300
CUTTING RETIREE BENEFITS

14:40.300 --> 14:43.333
I WAS PROMISED SOMETHING WHEN

14:43.333 --> 14:43.600
RETIRED.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.933
I WORKED ALMOST 30 YEARS T

14:45.933 --> 14:48.200
RECEIVE THAT AND I BASED MY LIFE

14:48.200 --> 14:48.867
UPON IT.

14:48.867 --> 14:50.333
>> WAS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THE

14:50.333 --> 14:52.567
CITY OF VALLEJO COULD HAVE DON

14:52.567 --> 14:54.100
AT THAT POINT?

14:54.100 --> 14:55.700
WHERE COULD THEY HAVE CUT?

14:55.700 --> 14:56.700
>> WHERE I THINK THEY SHOULD

14:56.700 --> 15:01.133
HAVE STARTED TO MAKE CHANGES I

15:01.133 --> 15:02.400
WITH THE CURRENT EMPLOYEES

15:02.400 --> 15:03.300
THOSE PEOPLE STILL HAVE AN

15:03.300 --> 15:04.867
OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN FOR THES

15:04.867 --> 15:05.500
THINGS IN THE FUTURE

15:05.500 --> 15:06.767
>> I GET THAT THEY PUT THEIR

15:06.767 --> 15:07.433
LIFE ON THE LINE

15:07.433 --> 15:09.300
MY HUSBAND WAS A POLICE CAPTAIN.

15:09.300 --> 15:10.300
RETIRED AFTER 36 YEARS

15:10.300 --> 15:11.133
I GET IT

15:11.133 --> 15:12.400
BUT YOU CHOOSE THAT JOB.

15:12.400 --> 15:15.067
BECAUSE YOU BELIEVE IN IT.

15:15.067 --> 15:17.400
YOU CHOOSE IT BECAUSE OF

15:17.400 --> 15:17.767
SERVICE.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.733
AND YOU BELIEVE IN SERVING THE

15:19.733 --> 15:19.867
PUBLIC

15:19.867 --> 15:22.300
AND THE PUBLIC IS HURTING.

15:22.300 --> 15:26.500
>> HOW FAR IS IT FAIR TO GO IN

15:26.500 --> 15:27.233
CUTTING THAT, THOUGH

15:27.233 --> 15:29.133
>> I WOULD CUT THE LEAST AMOUN

15:29.133 --> 15:30.367
THAT WE COULD BECAUSE I AGRE

15:30.367 --> 15:32.700
PEOPLE RETIRE AND THEY KIND OF

15:32.700 --> 15:36.500
MAKE PLANS ON THAT

15:36.500 --> 15:38.100
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE PROMISES TO

15:38.100 --> 15:38.933
THE TAXPAYERS?

15:38.933 --> 15:41.933
PEOPLE PAYING THESE PENSIONS

15:41.933 --> 15:43.533
IT'S PROMISES TO A MANY AN

15:43.533 --> 15:44.933
PROMISES TO A FEW.

15:44.933 --> 15:45.933
AND IF WOULD HE ALL TOOK A

15:45.933 --> 15:48.300
LITTLE BIT OF CUTS AND IF WE ALL

15:48.300 --> 15:49.267
SHARED IN THAT PAIN, THEN IT

15:49.267 --> 15:51.367
WOULDN'T HAVE TO BE SO GREAT

15:51.367 --> 15:53.067
>> Reporter: THE CONFRONTATION

15:53.067 --> 15:55.833
IN VALLEJO WAS PART OF A BREER

15:55.833 --> 16:01.300
CONFLICT OVER THE COST OF TAKING

16:01.300 --> 16:02.933
CARE OF RETIRE YEARS AND IT MA

16:02.933 --> 16:04.367
BE COMING TO A LOT MORE.

16:04.367 --> 16:05.800
>> IT'S A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM, LIKE

16:05.800 --> 16:07.567
A VIRUS MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH

16:07.567 --> 16:08.800
CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL

16:08.800 --> 16:09.033
GOVERNMENTS.

16:09.033 --> 16:10.167

RAISE TAXES OR CUT OTHER PARTS

OF THE BUDGET.

CITIES TO REIN IN THAT COS

17:00.000 --> 17:01.767
BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO CUT

17:01.767 --> 17:02.833
PENSIONS TO DO IT.

17:02.833 --> 17:04.233
AND SINCE THAT'S PROHIBITE

17:04.233 --> 17:06.800
UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW, THEY'R

17:06.800 --> 17:07.700
LIKELY TO GO BANKRUPTCY.

17:07.700 --> 17:09.100
SHE'S BEEN CAMPAIGNING TO CHANGE

17:09.100 --> 17:10.700
THAT LAW, TO GIVE CITIES THE

17:10.700 --> 17:13.033
RIGHT TO NEGOTIATE FOR PENSION

17:13.033 --> 17:13.233
CUTS

17:13.233 --> 17:14.400
SHE AND OTHER SUPPORTERS HOPE TO

17:14.400 --> 17:16.400
GET THE INITIATIVE ON TO THE

17:16.400 --> 17:17.267
BALLOT IN THE STATEWIDE SLEEKS

17:17.267 --> 17:20.400
THAT CALIFORNIA VOTERS CAN

17:20.400 --> 17:22.167
DECIDE

17:22.167 --> 17:23.733
>> I'M GOING TO PAY --

17:23.733 --> 17:25.367

17:25.367 --> 17:27.200
AN ANTI-GRAFFITI CAMPAIGN SH

17:27.200 --> 17:28.567
AND HER HUSBAND STARTED.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.500
SHE SEES A LOT OF OTHE

17:30.500 --> 17:31.867
RESIDENTS GETTING TOGETHER TO DO

17:31.867 --> 17:33.233
THINGS THE CITY USED TO DO WHICH

17:33.233 --> 17:35.333
COULD BE A GOOD SIGN FOR

17:35.333 --> 17:36.400
VALLEJO'S FUTURE

17:36.400 --> 17:38.633
AND ON THAT POINT, BOB LEE

17:38.633 --> 17:39.200
AGREES WITH HER.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.600
THERE IS A STORY LIKE THAT I

17:40.600 --> 17:41.233
THE BIBLE.

17:41.233 --> 17:44.067
>> IN THE BOOK OF ACTS AFTER

17:44.067 --> 17:46.600
CHRIST WENT BACK TO HEAVEN, HE

17:46.600 --> 17:48.900
LEFT THE PEOPLE WITH A MANDATE

17:48.900 --> 17:50.233
HE SAID LOVE GOD, LOVE YOU

17:50.233 --> 17:50.833
NEIGHBORS.

17:50.833 --> 17:53.667
AND THAT IS WHAT THE PEOPLE DID.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.133
THEY SET THEIR DIFFERENCES

17:55.133 --> 17:56.400
ASIDE, THEY CAME TOGETHER TO

17:56.400 --> 17:58.767
MAKE A BETTER FUTURE FOR

17:58.767 --> 17:59.933
EVERYONE

17:59.933 --> 18:01.667
AND I THINK THAT YOU CAN D

18:01.667 --> 18:02.167
THAT

18:02.167 --> 18:05.900
BUT IT TAKES A LOT OF HARD WOR

18:05.900 --> 18:08.367
FOR PEOPLE TO BE WILLING TO SE

18:08.367 --> 18:09.233
ASIDE THINGS THAT THEY

18:09.233 --> 18:14.933
OFTENTIMES HOLD DEARLY

18:14.933 --> 18:16.600

TONIGHT ON YESTERDAY'S MONTHLY

18:29.033 --> 18:29.833
UNEMPLOYMENT REPORT.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.933
OUR FOCUS THIS EVENING,

18:31.933 --> 18:35.400
PERSISTENT PROBLEM, HOW IT

18:35.400 --> 18:37.933
IMPACTS YOUNG PEOPLE AND PEOPL

18:37.933 --> 18:38.367
OF COLOR

18:38.367 --> 18:41.567
WE HAVE A SENIOR ECONOMIST WIT

18:41.567 --> 18:42.100
US FROM BLOOMBERG.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.933
WHEN YOU YOU LOOK UNDER TH

18:43.933 --> 18:46.233
HOOD, IT'S WORSE DEPENDING O

18:46.233 --> 18:46.933
WHERE YOU LOOK

18:46.933 --> 18:48.400
LET'S LOOK AT RACE

18:48.400 --> 18:49.500
WHITE AMERICANS HAVE A

18:49.500 --> 18:51.900
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF ABOUT 5.7%.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.433
AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE MORE THA

18:53.433 --> 18:56.333
TWICE THAT FIGURE AT 12.1%

18:56.333 --> 18:58.300
ANY PRIMARY CAUSES

18:58.300 --> 19:00.233
>> WELL, YOU SEE THAT DOUBLING

19:00.233 --> 19:02.233
OF THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE BETWEEN

19:02.233 --> 19:05.567
BLACKS AND WHITES AT EVERY

19:05.567 --> 19:07.633
EDUCATIONAL LEVEL AND IT'S

19:07.633 --> 19:09.467
PARTICULARLY DRAMATIC WHEN YOU

19:09.467 --> 19:10.933
LOOK AT THE YOUTH POPULATION

19:10.933 --> 19:13.300
THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.333
ONE, THE FACT THAT BLACK

19:15.333 --> 19:18.533
GRADUATE AT LOWER LEVELS THA

19:18.533 --> 19:19.300
WHITES DO.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.933
SO WE KNOW COLLEGE EDUCATION I

19:20.933 --> 19:22.567
A HUGE FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE

19:22.567 --> 19:24.433
LEVEL OF UNEMPLOYMENT.

19:24.433 --> 19:25.567
SO THAT EMPLOYMENT DISPARITY I

19:25.567 --> 19:28.000
A BIG DRIVER

19:28.000 --> 19:29.600
SECONDLY, YOUTH AN

19:29.600 --> 19:31.933
AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH TEND TO

19:31.933 --> 19:35.567
BE EMPLOYED IN SECTORS THAT AR

19:35.567 --> 19:36.633
VERY BUSINESS CYCLE SENSITIVE.

19:36.633 --> 19:37.867
SO WHEN THE GENERAL ECONOMY IS

19:37.867 --> 19:39.267
DOING BAD, THAT SECTOR GET

19:39.267 --> 19:41.067
WORSE AND IT'S WORSE FOR THI

19:41.067 --> 19:42.133
PARTICULAR POPULATION.

19:42.133 --> 19:43.200
>> SO WHEN WE LOOK A

19:43.200 --> 19:45.933
UNEMPLOYMENT NUMBERS BY AGE,

19:45.933 --> 19:46.967
IT'S EVEN WORSE AS YOU'R

19:46.967 --> 19:48.700
POINTING OUT

19:48.700 --> 19:51.667
FROM 16 TO 19, THE NUMBER IS

19:51.667 --> 19:52.633
20.7%.

19:52.633 --> 19:58.733
BY RACE, WHITES 17.5%, AND YOUNG

19:58.733 --> 20:00.333
AFRICAN-AMERICANS ARE MORE

20:00.333 --> 20:01.600
DOUBLE THAT NUMBER AT 38%.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.833
THAT IS AN ASTOUNDING NUMBER

20:05.833 --> 20:07.900
>> THAT'S NEARLY 40% FOR YOUNG

20:07.900 --> 20:09.600
BLACK TEENAGERS.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.133
LOOK, ONE IN EVERY FOUR BLAC

20:11.133 --> 20:14.067
YOUTH AGES 16 TO 25 IS

20:14.067 --> 20:14.933
UNEMPLOYED RIGHT NOW

20:14.933 --> 20:16.433
AND SO IT'S A HUGE PROBLEM

20:16.433 --> 20:18.267
BUT IT'S NOT ONLY A PROBLEM FO

20:18.267 --> 20:19.133
THE PRESENT.

20:19.133 --> 20:20.667
IT'S A PROBLEM FOR THE FUTURE.

20:20.667 --> 20:24.167
HOW YOU START OUT AS A YOUNG

20:24.167 --> 20:25.467
WORKER, HOW YOU ENTER THE LABO

20:25.467 --> 20:27.567
MARKET DETERMINES YOUR FUTUR

20:27.567 --> 20:28.367
EARNINGS POTENTIAL

20:28.367 --> 20:29.467
IF YOU'RE BLOCKED OU

20:29.467 --> 20:30.967
OPPORTUNITIES NOW, YOU MAY B

20:30.967 --> 20:32.733
BLOCKED OUT FOR A LIFETIME

20:32.733 --> 20:35.033
IT'S A DRAMATIC SITUATION THAT

20:35.033 --> 20:35.733
DEFINITELY NEEDS ATTENTION

20:35.733 --> 20:37.267
>> AND IT COSTS THE GOVERNMENT

20:37.267 --> 20:38.933
SORT OF IN BOTH WAYS

20:38.933 --> 20:40.233
TAXES THAT WE DON'T GET FROM

20:40.233 --> 20:41.467
WORKERS THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO

20:41.467 --> 20:43.033
THE ECONOMY AND ALSO SOCIA

20:43.033 --> 20:43.767
SERVICES THAT WE'RE PROVIDING TO

20:43.767 --> 20:45.700
THE UNEMPLOYED

20:45.700 --> 20:47.700
>> THAT'S TRUE

20:47.700 --> 20:50.067
BUT THE GOOD NEWS HERE IS THAT

20:50.067 --> 20:51.767
THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT I

20:51.767 --> 20:51.867
FIXABLE.

20:51.867 --> 20:54.500
WE KNOW THAT IF YOU GET

20:54.500 --> 20:58.600
COLLEGE DEGREE, YOUR CHANCES O

20:58.600 --> 21:01.000
FINDING A JOB INCREASE TODAY

21:01.000 --> 21:02.300
DRAMATICALLY

21:02.300 --> 21:06.400
SO ONE FIX IS TO MAKE COLLEG

21:06.400 --> 21:09.133
AID MORE AVAILABLE

21:09.133 --> 21:12.000
BUT FOR BLACK YOUTH, YOU STILL

21:12.000 --> 21:14.633
SEE DOUBLE THE UNEMPLOYMEN

21:14.633 --> 21:17.733
RATE

21:17.733 --> 21:19.267
SO WE NEED PERHAPS PAI

21:19.267 --> 21:20.533
INTERNSHIPS TO MAKE SURE THE

21:20.533 --> 21:21.267
HAVE THE SAME EMPLOYMENT

21:21.267 --> 21:22.033
OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD.

21:22.033 --> 21:23.367
>> AND WHAT ABOUT MANUFACTURIN

21:23.367 --> 21:25.167
JOBS, HOW DOES THIS ADDRESS TH

21:25.167 --> 21:26.033
EQUATION

21:26.033 --> 21:27.900
>> YOU KNOW, THERE IS A HUGE

21:27.900 --> 21:29.100
SEGMENT OF THE ECONOMY THAT IS

21:29.100 --> 21:30.300
ACTUALLY TAKING OFF.

21:30.300 --> 21:31.733
AND THE ONE THING THAT YOUNG

21:31.733 --> 21:33.033
PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR FAVOR I

21:33.033 --> 21:34.633
THAT THEY'RE MUCH MORE MOBIL

21:34.633 --> 21:36.700
THAN OLDER WORKERS

21:36.700 --> 21:38.100
THEY CAN MOVE TO WHERE THE JOB

21:38.100 --> 21:39.867
ARE AND THEY CAN ACQUIRE SKILL

21:39.867 --> 21:41.267
THAT ARE NEEDED FOR THE ECONOM

21:41.267 --> 21:42.600
OF THE FUTURE.

21:42.600 --> 21:45.233
SO ANY PROGRAM THAT WE CAN GET

21:45.233 --> 21:47.267
TO GET PEOPLE ATTACHED TO TH

21:47.267 --> 21:50.300
LABOR MARKET BY GROWING SKILLS

21:50.300 --> 21:52.467
AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT CAN ONLY

21:52.467 --> 21:53.667
HELP THEIR FUTURE EMPLOYMENT

21:53.667 --> 21:56.300
PICTURE GOING FORWARD.

21:56.300 --> 21:57.267
