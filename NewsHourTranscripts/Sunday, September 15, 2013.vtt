LOT OF INFLUENCE OVER THE RULE

20:33.500 --> 20:35.033

NEW LAWS ONLY BECAUSE TH

21:02.133 --> 21:03.167
FINANCIAL SYSTEM IS BECOMING

21:03.167 --> 21:04.500
MORE AND MORE COMPLEX.

21:04.500 --> 21:07.800
AND WRITING LAWS ALLOWS US T

21:07.800 --> 21:09.467
COMPLEX AND TO REIN IN THA

21:09.467 --> 21:10.633
COMPLEXITY OR AT LEAST REGULAT

21:10.633 --> 21:13.533
IT, BUT IT'S TRUE THAT WE ALSO

21:13.533 --> 21:14.600
DON'T ENFORCE VERY WELL WHAT W

21:14.600 --> 21:15.267
ALREADY HAVE

21:15.267 --> 21:18.567
A LOT OF REGULATORS JUST AREN'

21:18.567 --> 21:19.633
INCENTIVIZED TO FIND WRONGDOING.

21:19.633 --> 21:21.500
WE HAVE A WRISTLE BROTHER RULE

21:21.500 --> 21:23.167
THAT'S PART OF DODD FRANK THAT

21:23.167 --> 21:24.633
STILL HASN'T BEEN FINALIZED.

21:24.633 --> 21:25.633
YOU HAVE THE STRUCTURAL ISSU

21:25.633 --> 21:27.433
THAT A LOT OF REGULATORS ARE

21:27.433 --> 21:30.167
PAID $50,000, $80,000, MAYBE

21:30.167 --> 21:32.833
$100,000 A YEAR BUT THE BANKER

BEING PAID MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

21:36.833 --> 21:37.767
