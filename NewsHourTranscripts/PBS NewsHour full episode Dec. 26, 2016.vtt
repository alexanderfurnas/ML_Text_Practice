WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Good evening.

00:05.467 --> 00:06.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm William Brangham.

00:06.467 --> 00:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Judy Woodruff is away.

00:07.900 --> 00:10.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
dueling visions for the nation.

00:10.133 --> 00:14.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Obama seeks to
preserve his legacy, as Donald
Trump lays out a very different

00:14.533 --> 00:16.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
path forward.

00:16.500 --> 00:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Plus: The Greek island of Lesbos
is facing strained relations
with the refugees it once

00:21.267 --> 00:23.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
welcomed with open arms.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ERIC KEMPSON, Volunteer: It
took so long to come here, and
they're sitting on the boat,

00:25.467 --> 00:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
they're soaking wet,
they're freezing cold.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The temperature
is close to zero.

00:29.600 --> 00:34.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you have a few people
holding two towns to ransom
because they don't want refugees

00:36.133 --> 00:38.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in there, this is
absolutely disgusting.

00:38.667 --> 00:42.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And
remembering George
Michael, the '80s pop star
and gay rights advocate

00:43.433 --> 00:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
who died at age 53.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more on
tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:47.533 --> 00:52.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:52.267 --> 00:57.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: There is more
fallout tonight from that U.N.
Security Council vote on Friday

01:05.200 --> 01:07.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which condemned Israel's
building of settlements.

01:07.833 --> 01:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Israelis confirmed today
that they have suspended working
ties with 12 of the nations

01:12.233 --> 01:14.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that backed the resolution.

01:14.167 --> 01:17.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will not meet with
their foreign ministers, and the

01:17.600 --> 01:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Israeli foreign minister will
not receive their ambassadors.

01:21.033 --> 01:25.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, president-elect Trump
again tweeted his own criticism
of the United Nations this

01:25.767 --> 01:27.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
evening.

01:27.733 --> 01:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said, it has great potential,
but for now it's -- quote --
"just a club for people to

01:30.800 --> 01:33.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
get together, talk
and have a good time."

01:33.633 --> 01:35.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And he added, "So sad."

01:35.700 --> 01:39.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mr. Trump had urged the Obama
administration to veto the
Israel resolution, instead of

01:39.700 --> 01:41.667 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
abstaining.

01:41.667 --> 01:44.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This has been a day of mourning
in Russia for the victims
of a military plane crash

01:44.967 --> 01:47.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that killed 92 people.

01:47.500 --> 01:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The plane went down Sunday
morning, just minutes
after taking off from
the southern city of

01:50.933 --> 01:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Sochi, en route to Syria.

01:53.033 --> 01:57.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, divers pulled fragments
of the plane out of the Black
Sea, and a massive search

01:57.167 --> 02:01.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
operation continued
as investigators
searched for a cause.

02:01.733 --> 02:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MAXIM SOKOLOV, Russian
Transportation Minister
(through translator):
As we know, the main

02:08.067 --> 02:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
causes so far do not
include an act of terrorism.

02:10.033 --> 02:14.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So we think that the reason for
the crash could be a technical
fault or a pilot error,

02:14.333 --> 02:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but I repeat it will
be clarified by the
investigation of a Ministry
of Defense special technical

02:19.233 --> 02:21.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
commission.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The Russian
intelligence agency FSB said
today it has found no signs

02:24.467 --> 02:27.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
pointing to sabotage
or terror in the crash.

02:27.733 --> 02:32.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Syria, Russian troops
say they have uncovered
mass graves in Eastern
Aleppo since its recapture

02:33.333 --> 02:35.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from rebels.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Defense Ministry said
today that several dozen bodies
were found, victims of torture

02:38.600 --> 02:40.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and mutilation.

02:40.600 --> 02:43.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Russians sent military
police into Eastern Aleppo after
helping the Syrian government

02:43.633 --> 02:45.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
retake the city.

02:45.733 --> 02:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's word that China's
1st Aircraft Carrier Group has
sailed past Taiwan and into

02:50.233 --> 02:52.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the contested South China Sea.

02:52.367 --> 02:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Chinese warships passed
islands controlled by
Taiwan in a show of force.

02:56.600 --> 03:01.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Beijing says it's a routine
exercise, but it comes amid
rising tensions over Taiwan's

03:02.067 --> 03:04.633 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
status.

03:04.633 --> 03:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Philippines faced
widespread power outages
and evacuations today,
after a powerful Christmas

03:08.633 --> 03:10.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
typhoon.

03:10.700 --> 03:14.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Typhoon Nock-ten made landfall
overnight, killing six people
and forced nearly 400,000

03:14.400 --> 03:16.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to flee.

03:16.400 --> 03:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five provinces lost power
completely as winds of more than
100 miles an hour tore through

03:20.600 --> 03:22.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
power lines and damaged homes.

03:22.633 --> 03:26.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
The water from the streets
became so strong, it came into

03:26.367 --> 03:28.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
our house.

03:28.433 --> 03:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MAN (through translator): I
told my family to evacuate and
leave our belongings behind.

03:31.433 --> 03:33.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We needed to save
our lives first.

03:33.900 --> 03:38.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: The
typhoon disrupted Christmas
celebrations in Asia's
largest Catholic nation,

03:39.100 --> 03:41.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and stranded some 12,000
holiday travelers.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Blizzard conditions in
the Dakotas kept major
highways closed today
and knocked out power

03:45.267 --> 03:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
through Nebraska and Iowa.

03:47.233 --> 03:51.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Heavy snow, ice and winds
moved in over the Christmas
weekend, forcing authorities to

03:51.700 --> 03:54.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
post several no-travel warnings.

03:54.100 --> 03:58.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Forecasters expect the
storm to move into the
Northeast later in the week.

03:58.367 --> 04:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Still to come on the "NewsHour":
the constant push and pull
between the current president

04:02.233 --> 04:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and the future one;
rising tensions on a Greek
island that's welcomed
thousands of refugees;

04:08.700 --> 04:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a deadly Christmas weekend
in Chicago; and much more.

04:23.167 --> 04:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It seems politics didn't
take much of a holiday break.

04:26.033 --> 04:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
From the ongoing turf war
between outgoing President Obama
and soon-to-be President Trump

04:30.800 --> 04:34.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to a new pledge this weekend to
dissolve the Trump Foundation
over possible conflicts of

04:34.733 --> 04:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interest, there's plenty to
talk about this Politics Monday.

04:38.200 --> 04:43.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Joining me are Amy Walter of
The Cook Political Report and
Stu Rothenberg of The Rothenberg

04:43.033 --> 04:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
&amp; Gonzales Political Report.

04:45.533 --> 04:47.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Welcome to you both.

04:47.600 --> 04:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen, over this weekend,
and in the past week or so,
president-elect Trump inserting

04:53.700 --> 04:57.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
himself very overtly into
American policy on Israel,
on Taiwan and China.

04:58.867 --> 05:00.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's negotiating
government contracts.

05:00.800 --> 05:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I'm curious, Amy, is this as
unprecedented as it seems?

05:04.933 --> 05:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER, The Cook Political
Report: It is unprecedented.

05:07.033 --> 05:11.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But we, of course, have never
had a president-elect coming
in the age of Twitter either.

05:11.033 --> 05:13.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So there's that piece of it.

05:13.300 --> 05:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I feel like a broken
record, but every time we're
together, I say the same thing,

05:17.867 --> 05:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which is we have to expect
that this is going to be an
unprecedented presidency.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He ran an unprecedented
kind of campaign.

05:25.067 --> 05:29.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's been showing no
signs of being a different
president-elect than
he was as a candidate.

05:29.200 --> 05:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I think he's also showing
us the kind of president that
he's going to be, especially

05:33.133 --> 05:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
on an issue like Israel, where
he's going to move much closer
to where the hard-liners,

05:40.000 --> 05:44.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
especially Benjamin
Netanyahu, want the U.S. to
be than where Obama was.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is a relationship between
Israel and the U.S. during
the Obama years that hasn't

05:48.833 --> 05:51.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
exactly been the
nicest and friendliest.

05:51.433 --> 05:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Stu, is that
your take as well, that this
is just the way it's going

05:54.200 --> 05:56.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to be?

05:56.233 --> 05:58.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG, Editor and
Publisher, The Rothenberg &amp;
Gonzales Political Report: Yes,

05:58.200 --> 06:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
it's a man with huge
personality and a huge
ego with lots of opinions.

06:00.200 --> 06:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And unlike traditional
politicians, all of our previous
presidents, he has a different

06:05.100 --> 06:07.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kind of filter or no filter.

06:07.200 --> 06:11.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he thinks that, when he has
an opinion, he should offer it
and people would be interested.

06:11.600 --> 06:12.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they are interested.

06:12.667 --> 06:14.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And I agree with Amy entirely.

06:14.733 --> 06:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would expect this throughout
the presidency, at least over
the next couple of years, where

06:18.700 --> 06:23.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
he likes to interject himself,
solve problems, make points,
and he will continue to do that.

06:25.767 --> 06:29.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMY WALTER: And, look, there
is not really a distinctive
line between foreign policy

06:29.667 --> 06:34.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other policies, right,
that when you're negotiating
trade, you can also negotiate

06:36.667 --> 06:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
foreign policy and defense
contracts and where our
warships are positioned.

06:38.933 --> 06:41.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's all part
of a big package.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: And in terms
of the language - - just want
to point, just in terms of the

06:43.067 --> 06:46.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
language, while politicians
use diplomatic language and
they are very concerned about

06:46.467 --> 06:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the words they use and the
phrases, Donald Trump is never
concerned about a particular

06:50.400 --> 06:52.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
word or phrase.

06:52.433 --> 06:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He wants to get a point across
and he says it bluntly if
he wants to, and he usually

06:56.133 --> 06:58.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wants to.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
in the end, though, any of
this really affects policy?

07:00.167 --> 07:04.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I understand the appearance
of having an armchair
president in waiting.

07:04.133 --> 07:06.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Does it change policy
in any substantive way?

07:06.067 --> 07:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: It will when he's
no longer the president-elect.

07:09.300 --> 07:12.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And so that's really
the question that we're
all waiting to see.

07:12.100 --> 07:15.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Right now, he sends out
his opinions, his tweets.

07:15.133 --> 07:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We see sometimes there is a
reaction, but nothing that has
been particularly substantive,

07:19.733 --> 07:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
in part because we have
one president right now.

07:22.533 --> 07:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When he becomes the president
and he sends a tweet out, and
let's say warships move based

07:28.967 --> 07:32.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
on that tweet, then we will have
a very different conversation.

07:32.067 --> 07:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Unless and until that happens,
though, we have to just sort
of expect that this is the

07:36.367 --> 07:38.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way he's going to
conduct himself.

07:38.833 --> 07:43.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we're going to learn a lot
more once the people he has
hired, secretary of defense,

07:45.833 --> 07:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
secretary of state, how they
perform and whether they have a
greater influence on policy, but

07:51.367 --> 07:53.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
also on his behavior.

07:53.433 --> 07:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I would
say, for the near term, those
of us who read the tweets and

07:57.233 --> 08:02.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
hear his opinions take
a deep breath, whether
we're journalists or
political analysts or

08:04.233 --> 08:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
you run Boeing or whatever,
or international leader, but
there is a sense of let's wait

08:09.133 --> 08:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
until after January 20 to
see where the policies are.

08:12.833 --> 08:14.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

08:14.333 --> 08:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: We know
where the opinions are.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Maybe the policies will
or will not follow that.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Let's talk a
little bit now about the whole
conflict of interest issue.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We saw over the weekend the
Trump administration-to-be
is announcing that
they're going to close

08:24.400 --> 08:26.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the Trump family foundation.

08:26.733 --> 08:31.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think that is going to
start to put to rest some of the
questions about his potential

08:31.133 --> 08:33.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
conflicts?

08:33.167 --> 08:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Well, it's
a start, but I don't think
it will be the finish or is

08:35.900 --> 08:39.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the finish, and I don't think
he will be able to deal with
all the potential conflicts of

08:39.667 --> 08:42.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
interests that he now has and
I think will continue to have.

08:42.967 --> 08:45.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He's not going to sell
all his properties.

08:45.133 --> 08:47.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His properties are
in many countries.

08:47.800 --> 08:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
That raises questions
about foreign policy,
and relationships,
and economic issues.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I just don't see it.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, is this a first step,
a significant first step?

08:56.733 --> 08:58.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I guess so.

08:58.833 --> 09:02.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He didn't indicate during the
campaign that he was willing
to do this, but I don't think

09:02.700 --> 09:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that solves the fundamental
problem, which is he's got a
lot of interests around the

09:06.233 --> 09:07.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
world.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMY WALTER: Yes, I
absolutely agree with that.

09:09.267 --> 09:11.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And it also takes
another political
headache off the table.

09:11.833 --> 09:16.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Remember throughout the
campaign, The Washington
Post had been reporting
on a lot of issues

09:18.833 --> 09:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with that foundation, where
it was getting its money, what
it was and wasn't doing with

09:21.333 --> 09:23.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

09:23.333 --> 09:25.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is an actual open
investigation by the New
York state attorney general.

09:25.967 --> 09:30.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So it takes, at least in the
short-term, this political
headache, right, well, only just

09:30.467 --> 09:31.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
giving me bad problems.

09:31.900 --> 09:33.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not a particularly
large foundation.

09:33.867 --> 09:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it takes that off the table.

09:36.200 --> 09:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Also gives him the opportunity
to say, hey, look, unlike the
Clintons, when it looks like

09:39.900 --> 09:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
something could be pay for
play or there is a problem
with my foundation, I will just

09:44.133 --> 09:49.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
close it down, rather than
making it -- or raising these
questions about conflicts.

09:51.033 --> 09:53.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But to Stu's point, there
are still too many other
conflicts that are out there.

09:53.833 --> 09:57.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the question is, ultimately,
we know that reporters are
going to be interested in this

09:57.833 --> 09:59.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and tracking this
down consistently.

09:59.933 --> 10:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
How focused will voters be on
this and how long will they
see each and every one of his

10:05.933 --> 10:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
decisions impacting
his business?

10:08.200 --> 10:11.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That
always does seem to be
the ongoing question.

10:11.433 --> 10:15.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The AP, Lisa Lerer, had a really
interesting piece looking at
several of the things that

10:15.733 --> 10:20.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump criticized Hillary
Clinton for during the campaign
that he is now himself doing,

10:22.700 --> 10:25.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
things like having a lot of
members of Goldman Sachs in his
inner circle, not having press

10:25.833 --> 10:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
conferences, things like that.

10:27.500 --> 10:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Do you think that those
matter to voters, to
his constituency at all?

10:31.933 --> 10:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: I don't
think they matter to Trump
voters, Trump supporters.

10:36.633 --> 10:41.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
No, because I think they can
explain that away, it's the
media, it's misstatements by

10:42.833 --> 10:44.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
opponents, it's
liberal Democrats.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So I don't think
that's a problem.

10:46.867 --> 10:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With the media, members of
the media will continue to be
interested in that, and will

10:52.567 --> 10:54.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
continue to ask, when
are you going to have
a press conference?

10:54.333 --> 10:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But to Trump supporters, no,
I don't think it's a big deal.

10:57.033 --> 10:59.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMY WALTER: Yes.

10:59.200 --> 11:02.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And I was sitting in a
focus group with voters
last week in Ohio who
had all supported Donald

11:02.733 --> 11:03.967 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Trump.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Now, they weren't all
hard, solid Republicans.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Many of them had voted for Obama
or Bill Clinton in the past.

11:08.900 --> 11:12.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But when you asked the question
about conflict of interest,
their answer, the way that they

11:12.833 --> 11:17.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helped to process this is
they said, look, he comes in
already very rich, so he can't

11:18.700 --> 11:20.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be bought off.

11:20.167 --> 11:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And you heard that a lot
on the campaign trail, too.

11:22.233 --> 11:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What they were frustrated
about with Hillary Clinton and
other traditional politicians

11:26.233 --> 11:30.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was that they came to Washington
and then got rich, as opposed
to they are already rich

11:30.300 --> 11:32.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
when they came to
Washington, so of course
you can't be corrupted.

11:32.500 --> 11:33.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: He's
inoculated from it.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
AMY WALTER: Right.

11:35.567 --> 11:37.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can't be corrupted if you
already have all this money
and you are not looking for

11:37.067 --> 11:38.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the money.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.067 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We will see.

11:39.067 --> 11:41.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We will see how long it lasts.

11:41.133 --> 11:45.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Again, it's great in theory,
but to Stu's point, once it's
January 20, and you're president

11:47.100 --> 11:50.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the United States and you're
making decisions, the lines are
going to get much darker and

11:51.567 --> 11:53.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
much clearer.

11:53.700 --> 11:57.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Amy Walter, Stu Rothenberg,
thank you both very much.

11:58.867 --> 12:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STUART ROTHENBERG: Thank you.

12:02.100 --> 12:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMY WALTER: You're very welcome.

12:06.133 --> 12:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Eighteen
months into Europe's
refugee crisis, tension
has surfaced on the

12:12.567 --> 12:14.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Greek island of Lesbos.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It wasn't so long ago that the
islanders were being considered
for the Nobel Peace Prize

12:18.333 --> 12:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for their welcoming of refugees.

12:20.500 --> 12:25.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But income from tourism,
on which many islanders
depend, has plummeted
this year, and hostility

12:25.233 --> 12:29.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
towards refugees and to
the volunteers helping
them has only grown.

12:29.333 --> 12:32.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
From Lesbos, special
correspondent Malcolm
Brabant reports.

MALCOLM BRABANT: Skala

a small fishing village
in northern Lesbos,

12:37.433 --> 12:42.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the tranquil dawn is about
to get busy.

12:47.433 --> 12:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
The first raft of the
day has been spotted
about five miles away.

12:54.467 --> 12:59.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Volunteers from Refugee
Rescue, an Irish charity,
are scrambling to help.

13:01.367 --> 13:05.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The raft is intercepted by a
coast guard cutter after leaving
Turkey's shore and entering

13:05.500 --> 13:06.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%

FATHER CHRISTOFOROS SCHUFF,
Lesbos: When it comes to the
fact that many of these people

13:10.267 --> 13:14.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
arriving are Muslims, we are
supposed to love everyone.

13:14.033 --> 13:18.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Waiting
for them is Californian
orthodox priest father
Christoforos, who has

13:18.867 --> 13:20.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
lived in Lesbos for 15 years.

13:20.933 --> 13:25.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
At a time when Europe
is becoming increasingly
anxious about the influx
of Muslim refugees

13:27.233 --> 13:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
and economic migrants,
Christoforos doesn't
waver from his creed.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FATHER CHRISTOFOROS SCHUFF:
Theologically, we are supposed
to see every human being as

13:33.367 --> 13:35.700 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
God.

13:35.700 --> 13:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And how we treat that
person is how we treat God.

13:39.733 --> 13:42.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This a sacred ideal
to love the foreigner.

13:42.867 --> 13:46.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It is the exact
opposite of xenophobia.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This is something

15:10.067 --> 15:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: But
that's a paradise.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Yes.

15:12.833 --> 15:16.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Why
have you left a paradise?

15:16.733 --> 15:20.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MAN: It is a paradise,
but it's very poor.

15:20.267 --> 15:22.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's very poor.

15:22.800 --> 15:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Like most
other Greek communities,
Skala Sikaminia has
endured seven years of

15:28.967 --> 15:33.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
economic hardship, but
the selflessness of
the Nobel-nominated
villagers is one of the

15:33.133 --> 15:36.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
reasons why Refugee
Rescue is based here.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Coordinator Baz Fischer.

15:38.600 --> 15:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BAZ FISCHER, Refugee Rescue:
There have been tensions in
other places, definitely.

15:42.467 --> 15:45.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And if we can, we'd always
like to bring them here.

15:45.867 --> 15:50.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If every village down the
coast was like here, it would
make things a lot easier.

15:52.867 --> 15:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: This footage
was shot by activists at the
nearby port of Petra in the

15:59.467 --> 16:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
summer, as local people
blockaded the jetty
in an attempt to stop
the coast guard from

16:03.700 --> 16:07.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
transferring refugees in front
of their tourist beaches.

16:07.633 --> 16:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As a result of alleged
intimidation, including
vandalism of their
vehicles, volunteer groups

16:13.700 --> 16:16.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
avoid Petra and Molyvos
five miles away.

16:16.033 --> 16:21.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
With its magnificent 15th
century citadel, Molyvos is the
architectural jewel of Lesbos

16:22.233 --> 16:24.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and is almost entirely
dependent on tourism.

16:24.433 --> 16:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But according to Mayor
Athanasios Andriotis,
income was down by 70
percent this year, as

16:30.267 --> 16:33.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
vacationers stayed away
because of the refugee crisis.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He acknowledged there
was some tension.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ATHANASIOS ANDRIOTIS,
Mayor of Molyvos (through
translator): The people
are annoyed and worried

16:38.800 --> 16:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
about the future because
this situation seems to
be becoming permanent.

16:42.233 --> 16:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's one which is no good
for the people of Molyvos, nor,
unfortunately, for the refugee

16:46.833 --> 16:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
migrants who come here.

16:48.833 --> 16:51.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: There are some
people who say that the coast
guard has not been allowed

16:51.267 --> 16:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to drop people in Molyvos
because there is such hostility.

16:54.200 --> 16:57.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ATHANASIOS ANDRIOTIS (through
translator): The figures
here for tourism have dropped

16:57.667 --> 17:00.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to almost zero because
of the refugee issue.

17:00.267 --> 17:02.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This can't go on.

17:02.367 --> 17:05.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have to understand that,
OK, they have arrived here,
but they have to go somewhere

17:05.267 --> 17:07.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
else more secluded to disembark.

17:07.300 --> 17:11.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The consequence
is that it takes longer for
the coast guard or volunteers

17:11.700 --> 17:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to take migrants to ports
where they will be accepted.

17:15.033 --> 17:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This angers British
volunteer and Lesbos
resident Eric Kempson, who
we first met 18 months ago

17:21.433 --> 17:23.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and have since encountered
on several occasions.

17:23.967 --> 17:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He and his family have
repeatedly been threatened
because of his outspoken
pro-refugee stance.

17:29.667 --> 17:30.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ERIC KEMPSON, Volunteer:
This is very dangerous.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We are going to lose people.

17:33.133 --> 17:36.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You could see, it took
so long to come here,
and they're sitting on
the boat, they're soaking

17:36.967 --> 17:38.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wet, they're freezing cold.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The temperature
is close to zero.

17:40.167 --> 17:44.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you have a few people
holding two towns to ransom
because they don't want refugees

17:46.500 --> 17:49.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
in there, this is
absolutely disgusting,
absolutely disgusting.

17:49.367 --> 17:52.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
People are going to die
here this winter because
of these few people.

17:52.600 --> 17:57.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Dimitris
Drakolias has been on
the receiving end of
anti-migrant hostility.

17:57.267 --> 18:00.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He runs a hotel in the
small resort of Petra.

18:00.267 --> 18:05.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Local hard-liners
blockaded the village and
whipped up an Internet
campaign after he agreed

18:06.867 --> 18:08.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to provide temporary
accommodation for
22 refugee children.

18:08.933 --> 18:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIMITRIS DRAKOLIAS, Hotelier:
People got afraid that we were
supposed to bring refugees here

18:14.500 --> 18:16.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and stay for three --
two, three, four months.

18:16.733 --> 18:19.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a very
uncomfortable situation.

18:19.767 --> 18:24.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nobody came up to me and do
anything, but I can understand
that they didn't like that

18:26.733 --> 18:29.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
that I hosted 20 kids
inside the hotel.

18:29.767 --> 18:33.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Did
you feel intimidated?

18:33.033 --> 18:35.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DIMITRIS DRAKOLIAS:
A little bit.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.033 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
A little bit.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
hotelier says the Internet
campaign was orchestrated
by a tourist organization

18:39.333 --> 18:41.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
called The Other Aegean.

18:41.500 --> 18:45.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We arranged an interview
with The Other Aegean's
chairman, Nikos Molvalis
(ph), who only wanted

18:45.967 --> 18:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to discuss the tourist
industry's 70 percent
losses and other problems.

18:50.800 --> 18:55.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have been talking to the
owner of the Clara Hotel, who
says that your organization was

18:55.167 --> 19:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
responsible for blockading
the place to make sure that
refugees didn't turn up there.

19:01.067 --> 19:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Can you explain that, please?

19:02.300 --> 19:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WOMAN: He doesn't want
to talk about that.

19:05.033 --> 19:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Why don't
you want to talk about that?

19:07.733 --> 19:10.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WOMAN: Because he's already
answered the question.

19:10.167 --> 19:12.667 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT:
Off-camera, Molvalis
claimed to have intervened
on behalf of the refugee

19:12.667 --> 19:14.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
children.

19:14.167 --> 19:15.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, he said there
would have been bloodshed.

19:15.100 --> 19:16.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REV.

19:16.533 --> 19:19.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FATHER CHRISTOFOROS
SCHUFF: This is not true.

19:19.067 --> 19:21.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The
tension troubles Father
Christoforos, who believes
some of the volunteers

19:21.900 --> 19:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't fully understand the
plight of the islanders.

19:24.533 --> 19:26.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REV.

19:26.033 --> 19:27.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
FATHER CHRISTOFOROS SCHUFF:
I see people are affected.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And I understand why
they are affected.

19:29.267 --> 19:33.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Their pocketbooks hurting
and they want to find
somewhere to put the blame.

19:33.500 --> 19:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But at the same time, a lot
of these same people will not
only blame the refugees or

19:40.500 --> 19:44.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the organizations, but they
also blame the government just
as much for not doing more.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: The numbers of
people arriving on the islands
are just a fraction of the

19:51.400 --> 19:55.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
thousands that were
landing daily when the
crisis was at its peak.

19:55.800 --> 20:00.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there is a steady trickle,
and, slowly, slowly, the
islands are filling up again.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There's a serious shortage of
accommodation for these people.

20:03.400 --> 20:08.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And there's genuine concern
here that Europe's deal with
Turkey will break down, and once

20:08.233 --> 20:13.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
again the islands
will be inundated with
refugees and migrants.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The influx increases
the pressure in Moria,
the overcrowded and
tense camp in the south

20:18.233 --> 20:22.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of the island visited by the
pope earlier in the year.

20:22.500 --> 20:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Frustrated migrants, angry
at conditions and the time it
takes to process asylum claims,

20:28.667 --> 20:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
have, on occasions, set
fires inside the camp.

20:31.933 --> 20:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A Muslim charity has established
a feeding station just outside
Moria, claiming the camp

20:38.033 --> 20:39.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
caterers are cheating
the residents.

20:39.700 --> 20:43.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MAN: Food in Moria, they
recook it three times,
two to three times.

20:43.633 --> 20:44.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is what they say.

20:44.767 --> 20:45.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's not eatable.

20:45.833 --> 20:47.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they say it's dirty.

20:47.567 --> 20:48.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MAN: Moria, no good.

20:48.767 --> 20:49.767 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Here, good.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
We want freedom.

20:51.400 --> 20:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Here, the food delicious,
and Moria not delicious.

20:54.433 --> 20:56.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MAN: Moria is like a jail.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Not good.

20:58.700 --> 21:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the situation is really
bad, really a lot of problems,
calls -- every day fight,

21:04.600 --> 21:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
every night fight.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Fire.

21:06.600 --> 21:07.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Fight.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
MAN: Fire.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
A lot of problems.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Not everyone
is enduring spartan conditions.

21:12.633 --> 21:17.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Along with 200 other vulnerable
people, five members of the
Nikzad family are living in

21:19.100 --> 21:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a holiday hotel run by the
Catholic charity Caritas.

21:22.100 --> 21:27.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sahil is desperately
missing regular school.

21:28.500 --> 21:31.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But in three months, he has
made good progress with English.

21:31.000 --> 21:35.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SAHIL NIKZAD, Refugee:
In Afghanistan, the
Taliban, I can't go to
school because explosions,

21:38.733 --> 21:41.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
a bomb.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We want to go to some
good place, good country,
because,there, we learned
-- we go to school.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We have a good home.

21:53.000 --> 21:57.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MALCOLM BRABANT: Every
new arrival who survives
the perilous crossing
shares the same ambition.

21:59.067 --> 22:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
As the numbers mount, their
chances of success diminish.

22:02.400 --> 22:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The warm welcome of Skala
Sikaminia goes cold as soon
as they leave the village.

22:07.367 --> 22:12.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The buzzword in Europe is
deportation, especially
after an Islamist
terrorist used a truck to

22:13.367 --> 22:16.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
kill 12 people in Berlin.

22:16.167 --> 22:20.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This year, more migrants than
ever before died trying to
cross the Mediterranean to

22:20.833 --> 22:21.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Europe.

22:21.833 --> 22:24.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Yet still they come.

22:24.067 --> 22:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Father Christoforos may be a
lighthouse, but much of Europe
wishes that his beam would

22:28.833 --> 22:30.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
be extinguished.

For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Malcolm Brabant in Lesbos.

22:37.067 --> 22:42.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Stay with us.

22:46.367 --> 22:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour":
the legacy of pop star George
Michael; a conversation with

22:50.733 --> 22:55.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Israel's best-known novelist;
and a saxophonist describes what
he calls the music of freedom

22:56.367 --> 22:58.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and wonder.

22:58.100 --> 23:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But first: It was yet
another bloody holiday
weekend in Chicago.

23:01.633 --> 23:06.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Five more people were shot
this morning, bringing the toll
since Friday afternoon to nearly

23:06.100 --> 23:08.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
50.

23:08.100 --> 23:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Eleven people were killed,
and Chicago is now set to
pass 700 homicides this year.

23:13.533 --> 23:15.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's a level not seen
there since the late '90s.

23:15.667 --> 23:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police said much of the violence
was clustered in areas with
historical gang problems on

23:19.467 --> 23:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the South and West Sides.

23:21.433 --> 23:25.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And police Superintendent
Eddie Johnson said at a news
conference today that the nature

23:25.400 --> 23:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of those disputes is changing.

23:27.100 --> 23:30.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
EDDIE JOHNSON, Chicago
Police Superintendent:
Here's the bottom line.

23:30.167 --> 23:35.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, with the technology we have
in place, social media drives
a lot of our gang disputes.

23:37.133 --> 23:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're on Facebook, on
Instagram, on Twitter
disrespecting each other.

23:38.233 --> 23:40.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They will live-stream
disrespects.

23:40.267 --> 23:42.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when they do that, they
go out there and look for
them, and they get them.

23:46.267 --> 23:48.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So it's not just drugs anymore.

23:48.067 --> 23:50.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's petty disputes.

23:50.000 --> 23:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: That
problem was one of several big
challenges that the "NewsHour"'s

23:53.633 --> 23:56.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
John Yang heard about
when he reported there
earlier this summer.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He also examined what is
being done to combat it.

23:59.300 --> 24:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
For some context, back
then, there were roughly
200 fewer homicides in
Chicago at that time.

24:05.433 --> 24:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Here's a second
look at his report.

24:07.600 --> 24:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On this busy street
corner in Englewood, one of the
hardest-hit neighborhoods on the

24:14.633 --> 24:17.467 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
city's troubled South Side,
it looks like a party.

24:17.467 --> 24:19.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Kids are playing.

24:19.367 --> 24:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The grill is fired up.

24:22.533 --> 24:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In the past, though, 75th and
Stewart felt like a war zone.

24:24.433 --> 24:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMAR MANASSEH, Mothers Against
Senseless Killings: This
corner is a corner where a

24:27.833 --> 24:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
man was killed -- well,
several men, a woman was
killed, and a child was killed.

24:34.833 --> 24:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A 9-year-old girl was killed
right across the street over
there washing her dog in broad

24:38.100 --> 24:40.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
daylight.

24:40.133 --> 24:44.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But for two summers,
a group called Mothers Against
Senseless Killings, or MASK,

24:46.100 --> 24:49.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
led by Tamar Manasseh, has been
out on this corner, and there
hasn't been a single shooting.

24:52.000 --> 24:55.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Volunteer Laura Lambert (ph)
comes from nearby Hyde Park.

24:55.133 --> 25:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And 91-year-old Edwina Knight
(ph) crosses the street every
day from the house she's

25:00.933 --> 25:02.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
lived in for 57 years.

25:02.133 --> 25:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TAMAR MANASSEH: Just show up.

25:04.233 --> 25:06.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's all you have to do.

25:06.267 --> 25:08.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Show up, grab a lawn chair
and a pair of sunglasses,
and you can do this.

25:08.967 --> 25:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can change the
world with that.

25:11.033 --> 25:15.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: But the moms of
MASK are only on one corner in
a city of 2.7 million people.

25:18.133 --> 25:20.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Killings have
spiked this summer.

25:20.567 --> 25:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chicago has already recorded
more homicides this year than
it did in all of last year.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.767 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

25:27.767 --> 25:29.000 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GARY SLUTKIN, University
of Illinois at Chicago:
This is also very
typical of all epidemics.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You can see the high
density of shootings.

25:31.100 --> 25:35.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: University
of Illinois at Chicago
physician Gary Slutkin
says epidemic is exactly

25:36.900 --> 25:38.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the right word.

25:38.433 --> 25:41.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He argues that violence
is a contagious disease.

25:41.633 --> 25:43.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

25:43.600 --> 25:45.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY SLUTKIN: For example,
you're exposed to flu, you're
more likely to get flu.

25:45.067 --> 25:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You don't actually get
flu without being exposed.

25:47.633 --> 25:50.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Same thing for T.B.,
cholera and violence.

25:50.100 --> 25:54.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, why does someone
who was exposed to child
abuse, abuse their own kids?

25:54.133 --> 25:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That would be the person who
you would think would be least
likely to do it, because he

25:58.233 --> 26:00.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
knows how bad it was.

26:00.167 --> 26:02.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, in fact, he's
picked up this contagious
set of behaviors.

26:02.267 --> 26:07.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: So Dr. Slutkin
treats gun violence as
a contagious disease.

26:09.300 --> 26:12.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He founded Cure Violence, now
an international effort that
trains former gang members and

26:14.000 --> 26:17.667 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
felons to stop violence in its
tracks, violence interrupters.

26:17.667 --> 26:19.733 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
DR.

26:19.733 --> 26:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GARY SLUTKIN: They are always in
the community, aware of what's
going on, and asking families

26:24.833 --> 26:27.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and people, you
know, who's upset?

26:27.267 --> 26:31.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You know, who is -- somebody
slept with someone's
girlfriend, someone was
disrespected, someone

26:32.333 --> 26:33.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
owes somebody money.

26:33.800 --> 26:36.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we can reach those people
with these health workers.

26:36.633 --> 26:39.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They may not look like
health workers to everybody.

26:39.167 --> 26:43.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They know how to cool people
down, know how to buy time,

26:43.333 --> 26:48.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Chicago violence
interrupter Chico Tillmon
knows how to cool people down.

26:48.233 --> 26:52.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He drove us around the South
Side last week, where much
of the violence happens.

26:52.433 --> 26:56.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON, Violence
Interrupter: In early January,
two cliques were arguing.

26:56.967 --> 27:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So one clique went into another
clique's neighborhood and got on
Facebook Live and was like: F.

27:02.433 --> 27:03.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you all.

27:03.433 --> 27:05.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're in your all neighbor.

27:05.067 --> 27:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're in your all gas station.

27:07.333 --> 27:12.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Within 30 minutes, on that
walk from the gas station back
to the house, two were dead,

27:14.433 --> 27:15.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
one was wounded.

27:15.867 --> 27:19.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's not like
this is a gang war over turf.

27:19.933 --> 27:21.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is just sort of...

27:21.133 --> 27:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON: Interpersonal.

27:23.667 --> 27:27.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I said something you
didn't agree with, you
responded negatively, it
ended up in gun violence.

27:29.867 --> 27:34.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Violence interrupter
Ulysses "U.S." Floyd was a
leader in one of Chicago's most

27:34.700 --> 27:37.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
notorious gangs, the
Gangster Disciples.

27:37.333 --> 27:38.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ULYSSES "U.S." FLOYD, Violence
Interrupter: I know I helped
start this mess, so I wanted

27:38.333 --> 27:41.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to help clean it up.

27:41.133 --> 27:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: He told us that
gangs are very different now
than they were in his day.

27:47.600 --> 27:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ULYSSES "U.S." FLOYD: One or
two men control everything.

27:49.300 --> 27:52.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Now you have got a lot
of different little
gangs split all over.

27:52.900 --> 27:56.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They are offsprings of the major
gangs, what they call cliques.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they just do
what they want to do.

27:58.667 --> 28:00.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Ain't nobody really in control,
no structure, no rules.

28:00.933 --> 28:05.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The number of
neighborhoods where Chicago's
branch of Cure Violence operates

28:05.167 --> 28:07.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
varies based on funding.

28:07.333 --> 28:11.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But a Justice Department study
found that, at one point, the
group helped reduce violence

28:11.967 --> 28:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by 40 percent to 70 percent
in some of the areas
where they were operating.

28:18.367 --> 28:22.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Today, they are in only five
of the city's 77 neighborhoods.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On our drive through the
South Side, we saw children
walking home from school.

28:26.233 --> 28:29.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
What do you think when
you look at kids that age?

28:29.267 --> 28:34.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON: I'm praying that
they survive through this --
through this epidemic that's

28:35.000 --> 28:37.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
going on in the city.

28:37.367 --> 28:39.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a Woodlawn problem.

28:39.367 --> 28:41.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's not a South Shore problem.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's everybody's problem.

28:43.467 --> 28:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And we don't understand that
until the disease hits home,
until one of our loved ones is

28:49.033 --> 28:50.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
killed by gun violence.

28:50.267 --> 28:51.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Then we want to get involved.

28:51.800 --> 28:55.867 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Police have seized
6,000 illegal guns this year.

28:55.867 --> 29:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's one every hour,
many from nearby Indiana,
where laws aren't as tough.

29:02.867 --> 29:06.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chicago cops are feeling the
heat, a federal probe of the
use of deadly force and public

29:08.833 --> 29:12.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
trust at a breaking point
after last year's release of a
dash-cam video showing a white

29:14.033 --> 29:18.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
officer fatally shooting
a black teenager 16 times.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After another deadly weekend,
Superintendent Eddie Johnson
virtually threw up his hands.

29:24.833 --> 29:25.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EDDIE JOHNSON: It's
not a police issue.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's a society issue.

29:28.300 --> 29:32.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Impoverished neighborhoods,
people without hope do
these kinds of things.

29:32.100 --> 29:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You show me a man that doesn't
have hope, I show you one
that is willing to pick up

29:35.600 --> 29:38.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a gun and do anything with it.

29:38.067 --> 29:40.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LANCE WILLIAMS, Northeastern
Illinois University: I
really see this problem
as a cultural problem.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Lance Williams
is an associate professor of
urban affairs at Northeastern

29:44.833 --> 29:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Illinois University and an
inner-city youth advocate.

29:47.900 --> 29:49.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LANCE WILLIAMS: This is not
a law enforcement problem.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I mean, you can hire all of
the police that you want.

29:52.333 --> 29:57.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not going to solve this
problem, because these young
men are acting in alignment with

29:58.633 --> 30:00.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their cultural value system.

30:00.833 --> 30:03.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They need a cultural
retooling process.

30:03.333 --> 30:08.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Williams says it's a
culture that's developed in the
absence of working institutions

30:08.167 --> 30:11.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and in the midst of
crushing poverty.

30:11.067 --> 30:14.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
One big cause of
much frustration?

30:14.467 --> 30:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nearly half of black men in
Chicago aged 20 to 24 are not
in school and out of work, far

30:21.467 --> 30:24.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
higher than the national
rate of 32 percent.

30:24.367 --> 30:26.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LANCE WILLIAMS:
There's a lot of rage.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
There's a lot of anger.

30:28.833 --> 30:31.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They just see their lives, you
know, just passing them by.

30:31.700 --> 30:33.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They don't -- they
haven't been to school.

30:33.233 --> 30:35.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They're not qualified for jobs.

30:35.233 --> 30:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are no viable businesses
in their neighborhood, so
they're really depressed.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.767 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And then they're self-medicating
through drinking and drugging.

30:42.767 --> 30:47.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And the only individuals
around them are other
young African-American
males like themselves

30:49.800 --> 30:52.367 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
who have these -- these
same forms of depression.

30:52.367 --> 30:57.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Another
structural factor playing
into the violence, Chicago
is one of the nation's

30:57.867 --> 30:59.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
most segregated cities.

30:59.900 --> 31:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LANCE WILLIAMS: All of the
poor blacks live way, way, way,
way away from affluent people,

31:06.867 --> 31:09.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from the business district,
from the tourist district.

31:09.233 --> 31:13.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, you have some kids in
these neighborhoods far south
that have never been downtown.

31:13.567 --> 31:15.567 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

31:15.567 --> 31:19.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have folks in the
white communities who have
never been to the South Side.

31:19.167 --> 31:22.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what happens is, you
have an out-of-sight,
out-of-minute kind of deal.

31:22.367 --> 31:24.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: I was 23
when I went to prison.

31:24.833 --> 31:29.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: For Chico Tillmon,
who spent 16 years and three
months in federal prison,

31:31.767 --> 31:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
violence is never out of sight
or mind, turning other people's
lives around after turning

31:37.800 --> 31:39.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
his own around.

31:39.867 --> 31:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON: Being able to see
all the violence and chaos in
the community that I once was

31:45.800 --> 31:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
a part of, and that I once
helped produce, pushed me or
gave me an obligation to make

31:51.433 --> 31:52.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a change.

31:52.733 --> 31:53.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Since you
got out of prison...

31:53.800 --> 31:55.067 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes.

31:55.067 --> 31:56.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: ... you got
your bachelor's degree.

31:56.133 --> 31:57.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes, sir.

31:57.367 --> 31:58.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: You got
your master's degree.

31:58.200 --> 31:59.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes, sir.

31:59.433 --> 32:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: You're
working on your Ph.D.

32:00.333 --> 32:01.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes, sir.

32:01.833 --> 32:03.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: How long, how many
years are we talking about here?

32:03.100 --> 32:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHICO TILLMON: Five years.

32:04.100 --> 32:05.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Pretty determined.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes.

32:06.133 --> 32:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Pretty motivated.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHICO TILLMON: Yes, sir.

32:09.567 --> 32:13.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I got out with a purpose, and
I got out trying to not only do
something that was beyond what

32:16.400 --> 32:20.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I believed I could do, but to
inspire hope within all the
people that I left behind in

32:20.767 --> 32:22.800 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
prison.

32:22.800 --> 32:26.767 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Back on the corner
of 75th and Stewart, Tamar
Manasseh is also determined

32:27.500 --> 32:29.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that change will happen.

32:29.567 --> 32:33.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TAMAR MANASSEH: It's going to
take a lot of people all doing
something, not saying something,

32:34.567 --> 32:36.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but doing something
to fix that problem.

32:36.533 --> 32:38.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And the doing something
is the sitting here.

32:38.400 --> 32:40.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's the sitting here,
having a conversation.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I live on this block with you.

32:41.933 --> 32:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I live in this city with you.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I live in this country with you.

32:44.700 --> 32:46.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we're all affected
by the same things.

32:46.800 --> 32:50.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, sometimes, when we don't
talk to each other, when we
don't interact, we miss that.

32:50.900 --> 32:55.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: On one
corner, a small effort in
response to a big problem.

32:57.367 --> 32:59.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang in Chicago.

32:59.800 --> 33:04.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As
a postscript to John's
story, there are some
more unfortunate numbers

33:04.633 --> 33:06.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to report.

33:06.633 --> 33:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This weekend's shootings brings
the overall total to more than
4,000 people shot in 2016.

33:12.700 --> 33:15.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Also, there have been
an additional 2,000
guns confiscated by
the police since John's

33:16.667 --> 33:17.667 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
report.

33:17.667 --> 33:19.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The rate is about the same.

33:19.700 --> 33:23.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It averages a little less
than one gun confiscated
every hour this year.

33:28.133 --> 33:33.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fans today are mourning the loss
of singer and musician George
Michael and paying tribute

33:38.300 --> 33:42.167 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to him as one of pop's biggest
stars of the '80s and '90s.

33:42.167 --> 33:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Michael shot to fame as a
member of the duo Wham! and then
launched a hugely successful

33:45.933 --> 33:47.933 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
solo career.

33:47.933 --> 33:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His friend Elton John called
him -- quote - - "the kindest,
most generous soul and a

33:51.400 --> 33:53.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
brilliant artist."

33:53.300 --> 33:56.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, for all of his
success, Michael faced
personal struggles as well.

33:56.500 --> 34:00.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He died on Christmas Day
at his home in Oxfordshire,
England, at the age of 53.

34:00.200 --> 34:02.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Let's begin with this
remembrance by Angus Walker of
Independent Television News.

34:02.833 --> 34:03.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ANGUS WALKER: His songs,
his voice, his stunning
success, George Michael,
singer, writer, producer,

34:03.767 --> 34:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
perhaps the perfect pop star.

34:05.733 --> 34:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Just 21, he wrote Wham!'s
breakthrough single, topping
the charts in the U.K. and U.S.

34:07.233 --> 34:08.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He and Andrew Ridgeley had
met at school near Watford.

34:08.733 --> 34:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Their brand of bouncy pop
was carefree, colorful.

34:09.933 --> 34:11.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Wham! soon sold more
than 25 million records.

34:11.967 --> 34:14.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
World-famous, their crafty
manager secured a 1985 tour
to China, the first glimpse of

34:14.000 --> 34:16.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Western pop culture for
a country emerging from a
brutal cultural revolution.

34:16.067 --> 34:17.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
His solo career began
with another number
one hit, new image, new
fans, multiple awards,

34:17.967 --> 34:19.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
100 million records sold,
making him one of bestselling
artists of all time.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But it wasn't just his
music attracting attention.

34:21.433 --> 34:23.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After being arrested for a
so-called lewd act in a public
toilet in L.A., he responded

34:23.467 --> 34:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with a cheeky, defiant video,
came out as gay, speaking
openly about having hundreds

34:24.133 --> 34:26.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of lovers.

34:26.133 --> 34:27.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
GEORGE MICHAEL, Musician: I
have been doing this on and
off since I was a teenager, and

34:27.067 --> 34:28.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
never once seen violence.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have not cheated or
lied about my sex life.

34:29.533 --> 34:31.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ANGUS WALKER: He also
admitted heavy drug use.

34:31.600 --> 34:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Arrested after crashing his car
while intoxicated near his North
London home, he was sent to

34:32.400 --> 34:34.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
jail for eight weeks.

34:34.967 --> 34:36.133 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Five years ago, he came
close to death, spending
10 days in hospital,
suffering from pneumonia.

34:36.133 --> 34:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
2016, another
superstar leaves us.

34:38.333 --> 34:39.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: One
of Michael's important
legacies over time was
how he eventually came

34:39.567 --> 34:41.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
out and dealt with his
sexuality and identity.

34:41.100 --> 34:42.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tim Teeman wrote about that
and more on The Daily Beast.

34:42.033 --> 34:44.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He joins me now from New York.

34:44.133 --> 34:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tim, before we get into that
issue of his sexuality, I
wonder if we could just talk

34:45.600 --> 34:46.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a little bit about George
Michael as a musician.

34:46.833 --> 34:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
TIM TEEMAN, The
Daily Beast: Yes.

34:48.833 --> 34:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: When you look
back at his career, where do
you put him in the pantheon

34:49.500 --> 34:51.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of pop stars?

34:51.133 --> 34:53.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
TIM TEEMAN: Oh, I put
him -- personally, I
put him right up there.

34:53.200 --> 34:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, if you grew up in
England -- and I'm sure he was
very famous over here as well

34:55.300 --> 34:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with Wham! and later on as a
solo singer -- but if you grew
up in England in the '70s and

34:57.433 --> 34:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
'80s, as I did, he, along with
Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet
and Culture Club, Boy George,

34:58.600 --> 35:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
these were big, totemic
cultural figures.

35:00.700 --> 35:01.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Wham!, as Angus Walker
described in his report there,
were -- they were almost the

35:01.967 --> 35:03.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
harbingers, the heralds
of Thatcherism himself.

35:03.933 --> 35:05.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The group was very
anti-Thatcher, famously
anti-Thatcher, but
their brand of pop and

35:05.933 --> 35:08.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the kind of aspiration and
the brightness of that pop
was radical and revolutionary.

35:08.067 --> 35:10.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Britain, at that point in
the early '80s, emerging from
a period of sort of late '70s

35:12.267 --> 35:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
gray industrial decline,
this was the kind of pop that
heralded the big, brash '80s.

35:15.700 --> 35:19.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And look at George's hair, look
at his clothes in that time.

35:19.300 --> 35:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And those songs, you either
-- as I say in my article for
The Daily Beast, you either

35:23.533 --> 35:27.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
hit the dance floor, and you
just flailed like a windmill
dancing crazily at them, and

35:27.867 --> 35:32.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then for the slower songs,
those slower songs still are
the songs that are at weddings,

35:32.567 --> 35:35.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
the last song of the
night, people weeping on
each others' shoulder.

35:35.267 --> 35:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They are slow dances.

35:37.033 --> 35:38.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And they have remained.

35:38.633 --> 35:40.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And they have transcended.

35:40.700 --> 35:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If they were considered cheesy
-- and they were considered
slightly cheesy back in the

35:43.500 --> 35:45.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day -- they have stood
the test of time.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Look at "Last Christmas."

35:48.500 --> 35:52.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"Last Christmas" is
right up there with "Have
Yourself a Merry Little
Christmas" as a Christmas

35:52.100 --> 35:54.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cultural classic.

35:54.200 --> 35:58.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As we heard
in that report, George Michael
was rather rudely forced out

35:58.067 --> 36:00.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of the closet by this
arrest back in the '90s.

36:00.867 --> 36:05.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And up until that point,
he had been rather quiet
about his sexuality.

36:05.033 --> 36:09.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
I wonder if you have a
sense of why he wanted
to keep that to himself.

36:09.267 --> 36:14.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM TEEMAN: I think, sometimes,
especially now, with the
acceleration of cultural change

36:16.233 --> 36:20.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and acceptance, as it's known,
I think we sometimes forget
what those times were like

36:22.167 --> 36:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
back in the '80s and even
into the '90s, before he was
forced out of the closet.

36:25.033 --> 36:30.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
These were not times of large
numbers of celebrities of any
kind out of the closet at all.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You might remember, in the
very late '90s, Ellen's coming
out over here was a big, big

36:35.333 --> 36:37.300 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
cultural moment.

36:37.300 --> 36:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And so I sometimes think we
forget how, in those days,
coming out of the closet, if you

36:43.733 --> 36:46.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
were famous, and, in fact,
coming out of the closet if you
were anybody was a very brave,

36:46.367 --> 36:48.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
wonderful act.

36:48.900 --> 36:51.267 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Harvey Milk, the wonderful
Harvey Milk, had it
exactly right when he
said the most important

36:51.267 --> 36:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and wonderful thing an LGBT
person could do was come out.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It was the most powerful
statement they could make.

36:57.133 --> 37:01.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, the interesting thing about
George Michael is that, yes,
he kept it quiet, though it

37:01.300 --> 37:06.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
always -- I remember growing
up in the era of tabloid bait
and insinuation around stars

37:07.467 --> 37:09.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
like George Michael
and his sexuality.

37:09.333 --> 37:10.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He did play equality concerts.

37:10.967 --> 37:14.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He donated and sang at
HIV and AIDS benefits.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
While he was in the closet, he
fell in love for the first time.

37:17.433 --> 37:22.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And his first lover died
in 1993 of an AIDS-related
brain hemorrhage.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So he had a gay life,
and he was coming to
terms with something
himself in that period.

37:28.933 --> 37:31.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And he talked later on about the
complexity of his own sexuality.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Maybe he wasn't ready.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Maybe there were
commercial concerns.

37:35.133 --> 37:39.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But then, in 1998, as you say,
and as Angus Walker said in his
report that you just played,

37:39.100 --> 37:41.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
came this arrest in Los Angeles.

37:41.567 --> 37:45.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And George Michael's completely
fantastic, wonderfully
defiant, mischievous response

37:45.733 --> 37:50.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to that, which wasn't the usual
contrite, yes, I have been
bad, I have a few personal

37:52.600 --> 37:56.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
issues -- it was to release
a pop song which proudly
celebrated sexuality and also...

37:57.633 --> 37:58.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
This was "Outside."

37:58.433 --> 37:59.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
TIM TEEMAN: Sorry.

37:59.367 --> 38:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
This was "Outside," absolutely.

38:00.233 --> 38:02.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You're right, yes.

38:02.333 --> 38:06.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It was a song that not only
proudly celebrated sexuality,
but also proudly and defiantly

38:08.467 --> 38:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
aimed itself squarely at law
enforcement, which famously
for years and years in your

38:11.433 --> 38:16.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
country and in Britain as well
would entrap gay men in public
lavatories just to arrest

38:17.967 --> 38:20.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
them, the use of
pretty policemen, we
called it in Britain.

38:20.100 --> 38:24.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in this video, George
skewers it all and also, if you
listen to the lyrics, celebrates

38:24.933 --> 38:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
defiantly his own
sexuality, which he spoke
about in later years.

38:30.800 --> 38:31.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He liked having public sex.

38:31.833 --> 38:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He spoke about it openly.

38:33.233 --> 38:34.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He had lovers.

38:34.333 --> 38:35.467 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He fell in love.

38:35.467 --> 38:36.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He had commitment issues.

38:36.467 --> 38:38.567 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
He was horny.

38:38.567 --> 38:42.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He talked about all these things
in his song, and occasionally
in wonderful public interviews,

38:43.600 --> 38:45.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which I talk about
in my article.

38:45.600 --> 38:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You said that
the culture has changed quite
a bit since that notorious

38:50.200 --> 38:52.267 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
arrest.

38:52.267 --> 38:55.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Do you think, if the next
George Michael is coming along
and knows his sexuality, that

38:55.000 --> 38:58.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
he could be more comfortable
today being who he is?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
TIM TEEMAN: That's a very
interesting question.

39:00.267 --> 39:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I have been talking about
that with colleagues today.

39:02.733 --> 39:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I think we like to think
things have moved on.

39:05.533 --> 39:10.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think, for a certain level
of celebrity, I think things
have moved on, and I think

39:11.267 --> 39:13.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
careers are continuing.

39:13.300 --> 39:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You look at Neil Patrick Harris,
you look at Ellen, there are
some people who are excelling.

39:16.667 --> 39:20.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's wonderful, and it's
a demonstration of how far we
have come and how far we like

39:20.600 --> 39:22.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to think we have come.

39:22.533 --> 39:25.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then you look at the
top tier maybe of the music
industry and you look at the top

39:25.533 --> 39:30.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
tier of Hollywood, and
there it remains, at
that very top tier, fear,
prejudice, a self-patrolling

39:34.367 --> 39:37.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
closet on the part
of celebrities and
their representation.

39:37.700 --> 39:42.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think we have yet to
really breach that sort of top,
top, A-list film star, music

39:43.500 --> 39:44.867 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
star moment.

39:44.867 --> 39:46.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's happening.

39:46.100 --> 39:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
There are more stars
out than ever before.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we should be
happy about that.

39:49.900 --> 39:54.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I would hope, in the
future, that the example
of George Michael and the
openness and fierceness

39:56.267 --> 40:00.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and the defiance and the
mischief and the big smile and
the joy he took in some parts

40:02.333 --> 40:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of his life and what he tried
to convey to us in music and
how he spoke about it all

40:04.533 --> 40:09.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
in interviews, I hope
that younger stars and
even established stars
who haven't felt able

40:11.500 --> 40:13.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to come out will look at that
and think, he did it, and he
did it with such style, and

40:13.900 --> 40:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
such fierceness and with
such grace, let's do it.

40:16.233 --> 40:19.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All
right, Tim Teeman of The
Daily Beast, thanks for
this lovely remembrance.

40:19.867 --> 40:23.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM TEEMAN: Thank you so much.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Now to
the "NewsHour" Bookshelf
for a novel about Israel
by its internationally

40:50.233 --> 40:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
renowned writer, Amos Oz.

40:52.333 --> 40:56.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He joined Jeffrey Brown at the
Center for Jewish History in
New York, in a conversation

40:56.233 --> 40:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
recorded before the recent U.N.
vote on Israeli settlements.

40:59.833 --> 41:04.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: The 1950s, the
early years of the state of
Israel, a time of hope for

41:06.800 --> 41:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jews who'd seen a dream
come true, and fear about
what the future might bring.

41:11.100 --> 41:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMOS OZ, Author, "Judas": This
is the period of my own youth.

41:13.433 --> 41:17.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And these were, in terms
of Israeli history, the
years of the morning after.

41:17.867 --> 41:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: So the country's
still young, but the question
is, what now or what next?

41:22.133 --> 41:27.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMOS OZ: The question is what
now, but the question is also,
have we gone wrong somewhere?

41:28.267 --> 41:29.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Have we taken the
wrong turn someplace?

41:29.933 --> 41:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Amos Oz was
born in Jerusalem in 1939.

41:34.500 --> 41:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He spent many years living on a
kibbutz, served in the Israeli
army, and eventually became

41:40.367 --> 41:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
his country's best known writer.

41:42.600 --> 41:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
His new novel, "Judas," his
first in more than a decade,
is set in Jerusalem in those

41:47.533 --> 41:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
early years, the story of three
people at very different stages
in their lives and attitudes

41:53.467 --> 41:55.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
toward the new state.

41:55.833 --> 41:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
AMOS OZ: I wanted to explore,
first and foremost, how
three totally different
human beings lived

42:01.767 --> 42:06.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
for three months in the
same room, change and
almost reshape one another.

42:06.067 --> 42:11.067 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Do you start
with the notion of going back
to this period of what might

42:12.433 --> 42:13.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
come next, or do you
start with the characters?

42:13.233 --> 42:14.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How does it happen?

42:14.467 --> 42:15.767 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMOS OZ: Always
characters first.

42:15.767 --> 42:17.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Always?

42:17.800 --> 42:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMOS OZ: And I walk around
pregnant with the characters
for a long time before I write

42:20.700 --> 42:22.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a single sentence.

42:22.733 --> 42:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And when, inside my head or
inside my guts, the characters
begin to do things to each

42:28.233 --> 42:30.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
other, what they do to
each other is the plot.

42:30.967 --> 42:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And then I can start writing.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do we do to one another?

42:34.933 --> 42:39.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the one and only subject of
literature, if you really have
to squeeze it in a nutshell.

42:39.433 --> 42:43.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Betrayal is
a key theme in this book, in
the ancient sense, through one

42:43.967 --> 42:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of the character's studies of
the biblical story of Jesus and
Judas, and in modern Israel's

42:50.500 --> 42:51.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
founding.

42:51.700 --> 42:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The
title is "Judas," right?

42:52.500 --> 42:54.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMOS OZ: Yes.

42:54.533 --> 42:56.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: And this all
begins, I gather, out of an
interest of yours in the life of

42:56.733 --> 42:58.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Jesus.

42:58.833 --> 43:02.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMOS OZ: Yes, but also out of
huge, growing resentment to
the ugly story about Judas,

43:05.500 --> 43:10.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
about the 30 pieces of silver,
about the most notorious case in
history about the God killing.

43:12.567 --> 43:17.567 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In some point in the novel,
the protagonist, Shmuel Ash,
who is obsessed with his story,

43:18.667 --> 43:22.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he writes about Judas
hanging himself.

43:22.033 --> 43:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Thus died the first
Christian and last Christian,
the only Christian.

43:28.067 --> 43:29.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's a very
provocative sentence.

43:29.400 --> 43:30.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It doesn't come from me.

43:30.533 --> 43:32.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It comes from the protagonist.

43:32.567 --> 43:36.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But it's trying to reconsider
the worst story ever told
by anyone in human history.

43:40.367 --> 43:45.367 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Amos Oz has been
a strong critic of Israel's
occupation of the West Bank and

43:47.433 --> 43:51.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
a longtime advocate for
a two-state solution
with the Palestinians.

43:51.900 --> 43:55.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's made him a traitor in the
eyes of some of his countrymen.

43:55.100 --> 43:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMOS OZ: I wear these as a
badge of honor, because it
puts me in wonderful company.

43:59.933 --> 44:04.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Many, many great men and women
in history, prophets, statesmen,
intellectuals, artists,

44:07.500 --> 44:12.067 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
were accused of treason by many
of their own contemporaries.

44:12.067 --> 44:16.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: What is the
job or role of a writer
in a country like Israel?

44:16.533 --> 44:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
AMOS OZ: I resent the
very term role of writers
or role of literature.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I'm sorry.

44:24.633 --> 44:26.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think the right term should
be the gift of literature,
not the role of literature.

44:26.700 --> 44:27.867 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: The gift?

44:27.867 --> 44:30.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
AMOS OZ: Yes.

44:30.000 --> 44:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Makes us look one more time
at some things which we have
seen a million times, and we

44:37.300 --> 44:39.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
see them afresh.

44:39.333 --> 44:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or, sometimes, it makes us
reconsider things that we were
sure we knew or we were sure

44:45.833 --> 44:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we were convinced of.

44:47.400 --> 44:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: But
is it different in a
country such as Israel?

44:50.033 --> 44:52.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMOS OZ: I don't think so, no.

44:52.667 --> 44:54.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't think so.

44:54.733 --> 44:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think literature is based
on the deep human need to hear
stories and to tell stories.

45:02.500 --> 45:07.167 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It doesn't have to
serve any other purpose.

45:07.167 --> 45:12.167 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Oz's most famous
story may be his own, the
2004 autobiographical novel

45:14.200 --> 45:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
"A Tale of Love and Darkness,"
which has now been made into
a film by the actress Natalie

45:18.567 --> 45:20.600 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Portman.

45:20.600 --> 45:24.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a tragic family story of
a mother who commits suicide,
leaving behind her young

45:26.033 --> 45:29.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
son, and also a story of
a country in its early
years of statehood.

45:29.833 --> 45:34.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have advocated a two-state
idea long before it was a
diplomatic solution, right?

45:36.467 --> 45:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Is that two-state solution dead?

45:39.900 --> 45:41.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMOS OZ: I don't think so.

45:41.933 --> 45:44.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I don't see any alternative
to the two-state solution.

45:44.600 --> 45:49.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It is 50 years now
since I and a few of my
colleagues first advocated
the two-state solution.

45:52.200 --> 45:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Fifty years is a long time
in my life, but it's a
very short time in history.

45:56.800 --> 45:58.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Look, it's very simple.

45:58.400 --> 46:03.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are two nations rightly
claiming the same tiny land.

46:04.600 --> 46:07.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They just don't trust the other.

46:07.800 --> 46:11.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is a lack of courageous
leadership on both sides.

46:11.300 --> 46:16.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, it's like a patient
knowing that he has to undergo
a surgery, wanting to postpone

46:18.067 --> 46:19.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
it because it's painful.

46:19.667 --> 46:21.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But the doctors are cowards.

46:21.333 --> 46:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They don't have the guts to tell
the patient, let's do it now.

46:24.500 --> 46:25.667 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The sooner, the better.

46:25.667 --> 46:27.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: You
still have hope for it?

46:27.267 --> 46:29.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
AMOS OZ: Of course, because
I see no alternative.

46:29.800 --> 46:33.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: All right, Amos
Oz, the new novel is "Judas."

46:33.300 --> 46:37.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

46:37.100 --> 46:42.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
AMOS OZ: Thank
you for having me.

46:43.700 --> 46:47.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you very much.

46:47.467 --> 46:51.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM:
Finally tonight, another
in our music series.

46:51.700 --> 46:56.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Jazz musician Charles Lloyd
plays the tenor saxophone,
and he recently caught up with

46:56.267 --> 46:58.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"NewsHour" producer
Frank Carlson.

46:58.533 --> 47:03.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHARLES LLOYD, Musician: In
my mind's ear, I have always
heard a beautiful sound.

47:09.467 --> 47:14.467 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I keep, all my life,
practicing and playing,
trying to get close to it.

47:20.900 --> 47:25.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, sometimes, the creator
will let me get just
so close, but it's like
the carrot-on-the-stick

47:34.967 --> 47:39.967 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
phase, you know,
not yet, Charles.

47:43.233 --> 47:47.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Charles Lloyd.

47:47.400 --> 47:52.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I have been drunk with
music all my life.

47:53.867 --> 47:57.967 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was born in Memphis, and I
heard this beautiful music.

48:02.333 --> 48:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I would walk down the street in
my neighborhood, and coming out
of every house, I could hear

48:09.200 --> 48:12.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Billie Holiday, Lester
Young, Count Basie, you know,
Charlie Parker, on and on.

48:21.367 --> 48:26.367 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
So, the music is
fueling the atmosphere.

48:26.967 --> 48:31.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Why jazz?

48:31.533 --> 48:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's the music of wonder,
freedom and wonder.

48:39.833 --> 48:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And played by the great
players, the individual
truth, the personal truth
becomes the universal

48:47.267 --> 48:49.367 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
truth.

48:49.367 --> 48:53.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
What I have been doing
all my life is making
a parallel between the
beauties of the eternal

48:57.733 --> 49:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
verities that come through
the music and spiritual life.

49:01.133 --> 49:06.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think what we do is that
we come through here, we sing
our song, nobody knows us, and

49:10.100 --> 49:14.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
we're gone.

49:14.200 --> 49:19.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But in the music, I can get up
there and find this paradise
that I'm trying to describe.

49:25.267 --> 49:30.267 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: On the
"NewsHour" online right now:
2016 was a year of much turmoil,

49:39.500 --> 49:41.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
loss and division.

49:41.600 --> 49:45.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But as we prepare for
yet another trip around
the sun in 2017, enjoy
our list of undeniably

49:47.167 --> 49:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
good things that happened
over the course of the year.

49:49.433 --> 49:54.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All that and more is on our
Web site, PBS.org/NewsHour.

49:55.467 --> 49:57.467 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's the
"NewsHour" for tonight.

49:57.467 --> 50:00.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Tuesday, we have the first
in a series of conversations
highlighting some of the

50:00.233 --> 50:04.867 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
best in the arts in 2016,
including television,
movies and books.

50:04.867 --> 50:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Join us online and again
here tomorrow evening.

50:07.600 --> 50:09.267 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm William Brangham.

50:09.267 --> 50:13.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
For all of us at the
"PBS NewsHour," thank
you, and good night.
