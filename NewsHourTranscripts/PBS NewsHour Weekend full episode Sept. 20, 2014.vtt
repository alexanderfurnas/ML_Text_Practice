03:45.892 --> 03:47.094
FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES

CONTINUE TO SCOUR THE HEAVILY

03:48.962 --> 03:50.564
WOODED AREA FOR FROOEN.

03:52.933 --> 03:53.733
BRIEFLY GOT INSIDE THE WHITE

03:57.304 --> 03:58.038
42-YEAR-OLD OMAR GONZALEZ,

03:58.038 --> 03:59.172
RACING ACROSS THE WHITE HOUSE

03:59.172 --> 04:01.108
LAWN AFTER HE SCALED THE FENCE

04:01.108 --> 04:01.875
SURROUNDING THE BUILDING.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.443
HE EVENTUALLY MADE IT INSIDE

04:03.443 --> 04:05.278
BEFORE HE WAS TACKLED BY

04:05.278 --> 04:06.713
SECURITY AND APPREHENDED.

04:06.713 --> 04:07.914
THE INCIDENT OCCURRED A SHORT

04:07.914 --> 04:09.015
TIME AFTER THE PRESIDENT AND HIS

04:09.015 --> 04:11.284
TWO DAUGHTERS HAD LEFT FOR CAMP

04:11.284 --> 04:11.618
DAVID.

04:11.618 --> 04:12.552
THE FIRST LADY HAD TRAVELED

04:12.552 --> 04:14.254
THERE EARLIER.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.589
GONZALES REPORTEDLY WAS UNARMED.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.824
AND THE ACTRESS AND SINGER

04:17.824 --> 04:18.658
POLLY BERGEN HAS DIED.

04:18.658 --> 04:20.093
DURING A CAREER THAT SPANNED

04:20.093 --> 04:21.828
SOME 60 YEARS, BERGEN STARRED IN

04:21.828 --> 04:23.497
THE MOVIES INCLUDING THE

04:23.497 --> 04:25.532
ORIGINAL "CAPE FEAR," ON

04:25.532 --> 04:27.167
BROADWAY, AND ON TELEVISION.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.602
SHE BRIEFLY HAD HER OWN MUSICAL

04:28.602 --> 04:29.870
VARIETY SHOW, AND WAS A REGULAR

04:29.870 --> 04:31.838
ON THE GAME SHOW "TO TELL THE

04:31.838 --> 04:32.305

04:37.010 --> 04:37.577
HOUSEWIVES."

04:37.577 --> 04:37.677
THE.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.713
SHE FOUNDED A BEAUT PRODUCT

04:39.713 --> 04:39.880
COMPANY.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.248
SHE SAID IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT

04:41.248 --> 04:42.482
AT FIRST BECAUSE, "EVERYBODY

04:42.482 --> 04:44.317
CONSIDERED ME JUST ANOTHER

04:44.317 --> 04:45.852
BUBBLE-HEADED ACTRESS."

04:45.852 --> 04:54.728
POLYBERGEN WAS 84.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.230
TURNING NOW TO YET ANOTHER MAJOR

04:57.230 --> 04:58.565
SECURITY BREACH AT ONE OF

04:58.565 --> 04:59.733
AMERICA’S LARGEST RETAILERS,

04:59.733 --> 05:01.334
THIS TIME AT HOME DEPOT.

05:01.334 --> 05:03.803
WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHY CAN’T

05:03.803 --> 05:07.374
HACKERS BE STOPPED.

05:07.374 --> 05:09.509
FOR MORE WE’RE JOINED BY MICHAEL

05:09.509 --> 05:11.545
RILEY A REPORTER WITH BLOOMBERG.

05:11.545 --> 05:12.579
WHAT HAPPENED AT HOME DEPOT?

05:12.579 --> 05:13.747
>> IT WASN’T THAT DIFFERENT THAN

05:13.747 --> 05:15.215
WHAT HAPPENED AT TARGET.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.283
BASICALLY THE HACKERS GOT INTO

05:16.283 --> 05:18.852
THE NETWORK AND WERE ABLE TO USE

05:18.852 --> 05:21.755
HOME DEPOT’S OWN SYSTEM TO PUT

05:21.755 --> 05:22.522
MALWARE ON THE SYSTEM.

05:22.522 --> 05:24.291
WHEN YOU WENT INTO HOME DEPOT

05:24.291 --> 05:25.559
AND SWIPED THE CARD, THEY WERE

05:25.559 --> 05:27.527
STEALING THE CARD ALMOST AS

05:27.527 --> 05:29.296
QUICKLY AS HOME DEPOT WAS

05:29.296 --> 05:29.696
GETTING IT.

05:29.696 --> 05:30.630
>> Sreenivasan: AFTER SEEING

05:30.630 --> 05:31.598
WHAT HAPPENED TO TARGET-- THIS

05:31.598 --> 05:33.533
IS A COMPANY WITH 80 BILLION IN

05:33.533 --> 05:34.634
REVENUE, 2,000-PLUS STORES IN

05:34.634 --> 05:35.969
THE U.S., DIDN’T THEY LEARN FROM

05:35.969 --> 05:36.069
IT?

05:36.069 --> 05:37.204
>> YEAH, THAT’S THE THING.

05:37.204 --> 05:38.538
IT’S ONE THING TO BE TARGET AND

05:38.538 --> 05:39.573
WATCH THIS HAPPEN IN A

05:39.573 --> 05:40.574
RELATIVELY NEW KIND OF ATTACK.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.442
IT’S ANOTHER THING TO BE HOME

05:42.442 --> 05:44.077
DEPOT, WATCH TARGET GET TAKEN

05:44.077 --> 05:45.745
DOWN, LOT OF THEM LOSE 40

05:45.745 --> 05:47.113
MILLION CREDIT CARDS, NOT

05:47.113 --> 05:50.684
ELSEWHERE, OR NOT LEARN NUF TO

05:50.684 --> 05:52.452
ACT ACT QUICKLY SO IT DOESN’T

05:52.452 --> 05:53.987
HAPPEN TO YOU.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.689
HOME DEPOT DIDN’T SEEM TO TAKE

05:55.689 --> 05:57.624
THE STEPS, QUICKLY ENOUGH,

05:57.624 --> 05:57.724
ANYWAY.

05:57.724 --> 05:59.326
IN ONE CASE THEY BOUGHT AN

05:59.326 --> 06:01.861
ENCRYPTION SYSTEM TO ENCRYPT THE

06:01.861 --> 06:04.564
DATA FROM THE REMSTER, BUT THEY

06:04.564 --> 06:06.132
DIDN’T INSTALL IT UNTIL SIX,

06:06.132 --> 06:07.567
SEVEN DAYS AGO.

06:07.567 --> 06:08.235
>> Sreenivasan: COMPARE THIS

06:08.235 --> 06:09.336
TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.

06:09.336 --> 06:11.238
WE DON’T HEAR ABOUT THESE THINGS

06:11.238 --> 06:13.073
HAPPENING IN EUROPE AND ASIA AS

06:13.073 --> 06:13.173
MUCH.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.041
>> EUROPE AND ASIA, JUST ABOUT

06:15.041 --> 06:17.077
ANY ADVANCED ECONOMY USED A

06:17.077 --> 06:18.578
CREDIT CARD WITH THE CHIP IN IT.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.046
IT DOESN’T MAKE IT HARDER TO

06:20.046 --> 06:20.714
STEAL THE DATA.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.249
IT MAKES IT HARDER TO MAKE MONEY

06:22.249 --> 06:23.116
FROM THE DATA.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.451
WHAT THE CHIP IN THE CARD DOES,

06:24.451 --> 06:26.987
THE WAY THE ECOSYSTEM WORKS, YOU

06:26.987 --> 06:28.622
STEAL THE CREDIT CARDS, SELL

06:28.622 --> 06:30.590
THEM TO PEOPLE, THEY CREATE A

06:30.590 --> 06:32.792
FAKE CARD GINTO BEST BUY, BUY A

06:32.792 --> 06:34.494
GIANT TV-- WHATEVER IT IS-- BUT

06:34.494 --> 06:36.029
IT’S MUCH HARDER TO CREATE A

06:36.029 --> 06:38.398
FAKE CARD IF IT HAS A CHIP IN

06:38.398 --> 06:38.598
IT.

06:38.598 --> 06:40.600
ANYTHING WITH A CHIP IN IT MAKES

06:40.600 --> 06:41.868
IT HARDER FOR THIEVES TO MAKE

06:41.868 --> 06:43.036
MONEY OFF THE DATA.

06:43.036 --> 06:43.637
>> Sreenivasan: THIS IS ALSO

06:43.637 --> 06:44.938
IN A CLIMATE WHERE THE CONSUMERS

06:44.938 --> 06:47.374
ARE GETTING A BIT FED UP, JUST

06:47.374 --> 06:49.142
SAYING WHERE DID MY CREDIT CARD

06:49.142 --> 06:51.778
GET USED AND THEN WHAT WAS THAT

06:51.778 --> 06:53.613
STORE THAT GOT HACKED AND HOW DO

06:53.613 --> 06:54.514
I KEEP TRACK OF ALL THIS?

06:54.514 --> 06:56.449
>> IT’S ONE HACK AFTER THE NEXT

06:56.449 --> 06:58.051
AND I THINK-- I MEAN, I THINK

06:58.051 --> 06:59.152
ONE OF THE THINGS WE SAW IN

06:59.152 --> 07:00.620
TARGET IT WAS CHRISTMAS SEASON

07:00.620 --> 07:02.322
HACK, AND CUSTOMERS STOPPED

07:02.322 --> 07:04.024
GOING TO THE STORES NOW I DON’T

07:04.024 --> 07:05.692
KNOW IF THAT’S GOING TO HAPPEN

07:05.692 --> 07:07.327
TO HOME DEPOT.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.662
IT MAY BE THEY HANDLED IT

07:08.662 --> 07:08.928
DIFFERENTLY.

07:08.928 --> 07:09.963
IT MAY BE THAT IT’S JUST A

07:09.963 --> 07:11.898
DIFFERENT KIND OF CUSTOMER.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.433
BUT I THINK GENERALLY, RETAIL

07:13.433 --> 07:14.868
BRANDS ARE TAKING HITS BECAUSE

07:14.868 --> 07:17.504
THEY’RE NOT PROTECTING STIEWRMS’

07:17.504 --> 07:18.104
DATA.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.439
IT’S SOMETHING YOU WALK INTO A

07:19.439 --> 07:20.373
STORE, YOU BUY SOMETHING, YOU

07:20.373 --> 07:22.509
EXPECT THE STORE TO PROTECT YOUR

07:22.509 --> 07:22.709
DATA.

07:22.709 --> 07:23.677
THAT CLEARLY ISN’T HAPPENING.

07:23.677 --> 07:24.911
>> Sreenivasan: THIS ALSO

07:24.911 --> 07:26.079
SEEMS TO BE WE ARE IN A

07:26.079 --> 07:27.013
DIFFERENT POINT IN THE EVOLUTION

07:27.013 --> 07:28.815
OF HOW WE TRANSACT BUSINESS.

07:28.815 --> 07:29.716
>> RIGHT.

07:29.716 --> 07:30.383
>> Sreenivasan: CREDIT CARDS

07:30.383 --> 07:31.918
CAME AROUND SAYING IT’S SO MUCH

07:31.918 --> 07:33.820
MORE SECURE THAN WALK AROUND

07:33.820 --> 07:35.755
WITH BIG WADS OF CASH AND NOW

07:35.755 --> 07:37.290
THE CARDS SEEM TO BE GETTING

07:37.290 --> 07:39.092
REPLACED BY OUR FONZ WITH

07:39.092 --> 07:40.260
N.F.C., OR OTHER TECHNOLOGY,

07:40.260 --> 07:41.528
MAYBE THE APPLE PAY THING.

07:41.528 --> 07:44.164
HOW QUICKLY IS THE U.S. MOVING

07:44.164 --> 07:46.800
TOWARDS KIND DIGITAL CURRENCIES

07:46.800 --> 07:48.301
OR PUTTING THE CHIPS IN THE

07:48.301 --> 07:48.735
CARDS?

07:48.735 --> 07:50.370
>> SO NEXT YEAR BASICALLY THE

07:50.370 --> 07:51.471
U.S. IS SCHEDULED TO START TO

07:51.471 --> 07:53.340
CATCH UP WITH THE REST OF THE

07:53.340 --> 07:54.774
WORLD AND TRANSITION TO

07:54.774 --> 07:56.376
BASICALLY A CHIP SYSTEM IN THEIR

07:56.376 --> 07:57.043
CREDIT CARDS.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.212
THE BANKS AND THE RETAILERS HAVE

07:59.212 --> 08:01.915
GOTTEN TOGETHER AND SAID, LOOK,

08:01.915 --> 08:04.217
WE’RE GOING TO SET OCTOBER OF

08:04.217 --> 08:06.286
NEXT YEAR, 2015, AS A DEADLINE

08:06.286 --> 08:07.687
WHERE LIABILITY WILL SHIFT TO

08:07.687 --> 08:12.926
WHICHEVER SIDE OF THE EQUATION

08:12.926 --> 08:14.461
DOESN’T ALLOW THE CHIP

08:14.461 --> 08:14.694
TRANSACTION.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.563
SO IT’S RETAILERS DON’T HAVE THE

08:16.563 --> 08:17.931
READERS IN THEIR STORES THAT CAN

08:17.931 --> 08:19.232
READ THE CHIPS, AND THEY GET

08:19.232 --> 08:20.934
HACKED, THE LIABILITY IS ON

08:20.934 --> 08:21.067
THEM.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.769
IF BANKS DON’T PUT THE CHIPS IN

08:22.769 --> 08:23.937
THEIR CARDS AND THE RETAILER

08:23.937 --> 08:25.572
GETS HACKED, THE LIABILITY IS ON

08:25.572 --> 08:25.705
THEM.

08:25.705 --> 08:27.006
IT’S GOING TO CREATE A LOT OF

08:27.006 --> 08:27.974
INCENTIVE TO SHIFT OVER.

08:27.974 --> 08:29.142
AND THAT COULD EXPLAIN WHAT’S

08:29.142 --> 08:30.176
GOING ON NOW.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.511
THIS OF THERE SEEMS TO BE KIND

08:31.511 --> 08:33.713
OF A FEEDING FRENZY.

08:33.713 --> 08:35.782
YOU’RE SEEING A LOT OF RETAIL

08:35.782 --> 08:35.915
HACKS.

08:35.915 --> 08:38.218
IT MAY BE THEY SEE THIS AS THEIR

08:38.218 --> 08:39.352
LAST OPPORTUNITY BEFORE THE

08:39.352 --> 08:40.253
TRANSITION TAKES PLACE.

08:40.253 --> 08:41.788
>> Sreenivasan: AND YOU HAVE

08:41.788 --> 08:43.823
PEOPLE VICTIMS OF THE IDENTITY

08:43.823 --> 08:46.025
THEFT WHICH IS THE WORST CASE.

08:46.025 --> 08:47.027
>> CREDIT CARD NUMBERS ARE NOT

08:47.027 --> 08:48.728
THE ONLY DATA THESE GUYS ARE

08:48.728 --> 08:48.762
STEALING.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.763
IN THE CASE OF TARGET, FOR

08:49.763 --> 08:51.564
EXAMPLE, THEY TOOK A LOT OF

08:51.564 --> 08:53.166
PERSONAL DATA AS WELL-- NAMES,

08:53.166 --> 08:54.534
ADDRESSES-- A THE LOT OF THINGS

08:54.534 --> 08:56.035
THESE RETAILERS STORE UP.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.571
TARGET WAS REALLY GOOD AT

08:58.571 --> 09:00.573
TARGETING SPECIFIC KIND OF SALES

09:00.573 --> 09:03.576
AND MERCHANDISING ADS TO THEIR

09:03.576 --> 09:04.878
CUSTOMERS BUT ALL THAT IS BASED

09:04.878 --> 09:06.746
ON A HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA THAT

09:06.746 --> 09:08.081
THEY COLLECT FROM THEIR

09:08.081 --> 09:09.783
CUSTOMERS AS THEY MOVE AROUND

09:09.783 --> 09:11.518
THE STORES, AS THEY SWIPE THEIR

09:11.518 --> 09:13.086
CARDS, AS THEY SEND THEM STUFF,

09:13.086 --> 09:14.387
AND ALL OF THAT IS IN THEIR

09:14.387 --> 09:15.755
DATABASES. THE HACKERS, IF EVEN

09:15.755 --> 09:17.457
THEY CAN’T GET THE CARD, CAN

09:17.457 --> 09:18.124
STEAL THAT. >> Sreenivasan:

09:18.124 --> 09:19.292
MICHAEL RILEY OF BLOOMBERG,

09:19.292 --> 09:28.568
THANKS SO MUCH. >> YOU BET.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.911
THE SALE OF CANNABIS FOR

09:37.911 --> 09:38.645
RECREATIONAL USE HAS BEEN LEGAL

09:38.645 --> 09:39.779
THERE FOR NINE MONTHS NOW,

09:39.779 --> 09:40.547
LEADING TO THE CREATION OF

09:40.547 --> 09:41.448
THOUSANDS OF JOBS AND GENERATING

09:41.448 --> 09:42.215
MILLIONS IN TAX REVENUE EVERY

09:42.215 --> 09:44.317
MONTH.

09:44.317 --> 09:44.684
BUT SOME COLORADANS SEE SIGNS OF

09:44.684 --> 09:46.386
TROUBLE.

09:46.386 --> 09:48.154
THEY WORRY THAT THE LEGALIZATION

09:48.154 --> 09:50.190
OF THE DRUG HAS NOT ELIMINATED

09:50.190 --> 09:51.791
THE UNDERGROUND MARKET FOR IT,

09:51.791 --> 09:52.325
ESPECIALLY IN MINORITY

10:01.901 --> 10:03.336
BARELY KEEP UP WITH THE DEMAND

10:03.336 --> 10:05.805
FOR HIS PRODUCT THESE DAYS.

10:05.805 --> 10:07.407
HE SAYS HE CAN’T IMAGINE A MORE

10:07.407 --> 10:08.475
EXCITING AND LUCRATIVE INDUSTRY

10:08.475 --> 10:10.643
TO BE IN RIGHT NOW.

10:10.643 --> 10:11.144
BUT THE BUZZ IS ALL COMING FROM

10:11.144 --> 10:13.046
CAPITALISM.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.081
HE DOESN’T EVEN LIKE CANNABIS.

10:15.081 --> 10:16.282
>> I TRIED EVERY FEW YEARS JUST

10:16.282 --> 10:16.683
TO PROVE TO MYSELF I STILL DON’T

10:16.683 --> 10:20.854
LIKE IT.

10:20.854 --> 10:21.821
YOU KNOW, IT JUST AFFECTS ME

10:21.821 --> 10:23.490
VERY POORLY.

10:23.490 --> 10:24.324
>> Reporter: WHEN HE STARTED HIS

10:24.324 --> 10:25.859
BUSINESS A FEW YEARS AGO,

10:25.859 --> 10:26.459
WILLIAMS COULD ONLY SELL MEDICAL

10:26.459 --> 10:28.394
MARIJUANA.

10:28.394 --> 10:29.562
THAT PUT HIM IN POSITION TO BE

10:29.562 --> 10:30.964
ONE OF THE FIRST TO SELL

10:30.964 --> 10:32.198
RECREATIONAL CANNABIS WHEN IT

10:32.198 --> 10:34.234
BECAME LEGAL THIS YEAR.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.135
BUSINESS HAS BEEN SO GOOD THAT

10:36.135 --> 10:37.837
WILLIAMS IS ABOUT TO HIRE THREE

10:37.837 --> 10:39.372
DOZEN NEW EMPLOYEES AND RAMP UP

10:43.743 --> 10:46.846
IS, AS FAR AS I’M CONCERNED.

10:46.846 --> 10:48.615
YOU ARE MANUFACTURING MARIJUANA.

10:48.615 --> 10:51.651
THIS IS AN INDUSTRIAL

10:51.651 --> 10:52.252
MANUFACTURING PLANT THAT GROWS

10:52.252 --> 10:53.953
MARIJUANA.

10:53.953 --> 10:55.555
>> Reporter: STORES LIKE THESE

10:55.555 --> 10:56.856
CAN NOW SELL UP TO AN OUNCE OF

10:56.856 --> 10:58.124
MARIJUANA TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE

10:58.124 --> 10:59.859
21 AND OVER.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.996

11:20.914 --> 11:22.882
OF DOLLARS A MONTH ON THOSE

11:22.882 --> 11:24.484
PRODUCTS, BUT WILLIAMS IS SURE

11:24.484 --> 11:25.518
THERE’S A LOT MORE MONEY TO BE

11:25.518 --> 11:28.121
MADE IN HIS BUSINESS.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.189
>> YOU KNOW, I DID THIS SO THAT

11:30.189 --> 11:31.524
MY FAMILY CAN BE SET UP FOR

11:31.524 --> 11:32.392
THEIR REST OF THEIR LIVES.

11:32.392 --> 11:34.694
RIGHT NOW, I ALREADY KNOW OF

11:34.694 --> 11:36.896
SOME BLUE CHIP COMPANIES THAT

11:36.896 --> 11:37.897
ARE ON THE... ON THE START LINE.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.499
THEY’RE GOING TO COME AND BUY

11:39.499 --> 11:40.733
PEOPLE UP, AND, QUITE HONESTLY,

11:40.733 --> 11:42.335
I WANT TO BE ONE OF THOSE GUYS.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.269
>> Reporter: ONE OF THE BENEFITS

11:43.269 --> 11:44.604
ATTACHED TO LEGALIZATION WAS

11:44.604 --> 11:46.573
THAT IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE

11:46.573 --> 11:48.608
BLACK MARKET, BUT THAT MARKET IS

11:48.608 --> 11:50.710
STILL THRIVING, ACCORDING TO A

11:50.710 --> 11:52.011
39-YEAR-OLD MARIJUANA GROWER WHO

11:52.011 --> 11:53.947
ASKED US TO CALL HIM JOHN DOE

11:53.947 --> 11:54.981
AND TO CONCEAL HIS IDENTITY

11:54.981 --> 11:56.049
BECAUSE HE SELLS ON THE

11:56.049 --> 11:58.284
UNDERGROUND MARKET.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.752
THE ILLEGAL TRADE IS DOING

11:59.752 --> 12:01.688
ESPECIALLY WELL IN BLACK AND

12:01.688 --> 12:03.356
LATINO COMMUNITIES, AND HE SAYS

12:03.356 --> 12:04.490
IT WORKS THE SAME WAY IT DID

12:04.490 --> 12:07.093
WHEN POT WAS ILLEGAL.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.227
>> YOU HAVE THAT ONE GUY, THAT

12:08.227 --> 12:09.395
GUY THAT SHINES, THAT’S THE

12:09.395 --> 12:11.364
ROBIN HOOD OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.365
THIS MAN SUPPLIES A LITTLE

12:12.365 --> 12:13.533
GHETTO AREA.

12:13.533 --> 12:14.934
SIMPLE AS THAT.

12:14.934 --> 12:17.270
BREAKS HIS OWN POUND INTO LITTLE

12:17.270 --> 12:19.505
OUNCES AND HELPS EVERYBODY IN

12:19.505 --> 12:19.772
HIS COMMUNITY, SO THEY CAN

12:19.772 --> 12:20.940
AFFORD IT WITH HIM.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.308
THAT’S HOW IT’S HAPPENED.

12:22.308 --> 12:22.976
>> Reporter: YEAH.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.477
AND THAT’S HOW IT HAPPENED

12:24.477 --> 12:25.378
BEFORE, TOO.

12:25.378 --> 12:26.312
>> YEAH.

12:26.312 --> 12:26.980
YEAH.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.247
NOTHING’S CHANGED.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.415
>> Reporter: JOHN DOE SAYS LOW-

12:29.415 --> 12:30.984
INCOME BUYERS TURN TO THE BLACK

12:30.984 --> 12:32.552
MARKET BECAUSE PRICES ARE HIGHER

12:32.552 --> 12:34.454
AT LEGAL RETAIL STORES.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.322
THERE’S CONFLICTING INFORMATION,

12:36.322 --> 12:37.657
BUT AN OUNCE OF POT ON THE BLACK

12:37.657 --> 12:38.424
MARKET CAN COST AS LITTLE AS

12:38.424 --> 12:40.994
$180.

12:40.994 --> 12:42.595
AT THE STORE ANDY WILLIAMS OWNS,

12:42.595 --> 12:43.963
YOU HAVE TO PAY AROUND $240 FOR

12:43.963 --> 12:46.332
AN OUNCE.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.968
THAT’S PARTLY BECAUSE THE PRICE

12:48.968 --> 12:51.971
INCLUDES A 15% EXCISE TAX, A 10%

12:51.971 --> 12:54.374

12:54.374 --> 12:54.807
TAX AND DENVER’S MARIJUANA SALES

12:54.807 --> 12:56.976
TAX.

12:56.976 --> 12:57.677
>> THE TAXES ARE AN OVERREACH

12:57.677 --> 13:00.513
AND EXCESSIVE.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.447
AND IT’S A REGRESSIVE TAX, AND

13:01.447 --> 13:03.449
IT IMPACTS THE POOR MOST.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.984
>> Reporter: LARISA BOLIVAR WAS

13:04.984 --> 13:05.852
INVOLVED IN THE FIGHT TO MAKE

13:05.852 --> 13:06.419
MARIJUANA LEGAL FOR MEDICAL

13:06.419 --> 13:08.054
PURPOSES.

13:08.054 --> 13:08.554
SHE USES IT HERSELF TO TREAT

13:08.554 --> 13:11.290
STRESS.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.692
SHE CAMPAIGNED FOR LEGALIZATION,

13:12.692 --> 13:13.326
BUT SHE DOESN’T LIKE HOW IT’S

13:13.326 --> 13:15.328
WORKING OUT.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.529
SHE BELIEVES ALL THOSE TAXES

13:16.529 --> 13:19.232

13:19.232 --> 13:21.467
BUT TAXES HAVE BEEN BENEFICIAL,

13:21.467 --> 13:22.568
ACCORDING TO MASON TVERT, WHO

13:22.568 --> 13:24.537
ALSO CAMPAIGNED FOR LEGALIZATION

13:24.537 --> 13:25.204
AND HELPED DRAFT THE STATE’S

13:25.204 --> 13:27.540
REGULATIONS.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.676
IN THE FIRST SEVEN MONTHS, THOSE

13:29.676 --> 13:30.710
TAXES HAVE GENERATED $24 MILLION

13:30.710 --> 13:32.679
IN REVENUE.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.047
A CHUNK OF THAT IS SLATED FOR

13:34.047 --> 13:36.315
PUBLIC SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.284
BESIDES, HE SAYS, THE LEGAL

13:38.284 --> 13:40.053
MARKET OFFERS SOME THINGS THAT

13:40.053 --> 13:41.421
CONSUMERS FIND MORE IMPORTANT

13:41.421 --> 13:43.690
THAN THE LOWEST PRICE.

13:43.690 --> 13:46.025
>> VARIETY, CONVENIENCE, SAFETY-

19:33.506 --> 19:35.074
RIGHT NOW AND IT WILL BE AMAZING

19:35.074 --> 19:36.275
TO SEE THE FALLOUT BECAUSE IT

19:36.275 --> 19:38.511

AN INFLUENCE ON WHAT HAPPENS TO

19:46.385 --> 19:48.087
NOT JUST THESE SPECIFIC INCIDENT

19:48.087 --> 19:49.021

ABOUT.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.426
THERE ARE KIND OF ROCK-SOLID

19:53.426 --> 19:57.063
DEALS WITH THESE SPONSORS.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.436
THEY CAN’T IPVEST IT IN

VIEWERS ARE NOT THERE.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.906
THEY’RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THE

LAST SECOND.

20:08.174 --> 20:11.744
DID GOODELL ORDER A COVER-UP,

20:11.744 --> 20:14.713
DID THEY SEE THE NEW VIDEO.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.848

HAD TANGIBLE, AWFUL THINGS HE

20:19.452 --> 20:21.020
DID AND THEN PULL IT.

20:21.020 --> 20:21.687
I DON’T FEEL LIKE THEY’RE GOING

20:21.687 --> 20:23.222
TO PULL IT JUST BECAUSE OF

20:23.222 --> 20:24.256
SOCIAL MEDIA PRESSURE OR WHETHER

20:24.256 --> 20:25.524
IT’S HURTING THEIR BRAND TO BE

20:25.524 --> 20:26.425
ASSOCIATED WITH IT BECAUSE

20:26.425 --> 20:27.259
THAT’S SHORT TERM.

20:27.259 --> 20:30.062
THESE DEALS ARE SIX, SEVEN-YEAR

20:30.062 --> 20:31.697
DEALS WORTH OVER $1 WELL IN A

20:31.697 --> 20:32.731

HAVE PROFITED HANDSOMELY UNDER

20:39.438 --> 20:40.172
THE GOODELL YEARS.

20:40.172 --> 20:43.476
>> YEAH, IT’S A $9

20:43.476 --> 20:44.443
BILLION-A-YEAR BUSINESS.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.212
FRANCHISE VALUES ARE AN ALL-TIME

20:46.212 --> 20:46.312
HIGH.

20:46.312 --> 20:47.646
ONE THING THAT HELPED GOODELL

20:47.646 --> 20:49.515
WAS LAST WEEK, THE BUFFALO

20:49.515 --> 20:52.985
BILLS, A MIDTIER MARKET, MIDTIER

20:52.985 --> 20:57.323
TEAM SOLD FOR $1.4 BILLION.

20:57.323 --> 20:58.958
IF YOU DON’T HAVE ONE OF THE

20:58.958 --> 21:00.993
MARQUEE TEAMS YOU’RE SAYING

21:00.993 --> 21:02.261
WHATEVER HAPPENS I’M GOING TO

21:02.261 --> 21:04.563
GET $1.4, $1.5 BILLION OUT OF

21:04.563 --> 21:05.464
THE DEAL.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.366
THEY LIKE ROGER GOODELL.

21:07.366 --> 21:09.468
DO THEY THINK HE’S WORTH $44

21:09.468 --> 21:10.736
MILLION-- HIS MOST RECENT

21:10.736 --> 21:11.604
SALARY-- I DON’T KNOW.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.771
BUT THEY DON’T WANT TO FIND OUT.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.306
THEY DON’T WANT TO EXPERIMENT

21:14.306 --> 21:15.341
AND FIND OUT HE WAS THE GLUE

21:15.341 --> 21:16.775
THAT WAS HOLDING IT ALL

21:16.775 --> 21:16.942
TOGETHER.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.611
THEY’RE GOING TO TAKE A "WAIT

21:18.611 --> 21:20.946
AND SEE "APPROACH LIKE THE

21:20.946 --> 21:21.113
ADVERTISERS.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.615
SO MUCH IS AT STAKE.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.150
THEY’RE NOT GOING TO DO IT BASED

21:24.150 --> 21:26.118
ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR EXPERIMENT

21:26.118 --> 21:26.285
PRESSURES.

21:26.285 --> 21:26.852
>> Sreenivasan: IS THERE

21:26.852 --> 21:28.487
EVIDENCE THAT MERCHANDISE SALES

21:28.487 --> 21:32.491
ARE DECLINING AT STADIUMS ANDS

21:32.491 --> 21:32.992
BECAUSE OF THIS?

21:32.992 --> 21:36.028
>> NO AND THE MOST RECENT SUNDAY

21:36.028 --> 21:38.264
RATINGS WERE STAGNANT OR UP FROM

21:38.264 --> 21:38.731
LAST YEAR.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.633
THE SUNDAY NIGHT GAME LAST WEEK

21:40.633 --> 21:42.301
WAS UP 8% FROM THE YEAR BEFORE.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.736
THERE REALLY IS NO EVIDENCE IT’S

21:43.736 --> 21:45.871
HURTING THE LEAGUE ON THE FIELD.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.173
LOOK, FANTASY FOOTBALL AND

21:47.173 --> 21:48.240
OFFICE POOLS AND GETTING

21:48.240 --> 21:49.508
TOGETHER WITH YOUR FRIENDS--

21:49.508 --> 21:50.976
THOSE ARE THE REASONS PEOPLE

21:50.976 --> 21:52.144
LIKE FOOTBALL AND SHE THOSE

21:52.144 --> 21:53.379
HAVEN’T BEEN AFFECTED THROUGHOUT

21:53.379 --> 21:54.280
THIS WHOLE THING.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.047
>> Sreenivasan: KEVIN CLARK,

21:55.047 --> 21:56.215
REPORTER FROM THE "WALL STREET

21:56.215 --> 21:58.284
JOURNAL" WHO COVERS FOOTBALL.

21:58.284 --> 21:58.817
THANKS SO MUCH.

21:58.817 --> 22:00.252
JOIN US ON-AIR AND ONLINE

22:00.252 --> 22:00.986
TOMORROW.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.154
WE’LL REPORT FROM HUNGARY,

22:02.154 --> 22:03.522
WHERE A FAR-RIGHT PARTY IS

22:03.522 --> 22:05.591
GAINING GROUND BY PROMISING TO

22:05.591 --> 22:09.128
CRACK DOWN ON CRIME BY GYPSIES.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.130
>> THERE WERE SO MANY POLICEMEN

22:11.130 --> 22:12.431
YOU COULDN’T MOVE.

22:12.431 --> 22:13.832
THEY JUST KEPT SAYING, "OUT,

22:13.832 --> 22:14.633
OUT."

22:17.269 --> 22:19.471
>>THIS IS PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND,

22:19.471 --> 22:20.673
SATURDAY.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.012
>> Sreenivasan: BY A TWO-TO-ONE

22:27.012 --> 22:28.714
MARGIN, AMERICANS DISAPPROVE OF

22:28.714 --> 22:29.848
THE WAY THE N.F.L. HAS HANDLED

22:29.848 --> 22:30.416
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE INCIDENTS

22:30.416 --> 22:31.717
INVOLVING ITS PLAYERS.

22:31.717 --> 22:33.452
THIS, ACCORDING TO A POLL

22:33.452 --> 22:33.852
CONDUCTED BY NBC NEWS AND MARIST

22:33.852 --> 22:35.020
COLLEGE.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.288
EARLIER THIS WEEK, THE

22:36.288 --> 22:37.823
NEWSHOUR’S STUDENT REPORTING

22:37.823 --> 22:39.191
LABS TEAM ASKED HIGH SCHOOL

22:39.191 --> 22:40.759
STUDENTS FOR THEIR REACTIONS TO

22:40.759 --> 22:41.360
THE RAY RICE INCIDENT AND OTHERS

22:41.360 --> 22:42.828
LIKE IT.

22:42.828 --> 22:44.263
THEY ALSO ASKED IF PROFESSIONAL

22:44.263 --> 22:46.031
ATHLETES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED

22:46.031 --> 22:48.100
ROLE MODELS.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.768
>> WHEN I SAW THAT VIDEO OF RAY

22:49.768 --> 22:50.903
RICE, I, ACTUALLY... SOMEBODY

22:50.903 --> 22:51.303
SENT ME THE VIDEO, AND I WATCHED

22:51.303 --> 22:54.006
IT.

22:54.006 --> 22:56.976
AND I... I THINK THE RIGHT WORD

22:56.976 --> 22:58.377
WAS, LIKE, APPALLED.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.545
>> MY REACTION WHEN I SAW RAY

22:59.545 --> 23:01.146
RICE LAY HIS HANDS ON HIS

23:01.146 --> 23:03.182
FIANCÉE, IT WAS SHOCKING.

23:03.182 --> 23:03.949
>> BEING AN ATHLETE, WE LOOK UP

23:03.949 --> 23:05.985
TO THESE GUYS.

23:05.985 --> 23:08.087
AND UNFORTUNATELY THE ROLE THEY

23:08.087 --> 23:11.023
PLAY, IT PUTS A HUGE TARGET ON

23:11.023 --> 23:15.828
THEM TO BE GOOD ROLE MODELS, YOU

23:15.828 --> 23:16.161
KNOW, NOT ONLY ON AND OFF THE

23:16.161 --> 23:16.662
FIELD.

23:16.662 --> 23:17.529
KIND OF MAKES YOU WONDER, ARE

23:17.529 --> 23:18.497
THESE GUYS THAT ARE BEING PUT IN

23:18.497 --> 23:19.665
THE SPOTLIGHT WORTH BEING LOOKED

23:19.665 --> 23:20.666
UP TO?

23:20.666 --> 23:21.333
>> NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, I

23:21.333 --> 23:23.235
THINK ANY TYPE OF VIOLENCE,

23:23.235 --> 23:24.336
ANYTHING THAT A REGULAR PERSON

23:24.336 --> 23:24.903
SHOULD DO, YOU SHOULD ALSO GET

23:24.903 --> 23:25.504
PUNISHED.

23:25.504 --> 23:26.205
NO MATTER IF YOU’RE THE

23:26.205 --> 23:27.740
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

23:27.740 --> 23:30.276
IF YOU’RE A QUARTERBACK FOR THE

23:30.276 --> 23:32.278
N.F.L., IF YOU’RE A KID LIKE US,

23:32.278 --> 23:33.212
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO

23:33.212 --> 23:35.080
WHATEVER YOU DO.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.483
>> UNFORTUNATELY, SOCIETY GIVES

23:37.483 --> 23:38.250
THE IMPRESSION THAT ATHLETES DO

23:38.250 --> 23:40.552
NEED TO BE ROLE MODELS.

23:40.552 --> 23:41.820
HOWEVER, THIS DOES BECOME TRICKY

23:41.820 --> 23:43.022
FOR ATHLETES BECAUSE THEY NEED

23:43.022 --> 23:45.057
TO LEARN HOW TO BALANCE THEIR

23:45.057 --> 23:45.457
PERSONAL LIFE FROM THEIR SPORTS

23:45.457 --> 23:47.259
LIFE.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.594
>> PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES

23:48.594 --> 23:50.195
DEFINITELY HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO

23:50.195 --> 23:52.531
ACT AS ROLE MODELS.

23:52.531 --> 23:53.766
IF YOU ARE PLAYING ON EVERY

23:53.766 --> 23:56.235
SUNDAY ON NATIONAL TELEVISION

23:56.235 --> 23:58.037
AND PEOPLE WATCH YOU, THEN THEY

23:58.037 --> 23:58.537
WILL BEGIN TO LOOK UP TO YOU.

23:58.537 --> 23:59.538
AND WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT,

23:59.538 --> 23:59.872
YOU HAVE TO ACT LIKE A ROLE

23:59.872 --> 24:00.839
MODEL.

24:00.839 --> 24:01.740
>> AT THE END OF THE DAY,

24:01.740 --> 24:02.775
THEY’RE NOT THE ONES WHO

24:02.775 --> 24:04.877
INTERACT WITH YOUR CHILDREN.

24:04.877 --> 24:05.411
IT’S YOU, IT’S TEACHERS, IT’S

24:05.411 --> 24:07.713
EVERYONE ELSE.

24:07.713 --> 24:08.981
SO, SORT OF PUTTING THE BLAME ON

24:08.981 --> 24:10.916
THE PUBLIC FIGURES, MAYBE PEOPLE

24:10.916 --> 24:13.052
SHOULD LOOK AT THEMSELVES FIRST.

24:25.531 --> 24:26.665
>> Sreenivasan: SOME MORE NEWS

24:26.665 --> 24:28.434

24:34.540 --> 24:37.409
AS ISIS MILITANTS ADVANCE ON A

24:37.409 --> 24:38.610
STRATEGIC SYRIAN TOWN.

24:38.610 --> 24:39.912
MEANWHILE, KURDISH FIGHTERS FROM

24:39.912 --> 24:42.181
IRAQ AND TURKEY ARE REPORTEDLY

24:46.585 --> 24:47.886
HOSTAGES FREED TODAY AFTER MORE

24:49.988 --> 24:53.225

24:53.225 --> 24:55.194
GROUP WATCH BEHEADING VIDEOS TO

24:55.194 --> 24:55.627
TRY TO INTIMIDATE THEM.

24:55.627 --> 24:56.528
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

24:56.528 --> 24:57.463
I’M HARI SREENIVASAN.

24:57.463 --> 24:58.564
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.
