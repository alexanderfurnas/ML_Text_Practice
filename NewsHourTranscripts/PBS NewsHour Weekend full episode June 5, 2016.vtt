14:16.767 --> 14:19.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ARMY AND THE MILITIAS?

14:21.400 --> 14:23.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHO IS DOING THE FIGHTING?

14:23.467 --> 14:26.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IT'S A MIXED BAG REALLY.

14:26.367 --> 14:28.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IRAQI ARMY HAS ONLY FIVE

14:28.267 --> 14:29.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FUNCTIONING DIVISIONS ACCORDING

14:29.400 --> 14:30.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO U.S. OFFICERS AND MOST

14:30.733 --> 14:32.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIVISIONS ARE ABOUT 60 TO 65%

14:32.900 --> 14:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAPACITY.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO ON THE GROUND NOW, WHEN

14:36.200 --> 14:38.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FIGHTING HAPPENS, THE IRAQI

14:38.733 --> 14:40.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY HAS BASICALLY A

14:40.567 --> 14:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHORTAGE OF LABOR.

14:41.667 --> 14:43.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE ONE GOOD FIGHTING FORCE

14:43.700 --> 14:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S THERE, THAT'S EFFECTIVE

14:45.433 --> 14:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM THE STATE, IS THE IRAQI

14:47.700 --> 14:49.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPECIAL FORCES.

14:49.067 --> 14:50.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICERS,

14:50.500 --> 14:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THOSE FORCES ARE IN REAL DANGER

14:52.533 --> 14:54.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF BURNING OUT BECAUSE THEY ARE

14:54.833 --> 14:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE ONLY FORCE THE STATE HAS

14:56.133 --> 14:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEEN ABLE TO RELY UPON TIME AND

14:58.300 --> 14:59.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME AGAIN OVER THE LAST TWO

14:59.133 --> 14:59.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YEARS.

14:59.767 --> 15:01.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO THE OTHER FORCE FIGHTING

15:01.533 --> 15:04.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALONGSIDE THE SPECIAL FORCES ARE

15:04.167 --> 15:05.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITIA GROUPS THAT MANY OF THEM

15:05.600 --> 15:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE FUNDED BY IRAN, THEY HAVE

15:09.100 --> 15:12.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARD LINE SECTARIAN IDEOLOGY AND

15:12.100 --> 15:14.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN DEEPLY CONTROVERSIAL.

15:14.600 --> 15:16.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ON THE GROUND, WHAT HAPPENS IS

15:16.000 --> 15:19.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY PLACES NORTH OF BAGHDAD IN

15:19.433 --> 15:23.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREAS LIKE TIKRIT OR BEIJI THAT

15:23.467 --> 15:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY ISRAEL

15:27.700 --> 15:30.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FORCES, THE MILITIAS TAKE OVER.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOCAL OFFICIALS, ORDINARY

15:33.400 --> 15:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITIZENS SEE NOT THE STATE BUT

15:36.367 --> 15:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE MILITIA FORCES AT THE

15:37.900 --> 15:38.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ULTIMATE POWER.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> IN PART OF YOUR STORY YOU

15:40.133 --> 15:42.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ALSO TALK ABOUT THE SUPPLY CHAIN

15:42.000 --> 15:43.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THAT IT'S NOT ALL GETTING TO

15:43.767 --> 15:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE IRAQI ARMY.

15:46.233 --> 15:47.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETIMES THAT THE WEAPONS THAT

15:47.000 --> 15:48.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE UNITED STATES IS SENDING IS

15:48.367 --> 15:49.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ACTUALLY GETTING TO THESE

15:49.867 --> 15:50.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITIAS.

15:50.400 --> 15:53.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WHAT HAS HAPPENED IS AS

15:53.633 --> 15:55.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SUPPLIES GO DOWN THE DEPOT SUCH

15:55.333 --> 15:58.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AS TAJI WHICH IS THE LARGEST

15:58.467 --> 15:59.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WEAPONS WAREHOUSE FOR THE IRAQI

15:59.867 --> 16:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MILITARY IN IRAQ ON BASES LIKE

16:01.900 --> 16:04.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT IF MILITIAS HAVE INFLUENCE

16:04.967 --> 16:06.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHETHER THROUGH CORRUPTION OR

16:06.467 --> 16:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INTIMIDATION THEY CAN TAKE WHAT

16:07.400 --> 16:08.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY WANT.

16:08.433 --> 16:09.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. OFFICERS I'VE SPOKEN TO SAY

16:09.867 --> 16:11.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THERE WAS A HUGE EFFORT

16:11.567 --> 16:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAST SUMMER TO TAMP DOWN ON THIS

16:13.533 --> 16:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND TO STOP IT AND THERE ARE

16:15.033 --> 16:16.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY FEW CASES.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT STILLS STILL CONTINUES.

16:17.400 --> 16:18.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: SO WHAT'S THE

16:18.800 --> 16:20.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. SUPPOSED TO DO IN THIS?

16:20.133 --> 16:22.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> SOME OFFICERS SAY THAT THE

16:22.233 --> 16:23.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AMERICANS ARE NOT THINKING ABOUT

16:23.367 --> 16:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS ENOUGH AND AREN'T DOING

16:25.033 --> 16:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENOUGH POLITICALLY TO PUSH THE

16:26.400 --> 16:27.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEAL AND WHETHER YOU SPEAK WITH

16:27.833 --> 16:30.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
U.S. MILITARY SPOKESMEN THEY'LL

16:30.667 --> 16:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY OUR JOB IS NOT TO POLICE

16:32.600 --> 16:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IRAQ.

16:32.933 --> 16:35.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE MILITARY TRACK MOVERS

16:35.967 --> 16:38.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FAR FASTER THAN THE DIPLOMATIC

16:38.100 --> 16:38.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TRACK.

16:38.767 --> 16:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT THEN IF THE MILITARY TRACK

16:40.633 --> 16:43.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS SHAPING A REALITY ON THE

16:43.367 --> 16:47.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GROUND, THAT IS ONLY FURTHER

16:47.533 --> 16:48.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ANTAGONIZING AND PUSHING SUNNIS

16:48.967 --> 16:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ISLAMIC STATE, THEN IT'S --

16:55.067 --> 16:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S A PROBLEM BECAUSE THE

16:57.367 --> 16:58.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITICAL SOLUTION IS SO FAR

16:58.967 --> 17:01.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:01.067 --> 17:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ON THE BOOKS I MEAN THIS IS

17:44.500 --> 17:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN HEARING

17:45.933 --> 17:46.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ABOUT REALLY ALMOST SINCE

17:46.967 --> 17:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PRESIDENT OBAMA GOT INTO OFFICE.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE NOW?

17:49.367 --> 17:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE BIG DIFFERENCE NOW IS

17:51.200 --> 17:52.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
2013 YOU HAD A SUPREME COURT

17:52.767 --> 17:54.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DECISION, THE SHELBY DECISION.

17:54.367 --> 17:57.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

17:57.067 --> 17:58.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO CLEAR ANY

17:58.600 --> 18:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KIND OF CHANGES TO VOTING LAWS

18:01.367 --> 18:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE.

18:03.733 --> 18:05.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO WE'RE SEEING A LOT MORE

18:05.033 --> 18:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHANGES TO THE LAWS, A LOT MORE

18:07.367 --> 18:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FRICTION OVER THIS ISSUE.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN A NUMBER OF STATES.

18:10.367 --> 18:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT MORE LITIGATION NOW

18:12.500 --> 18:13.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OVER THIS ISSUE.

18:13.667 --> 18:14.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT'S

18:14.367 --> 18:15.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAPPENING IN OHIO THAT'S

18:15.767 --> 18:16.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT THIS CYCLE?

18:16.400 --> 18:19.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> WELL, OHIO HAS A LAW ON ITS

18:19.767 --> 18:22.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOOKS, IT'S HAD THIS LAW ON ITS

18:22.400 --> 18:23.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BOOKS FOR QUITE SOME TIME AND

18:23.567 --> 18:26.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS IS A LAW THAT ESSENTIALLY

18:26.367 --> 18:27.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MEANS IF YOU HAVEN'T VOTED FOR

18:27.733 --> 18:30.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THREE ELECTIONS YOU WOULD

18:30.467 --> 18:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AUTOMATICALLY BE PURGED FROM THE

18:34.033 --> 18:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTER REGISTRATION ROLLS.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS LAW HAS BEEN ON THE BOOKS

18:36.367 --> 18:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR QUITE SOME TIME BUT WHAT'S

18:37.933 --> 18:39.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DIFFERENT THIS YEAR IS YOU

18:39.867 --> 18:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HAD HUGE -- 2008 YOU HAD HUGE

18:43.433 --> 18:45.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TURN OUT, YOU HAD A LARGE NUMBER

18:45.633 --> 18:46.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF AFRICAN AMERICANS VOTING.

18:46.967 --> 18:48.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MANY OF THOSE VOTERS ARE WHAT

18:48.867 --> 18:51.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE CALLED INFREQUENT VOTERS.

18:51.533 --> 18:53.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAT OUT THE NEXT FEW ELECTIONS.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN THEY GO TO THE POLLS THIS

18:55.933 --> 18:57.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIME THEY'LL FIND THEY'RE NOT

18:57.267 --> 18:58.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGISTERED.

18:58.033 --> 18:59.067 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: WHAT ABOUT IN

18:59.067 --> 18:59.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KANSAS.

18:59.833 --> 19:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU HAVE TO PROVE YOU'RE CITIZEN

19:01.833 --> 19:03.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BEFORE YOU CAN VOTE.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHY LAST IT BECOME SO DIFFICULT?

19:04.467 --> 19:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE REQUIREMENTS TO REGISTER

19:05.833 --> 19:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN ALL STATES ARE FOR THE MOST

19:07.933 --> 19:11.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PART, YOU SHOW AN I.D., AND YOU

19:11.833 --> 19:14.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SIGN A DOCUMENT THAT BASICALLY

19:14.633 --> 19:16.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SWEARS THAT YOU'RE A CITIZEN.

19:16.667 --> 19:18.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHAT'S HAPPENING THIS KANSAS IS

19:18.367 --> 19:21.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'VE TAKEN IT A STEP FURTHER,

19:21.567 --> 19:25.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND REQUIRED PROOF CITIZENSHIP.

19:25.467 --> 19:27.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THEY'RE ACTUALLY THREE

19:27.167 --> 19:28.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES THAT HAVE THIS LAW ON

19:28.467 --> 19:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEIR BOOKS.

19:29.900 --> 19:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KANSAS, GEORGIA, AND ALABAMA.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.600 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND A LOT OF YOUNG VOTERS WERE

19:35.600 --> 19:36.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THIS.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LOT OF YOUNG VOTERS WOULDN'T

19:38.800 --> 19:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NECESSARILY HAVE THE KIND OF

19:40.233 --> 19:41.667 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP DOCUMENTS

19:41.667 --> 19:43.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THEY MIGHT NEED WHEN THEY

19:43.533 --> 19:45.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO AND REGISTER AT A LOCAL SORT

19:45.767 --> 19:47.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF DMV.

19:47.367 --> 19:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE HAS BEEN LITIGATION AROUND

19:49.833 --> 19:51.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THIS THAT A COURT RULED IN MAY

19:51.867 --> 19:55.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT THE DMVs SHOULD NO LONGER

19:55.367 --> 19:57.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE YOUR PROOF

19:57.367 --> 19:58.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CITIZENSHIP BUT IN KANSAS THE

19:58.500 --> 20:00.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LAW IS STILL IN EFFECT IN OTHER

20:00.767 --> 20:01.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AREAS STILL IN EFFECT FOR

20:01.767 --> 20:03.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXAMPLE IF YOU WANT TO MAIL IN

20:03.700 --> 20:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUR... IF YOU WANT TO --

20:06.000 --> 20:07.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REGISTRATION OR IF YOU WANT TO

20:07.033 --> 20:11.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
GO TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION, SORT

20:11.200 --> 20:16.967 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OF TWO TIER VOTING SYSTEM, WHERE

20:16.967 --> 20:18.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PEOPLE HAVE THE ABILITY TO VOTE

20:18.833 --> 20:21.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN STATE ELECTIONS AND SOME

20:21.533 --> 20:23.467 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CAN'T, COUNTY OFFICIALS HAVE

20:23.467 --> 20:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DESCRIBED A SENSE OF CHAOS

20:25.000 --> 20:25.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AROUND THIS.

20:25.767 --> 20:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IT HAS BEEN LITIGATED AND I

20:29.100 --> 20:30.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK THE CONCERN FROM THE

20:30.367 --> 20:32.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DEMOCRATIC PARTY THE PEOPLE

20:32.133 --> 20:33.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WE'VE SPOKE TO ON THIS IS

20:33.733 --> 20:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THERE'S A CONCERN THAT IT WILL

20:36.033 --> 20:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BE USED AS A TEMPLATE IN OTHER

20:38.233 --> 20:40.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
STATES, THIS -- AS A TEMPLATE IN

20:40.867 --> 20:42.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
OTHER STATES, AND THIS WOULD

20:42.500 --> 20:44.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AFFECT YOUNGER VOTERS AND

20:44.367 --> 20:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
UNAFFILIATED VOTERS.

20:45.533 --> 20:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ARE.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> Sreenivasan: IS THIS

20:47.900 --> 20:49.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOCUSED ON RACE OR PARTY?

20:49.300 --> 20:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FOR EXAMPLE IN TEXAS YOU CAN USE

20:51.300 --> 20:53.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOUR CONCEALED CARRY PERMIT BUT

20:53.367 --> 20:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT YOUR STATE-ISSUED STUDENT

20:55.567 --> 20:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I.D.

20:56.133 --> 20:58.167 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
>> THE ANSWER TO THAT REALLY

20:58.167 --> 21:00.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IS -- DEPENDS ON WHO YOU TALK

21:00.267 --> 21:00.867 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO.

21:00.867 --> 21:02.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DEMOCRAT PARTY, OFFICIALS

21:02.233 --> 21:04.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SAY LOOK IT HAS A LOT TO DO WITH

21:04.267 --> 21:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RACE AND THAT HAS IN TURN A LOT

21:06.233 --> 21:07.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TO DO WITH PARTY.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
BUT IF YOU TALK TO THE

21:08.933 --> 21:09.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICAN PARTY OFFICIALS IN A

21:09.933 --> 21:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NUMBER OF STATES, THEY'LL SAY

21:12.400 --> 21:14.767 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LOOK THIS IS REALLY ABOUT FRAUD.

21:14.767 --> 21:17.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THERE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT

21:17.367 --> 21:19.267 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VOTER FRAUD AND TIGHTENING THE

21:19.267 --> 21:20.367 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
RESTRICTIONS TO PREVENT THAT

21:20.367 --> 21:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
FROM HAPPENING.

21:20.900 --> 21:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
