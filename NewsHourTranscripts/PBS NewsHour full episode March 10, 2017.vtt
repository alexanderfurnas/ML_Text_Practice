JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:05.372 --> 00:06.273 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:06.373 --> 00:08.041 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

00:08.141 --> 00:11.211 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
tonight:
President Trump touts the GOP's
new health

00:11.311 --> 00:15.582 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
care bill, as Republicans
wrangle over how
to replace Obamacare.

00:15.682 --> 00:19.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Also ahead:
mirrors and
lights -- a traveling art
exhibit that pushes

00:19.820 --> 00:21.655 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
boundaries out to infinity.

00:21.755 --> 00:27.127 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKA YOSHITAKE, Curator,
Hirshhorn Museum:
It's about filling a void that
she has experienced

00:27.227 --> 00:29.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that she's experienced as that
incessant energy.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.965 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And it's Friday.

00:32.065 --> 00:35.469 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mark Shields and Michael Gerson
are here to
take on the week's news.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All that and
more on tonight's
"PBS NewsHour."

00:38.038 --> 00:42.309 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

00:42.409 --> 00:54.621 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President Trump
is warning
that Congress must act on a
Republican health

00:54.721 --> 00:58.225 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
care bill to head off a crisis
with Obamacare.

00:58.325 --> 01:03.196 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He called in key House
congressional committee
chairs today to praise their
work, despite

01:03.297 --> 01:07.401 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
opposition from Democrats,
medical groups
and some conservatives.

01:07.501 --> 01:10.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States:
We must act now to save
Americans from the

01:10.170 --> 01:13.573 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
imploding Obamacare disaster.

01:13.674 --> 01:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Premiums have skyrocketed by
double digits,
and triple digits in some cases.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.313 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the time we're going to
get it done.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We're working together.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.282 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have some great results.

01:22.382 --> 01:26.753 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have tremendous spirit, and I
think it's
something that's just going to
happen very

01:26.853 --> 01:28.622 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
shortly.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.590 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Joining me to
discuss the
American Health Care Act are
"NewsHour"'s

01:30.691 --> 01:34.194 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
White House correspondent John
Yang and congressional
correspondent Lisa Desjardins.

01:34.294 --> 01:37.130 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, let's start with the
resistance in Congress.

01:37.230 --> 01:41.201 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The president in his tweet says
everything
is going smoothly, but on
Capitol Hill, not

01:41.301 --> 01:42.202 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
so much.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.104 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: It's real and
significant.

01:44.204 --> 01:48.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Right now, if you look at the
House, they
can spare 21 Republican votes
and still pass

01:48.709 --> 01:50.510 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
this.

01:50.610 --> 01:54.314 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, by my count, there are
somewhere like
40 Republicans who are either
unsure or have

01:54.414 --> 01:56.650 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
expressed clear doubts or even
no votes.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.819 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They have a lot of reasons for
concern.

01:58.919 --> 02:01.521 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
One are the tax credits we have
talked on
the show before.

02:01.621 --> 02:05.325 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To some conservatives, that's
just another
government entitlement program.

02:05.425 --> 02:08.829 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They're hoping there's
negotiations ahead,
but it's not clear if there are.

02:08.929 --> 02:12.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: So, John, what
does the
White House do to try to make
sure that those

02:12.766 --> 02:14.368 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
40 Republicans stay in line?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.837 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Well, the president
says that he
hasn't have to do much of
anything.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.706 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He points out that -- in the
meeting with
the House whips the other day,
he pointed

02:19.806 --> 02:24.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
out his margin of victory in the
districts
of a lot those recalcitrant
House Republicans.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.446 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he knows those numbers.

02:26.546 --> 02:29.082 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He knows what they won and he
knows what he
won.

02:29.182 --> 02:35.022 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's going to go out on what
they call a full-court
press to sell this, but what
he's selling

02:35.122 --> 02:37.391 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
is repealing the current law.

02:37.491 --> 02:41.995 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's what he is trying make
this vote, not
a vote for the -- so much for
the proposal

02:42.095 --> 02:45.632 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they have got on the table
now, but a
vote for repealing Obamacare.

02:45.732 --> 02:50.170 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So the question is, do you want
to go home
and say you voted against
repealing Obamacare?

02:50.270 --> 02:51.905 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There are
still those sticking
points.

02:52.005 --> 02:56.143 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Besides the tax credits, what
else is making
these Republicans hesitant?

02:56.243 --> 02:59.346 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: There's another
problem for
moderate Republicans as well,
some like, say,

02:59.446 --> 03:05.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania,
who has many
constituents on Medicaid or on
the Medicaid

03:05.485 --> 03:07.287 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
expansion.

03:07.387 --> 03:09.689 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're worried about coverage
and whether
many of their constituents are
going to lose

03:09.790 --> 03:11.658 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
coverage.

03:11.758 --> 03:14.294 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they're worried about the
Congressional
Budget Office score, which we
expect on Monday.

03:14.394 --> 03:17.064 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is going to be a big factor
in how this
battle go.

03:17.164 --> 03:20.934 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This is kind of that wild
moment, Hari, where
people are still deciding, which
way will

03:21.034 --> 03:22.235 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
the wind go?

03:22.335 --> 03:24.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And CBO is going to have an
effect on that.

03:24.304 --> 03:27.941 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The White
House went out
of its way to sort of discredit
the CBO already

03:28.041 --> 03:29.976 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
before the numbers came out just
yesterday.

03:30.077 --> 03:31.711 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOHN YANG: It's gaming the ref.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.314 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They have already said --
they're already
preparing themselves for a bad
score.

03:34.414 --> 03:40.687 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They said -- Sean Spicer said if
you're looking
for accuracy, the CBO is the
wrong place to

03:40.787 --> 03:42.022 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
look.

03:42.122 --> 03:43.890 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So they're already discrediting
before it
even comes out.

03:43.990 --> 03:47.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: But a couple
of kind of
mixed messages that we see here
is, we see

03:47.260 --> 03:50.530 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Paul Ryan on the one hand
saying, this is
it, this is the final thing.

03:50.630 --> 03:53.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And then sometimes we also hear
from other
people that this is open to
negotiation, this

03:54.067 --> 03:54.968 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
is a process.

03:55.068 --> 03:55.969 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Which is it?

03:56.069 --> 03:56.970 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.905 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's very curious.

03:59.005 --> 04:01.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Behind closed doors,
conservatives have said
the president has told them in
meetings this

04:01.308 --> 04:05.846 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
week with people like Jim Jordan
that he is
listening, that he's willing to
change some

04:05.946 --> 04:07.047 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
things they don't like.

04:07.147 --> 04:09.583 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, publicly, that's not what
the message
is.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Paul Ryan used a very
important word yesterday.

04:12.119 --> 04:15.055 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He said this is a binary
decision.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.957 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Translation, ultimatum.

04:17.057 --> 04:20.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Just like John was saying,
either you vote
for this, or, if you vote no,
that is a vote

04:21.027 --> 04:22.729 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
for Obamacare.

04:22.829 --> 04:25.265 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That drives these conservatives
crazy, because
they don't see the choice that
way.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.868 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right, so
it's either
you're with us or you're with
Obamacare.

04:27.968 --> 04:32.472 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Although the
president says -- or
Sean Spicer said in his
briefings today, it's

04:32.572 --> 04:34.641 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
not so much the details that the
president
is looking at.

04:34.741 --> 04:39.346 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He laid out five principles for
this bill
in his speech to Congress.

04:39.446 --> 04:44.251 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As long as those five principles
are met,
he really doesn't care what the
details are.

04:44.351 --> 04:47.754 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: All right,
John Yang, Lisa
Desjardins, thank you both.

04:47.854 --> 04:53.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: In the day's
other news: The
U.S. economy cranked out more
jobs in February.

04:53.493 --> 04:59.699 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Labor Department reports
that U.S. employers
added a net of 235,000 new
positions.

04:59.799 --> 05:06.072 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The unemployment rate dipped
slightly to 4.7
percent, as more people began
looking for

05:06.173 --> 05:07.741 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
work.

05:07.841 --> 05:11.411 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
During the campaign, then
candidate Trump
dismissed the jobs data as
phony.

05:11.511 --> 05:15.749 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Today, a White House spokesman
said, they
may have been phony in the past,
but they're

05:15.849 --> 05:17.651 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
very real now.

05:17.751 --> 05:21.988 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: It turns out
lawyers for
former National Security Adviser
Michael Flynn

05:22.088 --> 05:26.660 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
told the Trump transition team
before the
inauguration that he might have
to register

05:26.760 --> 05:28.562 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as a foreign agent.

05:28.662 --> 05:32.999 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's because Flynn had lobbied
for the Turkish
government during the campaign,
before he

05:33.099 --> 05:36.336 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
joined the Trump administration.

05:36.436 --> 05:40.907 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
White House Press Secretary Sean
Spicer said
today that Flynn's lawyers spoke
to transition

05:41.007 --> 05:43.376 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
lawyers, and he defended the
vetting process.

05:43.476 --> 05:46.313 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SEAN SPICER, White House Press
Secretary:
He was also the head of the
department -- the

05:46.413 --> 05:51.985 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Defense Intelligence Agency,
unbelievably
qualified, 40 years in the
military with impeccable

05:52.085 --> 05:53.386 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
credentials.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.456 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, what is it that he -- what
is exactly
are you getting at?

05:56.556 --> 06:01.962 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Because, so far, he has
impeccable credentials,
he had a stellar career in the
military, widely

06:02.062 --> 06:03.730 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
respected.

06:03.830 --> 06:06.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Flynn was
fired last month
when it came out that he had had
contacts

06:07.067 --> 06:12.138 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
with the Russian ambassador to
the U.S., but
misled the vice president and
others about

06:12.239 --> 06:13.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.309 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Native Americans
and their
supporters rallied outside the
White House

06:16.409 --> 06:20.046 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today against the Dakota Access
oil pipeline.

06:20.146 --> 06:24.818 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Their march started at the Army
Corps of Engineers
headquarters and culminated with
a gathering

06:24.918 --> 06:26.553 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
next to the executive mansion.

06:26.653 --> 06:30.490 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They have also been staging
protests on the
National Mall this week.

06:30.590 --> 06:34.127 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The final phase of the pipeline
is under construction
in North Dakota.

06:34.227 --> 06:38.665 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Volkswagen has
pleaded guilty
to conspiracy and obstruction of
justice in

06:38.765 --> 06:40.834 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
its emissions cheating scandal.

06:40.934 --> 06:44.371 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The German automaker entered the
plea in federal
court in Detroit.

06:44.471 --> 06:48.008 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It agreed to pay $4.3 billion in
penalties.

06:48.108 --> 06:52.545 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The case involved nearly 600,000

JUDY WOODRUFF: In South Korea,
President Park
Geun-hye was officially ousted
today by the

06:58.184 --> 06:59.753 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
nation's highest court.

06:59.853 --> 07:04.591 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Chief foreign affairs
correspondent Margaret
Warner has the story.

07:04.691 --> 07:10.697 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: The
constitutional court's
verdict, announced in Seoul, was
unanimous.

07:10.797 --> 07:15.468 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Upholding the impeachment of
South Korea's
President Park, it removed her
from office

07:15.568 --> 07:19.539 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
a stunning fall from power.

07:19.639 --> 07:24.144 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Streets overflowed with
demonstrators, many
celebrating the ouster of the
country's first

07:24.244 --> 07:25.679 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
female leader.

07:25.779 --> 07:28.915 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): The
people gave
her the power to serve.

07:29.015 --> 07:33.253 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But she filled her own pocket,
disrupted social
order and undermined democracy.

07:33.353 --> 07:37.857 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MARGARET WARNER: Others
protested the verdict,
saying Park's removal leaves
South Korea at

07:37.957 --> 07:39.826 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
risk.

07:39.926 --> 07:44.464 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator): We
should be thankful
to president Park for protecting
our nation.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.399 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Young people these days don't
know that.

07:46.499 --> 07:49.769 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's only been 67 years since
the Korean War
erupted.

07:49.869 --> 07:53.306 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We could soon see another
similar tragedy
happen.

07:53.406 --> 07:59.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARGARET WARNER: Two people died
during today's
protests, and at least 30 were
hurt.

07:59.245 --> 08:03.350 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All of this follows Park's
suspension from
office in December.

08:03.450 --> 08:09.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Now she may face criminal
charges of conspiring
to let childhood friend Choi
Soon-sil meddle

08:09.823 --> 08:15.495 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
in state affairs and extort
money from businesses,
including Samsung, whose own
chief is now

08:15.595 --> 08:18.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
on trial for bribery.

08:18.498 --> 08:23.703 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The political turmoil in South
Korea comes
at a moment of high tensions in
the region.

08:23.803 --> 08:29.509 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
North Korea test-fired a barrage
of long-range
missiles this week, as the U.S.
and South

08:29.609 --> 08:33.246 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Korea conducted annual joint
military exercises.

08:33.346 --> 08:39.386 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And China is now protesting U.S.
plans to
deploy a new missile defense
system in the

08:39.486 --> 08:41.354 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
South.

08:41.454 --> 08:47.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Pentagon shipped components
of the so-called
THAAD defense system to South
Korea this week.

08:47.260 --> 08:53.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Washington says it's designed to
protect against
a North Korean attack, not to
threaten China.

08:53.166 --> 08:57.971 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
is likely
to reinforce that message, as he
visits South

08:58.071 --> 08:59.906 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Korea next week.

09:00.006 --> 09:04.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Meanwhile, a caretaker president
is in place
while the country gets ready to
hold elections

09:04.544 --> 09:06.179 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the next 60 days.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.048 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Margaret Warner.

09:09.149 --> 09:13.720 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The White House
said today
the U.S. expects to continue to
work with

09:13.820 --> 09:16.089 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
South Korea as a friend and
ally.

09:16.189 --> 09:20.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The president
of Guatemala
called today for reforms after a
deadly fire

09:20.493 --> 09:23.029 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at a crowded shelter for abused
teens.

09:23.129 --> 09:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Meanwhile, the death toll in
Wednesday's deadly
blaze rose to 37.

09:27.066 --> 09:31.171 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Police say some of the girls set
fire to mattresses
to protest abuses.

09:31.271 --> 09:36.075 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Families of victims held a
candlelight vigil
and protest last night to call
for an investigation.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.278 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They also demanded the
president's resignation.

09:38.378 --> 09:43.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The U.N. Human
Rights Office
accused Turkey today of
widespread killings

09:43.783 --> 09:47.487 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and other abuses, mostly against
minority
Kurds.

09:47.587 --> 09:53.426 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Investigators said roughly 2,000
people died
during security operations in
Southeastern

09:53.526 --> 09:55.328 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Turkey over 18 months.

09:55.428 --> 10:01.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The U.N. told of entire
neighborhoods destroyed,
displacing several hundred
thousand people.

10:02.068 --> 10:06.105 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Geneva, a U.N. spokesman said
Turkey is
hindering a thorough
investigation.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.974 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
RUPERT COLVILLE, Spokesman,
United Nations
High Commissioner for Human
Rights: It appears

10:08.074 --> 10:13.179 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that not a single suspect was
apprehended
and not a single individual was
prosecuted

10:13.279 --> 10:17.450 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
for violations that occurred
during this period.

10:17.550 --> 10:22.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The government of Turkey has
repeatedly failed
to grant us access, but has
nevertheless contested

10:22.322 --> 10:25.959 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the veracity of the very serious
allegations
made in this report.

10:26.059 --> 10:30.697 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The Turkish
government says
that 800 of the dead were
troops, and that

10:30.797 --> 10:32.632 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
many others were Kurdish rebels.

10:32.732 --> 10:37.670 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Pope Francis
has now signaled
that he'd consider letting some
married men

10:37.770 --> 10:40.874 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
become priests, but with strict
limits.

10:40.974 --> 10:45.311 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He told a German newspaper the
men would have
to be older, with proven
character.

10:45.411 --> 10:48.248 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they'd serve only where
there's a shortage
of clergy.

10:48.348 --> 10:52.385 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Back in this
country, there's
word that the death of Russia's
U.N. ambassador

10:52.485 --> 10:54.053 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was due to a heart attack.

10:54.153 --> 10:57.290 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Vitaly Churkin collapsed in his
office last
month.

10:57.390 --> 11:02.128 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Associated Press cites a
senior New York
City official who says there's
no sign of

11:02.228 --> 11:04.063 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
foul play.

11:04.163 --> 11:08.301 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The State Department has asked
the city not
to release the autopsy results,
in accordance

11:08.401 --> 11:10.169 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
with diplomatic protocol.

11:10.270 --> 11:13.840 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
HARI SREENIVASAN: House
Republicans pushed
through legislation today to
sanction lawyers

11:13.940 --> 11:17.577 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and others who file frivolous
lawsuits in
federal courts.

11:17.677 --> 11:22.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It doesn't change the standard
for determining
whether a suit is frivolous, but
it does require

11:22.482 --> 11:24.250 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
judges to impose penalties.

11:24.350 --> 11:29.255 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It's being
reported tonight
that President Trump will
nominate Dr. Scott

11:29.355 --> 11:33.326 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gottlieb to be commissioner of
the Food and
Drug Administration.

11:33.426 --> 11:38.598 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Wire service accounts say that
he would be
tasked with speeding the drug
approval process.

11:38.698 --> 11:43.403 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Gottlieb served previously as a
deputy FDA
commissioner and is currently a
partner in

11:43.503 --> 11:46.139 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a venture capital firm.

11:46.239 --> 11:52.712 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And on Wall Street today, the
Dow Jones industrial
average gained 44 points to
close near 20903.

11:52.812 --> 11:57.317 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Nasdaq rose almost 23, and
the S&amp;P 500
added seven.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.086 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the week, all three indexes
were down
slightly.

12:00.186 --> 12:04.591 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Still to come
on the "NewsHour":
perspective on the replacement
health care

12:04.691 --> 12:11.731 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
plan from a key GOP committee
chair; conduct
unbecoming in the U.S. armed
forces; Mark

12:11.831 --> 12:18.571 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Shields and Michael Gerson take
on the week's
political news; and much more.

12:18.671 --> 12:32.051 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Before the
congressional Republicans'
health care plan can get a final
vote in the

12:32.151 --> 12:37.357 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
House of Representatives, it
needs to clear
one more hurdle: the House
Budget Committee.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.292 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We turn now to the chairman of
that committee.

12:39.392 --> 12:41.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's Representative Diane
Black.

12:41.494 --> 12:45.431 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She was among a handful of
Republican leaders
who met with the president at
the White House

12:45.531 --> 12:49.068 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
today, and she joins us from
Nashville, Tennessee.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.804 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Chairman Black, thank you very
much for talking
with us.

12:51.904 --> 12:55.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, when this bill went through
the other
two committees in the House,
Ways and Means

12:55.608 --> 12:58.711 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and Energy and Commerce, vote
was along party
lines.

12:58.811 --> 13:00.747 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
All the Republicans voted for
it.

13:00.847 --> 13:02.949 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is that going to happen on the
Budget Committee
next week?

13:03.049 --> 13:04.717 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:04.817 --> 13:06.653 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BLACK (R), Tennessee: I
think we will
probably see a very similar
thing.

13:06.753 --> 13:11.724 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I don't anticipate that we will
have any Democrat
votes with us, but we will
continue to move

13:11.824 --> 13:16.362 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
along in the process and give
them the opportunity
to ask the questions and to make
that decision

13:16.462 --> 13:17.964 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
whether they would like to vote
with us or
not.

13:18.064 --> 13:19.298 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What about
Republicans?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Do you expect any defections?

13:20.667 --> 13:22.468 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:22.568 --> 13:24.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BLACK: I anticipate we
will have a lot
of good conversation, as we have
in the Ways

13:24.971 --> 13:27.073 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and Means Committee, of which I
am a member.

13:27.173 --> 13:33.579 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
After 18 hours of very good
dialogue and making
a lot of good points, I
anticipate that we

13:33.680 --> 13:36.549 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
will have all members of our
committee supporting
this measure.

13:36.649 --> 13:41.554 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What is your
answer to the
conservative complaint or
concern at this

13:41.654 --> 13:46.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
point that what you have in this
legislation,
among other things, is what they
call a new

13:46.926 --> 13:50.163 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
entitlement program with these
refundable
tax credits?

13:50.263 --> 13:51.798 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BLACK: Well, this is a way
in which
we can give people an
opportunity.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.569 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's a very small portion of
our population.

13:56.669 --> 14:00.039 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, most people have their
insurance
through their employer.

14:00.139 --> 14:04.711 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we have got about 4 percent
of -- 4 to
5 percent of our population who
doesn't have

14:04.811 --> 14:06.446 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
that opportunity.

14:06.546 --> 14:11.217 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And so this gives them, as those
who have
insurance through their
employer, that is

14:11.317 --> 14:13.086 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a tax-free benefit that they
have.

14:13.186 --> 14:17.023 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And for those who aren't as
fortunate to have
an employer that provides that
insurance,

14:17.123 --> 14:20.827 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this gives them an opportunity
to be able
to be in the marketplace.

14:20.927 --> 14:24.664 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the important part of this
is that they
are in the marketplace where
they can make

14:24.764 --> 14:28.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
a decision about who it is that
they would
like to get their insurance
through.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.369 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So we believe this is a fairness
issue.

14:30.470 --> 14:35.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, as you know,
your conservative
colleagues are saying they see
it's a government

14:35.975 --> 14:37.510 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
guarantee and they don't like
it.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.445 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.881 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BLACK: Well, they have
that opportunity
to make those comments and make
their points.

14:41.981 --> 14:44.350 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And that's what the whole
process is about.

14:44.450 --> 14:48.821 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's the great thing about
being in the
legislature, is a lot of good
discussion and

14:48.921 --> 14:52.391 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
sometimes really heavy
conversations.

14:52.492 --> 14:56.395 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think, at the end of the
day, that you're
going to see that this bill is
going to be

14:56.496 --> 15:00.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
successful, and that's because
our health
care system right now is
failing.

15:00.266 --> 15:02.201 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You know what?

15:02.301 --> 15:05.838 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Here in the state of Tennessee,
my great state,
we actually have parts of our
state that have

15:05.938 --> 15:09.041 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
no insurers left in the
marketplace.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.977 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so we have got to rescue
people.

15:11.077 --> 15:16.883 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We get calls in our office every
day about
premiums going up, and co-pays
and to a point

15:16.983 --> 15:20.219 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
where people say, I can't afford
it anymore,
please help us out.

15:20.319 --> 15:24.090 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And so that's what we're
attempting to do
is to be able to rescue people,
so they can

15:24.190 --> 15:29.028 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
get patient care or
patient-centered health
insurance that will be what they
want at a

15:29.128 --> 15:30.897 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
price they can afford.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.032 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, let me ask
you about
the complaints on the other side
from Democrats

15:33.132 --> 15:38.070 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and from moderates in your own
party who are
saying they're concerned that
people who cannot

15:38.171 --> 15:42.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
-- or can barely afford health
coverage right
now will not be able to afford
it, with the

15:42.708 --> 15:47.947 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid changes, changing the
way Medicaid
is handled by the year 2020.

15:48.047 --> 15:51.150 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There is even some conversation
about moving
that earlier.

15:51.250 --> 15:55.955 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In your own state of Tennessee,
there was
a statement today from the
hospital association

15:56.055 --> 16:02.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
saying they're concerned about
what they say
are 230,000 Tennesseans who
depend on the

16:02.995 --> 16:05.598 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
kind of coverage in the existing
law.

16:05.698 --> 16:06.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How will you deal with that?

16:07.066 --> 16:08.868 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.903 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BLACK: Well, first of all,
we want to
make sure everyone knows that
we're not going

16:11.003 --> 16:13.072 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to pull the rug out from
underneath of them.

16:13.172 --> 16:17.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But what we do want do is open
the marketplace
back up again and allow more
competition.

16:18.010 --> 16:22.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We have had so many of the
insurance companies,
and look at the co-ops that were
out there.

16:22.982 --> 16:28.221 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Out of the 23 co-ops, 18 of them
are gone,
which meant here in my state,
when lost that

16:28.321 --> 16:34.861 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
co-op, over 20,000 people that
were in that
health care policy lost their
insurance, because

16:34.961 --> 16:36.729 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
you just can't afford it.

16:36.829 --> 16:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When it is government-run, and
there are so
many requirements put on it, it
drives the

16:40.933 --> 16:42.101 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
cost of the policy up.

16:42.201 --> 16:43.636 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But what about --
excuse me.

16:43.736 --> 16:44.637 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:44.737 --> 16:46.606 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
DIANE BLACK: That's OK.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.040 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I just want to
say, what about
those 230,000 Tennesseans who
were cited by

16:48.140 --> 16:51.510 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the hospital association in your
state as
standing to lose coverage?

16:51.611 --> 16:52.912 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.313 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DIANE BLACK: Well, we're --
they're not going
to lose coverage.

16:54.413 --> 16:55.882 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's what I want people to
know.

16:55.982 --> 16:58.584 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I want people to understand we
are not pulling
the rug out.

16:58.684 --> 17:03.222 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We are still going to have
Medicaid there
for them, but it is going to be
changed in

17:03.322 --> 17:05.791 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the way it's done where it's
more patient-centered.

17:05.892 --> 17:09.862 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're also going to give states
an opportunity
to make the decision about how
they best can

17:09.962 --> 17:11.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
use those dollars.

17:11.864 --> 17:15.268 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What's good for New York and
California is
not necessarily what's good for
here in the

17:15.368 --> 17:17.036 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
state of Tennessee.

17:17.136 --> 17:20.506 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will allow the governor
here in our
state to make the decision about
how best

17:20.606 --> 17:25.144 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
to spend those dollars that are
sent down
from Washington for Medicaid and
for those

17:25.244 --> 17:27.046 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that are in that space.

17:27.146 --> 17:31.017 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Very quick final
question,
Chairman Black, and that is the
Congressional

17:31.117 --> 17:35.855 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Budget Office expected to put
out its projections
on how many people will be
covered, how many

17:35.955 --> 17:37.723 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will lose coverage.

17:37.823 --> 17:43.596 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Will your committee look at that
information,
take it seriously, or,, as the
White House

17:43.696 --> 17:47.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
is suggesting, that it really
doesn't matter
what the Congressional Budget
Office says?

17:47.867 --> 17:49.635 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.904 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DIANE BLACK: Well, we always
take what the
Congressional Budget Office
gives us very

17:52.004 --> 17:53.973 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
seriously, and we will look at
that.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.910 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It may be that, when we get
those scores back,
that we do have to tweak some
things one way

17:58.010 --> 17:59.245 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
or the other.

17:59.345 --> 18:02.081 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It probably will not be done in
the House
Budget Committee.

18:02.181 --> 18:06.452 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It will be done through another
process once
it gets into the rules.

18:06.552 --> 18:10.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But we do take that seriously,
and we will
be looking at that and making
some decisions

18:11.023 --> 18:12.992 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
about whether there needs to be
some adjustments.

18:13.092 --> 18:17.129 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Chairman Diane
Black, chairman
of the House Budget Committee,
we thank you

18:17.229 --> 18:18.130 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
for talking with us.

18:18.230 --> 18:19.131 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
REP.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DIANE BLACK: You're very
welcome.

18:20.466 --> 18:28.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Thank you for having me.

18:28.174 --> 18:34.714 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: We turn now to
a growing
scandal in the U.S. Marine
Corps, where male

18:34.814 --> 18:39.752 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Marines have been caught sharing
sexually
explicit photos of female
Marines without

18:39.852 --> 18:41.053 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their consent.

18:41.153 --> 18:42.888 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
William Brangham has the story.

18:42.989 --> 18:47.460 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: It started on
a private
Facebook page called Marines
United, hundreds

18:47.560 --> 18:52.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of explicit photographs of
female Marines,
followed by endless obscene,
degrading comments.

18:52.932 --> 18:56.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Some of the photos appear to
have been taken
consensually, but others were
not.

18:56.936 --> 19:01.407 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
None of the women identified so
far said they
had agreed to their photos being
posted this

19:01.507 --> 19:03.275 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
way.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.878 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Facebook page is gone, but
many of the
photos -- these are some of the
tamer ones

19:05.978 --> 19:08.914 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- have now been uploaded to
other Web sites.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.950 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Military officials have launched
an investigation.

19:11.050 --> 19:15.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, today, Defense Secretary
James Mattis,
a former Marine himself, called
these acts

19:15.888 --> 19:19.158 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
egregious violations of the
fundamental values.

19:19.258 --> 19:23.229 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The commandant of the Marine
Corps, General
Robert Neller, also expressed
his dismay.

19:23.329 --> 19:24.997 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
GEN.

19:25.097 --> 19:26.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ROBERT NELLER, Commandant of the
U.S. Marine
Corps: These allegations
themselves, they

19:26.932 --> 19:33.005 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
undermine everything that we
stand for as
a Marine Corps and as Marines:
discipline,

19:33.105 --> 19:37.743 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
honor, professionalism, and
respect and trust
amongst each other.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.914 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: For more on
this, I'm joined
by retired Colonel Mary
Reinwald.

19:42.014 --> 19:46.619 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She spent 27 years in the Corps
and now edits
"Leatherneck" magazine, written
for the Marine

19:46.719 --> 19:48.387 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Corps community.

19:48.487 --> 19:49.455 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Nice to see you again.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.823 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Sorry it's under these
circumstances.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.691 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

19:52.792 --> 19:53.893 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY REINWALD, (RET.), U.S.
Marine Corps:
Tell me, when you first heard
about this,

19:53.993 --> 19:55.428 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
what was your reaction?

19:55.528 --> 19:57.296 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was angry.

19:57.396 --> 20:01.367 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was absolutely angry, because,
you know,
both General Neller and General
Mattis mentioned

20:01.467 --> 20:03.903 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in their comments that, you
know, this is
about honor.

20:04.003 --> 20:07.973 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the Marines who did these
type of things,
they don't have the honor that
we value as

20:08.074 --> 20:08.974 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Marines.

20:09.075 --> 20:09.975 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I was ashamed.

20:10.076 --> 20:11.310 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I was ashamed for my Marine
Corps.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.612 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I was mad for my fellow
Marines.

20:13.712 --> 20:17.683 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was mad for my fellow male
Marines, because
the vast majority of male
Marines don't do

20:17.783 --> 20:19.752 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
this type of behavior.

20:19.852 --> 20:23.389 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They are honorable, they are
decent, and they're
the type of humans that
everybody should aspire

20:23.489 --> 20:25.291 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to.

20:25.391 --> 20:28.461 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And now there is a whole segment
of our country
who will believe this is what
Marines do.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.462 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
And it's not.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.963 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's absolutely not.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.832 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And what have
you been hearing
from other Marines?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I know you talk to them on a
daily basis.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.101 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What do you hear from them?

20:35.201 --> 20:36.102 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.336 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY REINWALD: I do.

20:37.436 --> 20:38.938 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have many friends that are
still on active
duty.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I also talked to a female Marine
whose picture
was posted on the Web site.

20:41.107 --> 20:45.044 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it was just an innocuous
picture from
her Instagram with her and some
other female

20:45.144 --> 20:46.045 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Marines.

20:46.145 --> 20:47.480 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There was nothing wrong with it.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.781 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They were out in public.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.717 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the photo was taken and
posted on the
Web site.

20:51.817 --> 20:55.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And they asked in terms of her
attractiveness,
but they asked in much cruder
terms than I

20:55.788 --> 20:56.889 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
would use.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.824 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She is an officer Marine.

20:58.924 --> 20:59.825 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
She's a pilot.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.560 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
She's got an exemplary record.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.562 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's one of the future leaders
of our Corps.

21:03.662 --> 21:06.832 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have these individuals
who decided
that they were going to be
disrespectful and

21:06.932 --> 21:10.503 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
vile and not uphold our ethos.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.471 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
How dare they?

21:12.571 --> 21:15.508 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I absolutely believe that our
culture has
some role to play in all of
this, social media.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.909 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: You mean
American culture
more broadly?

21:17.009 --> 21:18.010 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.345 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARY REINWALD: American culture
more broadly.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.581 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's very easy to get on
social media
and be anonymous.

21:22.681 --> 21:27.686 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And thing is, these individuals
-- and I really
do hesitate to call them Marines
-- if these

21:27.786 --> 21:31.223 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
individuals weren't the cowards
that they
are, they would be putting their
names up

21:31.323 --> 21:33.225 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
there.

21:33.325 --> 21:36.061 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They would be proudly
proclaiming their misogyny
and their disrespect toward
female Marines.

21:36.162 --> 21:40.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But this almost gang mentality
on whatever
social media account, whether
it's Facebook

21:41.066 --> 21:45.638 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
or some of the others, where
they feed off
each other, I have no respect
for them, because

21:45.738 --> 21:46.739 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
they wouldn't do it in public.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.274 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They wouldn't do it in front of
the commandant.

21:48.374 --> 21:52.444 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But they do it behind the
anonymity of both
Facebook and the Web.

21:52.545 --> 21:57.016 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: As you well
know, the Marine
Corps and all the other branches
of the services

21:57.116 --> 21:59.351 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
are integrating women into
combat roles.

21:59.451 --> 22:01.620 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's the first reason I spoke
to you several
months ago.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.621 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.523 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY REINWALD: Right.

22:04.623 --> 22:07.193 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: Do you think
it's coincidental
that the Corps is moving women
into these

22:07.293 --> 22:10.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
more forward roles at the same
time that this
kind of a scandal breaks out?

22:10.496 --> 22:11.764 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

22:11.864 --> 22:12.798 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARY REINWALD: I don't know that
it's necessarily
coincidental.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.601 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There is probably an element of
that.

22:15.701 --> 22:19.738 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's brought out more of the
individuals who
think back -- you know, have the
mentality

22:19.838 --> 22:24.476 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
from 50 years ago: Women don't
belong in the
infantry, so, by God, we're
going to be disrespectful

22:24.577 --> 22:25.878 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to all of them.

22:25.978 --> 22:28.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, you can't -- you cannot
dispute the timing
in many ways.

22:28.847 --> 22:31.383 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think these guys were
always there.

22:31.483 --> 22:35.688 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There was always an element, a
very, very
small element who had no problem
saying these

22:35.788 --> 22:36.689 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
things.

22:36.789 --> 22:37.690 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And now it's just easier to say.

22:37.790 --> 22:38.691 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: And it's just
amplified.

22:38.791 --> 22:39.692 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.660 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY REINWALD: It's amplified.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.629 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And once one makes one comment,
then the others
feel like, hey, he said it, so I
can say it,

22:43.729 --> 22:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
too, because everybody feels
this way.

22:45.097 --> 22:46.465 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Well, everybody doesn't feel
this way.

22:46.565 --> 22:48.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not the majority of
Marines.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.571 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: I know you're
also a great
champion of women going into the
Marine Corps.

22:52.671 --> 22:53.572 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.541 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARY REINWALD: Absolutely.

22:55.641 --> 22:56.875 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: What do you
think that this
kind of a thing does to those
women who are

22:56.976 --> 22:58.544 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
either just entering the Corps
or aspire to
enter the Corps?

22:58.644 --> 23:00.446 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.214 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARY REINWALD: I wouldn't doubt
for a minute
that it would make them pause
and ask them

23:02.314 --> 23:04.984 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
-- and have them ask themselves,
say, hey,
is this what I want to join?

23:05.084 --> 23:08.120 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Is the organization -- is this
who I want
to be?

23:08.220 --> 23:11.423 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I would reassure them and
say, again,
that this is not the majority of
Marines.

23:11.523 --> 23:17.329 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Ironically, I was at the United
States Naval
Academy last night, speaking to
some future

23:17.429 --> 23:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
female Marines, along with Major
General Lori
Reynolds, the senior female on
active duty

23:21.600 --> 23:22.968 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in the Marine Corps.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.104 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was heartened by what I heard.

23:25.204 --> 23:31.176 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I was thrilled by what not only
Major General
Reynolds said, but the other
female Marines

23:31.277 --> 23:35.247 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who are on active duty with me,
who all echo
in many ways what I said.

23:35.347 --> 23:39.151 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Our good experiences in the
Marine Corps vastly
outweigh our bad experiences.

23:39.251 --> 23:43.555 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we would encourage any
American young
lady today to join the Marine
Corps.

23:43.656 --> 23:47.559 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WILLIAM BRANGHAM: All right,
Mary Reinwald,
thanks so much for being here.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.161 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
COL.

23:49.261 --> 23:55.567 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARY REINWALD: Thank you.

23:55.668 --> 23:59.505 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Stay with us.

23:59.605 --> 24:04.310 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Coming up on the "NewsHour": a
new art exhibit
creates a never-ending world;
and why the

24:04.410 --> 24:08.213 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pursuit for happiness should
actually be a
search for meaning.

24:08.314 --> 24:12.751 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the
analysis of Shields
and Gerson.

24:12.851 --> 24:17.556 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's syndicated columnist Mark
Shields and
Washington Post columnist
Michael Gerson.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
David Brooks is away.

24:19.425 --> 24:20.626 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And welcome to both of you.

24:20.726 --> 24:23.996 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So, a lot going on this week,
Mark and Michael.

24:24.096 --> 24:28.500 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's start, Mark, though, with
we got a really
good sense or a better sense
this week of

24:28.600 --> 24:34.673 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what it is that Republicans in
the House and
the White House want to do in
terms of replacing

24:34.773 --> 24:37.409 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Affordable Care Act,
Obamacare.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.211 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What do we make of this?

24:39.311 --> 24:44.283 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Is this something that has the
elements of
a piece of legislation that can
survive?

24:44.383 --> 24:46.885 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't think so,
Judy.

24:46.985 --> 24:51.323 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I guess the one point I
would disagree
with you is, agreement between
the White House

24:51.423 --> 24:54.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
and the Republicans in Congress.

24:54.326 --> 24:57.896 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
To listen to Speaker Paul Ryan,
this is the
last stage out of Dodge.

24:57.996 --> 25:04.770 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is the best and only chance
the Republicans
are going to have to repeal,
fulfill that

25:04.870 --> 25:09.608 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pledge that they have made now
for seven years
to repeal Obamacare and come up
with their

25:09.708 --> 25:14.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
own plan, whereas the White
House, in the
words of the president, is, I'm
for it, but

25:15.047 --> 25:16.915 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
we can deal, we can negotiate.

25:17.015 --> 25:22.721 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I'm not sure that they're on
the same page
or have basically the same
commitment to this

25:22.821 --> 25:24.223 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legislation.

25:24.323 --> 25:30.396 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's why I just -- I think
it's in precarious
position right now.

25:30.496 --> 25:31.930 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

25:32.030 --> 25:33.232 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Even though it's
moved through
these two committees?

25:33.332 --> 25:34.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And we just spoke to the
chairman of the Budget
Committee.

25:34.433 --> 25:37.236 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And she says she expects it to
go flying through.

25:37.336 --> 25:39.004 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MARK SHIELDS: She does.

25:39.104 --> 25:44.009 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the question was, how many
hundred thousand
Tennesseans will lose health
care?

25:44.109 --> 25:50.682 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The estimates, Judy, quite
frankly, range
from 10 million to 15 million
now.

25:50.783 --> 25:55.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
All the promises of transparency
the Republicans
made about going to have open
hearings, open

25:55.854 --> 26:03.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
votes, they will not vote, that
Budget Committee
headed by Congresswoman Black,
until -- they

26:03.695 --> 26:08.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
will not release the
Congressional Budget
Office scoring to tell you how
many people

26:08.500 --> 26:13.338 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
are going to lose it and what
it's going to
cost until that happens.

26:13.439 --> 26:16.208 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's all being sort of
railroaded through
the Republican House.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.476 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But I don't see it surviving.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.478 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: How do you see it
on the substance,
Michael?

26:19.578 --> 26:23.882 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, on the
substance, there
is a set of conservative reform
ideas that

26:23.982 --> 26:26.785 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
have been developing, but this
isn't it.

26:26.885 --> 26:31.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a jerry-rigged system to
try to achieve
some of the goals of Obamacare
by slightly

26:31.557 --> 26:34.026 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
modifying this, by changing
that.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.894 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And the result is incoherent.

26:35.994 --> 26:40.999 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It has alienated the left
because of the number
of people that will be off the
system.

26:41.099 --> 26:46.872 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's alienated the right because
there are
some people that wanted a true
repeal.

26:46.972 --> 26:49.074 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This isn't that type of
approach.

26:49.174 --> 26:55.781 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, I think it's -- right now,
you know, it
has the virtue or the drawback
of pleasing

26:55.881 --> 26:58.417 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
no one, actually, in this system
on left to
right.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.052 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Why did it come
to this?

27:00.152 --> 27:03.956 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Why after all the talk
throughout the campaign?

27:04.056 --> 27:08.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Before anything else, you knew
that this president
was going to be -- he said,
we're going to

27:08.260 --> 27:10.929 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
deal with Obamacare, we're going
to get rid
of it.

27:11.029 --> 27:12.931 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Why has it come to this, then?

27:13.031 --> 27:16.535 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, I think
that President
Trump said it when he acted
shocked that health

27:16.635 --> 27:17.669 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
care is complex.

27:17.769 --> 27:20.772 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You remember him saying that?

27:20.873 --> 27:22.641 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is difficult.

27:22.741 --> 27:28.080 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I mean, Obamacare has many
faults and many
problems, but it has succeed in
creating a

27:28.180 --> 27:34.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
set of expectations about
preexisting conditions
and coverage that Republicans
now have to

27:34.620 --> 27:36.355 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
respond to.

27:36.455 --> 27:40.893 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And their response, I think, is
kind of a
makeshift response right now.

27:40.993 --> 27:44.997 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But I think Obamacare, in that
way, has triumphed.

27:45.097 --> 27:48.734 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It has created a set of
expectations Republicans
have to meet.

27:48.834 --> 27:51.937 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's very difficult to do,
to structure
a system to do that.

27:52.037 --> 27:56.008 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But you still
have Republicans,
Mark, who are arguing the whole
thing needs

27:56.108 --> 27:58.043 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be completely thrown out.

27:58.143 --> 28:01.947 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The Freedom Caucus group came
out this week
and said throw the whole thing
out and start

28:02.047 --> 28:03.882 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from scratch.

28:03.982 --> 28:06.618 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, in fairness,
the Freedom
Caucus, that's how they won a
majority in

28:06.718 --> 28:11.423 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2010, on the pledge to do that,
to repeal
completely Obamacare.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.325 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I agree with Michael.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.193 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I would say this.

28:15.294 --> 28:18.063 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Two other things I would add,
Joe Manchin,
Democratic senator from West
Virginia, who

28:18.163 --> 28:25.337 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
is in a difficult, now
red-leaning state now,
made an observation, I think,
that is so fundamentally

28:25.437 --> 28:27.272 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
true.

28:27.372 --> 28:31.209 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He said people, American voters,
may not remember
who gave you something, but they
will remember

28:31.310 --> 28:32.210 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
who took it away.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.812 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MICHAEL GERSON: Yes.

28:33.912 --> 28:35.747 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: And I think this
is the problem
the Republicans are facing.

28:35.847 --> 28:40.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The second point is, Judy,
what's holding
this together right now is that
it's not really

28:40.586 --> 28:41.853 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
a health care plan.

28:41.954 --> 28:43.922 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And it's not really a repeal.

28:44.022 --> 28:45.991 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
What it is, is a tax cut.

28:46.091 --> 28:55.767 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The top nine-tenths of 1 percent
of Americans
will receive $267 billion in tax
cuts over

28:55.867 --> 28:57.736 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
the next 10 years.

28:57.836 --> 29:03.775 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, quite bluntly put, when
this is scored,
when the numbers come out from
the Congressional

29:03.875 --> 29:10.549 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Budget Office, all you have to
do is go to
the testimony at the hearings of
Betsy DeVos

29:10.649 --> 29:17.889 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
and Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur
Ross and Gary
Cohn and all of the wealthy and
exactly what

29:17.990 --> 29:23.895 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this tax cut will mean for them
individually,
as single moms with two kids
lose their Medicaid

29:23.996 --> 29:25.764 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
coverage under it.

29:25.864 --> 29:30.335 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But it sounds
like, Michael,
the White House is prepared to
dismiss the

29:30.435 --> 29:33.872 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CBO numbers, or at least to
discount them.

29:33.972 --> 29:36.441 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, this is
actually a difference
in strategy.

29:36.541 --> 29:41.113 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
There has been a conflict
between the House
leadership and the
administration on whether

29:41.213 --> 29:45.117 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to attack CBO or not as an
authority in this.

29:45.217 --> 29:50.289 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is a tendency of this
administration,
to attack institutions, to
undermine the credibility

29:50.389 --> 29:55.861 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
of institutions that are
independent sources
of truth and analysis.

29:55.961 --> 29:58.497 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that would be a terrible
mistake in
this case.

29:58.597 --> 30:02.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CBO is a fairly respected
approach, not perfect.

30:02.401 --> 30:08.874 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But I think going after it would
indicate
a kind of disturbing tendency to
try to undermine

30:08.974 --> 30:11.410 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
other institutions in our
system, for their
own benefit.

30:11.510 --> 30:13.578 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, where do we
see this headed,
Mark, politically?

30:13.679 --> 30:18.116 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Well, I think it's
going to
founder.

30:18.216 --> 30:20.018 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I really do.

30:20.118 --> 30:24.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We're already getting the
signals from the
Republicans in the Senate, both
for the reasons

30:24.756 --> 30:27.025 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that Michael cited on the loss
of coverage.

30:27.125 --> 30:30.462 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A state like Alaska is going to
take an enormous
hit.

30:30.562 --> 30:36.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But even from Tom Cotton, the
conservative,
young conservative rising star
from Arkansas,

30:36.702 --> 30:38.970 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
saying, slow down, it couldn't
pass the Senate

30:39.071 --> 30:41.440 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, I think there are problems.

30:41.540 --> 30:46.478 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think you don't get Mitch
McConnell, the
sense that he's waiting for it
and just impatient

30:46.578 --> 30:48.847 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to get it over there to pass it,
because I
don't think he thinks he can.

30:48.947 --> 30:50.816 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you see
as the prospects?

30:50.916 --> 30:54.953 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: I think it had a
very rocky
start and it's going to get
rockier, particularly

30:55.053 --> 31:00.759 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
because of the CBO estimates
that Mark is
exactly right, could show
upwards of 12 million

31:00.859 --> 31:02.728 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
people losing coverage.

31:02.828 --> 31:10.202 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And that will dominate
discussion of this
bill in the next stage, and as
it gets very

31:10.302 --> 31:12.537 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
unfavorable to the
administration.

31:12.637 --> 31:16.942 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: You don't think
the administration
will be able to, again,
discount, dismiss

31:17.042 --> 31:19.211 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and say, well, you know, they
were wrong before?

31:19.311 --> 31:21.146 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We heard that from the White
House press secretary.

31:21.246 --> 31:25.083 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, they could
try to conduct
a campaign, go to the districts
of members,

31:25.183 --> 31:28.720 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
pressure them, call out their
Internet legions.

31:28.820 --> 31:30.689 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They could try to press on this.

31:30.789 --> 31:35.927 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But, if it happens that way, it
will only
happen through pressure, and not
through enthusiasm.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.863 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That's not what we're -- we're
not seeing
much enthusiasm.

31:37.963 --> 31:40.265 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, let's
turn to the
other big story of the week.

31:40.365 --> 31:43.835 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And it's Russia in all its
different forms.

31:43.935 --> 31:49.241 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mark, you had the president
tweeting last
Saturday morning that President
Obama was

31:49.341 --> 31:54.279 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
behind a wiretap as, evidently
part of the
Russia investigation.

31:54.379 --> 31:56.248 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
You have stories.

31:56.348 --> 32:00.485 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know that, just yesterday,
the FBI director
met with Republican leaders on
the Hill to

32:00.585 --> 32:01.653 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
brief them on the latest.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.522 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We don't know what was said.

32:03.622 --> 32:08.393 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And there's a story in The New
York Times
today that the FBI doesn't see a
clear connection

32:08.493 --> 32:13.565 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
between the Trump campaign and
Russia, and
yet all these bits and pieces
keep coming.

32:13.665 --> 32:20.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Do we have any more clarity on
Russia and
the Trump campaign and
transition today than

32:20.405 --> 32:21.873 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
we did a month ago?

32:21.973 --> 32:23.842 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: I don't see it,
Judy.

32:23.942 --> 32:29.915 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, I think there's
circumstantial evidence
of contacts or relationships
certainly with

32:30.015 --> 32:34.653 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
those within the Trump world
throughout the
campaign we have.

32:34.753 --> 32:38.557 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there isn't a gun, let alone
a smoking
gun.

32:38.657 --> 32:44.362 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But we do have -- as a
consequence of what
the president did last Saturday,
we have got

32:44.462 --> 32:52.204 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
pressure for greater, more
intense and more
public hearings and
investigations.

32:52.304 --> 32:58.410 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I will just say on this the
tweet last
Saturday was so grave.

32:58.510 --> 33:03.815 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, this is the 45th
president of the
United States accusing the 44th
president

33:03.915 --> 33:10.388 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of the United States of criminal
activity,
and with no basis, no evidence,
no context,

33:10.488 --> 33:12.524 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
no witnesses, nothing.

33:12.624 --> 33:20.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, 30 minutes later, he tweets
again about
Arnold Schwarzenegger's ratings
on "Celebrity

33:20.532 --> 33:22.167 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Apprentice."

33:22.267 --> 33:26.204 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He has just jeopardized the
relationship between
the president who preceded him.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.840 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Every president needs other
presidents.

33:28.940 --> 33:30.775 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They need the relationship.

33:30.876 --> 33:36.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he's just done something so
grave and
inflicted such a major wound on
the body politic.

33:36.514 --> 33:37.782 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It won't heal.

33:37.883 --> 33:41.519 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: I think there
are billows
of smoke here.

33:41.620 --> 33:42.954 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I mean, I think...

33:43.054 --> 33:44.823 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What do you mean?

33:44.923 --> 33:48.093 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: I think there
are lots of
ties that are being discovered
between the

33:48.193 --> 33:50.262 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Trump inner circle and Russia.

33:50.362 --> 33:55.567 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, in fact, the attorney
general had to
recuse himself because of
unreported contact.

33:55.667 --> 34:01.606 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we have learned that Flynn,
the former
national security adviser, was
doing work

34:01.706 --> 34:05.143 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
on behalf of individuals
associated with the
Turkish government.

34:05.243 --> 34:11.049 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
So, you're creating the
impression of a foreign
policy bought and sold by
dictators.

34:11.149 --> 34:13.018 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
This is quite serious.

34:13.118 --> 34:19.457 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
This is an unfolding, ongoing
ethics disaster
at the highest levels, I think
we're seeing.

34:19.557 --> 34:21.192 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: But, again --
Mark.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.828 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Just one thing I
want to point
out, Judy.

34:23.929 --> 34:28.867 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the time of the Cuban Missile
Crisis, when
the world stood at the brink,
Soviets and

34:28.967 --> 34:33.271 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
America, over the Cuban missiles
in Cuba,
President Kennedy sent Dean
Acheson, a former

34:33.371 --> 34:38.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
secretary of state, to see
General Charles
de Gaulle to tell him exactly,
brief him personally,

34:38.143 --> 34:40.345 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as the president's emissary, on
what was going
on.

34:40.445 --> 34:45.250 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
At the end of that talk, he said
to General
de Gaulle, I have been
authorized by the president

34:45.350 --> 34:49.921 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to show you the photographic
evidence we have,
and for your eyes only.

34:50.021 --> 34:52.724 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And General de Gaulle said, no,
no, no, that's
not necessary.

34:52.824 --> 34:56.728 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
All I need is the word of the
president of
the United States.

34:56.828 --> 35:02.467 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
There comes a time in every
administration
when you need the president to
be credible,

35:02.567 --> 35:06.871 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the president to have the trust
and confidence
of leaders around the world in a
time of crisis.

35:06.972 --> 35:13.178 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I can see no reason that
anybody would
ever say this about Donald
Trump: All I need

35:13.278 --> 35:14.612 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
is the word of the president of
the United
States.

35:14.713 --> 35:18.183 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael, how does
this administration
get beyond this?

35:18.283 --> 35:24.923 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Are we looking now at something
that is just
going to go on for months and
months, if not

35:25.023 --> 35:26.825 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
years?

35:26.925 --> 35:29.160 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Well, I think
we're seeing
that self-investigation through
the attorney

35:29.260 --> 35:32.197 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
general is not going to be
useful in this
case.

35:32.297 --> 35:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Someone is going to have to have
a real inquiry
here.

35:36.001 --> 35:37.435 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You could do a select committee.

35:37.535 --> 35:39.104 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You could do a special
prosecutor.

35:39.204 --> 35:42.407 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You do some other voice of
authority here.

35:42.507 --> 35:47.345 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The FBI doesn't have a huge
amount of credibility,
particularly given what Comey
did in the election,

35:47.445 --> 35:52.017 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
which may have helped Trump more
than the
Russians did.

35:52.117 --> 35:58.123 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think the administration,
whenever you hear
the phrase "Sean Spicer says,"
it makes the

35:58.223 --> 36:01.092 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
statement more incredible, not
more credible.

36:01.192 --> 36:05.730 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And I think that we have a
Congress that's
quite politicized on this set of
issues.

36:05.830 --> 36:11.469 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We're going to need some type of
independent
voice to determine what's
happening in this

36:11.569 --> 36:12.737 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
case.

36:12.837 --> 36:15.540 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, on that
note, we shake
our heads.

36:15.640 --> 36:16.941 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

36:17.042 --> 36:17.709 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Michael Gerson,
Mark Shields,
thank you both.

36:17.809 --> 36:24.315 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MARK SHIELDS: Thank you, Judy.

36:24.416 --> 36:31.423 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL GERSON: Thank you.

36:31.523 --> 36:37.729 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: There's a lot
going on in
the political world of
Washington these days,

36:37.829 --> 36:43.601 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
but the hottest ticket in town
may be for
a museum exhibition by a
Japanese artist exploring

36:43.701 --> 36:46.204 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
worlds well beyond today's
headlines.

36:46.304 --> 36:48.239 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Jeffrey Brown has our story.

36:48.339 --> 36:54.813 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: It's called an
Infinity Mirror
Room, and the stretching out of
time and space,

36:54.913 --> 36:59.984 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
an effect created through the
use of lights,
reflection and objects, is one
of the obsessions

37:00.085 --> 37:03.054 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
of artist Yayoi Kusama.

37:03.154 --> 37:07.792 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Right now at Washington's
Hirshhorn Museum,
people are lining up to
experience her world

37:07.892 --> 37:12.530 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of whimsy, color, shapes, and
peeks into the
beyond.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.499 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Museum director Melissa Chiu:

37:14.599 --> 37:16.301 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MELISSA CHIU, Director,
Smithsonian's Hirshhorn
Museum: There are fewer and
fewer moments

37:16.401 --> 37:23.308 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
today that you're alone in
something that
feels universal.

37:23.408 --> 37:27.145 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You are there in amongst the
cosmos in one
piece.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.513 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's just light.

37:28.613 --> 37:31.349 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And it's a kind of -- it's very
poignant and
very compelling.

37:31.449 --> 37:36.754 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Even as the wider
world has
caught on, Kusama has in fact
been a much-loved

37:36.855 --> 37:43.394 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
star in the art world since the
early 1960s,
after coming to New York from
her native Japan.

37:43.495 --> 37:49.434 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Her earliest works already
displayed motifs
that remain to this day, notably
the repetition

37:49.534 --> 37:56.274 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of forms, especially simple
marks and polka
dots, that Kusama gives a more
cosmic significance,

37:56.374 --> 38:00.512 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as in her series of paintings
called "Infinity
Nets."

38:00.612 --> 38:05.884 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In an interview with Hirshhorn
curators in
December, the 87-year-old
artist, as colorful

38:05.984 --> 38:10.989 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as her work, spoke of her
attempt to reach
the infinite through the
repetition of images.

38:11.089 --> 38:15.960 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YAYOI KUSAMA, Artist (through
translator):
The same things piled one on top
of another

38:16.060 --> 38:20.899 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
creates an expanding world that
reaches out
to the edges of the universe.

38:20.999 --> 38:27.272 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That is the simple image I have.

38:27.372 --> 38:32.944 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This effect of continual
repetition calls
out to the human senses, and, in
return, deep

38:33.044 --> 38:35.780 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
inside of our hearts, we yearn
for true amazement.

38:35.880 --> 38:39.217 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Curator Mika
Yoshitake put
together the exhibition.

38:39.317 --> 38:42.520 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIKA YOSHITAKE, Curator,
Hirshhorn Museum:
Her work is very
process-oriented, meaning

38:42.620 --> 38:50.028 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
that there is a very lengthy,
you know, physical
labor that goes on, that the
repetition of

38:50.128 --> 38:56.067 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
certain motifs like the nets or
the polka
dots, and they -- it kind of
expands organically.

38:56.167 --> 39:01.172 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: That
compulsiveness is there
in sculptures of phallic forms:
a rowboat

39:01.272 --> 39:07.278 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
titled "Violet Obsession,"
furniture that
you might not want to sit in,
but Kusama herself

39:07.378 --> 39:11.049 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
was happy to, and happy to be
photographed
in.

39:11.149 --> 39:16.521 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In fact, she often brought
herself into the
picture, a polka dotted,
kimono-wearing, downtown

39:16.621 --> 39:22.961 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
'60s art world figure known for
creating happenings
on the streets, sometimes with
nudes, sometimes

39:23.061 --> 39:25.163 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
protesting the Vietnam War.

39:25.263 --> 39:30.735 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She also began to make the
Infinity Mirror
Rooms, eventually 20 in all, six
at the center

39:30.835 --> 39:34.505 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of this new exhibition, the most
ever gathered
together.

39:34.606 --> 39:38.176 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Part of the attraction of
Kusama's work clearly
is the fun house effect.

39:38.276 --> 39:45.316 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
I mean, here I am, with
cameraman Malcolm,
in a field of pumpkins that
stretches on,

39:45.416 --> 39:46.718 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
yes, to infinity.

39:46.818 --> 39:48.720 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKA YOSHITAKE: It's about life.

39:48.820 --> 39:51.389 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about confronting our
mortality.

39:51.489 --> 39:56.327 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It's about filling a void that
she has experienced.

39:56.427 --> 40:02.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And that incessant energy, a
desire to connect
with people, I think it's about
the clarity

40:03.001 --> 40:04.836 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of vision and also perception.

40:04.936 --> 40:08.172 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: But Kusama's
story is more
complicated.

40:08.273 --> 40:13.444 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She suffered from hallucinations
from childhood,
and experienced early trauma
from being forced

40:13.544 --> 40:17.315 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
by her mother to spy on her
father as he had
affairs.

40:17.415 --> 40:21.252 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She had a breakdown in the 1970s
that forced
her to return to Japan.

40:21.352 --> 40:27.358 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And, for more than 40 years,
she's voluntarily
lived in a psychiatric hospital,
even as she's

40:27.458 --> 40:32.964 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
continued to work in a studio a
block away,
making what she's referred to as
art medicine.

40:33.064 --> 40:35.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIKA YOSHITAKE: Art for her is a
form of therapy.

40:35.833 --> 40:42.006 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So she needs the art, or else
she will probably
not survive.

40:42.106 --> 40:49.681 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is somebody who needs to
have a ritual
every day of, you know,
painting.

40:49.781 --> 40:54.819 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Certainly, her
work brought
a good deal of pleasure at the
Hirshhorn exhibition,

40:54.919 --> 41:00.391 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
especially in the Obliteration
Room, a pristine
white-walled space in which
visitors were

41:00.491 --> 41:04.762 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
invited to join in the
art-making by adding
dots of their own.

41:04.862 --> 41:10.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Captured in time-lapse video,
the room was
being transformed, just as
Kusama intended,

41:10.935 --> 41:12.670 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
according to museum director
Chiu.

41:12.770 --> 41:17.108 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MELISSA CHIU: The word
obliteration has a
very harsh kind of meaning, but,
for her this

41:17.208 --> 41:22.447 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
was, in a way, how she thinks
about her art,
that her art is transforming her
own life,

41:22.547 --> 41:27.919 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
helping her to deal with life,
but also potentially
allowing others to interact with
it here in

41:28.019 --> 41:29.354 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this room.

41:29.454 --> 41:31.522 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: Museum-goers
couldn't resist,
and neither could I.

41:31.622 --> 41:35.827 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, if I put it like this...

41:35.927 --> 41:37.395 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MELISSA CHIU: Put wherever you
like, Jeff.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.396 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:38.496 --> 41:39.397 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MELISSA CHIU: So, balancing.

41:39.497 --> 41:40.398 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
See how he's balancing?

41:40.498 --> 41:41.399 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(LAUGHTER)

41:41.499 --> 41:42.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JEFFREY BROWN: Yes.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.401 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.736 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Yes.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.604 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MELISSA CHIU: You could create
patterns from
randomness.

41:46.704 --> 41:47.071 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
As you can see, some people
couldn't resist
and they have tried to create a
line with

41:47.171 --> 41:47.705 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
their dots.

41:47.805 --> 41:48.639 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But all bets are off.

41:48.740 --> 41:50.475 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can do whatever you like.

41:50.575 --> 41:54.479 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEFFREY BROWN: There's a lot of
humor and
a lot of pain in the work of
Yayoi Kusama,

41:54.579 --> 41:59.550 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
who continues to put in full
days at her studio
creating new paintings and
sculptures, even

41:59.650 --> 42:03.254 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
as record crowds here flock to
see the results.

42:03.354 --> 42:08.493 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
From the Hirshhorn Museum in
Washington, D.C.,
I'm Jeffrey Brown for the "PBS
NewsHour."

42:08.593 --> 42:11.662 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: The exhibition
is in Washington
through May 14.

42:11.763 --> 42:14.298 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Then, for two years, it travels
to Seattle,
Los Angeles, Toronto, Cleveland,
and Atlanta.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

42:16.200 --> 42:21.305 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be back shortly with
a look at
the meaning of happiness with a
"NewsHour"

42:21.406 --> 42:22.707 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
essay.

42:22.807 --> 42:25.243 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, first, take a moment to
hear from your
local PBS station.

42:25.343 --> 42:31.983 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's a chance to offer your
support, which
helps keep programs like ours on
the air.

42:32.083 --> 42:34.986 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

42:35.086 --> 42:52.069 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: Finally, an
essay from Emily
Esfahani Smith.

42:52.170 --> 43:01.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
She is trained in psychology,
and author of
the recent book "The Power of
Meaning."

43:01.479 --> 43:10.354 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
An editor at Stanford
University's Hoover
Institution, tonight, Emily
offers her Humble

43:10.455 --> 43:16.394 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Opinion on what we should search
for.

43:16.494 --> 43:26.771 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
EMILY ESFAHANI SMITH, Author,
"The Power of
Meaning: Crafting a Life That
Matters": In

43:26.871 --> 43:43.654 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
recent years, psychologists have
started looking
more closely at how the
single-minded pursuit

43:43.754 --> 43:53.097 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of happiness affects us, and
they have come
to what seems like a
counterintuitive conclusion:

43:53.197 --> 43:58.769 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Chasing happiness and obsessing
over it, the
way our culture encourages us to
do, can actually

43:58.870 --> 44:00.671 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
make people unhappy and lonely.

44:00.771 --> 44:05.510 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But it's different when we set
another goal
for ourselves, when we search
for and pursue

44:05.610 --> 44:06.644 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
meaning in life.

44:06.744 --> 44:09.981 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Human beings are creatures that
yearn for
meaning.

44:10.081 --> 44:17.154 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
When we look up at the stars,
for example,
we don't see random balls of
fire.

44:17.255 --> 44:25.763 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We see swans and bears, we tell
stories and
myths, and we wonder about where
we came from,

44:25.863 --> 44:34.772 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
our place in the universe, and
how we can
make our lives count.

44:34.872 --> 44:39.076 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The same questions lie at the
center of much
great art, literature, and
philosophy.

44:39.176 --> 44:43.814 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
The first great work of human
literature,
"The Epic of Gilgamesh," is
about a hero's

44:43.915 --> 44:51.122 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
quest to figure out how to live,
given the
fact that he will die.

44:51.222 --> 44:58.996 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in the centuries since
Gilgamesh's tale
was told, that quest has
remained as urgent

44:59.096 --> 45:00.798 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
as ever.

45:00.898 --> 45:05.836 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We all want to know that our
lives amount
to more than the sum of our
experiences.

45:05.937 --> 45:13.311 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We all need a why to help us get
through the
good and the bad of life.

45:13.411 --> 45:16.314 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, what is a meaningful life?

45:16.414 --> 45:23.054 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Social science points to one
defining feature.

45:23.154 --> 46:07.031 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You connect and contribute to
something beyond
yourself.

46:07.131 --> 48:24.802 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
That could be

48:24.902 --> 50:14.845 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
your family, your work, nature,
or God.

50:14.945 --> 51:20.477 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
And when

51:20.577 --> 51:25.382 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
people say their lives are
meaningful, it's
because three conditions have
been satisfied:

51:25.482 --> 51:30.587 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They believe their lives matter,
they have
a sense of purpose that drives
them forward,

51:30.688 --> 51:34.758 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and they think their lives are
coherent and
make sense.

51:34.858 --> 51:40.030 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It sounds like a lot, but that
last point
is something you can do right
now.

51:40.130 --> 51:45.302 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
People tell me the simple act of
storytelling
gives meaning, or can at least
clear the path

51:45.402 --> 51:47.171 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to it.

51:47.271 --> 51:50.641 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That, I think, might explain the
rise of rap
and hip-hop and the popularity
of the radio

51:50.741 --> 51:54.044 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
series "StoryCorps" and "The
Moth."

51:54.144 --> 51:58.015 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Making a narrative out of the
events in your
life provides clarity.

51:58.115 --> 52:01.819 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It offers a framework that goes
beyond the
day-to-day.

52:01.919 --> 52:06.957 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It's the act itself, and not
necessarily sharing
their story with others, that
helps people

52:07.057 --> 52:10.194 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
make sense of themselves and
their lives.

52:10.294 --> 52:19.003 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we all have the power to
tell or to re-tell
our life story in more positive
ways.

JUDY WOODRUFF: On the "NewsHour"
online right
now: Why do humans have brains
the size they

52:30.948 --> 52:32.649 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
are?

52:32.750 --> 52:36.887 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
It's a mystery, but a new
mathematical model
may help scientists solve that
question.

52:36.987 --> 52:42.559 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Also, for the first time, a
major sports gear
company has designed a sporty
hijab.

52:42.659 --> 52:47.164 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can read more about how they
created their
design, with feedback from
athletes who wear

52:47.264 --> 52:48.332 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a head scarf.

52:48.432 --> 52:52.536 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's on our Web site,
PBS.org/NewsHour.

52:52.636 --> 52:56.707 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That is -- and coming up
tomorrow night on
"PBS NewsHour Weekend."

52:56.807 --> 53:01.812 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And we will be back right here
on Monday with
former Vice President Al Gore,
who looks at

53:01.912 --> 53:06.917 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"The Assault on Reason" in the
wake of the
2016 presidential election --
that's his book

53:07.017 --> 53:09.219 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
-- and the beginning of the
Trump presidency.

53:09.319 --> 53:10.754 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's the "NewsHour" for
tonight.

53:10.854 --> 53:11.755 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

53:11.855 --> 53:12.756 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
HARI SREENIVASAN: And I'm Hari
Sreenivasan.

53:12.856 --> 53:13.757 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Have a great weekend.

53:13.857 --> 53:19.730 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Thank you, and we will see you
soon.
