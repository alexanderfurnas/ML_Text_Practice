JUDY WOODRUFF: The president
delivered a lengthy,
emotional speech as he unveiled
new steps

00:04.938 --> 00:07.641 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
today to reduce gun violence.

00:07.674 --> 00:11.945 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Republicans quickly denounced
many of his
remarks, and others wondered
just how much

00:11.979 --> 00:18.418 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
impact his changes could have in
a country
where Americans own an estimated
300 million

00:18.452 --> 00:20.254 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
guns.

00:20.287 --> 00:24.124 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Victims' families hailed many of
the measures,
and the president argued that --
quote -- "We

00:24.157 --> 00:27.995 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
maybe cannot save everybody, but
we could
save some."

00:28.028 --> 00:38.505 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA, President of the
United States:
Fort Hood. Binghamton. Aurora.
Oak Creek.

00:38.538 --> 00:48.348 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Newtown. The Navy Yard. Santa
Barbara. Charleston.
San Bernardino. Too many.

00:48.382 --> 00:55.255 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: With that litany
of mass shootings,
President Obama announced his
decision to

00:55.289 --> 00:56.990 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
use executive action.

00:57.024 --> 01:05.432 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: People are dying.
And the constant
excuses for inaction no longer
suffice.

01:05.465 --> 01:11.104 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
That's why we're here today, not
to debate
the last mass shooting, but to
do something

01:11.138 --> 01:13.040 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to try to prevent the next one.

01:13.073 --> 01:18.378 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The audience was
filled with
victims of gun violence,
including former

01:18.412 --> 01:24.851 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Arizona Congresswoman Gabby
Giffords, who
received a standing ovation when
she arrived.

01:24.885 --> 01:30.791 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Standing behind the president
were other survivors
and family members of people
killed by guns

01:30.824 --> 01:37.864 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
over the past 20 years. They
included parents
of some of the 26 slain at Sandy
Hook Elementary

01:37.898 --> 01:42.102 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
School in Newtown, Connecticut,
in 2012.

01:42.135 --> 01:47.240 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The president was moved to tears
over the
20 children who died there.

01:47.274 --> 01:58.585 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: First-graders, and
from every
family who never imagined that
their loved

01:58.618 --> 02:08.729 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one would be taken from our
lives by a bullet
from a gun.

02:08.729 --> 02:17.270 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
one would be taken from our
lives by a bullet
from a gun.

02:17.304 --> 02:25.145 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Every time I think about those
kids, it gets
me mad. And, by the way, it
happens on the

02:25.178 --> 02:26.780 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
streets of Chicago every day.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.648 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:28.682 --> 02:33.220 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: After Newtown,
Mr. Obama tried
to get Congress to pass
comprehensive background

02:33.253 --> 02:38.992 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
checks for gun buyers, but he
failed. Today,
he declared it can't end there.

02:39.026 --> 02:42.396 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: So, the gun lobby
may be holding
Congress hostage right now, but
they cannot

02:42.429 --> 02:43.397 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
hold America hostage.

02:43.430 --> 02:44.931 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:44.965 --> 02:48.068 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: We do not have to
accept this
carnage as the price of freedom.

02:48.101 --> 02:49.903 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

02:49.936 --> 02:54.207 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now he's using
presidential
powers for a limited effort to
expand private

02:54.241 --> 02:57.577 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
gun sales subject to background
checks.

02:57.611 --> 03:03.417 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
To do that, the government will
widen the
definition of gun dealers and
sellers to include

03:03.450 --> 03:12.659 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
gun shows, Web sites and flea
markets. And
the FBI will hire 230 background
check processors

03:12.692 --> 03:14.895 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to help strengthen enforcement.

03:14.928 --> 03:21.334 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
A recent Harvard study found
that up to 40
percent of guns purchased in the
U.S. don't

03:21.368 --> 03:24.337 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
go through any background checks
at all.

03:24.371 --> 03:30.644 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Separately, Mr. Obama called
today for more
research into technologies to
keep guns safe.

03:30.677 --> 03:36.216 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: If we can set it
up so you can't
unlock your phone unless you've
got the right

03:36.249 --> 03:40.053 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fingerprint, why can't we do the
same thing
for our guns?

03:40.087 --> 03:41.855 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(APPLAUSE)

03:41.888 --> 03:48.795 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: If a child can't
open a bottle
of aspirin, we should make sure
that they

03:48.829 --> 03:50.097 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
can't pull a trigger on a gun.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.498 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

03:51.531 --> 03:53.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
BARACK OBAMA: Right?

03:53.366 --> 03:58.939 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: On the
presidential campaign
trail, Republican candidates
roundly rejected

03:58.972 --> 04:01.141 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
President Obama's actions.

04:01.174 --> 04:03.009 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Ted Cruz was in Iowa.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.412 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
SEN. TED CRUZ (R-TX),
Presidential Candidate:
I can tell you right now those
executive orders

04:05.445 --> 04:10.050 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
are not worth the paper they are
printed on,
because, when you live by the
pen, you die

04:10.083 --> 04:13.687 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
by the pen, and my pen has got
an eraser.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.456 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And Jeb Bush
spoke in New Hampshire.

04:16.490 --> 04:19.226 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JEB BUSH (R), Presidential
Candidate: It's
not going to solve any problems
by having

04:19.259 --> 04:24.898 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the so-called gun show loophole
be taken -- taken
care of by executive order. The
president

04:24.931 --> 04:28.802 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
doesn't have authority to do it.
If there
is an issue related to federal
gun laws, then

04:28.835 --> 04:31.972 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
he ought to go to Congress and
try to forge
consensus to make it happen. He
doesn't have

04:32.005 --> 04:33.773 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
this power.

04:33.807 --> 04:37.611 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: The president had
anticipated
some of the reaction, insisting
he's within

04:37.644 --> 04:42.616 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
his authority and that he's
upholding the
Second Amendment's right to bear
arms.

04:42.649 --> 04:52.826 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
BARACK OBAMA: Contrary to the
claims of what
some gun rights proponents have
suggested,

04:52.859 --> 05:00.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
this hasn't been the first step
in some slippery
slope to mass confiscation.
Contrary to claims

05:00.133 --> 05:10.043 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
of some presidential candidates,
apparently,
before this meeting, this is not
a plot to

05:10.076 --> 05:11.845 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
take away everybody's guns.

05:11.878 --> 05:16.516 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Still, the
president may need
additional funding from Congress
for mental

05:16.550 --> 05:23.390 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
health care and extra FBI
workers, money the
Republican-controlled Congress
is unlikely

05:23.423 --> 05:25.258 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to approve.

05:25.292 --> 05:30.997 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Speaker of the House Paul Ryan
made that clear
today in a statement that said
-- quote -- "His

05:31.031 --> 05:35.969 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
words and actions amount to a
form of intimidation
that undermines liberty."

05:36.002 --> 05:41.274 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Meanwhile, gun sales are
soaring. More guns
were sold in December, after the
attacks in

05:41.308 --> 05:43.076 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
San Bernardino, California, than
almost any
month in the last 20 years.

05:43.109 --> 05:43.777 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Let's look at both the symbol
and substance
of what the president announced
today and

05:43.810 --> 05:45.612 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
what its impact is likely to be.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.414 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Feinblatt is the president
of Everytown
for Gun Safety, which was
created after the

05:47.447 --> 05:49.249 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Newtown shootings and supported
in part by
former New York City Mayor
Michael Bloomberg.

05:49.282 --> 05:51.151 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And David Kopel, he is research
director at
The Independence Institute. It's
a libertarian

05:51.184 --> 05:51.518 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
think tank. And he's well --
also an adjunct
professor of constitutional law
at the University

05:51.551 --> 05:52.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Denver.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.020 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And we welcome both of you.

05:54.054 --> 05:54.854 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
John Feinblatt, is the president
on the right
track with these moves that he
says are going

05:54.888 --> 05:56.623 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to reduce the number of gun
deaths?

05:56.656 --> 05:57.290 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT, Everytown for
Gun Safety:
Yes, I think what the president
did today

05:57.324 --> 05:59.226 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
was pretty straightforward.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.027 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
What he did was took some
actions to enforce
laws already on the books. One
was, he clarified

06:01.061 --> 06:01.595 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the law, that, if you're in the
business of
selling guns, you need to get a
license and

06:01.628 --> 06:03.430 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
do a background check.

06:03.463 --> 06:05.232 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And the second is, he said that
he was going
to devote the resources to
enforce it. And

06:05.265 --> 06:06.967 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
I think that, when you combine
clarifying
the law with additional
enforcement resources,

06:07.000 --> 06:08.835 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
what you're going to do is
interrupt some
commercial sellers who are
actually taking

06:08.868 --> 06:09.135 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
advantage of loopholes in the
laws, not getting
a license, and selling without
background

06:09.169 --> 06:10.537 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
checks.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.272 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: David Kopel, do
you -- excuse
me for interrupting.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.140 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
David Kopel, do you agree the
president is
generally on the right track
with this?

06:14.174 --> 06:15.709 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
DAVID KOPEL, The Independence
Institute: Well,
I agree with most of what Mr.
Feinblatt just

06:15.742 --> 06:17.644 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
said, because the president
didn't do anything
at all that changes the law.

06:17.677 --> 06:19.379 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He just very forcefully and
passionately restated
what has been the law since
1968, which is,

06:19.412 --> 06:21.147 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
if you are engaged in the
business, as the
statute says, of selling
firearms, then you

06:21.181 --> 06:22.949 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
have to have a federal firearms
license. And
of course he's correct that that
mandate is

06:22.983 --> 06:23.350 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the same whether you sell in
your basement
or at a gun store or on the
Internet or at

06:23.383 --> 06:25.185 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
a gun show.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.920 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And it's always been like that.
So, he restated
it. He didn't change anything,
but I think

06:26.953 --> 06:28.788 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
it's fine to remind people who
might not know
about that requirement that it
exists.

06:28.822 --> 06:29.656 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, John
Feinblatt, it's really
not that much of a change? It's
just a matter

06:29.689 --> 06:31.458 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of enforcing what was already
there?

06:31.491 --> 06:33.360 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JOHN FEINBLATT: Look, the law
has been blurry.
It's always -- the law has been,
if you're

06:33.393 --> 06:35.195 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
engaged in the business of
selling guns, you
need to get a license and do
background checks.

06:35.228 --> 06:39.228 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But the problem was that there
was never any
meat on the bone. So, people
didn't know what
