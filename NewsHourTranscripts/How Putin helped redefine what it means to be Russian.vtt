JUDY WOODRUFF: This week,
we begin our weeklong series
Inside Putin's Russia.

00:04.666 --> 00:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
With support from the
Pulitzer Center on
Crisis Reporting, special
correspondent Nick Schifrin

00:09.300 --> 00:14.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and producer Zach Fannin
traveled to more than a dozen
cities, conducted 40 interviews,

00:15.033 --> 00:17.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
and were arrested twice.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They will report later
on Russian propaganda,
Russia's opposition,
Russians who join ISIS,

00:22.800 --> 00:24.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and the tense
relationship with the U.S.

00:24.333 --> 00:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But the first story explores
a new Russian identity.

00:27.500 --> 00:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's a combination of religion,
old Russian traditions, and
rediscovered patriotism.

00:34.433 --> 00:38.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This new identity helps explain
how people in today's Russia
think, how President Putin

00:39.100 --> 00:40.666 align:left position:25%,start line:86.67% size:75%
acts, and why he
remains popular.

00:40.666 --> 00:45.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We begin in the southern
city of Krasnodar.

00:45.000 --> 00:50.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It is
Sunday morning in Russia's
conservative south.

00:52.933 --> 00:56.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
More than 70 percent of
Russians are Orthodox Christian.

00:56.133 --> 01:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And under President
Vladimir Putin, the church
has been revitalized.

01:02.433 --> 01:04.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Archpriest Ivan Garmash
is known as Father John.

01:04.733 --> 01:07.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
He tells parishioners
there's only one way
to be a true Christian.

01:07.700 --> 01:11.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And he says being a true
Christian is the only
way to be a true Russian.

01:11.433 --> 01:14.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FATHER JOHN, Archpriest
(through translator): The
state and my faith are united.

01:14.933 --> 01:16.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They can't be separated.

01:16.566 --> 01:19.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The values of the church
and the state coincide.

01:19.933 --> 01:24.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Russia,
faith is patriotic.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The Orthodox Church criticizes
liberal Western values as
heresies, while Orthodox priests

01:29.300 --> 01:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
bless Russian weapons
and endorse Putin
politically and personally.

01:32.933 --> 01:35.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The president's faith
increases his popularity.

01:35.266 --> 01:39.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
FATHER JOHN (through
translator): He is a
religious man, and he
takes part in the divine

01:39.500 --> 01:41.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
worship with the
people in churches.

01:41.566 --> 01:46.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What the president is doing,
what the government is doing, of
course, we support it, because

01:46.266 --> 01:48.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
he acts conscientiously
and truthfully.

01:48.800 --> 01:53.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Today's
reenergized Orthodox
Church helps create pride
in a shared religion.

01:56.133 --> 02:01.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And historic Russian symbols,
like Cossacks, help create
pride in shared traditions; 500

02:06.133 --> 02:08.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
years ago, Cossacks became
the Russian tsars' henchmen.

02:08.833 --> 02:13.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They were famous and feared
and helped police the
Russian empire's borders.

02:15.233 --> 02:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The Soviets persecuted them.

02:17.133 --> 02:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Today's Russia restores them.

02:20.700 --> 02:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Cossacks fills Krasnodar's
streets at an annual parade.

02:24.433 --> 02:29.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They believe Russia should
be governed by tradition,
rather than the rule of law.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR GROMOV, Former Army
Leader (through translator):
Only the nation that has kept

02:31.300 --> 02:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its traditions and
honors them more than
the law deserves respect.

02:35.900 --> 02:38.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The strength of a nation
is in its traditions.

02:38.366 --> 02:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For 17
years, Vladimir Gromov led
the regional Cossack army.

02:45.266 --> 02:48.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He revitalized this
event, and helped get the
Cossacks state sponsorship.

02:50.333 --> 02:52.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
President Putin awarded him
the Order of Friendship Medal.

02:52.366 --> 02:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Gromov considers Putin the
custodian of Russian pride and
stability, preventing the chaos

02:58.033 --> 03:00.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the 1990s.

03:00.166 --> 03:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR GROMOV (through
translator): If it
wasn't for President
Putin, Russia as a state

03:04.200 --> 03:09.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
would be struggling through the
toughest times now, and possibly
may have ceased to exist.

03:10.633 --> 03:12.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Only Putin has saved the
state from total collapse.

03:12.300 --> 03:15.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And, in
return, Cossacks do what
they feel saves Putin.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
WOMAN (singing): Putin
will teach you to
love the motherland.

03:20.066 --> 03:23.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: During the 2014
Olympics, the band Pussy Riot
performed a song that disparages

03:23.233 --> 03:26.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

03:26.333 --> 03:31.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Cossacks unleashed their
centuries-old tradition
of vigilante violence.

03:33.333 --> 03:37.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, Cossacks doused the
main opposition leader, Alexei
Navalny, and attacked his staff.

03:41.633 --> 03:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And in Kaliningrad, when a
small group of demonstrators
demanded the government change

03:45.233 --> 03:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
its foreign policy, a
Cossack beat up 63-year-old
protester Yevgeniy Greishen.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He lost 80 percent
of his eyesight.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
YEVGENIY GREISHEN, Protester
(through translator):
If the regime can't
suppress civil protest

03:55.966 --> 04:00.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
through legal means,
they punish the people
through affiliated
associations, like the

04:00.600 --> 04:01.566 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Cossacks.

04:01.566 --> 04:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
The regime acts through them.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Why
have the authorities
cracked down so much?

04:06.733 --> 04:10.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
YEVGENIY GREISHEN
(through translator): In
Russia, statehood comes
first, and human rights

04:10.833 --> 04:12.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
come last.

04:12.833 --> 04:16.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They use any means to prove the
state is the most important,
more important than a human.

04:18.900 --> 04:21.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The idea that
the state is more important
than the people is actually

04:21.000 --> 04:22.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
not new.

04:22.266 --> 04:23.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russians have long had
a collective identity.

04:23.766 --> 04:28.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEXANDER DUGIN, Russia: For us,
the man is collective concept.

04:28.433 --> 04:33.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We consider ourselves to
be the part of the whole.

04:33.233 --> 04:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, to be Russian means
to share the same cultural
and historic identity.

04:40.800 --> 04:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For years,
TV fixture and firebrand
Alexander Dugin inspired
the Kremlin's ideology.

04:46.600 --> 04:51.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says Russia's collective
identity comes from patriotism,
projection of power, and

04:51.866 --> 04:53.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
respect for the ruler.

04:53.866 --> 04:57.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Putin's tapped into all three,
connecting today's Russia
to its imperial grandeur.

04:57.066 --> 04:58.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN:
Patriotism is organic.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It is not artificial.

05:00.833 --> 05:05.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Empire, or state, is
not something additional
or artificial, because
it is our breath, our

05:08.033 --> 05:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
skin, our organic way of life.

05:10.966 --> 05:15.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Today's
Kremlin uses that patriotism
to try and unite the
population and convince

05:15.600 --> 05:19.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
them only a powerful state
can protect them from enemies.

05:19.900 --> 05:21.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Enemy number one?

05:21.266 --> 05:22.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
The U.S.

05:22.766 --> 05:25.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: America is
on the brink of a revolution.

05:25.033 --> 05:29.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Dugin and the
Kremlin accuse the U.S. of
humiliating Russia by expanding

05:29.066 --> 05:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NATO to Russia's borders and
supporting revolutions in former
Soviet states and satellites.

05:36.033 --> 05:38.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Dugin advocates fighting
back by attacking the
West with asymmetric war.

05:38.433 --> 05:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You talk about introducing
geopolitical disorder,
actively supporting dissident
movements, extremism,

05:44.400 --> 05:46.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
racist, sectarian groups.

05:46.066 --> 05:47.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
This seems much
more than just...

05:47.333 --> 05:49.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ALEXANDER DUGIN: It's
exactly as you do.

05:49.066 --> 05:50.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's exactly what you do.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You are supporting
separatist group.

05:52.433 --> 05:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're supporting any kind of
nationalism, including Russian
nationalism that is against

05:56.566 --> 05:57.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Putin.

05:57.766 --> 06:01.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
My words are the mirror
what you are doing.

06:01.633 --> 06:06.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is mirror, and you are
frightened so much because you
are doing the same thing against

06:07.100 --> 06:09.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

06:09.266 --> 06:14.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In Ukraine,
that philosophy was weaponized.

06:16.666 --> 06:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Eastern Ukraine, Russia
aids local separatists
who fight against a
Ukrainian government that's

06:22.000 --> 06:24.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
pro-Western.

06:24.900 --> 06:29.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 2014 in Crimea,
Russia helped install
separatist leaders who
rushed through a referendum

06:30.766 --> 06:33.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
that led to Crimea's annexation.

06:33.700 --> 06:38.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The day of annexation,
Putin gave a speech
combining religion,
patriotism, and imperial

06:40.500 --> 06:42.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
history.

06:42.566 --> 06:45.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He said the West had been
subjugating Russia, and Russia
was finally demanding respect.

06:45.166 --> 06:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR PUTIN, Russian
President (through translator):
If you compress the spring all

06:49.500 --> 06:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the way to its limit,
it will snap back hard.

06:52.366 --> 06:56.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Russia is an independent,
active participant in
international affairs.

06:56.366 --> 07:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like other countries, it has
its own national interests that
need to be taken into account

07:00.633 --> 07:02.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and respected.

07:02.633 --> 07:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: It's impossible
to overstate how transformative
Eastern Ukraine and here,

07:11.133 --> 07:13.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Crimea, have been to
recent Russian memory.

07:13.700 --> 07:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After the Crimea annexation,
Putin's popularity spiked
to nearly 90 percent.

07:20.366 --> 07:22.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Russians told pollsters
that suddenly they felt
like a superpower again.

07:22.866 --> 07:25.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And Russians all over
the country mobilized.

07:25.966 --> 07:29.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's Denis Solomin in 2014
fighting in Eastern Ukraine.

07:29.433 --> 07:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
He's a former soldier who
was working a mid-management
retail job when he quit
and crossed the border.

07:33.966 --> 07:37.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENIS SOLOMIN, Retired
Soldier (through translator):
Now we hear that behind us.

07:37.766 --> 07:39.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
There's an intense battle.

07:39.233 --> 07:41.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Mortars and shells are
raining in our direction.

07:41.300 --> 07:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Solomin
went to war because of that
collective Russian identity.

07:45.533 --> 07:48.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He believed the Ukrainian
government was attacking
ethnic Russians.

07:48.666 --> 07:52.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DENIS SOLOMIN (through
translator): Those
people who were under
fire, I identified them

07:52.500 --> 07:56.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
as Russian people who need
protection by those who
can at least hold a weapon.

07:56.600 --> 08:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: What was
it about them that you
felt, I need to help them?

08:00.600 --> 08:03.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
DENIS SOLOMIN (through
translator): Those are
the people with the
same culture as mine,

08:03.700 --> 08:05.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the same language,
the same world view.

08:05.533 --> 08:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: He was convinced
of that by propaganda.

In May 2014, dozens of
pro-Russian separatists
died in Odessa, Ukraine.

08:13.100 --> 08:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DENIS SOLOMIN (through
translator): It probably
became the pivotal moment.

08:17.500 --> 08:21.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There was a lot of information
about how people were simply
getting beaten and killed.

08:21.566 --> 08:26.566 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russian
media exaggerated the
attack, even using an
actress to play a victim.

08:28.966 --> 08:32.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We know she was an actress
because she appeared in
unrelated pro-Russian
stories as three

08:32.266 --> 08:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
entirely different people.

08:34.266 --> 08:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that disinformation campaign
convinces the Kremlin's critics
the new Russian identity

08:39.000 --> 08:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is manufactured and a product
of deception and repression.

08:43.366 --> 08:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Sometimes, that repression
shows up in masks,
guns and camouflage.

08:50.233 --> 08:54.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Those are special forces
surrounding 66-year-old Ilmi
Umerov, in the jacket and jeans.

08:56.633 --> 09:00.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Umerov is a leader of
the Tatars, a Muslim
minority in Crimea.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
He and other Tatars fight
the Russian annexation.

09:02.633 --> 09:07.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In response, many Tatars have
been jailed on questionable
charges, and Umerov was thrown

09:07.333 --> 09:09.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
into a local insane asylum.

09:09.833 --> 09:13.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
ILMI UMEROV, Tatar Leader
(through translator):
So, all this together,
we call one big act

09:13.433 --> 09:15.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of intimidation.

09:15.466 --> 09:18.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The purpose is to silence some,
and keep others ignorant to
turn them into zombies so they

09:18.700 --> 09:20.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
think the same thing.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
These are the necessary
conditions in order for
the people to be loyal
to their government.

09:23.733 --> 09:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But do you
acknowledge that that is the
majority of the population who

09:27.866 --> 09:29.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
feels that way?

09:29.066 --> 09:30.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ILMI UMEROV (through
translator): Of course.

09:30.833 --> 09:32.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Of course.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We can't say that this
is a stupid population
or stupid people.

09:34.633 --> 09:37.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They are just living in
a constellation of fear.

09:37.033 --> 09:40.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And the propaganda machine rolls
over them like a steamroller.

09:40.233 --> 09:45.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Umerov may
accuse Putin of manipulating
the population, but under Putin,

09:47.266 --> 09:50.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Russia has revitalized
the majority religion,
brought back historic
traditions, and projects

09:52.533 --> 09:54.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
power.

09:54.866 --> 09:58.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So, until there's an
alternative, he's considered
the creator and will
remain the caretaker

09:59.500 --> 10:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the new Russian identity.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm Nick
Schifrin in Krasnodar, Russia.

10:05.200 --> 10:10.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%

our series Inside Putin's
Russia tomorrow, examining

10:11.266 --> 10:13.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%

by the state.

10:13.800 --> 10:18.100 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
