01:40.866 --> 01:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CONCEPT BECAUSE, AND I, I DON'T

01:42.400 --> 01:43.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WANT TO DISPARAGE ANYONE ELSE

01:43.500 --> 01:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
'CAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:44.833 --> 01:45.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TERRIFIC MUSIC PROGRAMS.

MICHAEL: YES.

01:46.433 --> 01:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOANNA: SO WHAT MAKES THIS ONE

01:47.266 --> 01:48.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A LITTLE BIT EDGIER, A LITTLE

01:49.233 --> 01:49.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT?

01:49.833 --> 01:51.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL: UH, OUR TEACHER

THEY KIND OF HAVE TO EMULATE MY

01:56.366 --> 01:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SPIRIT, WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN

01:57.500 --> 01:59.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
VERY ENERGETIC, AND SINCE I WAS

01:59.400 --> 02:00.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
A YOUNG ONE. UH, I WAS KIND OF

02:00.566 --> 02:01.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE FIRST PRESCHOOL OF ROCKER.

02:01.833 --> 02:03.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

LIKE, MY FATHER INVENTED THE

02:08.133 --> 02:10.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLASS. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

02:10.033 --> 02:11.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND UH, SO THANKS DAD. AND UM,

02:11.966 --> 02:13.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, WHAT, WE DON'T SIT

02:13.200 --> 02:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOWN. IT'S A WHOLE ROCK N' ROLL

02:14.866 --> 02:16.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERIENCE. IT'S LIKE A SHOW,

02:16.466 --> 02:17.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND THE KIDS ARE PART OF THE

02:17.466 --> 02:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SHOW. THEY GET THEIR OWN

02:18.366 --> 02:19.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTRUMENTS, AND THEY GET TO

02:19.100 --> 02:20.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPLORE OUR

02:20.233 --> 02:21.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
INSTRUMENTS EACH WEEK.

02:21.366 --> 02:22.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOANNA: WHAT IS IT ABOUT THE

02:22.200 --> 02:23.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
PHYSICALITY OF IT THAT YOU THINK

02:23.866 --> 02:25.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ENGAGES THE KIDS?

02:25.466 --> 02:27.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL: UM, YOU KNOW, IF

02:27.466 --> 02:28.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SOMEONE'S JUMPING, THEY'RE GONNA

02:28.733 --> 02:30.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JUMP. IF SOMEONE'S DANCING,

02:30.133 --> 02:31.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THEY'RE GONNA DANCE. IF THEY'RE

02:31.733 --> 02:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NOT, IT, IF THE TEACHER'S

02:34.000 --> 02:35.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SITTING DOWN AND JUST STRUMMING

02:35.000 --> 02:36.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE GUITAR, A LOT OF MUSIC

02:36.300 --> 02:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CLASSES PLAY PLAYBACK, IT'S NOT,

02:38.166 --> 02:39.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DOESN'T REALLY ENGAGE THEM. THEY

02:39.900 --> 02:41.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEED, ESPECIALLY IN OUR WORLD,

02:41.266 --> 02:42.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
YOU KNOW, OUR CHILDREN ARE

02:42.733 --> 02:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

UH, IMAGES AND TV, SO, UM,

02:46.933 --> 02:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

REALLY AFFECTS THEM GREATLY.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
JOANNA: YOU THINK THEY

02:53.033 --> 02:53.900 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
EXPERIENCE THE MUSIC DIFFERENTLY

02:53.900 --> 02:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT WAY?

02:55.800 --> 02:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MICHAEL: YES, I DO. YES. I, I

02:57.400 --> 02:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

ACTUALLY PLAYING IN FRONT OF 'EM

03:00.266 --> 03:01.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

DRUM THEY FEEL AN OWNERSHIP OVER

03:05.133 --> 03:06.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE CLASS, OVER THE MUSIC

03:06.000 --> 03:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ITSELF, YEAH.
