SHE JOINS ME NOW.
WELCOME TO THE
NEWSHOUR.

18:30.476 --> 18:31.008
WELCOME TO THE
NEWSHOUR.
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

18:31.010 --> 18:32.579
NEWSHOUR.
>> THANKS SO MUCH.
>> SO WHY IS THE OBAMA

18:32.581 --> 18:33.915
>> THANKS SO MUCH.
>> SO WHY IS THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION DOING THIS,

18:33.918 --> 18:35.286
>> SO WHY IS THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION DOING THIS,
PUTTING THESE PROPOSALS OUT

18:35.288 --> 18:35.887
ADMINISTRATION DOING THIS,
PUTTING THESE PROPOSALS OUT
THERE?

18:35.888 --> 18:37.323
PUTTING THESE PROPOSALS OUT
THERE?
>> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF

18:37.325 --> 18:37.658
THERE?
>> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
REASONS.

18:37.660 --> 18:38.627
>> THERE ARE A COUPLE OF
REASONS.
ONE IS THE FACT THAT THEY

18:38.629 --> 18:40.030
REASONS.
ONE IS THE FACT THAT THEY
ARE REQUIRING VEHICLES TO BE

18:40.032 --> 18:42.002
ONE IS THE FACT THAT THEY
ARE REQUIRING VEHICLES TO BE
CLEANER IN THE YEARS AHEAD.

18:42.003 --> 18:43.238
ARE REQUIRING VEHICLES TO BE
CLEANER IN THE YEARS AHEAD.
THEY'VE BASICALLY REDUCED

18:43.240 --> 18:44.073
CLEANER IN THE YEARS AHEAD.
THEY'VE BASICALLY REDUCED
GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS

18:44.075 --> 18:45.143
THEY'VE BASICALLY REDUCED
GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS
FROM THESE VEHICLES.

18:45.145 --> 18:46.680
GREENHOUSE-GAS EMISSIONS
FROM THESE VEHICLES.
AND SO YOU WILL SEE BETWEEN

18:46.682 --> 18:48.984
FROM THESE VEHICLES.
AND SO YOU WILL SEE BETWEEN
2016 AND 2025, THE VEHICLES

18:48.987 --> 18:50.422
AND SO YOU WILL SEE BETWEEN
2016 AND 2025, THE VEHICLES
ARE GOING TO BECOME MUCH

18:50.424 --> 18:52.661
2016 AND 2025, THE VEHICLES
ARE GOING TO BECOME MUCH
MORE EFFICIENT, GET MORE

18:52.662 --> 18:54.031
ARE GOING TO BECOME MUCH
MORE EFFICIENT, GET MORE
PILES -- MILES PER GALLON.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.067
MORE EFFICIENT, GET MORE
PILES -- MILES PER GALLON.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS

18:55.069 --> 18:56.404
PILES -- MILES PER GALLON.
SO ONE OF THE THINGS
AUTOMAKERS ARE ASKING FOR IS

18:56.406 --> 18:57.438
SO ONE OF THE THINGS
AUTOMAKERS ARE ASKING FOR IS
FOR CLEANER FUELS BECAUSE

18:57.441 --> 18:58.809
AUTOMAKERS ARE ASKING FOR IS
FOR CLEANER FUELS BECAUSE
THE SULFUR IN GASOLINE

18:58.811 --> 19:00.847
FOR CLEANER FUELS BECAUSE
THE SULFUR IN GASOLINE
REALLY AFFECTS THE CATALYTIC

19:00.849 --> 19:02.351
THE SULFUR IN GASOLINE
REALLY AFFECTS THE CATALYTIC
CONVERTER AND MAKES IT LESS

19:02.353 --> 19:03.721
REALLY AFFECTS THE CATALYTIC
CONVERTER AND MAKES IT LESS
EFFICIENT, RESULTS IN MORE

19:03.723 --> 19:04.423
CONVERTER AND MAKES IT LESS
EFFICIENT, RESULTS IN MORE
TAILPIPE EMISSIONS.

19:04.425 --> 19:06.127
EFFICIENT, RESULTS IN MORE
TAILPIPE EMISSIONS.
SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN

19:06.129 --> 19:07.196
TAILPIPE EMISSIONS.
SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN
INCENTIVE TO HAVE CLEANER

19:07.198 --> 19:07.496
SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE AN
INCENTIVE TO HAVE CLEANER
FUEL.

19:07.498 --> 19:08.566
INCENTIVE TO HAVE CLEANER
FUEL.
>> SO I WAS GOING TO SAY, IT

19:08.568 --> 19:09.936
FUEL.
>> SO I WAS GOING TO SAY, IT
IS INTERESTING WHO IS IN

19:09.937 --> 19:11.306
>> SO I WAS GOING TO SAY, IT
IS INTERESTING WHO IS IN
FAVOR OF THIS, IT IS NOT

19:11.308 --> 19:12.342
IS INTERESTING WHO IS IN
FAVOR OF THIS, IT IS NOT
JUST THE ENVIRONMENTAL

19:12.344 --> 19:13.745
FAVOR OF THIS, IT IS NOT
JUST THE ENVIRONMENTAL
ADVOCATES, IT'S THE CAR

19:13.747 --> 19:14.447
JUST THE ENVIRONMENTAL
ADVOCATES, IT'S THE CAR
MANUFACTURERS.

19:14.449 --> 19:14.915
ADVOCATES, IT'S THE CAR
MANUFACTURERS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.

MANUFACTURERS.
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE CAR MANUFACTURERS WHO

19:15.819 --> 19:17.187
>> ABSOLUTELY.
THE CAR MANUFACTURERS WHO
ALREADY BASICALLY HAVE TO

19:17.189 --> 19:18.557
THE CAR MANUFACTURERS WHO
ALREADY BASICALLY HAVE TO
COMPLY WITH THESE RULES IN

19:18.559 --> 19:19.826
ALREADY BASICALLY HAVE TO
COMPLY WITH THESE RULES IN
CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS A HUGE

19:19.829 --> 19:21.698
COMPLY WITH THESE RULES IN
CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS A HUGE
PART OF THE U.S. MARKET,

19:21.700 --> 19:23.035
CALIFORNIA, WHICH IS A HUGE
PART OF THE U.S. MARKET,
HAVE ASKED FOR UNIFORMITY.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.772
PART OF THE U.S. MARKET,
HAVE ASKED FOR UNIFORMITY.
AND SO THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN

19:24.774 --> 19:26.476
HAVE ASKED FOR UNIFORMITY.
AND SO THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN
THE OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT OF

19:26.478 --> 19:27.479

BUDGET JUST THIS MONTH
ASKING FOR THESE RULES TO
COME THROUGH.

19:29.184 --> 19:30.252
ASKING FOR THESE RULES TO
COME THROUGH.
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE

19:30.254 --> 19:31.756
COME THROUGH.
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE
REASONS WHY THE OBAMA

19:31.758 --> 19:32.658
AND SO THAT'S ONE OF THE
REASONS WHY THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION WAS

19:32.660 --> 19:33.827
REASONS WHY THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION WAS
COMFORTABLE MOVING AHEAD

ADMINISTRATION WAS
COMFORTABLE MOVING AHEAD
WITH THIS.

19:34.498 --> 19:35.431
COMFORTABLE MOVING AHEAD
WITH THIS.

WITH THIS.
>> NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE IS
THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY.

19:36.770 --> 19:37.771
>> NOW ON THE OTHER SIDE IS
THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY.
AND WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT

19:37.773 --> 19:38.472
THE OIL & GAS INDUSTRY.
AND WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT
THEY'RE MAKING?

19:38.474 --> 19:40.343
AND WHAT IS THE ARGUMENT
THEY'RE MAKING?
>> THEY'RE ARGUMENT IS THAT

19:40.345 --> 19:42.148
THEY'RE MAKING?
>> THEY'RE ARGUMENT IS THAT
OIL REFINERIES IN THE UNITED

19:42.150 --> 19:43.050
>> THEY'RE ARGUMENT IS THAT
OIL REFINERIES IN THE UNITED

AS PROFITABLE AS SAY THE BIG
OIL COMPANIES, WILL TAKE A

19:45.692 --> 19:47.060
AS PROFITABLE AS SAY THE BIG
OIL COMPANIES, WILL TAKE A
HIT BECAUSE IT WILL BE

19:47.062 --> 19:48.128
OIL COMPANIES, WILL TAKE A
HIT BECAUSE IT WILL BE
EXPENSIVE TO REDUCE THE

19:48.130 --> 19:49.800
HIT BECAUSE IT WILL BE
EXPENSIVE TO REDUCE THE
SULFUR IN THEIR EMISSIONS.

19:49.802 --> 19:51.503
EXPENSIVE TO REDUCE THE
SULFUR IN THEIR EMISSIONS.
THEY'VE ALREADY REDUCED IT

19:51.505 --> 19:53.575
SULFUR IN THEIR EMISSIONS.
THEY'VE ALREADY REDUCED IT
90% SINCE 2004 BECAUSE OF

19:53.576 --> 19:54.544
THEY'VE ALREADY REDUCED IT
90% SINCE 2004 BECAUSE OF
FEDERAL REGULATIONS.

90% SINCE 2004 BECAUSE OF
FEDERAL REGULATIONS.
AND THEY'RE SAYING IT WILL

19:55.615 --> 19:56.983
FEDERAL REGULATIONS.
AND THEY'RE SAYING IT WILL
BOTH BE COSTLY FOR THEM TO

AND THEY'RE SAYING IT WILL
BOTH BE COSTLY FOR THEM TO
DO THIS, AND ALSO IN FACT T

DO THIS, AND ALSO IN FACT T
WILL REQUIRE MORE ENERGY
WHICH WILL INCREASE THEIR

A BETTER CHANCE,
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM I GUESS
NOW IS THAT IS PROBABLY NOT

48:58.370 --> 48:59.003
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM I GUESS
NOW IS THAT IS PROBABLY NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

48:59.005 --> 49:00.339
NOW IS THAT IS PROBABLY NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.
NOW THE FIGHT IS OVER THE

GOING ANYWHERE.
NOW THE FIGHT IS OVER THE
BACKGROUND CHECKS AND SOME

OF THE OTHER THINGS LIKE THE
GUN TRAFFICKING LAWS.

49:03.483 --> 49:04.850
OF THE OTHER THINGS LIKE THE

49:14.543 --> 49:15.744
YESTERDAY.
BUT I THINK WHAT WAS NOT
DEVELOPED WAS A RED STATE

49:15.746 --> 49:16.579
BUT I THINK WHAT WAS NOT
DEVELOPED WAS A RED STATE
STRATEGY.

49:16.581 --> 49:17.816
DEVELOPED WAS A RED STATE
STRATEGY.
A STRATEGY TO WIN OVER SOME

49:17.818 --> 49:19.152
STRATEGY.
A STRATEGY TO WIN OVER SOME
OF THE MOMENTUM THAT EISTED

49:19.154 --> 49:20.522
A STRATEGY TO WIN OVER SOME
OF THE MOMENTUM THAT EISTED
AMONG SOME REPUBLICANS BUT

49:20.524 --> 49:21.892
OF THE MOMENTUM THAT EISTED
AMONG SOME REPUBLICANS BUT
ESPECIALLY AMONG RED STATE

49:21.894 --> 49:23.196
AMONG SOME REPUBLICANS BUT
ESPECIALLY AMONG RED STATE
DEMOCRATS TO TRY TO WIN THEM

49:23.198 --> 49:24.966
ESPECIALLY AMONG RED STATE
DEMOCRATS TO TRY TO WIN THEM
OVER TO THIS, AND TO WIN

49:24.968 --> 49:26.003
DEMOCRATS TO TRY TO WIN THEM
OVER TO THIS, AND TO WIN
PUBLIC OPINION IN THOSE

OVER TO THIS, AND TO WIN
PUBLIC OPINION IN THOSE
STATES OVER TO THIS.

49:26.873 --> 49:28.843
PUBLIC OPINION IN THOSE
STATES OVER TO THIS.
AND THAT IS THAT STRATEGY

49:28.845 --> 49:30.413
STATES OVER TO THIS.
AND THAT IS THAT STRATEGY
WAS NEVER QUITE DEVELOPED.

49:30.415 --> 49:31.783
AND THAT IS THAT STRATEGY
WAS NEVER QUITE DEVELOPED.
AND SO FOR A LOT OF SENATORS

49:31.785 --> 49:33.320
WAS NEVER QUITE DEVELOPED.
AND SO FOR A LOT OF SENATORS
FROM THOSE STATES, THE

49:33.322 --> 49:34.055
AND SO FOR A LOT OF SENATORS
FROM THOSE STATES, THE
POLITICAL PRESSURE IS ON THE

49:34.057 --> 49:35.191
FROM THOSE STATES, THE
POLITICAL PRESSURE IS ON THE
OTHER SIDE.

49:35.193 --> 49:36.895
POLITICAL PRESSURE IS ON THE
OTHER SIDE.
IT'S ALL ON THE SECOND

49:36.897 --> 49:37.563
OTHER SIDE.
IT'S ALL ON THE SECOND
AMENDMENT SIDE.

49:37.565 --> 49:39.802
IT'S ALL ON THE SECOND
AMENDMENT SIDE.
AND SO THAT WAS SACRIFICED.

49:39.804 --> 49:41.039
AMENDMENT SIDE.
AND SO THAT WAS SACRIFICED.
AND I'M NOT SURE THE

49:41.041 --> 49:41.707
AND SO THAT WAS SACRIFICED.
AND I'M NOT SURE THE
PRESIDENT DID ANYTHING

49:41.709 --> 49:42.409
AND I'M NOT SURE THE
PRESIDENT DID ANYTHING
YESTERDAY TO REALLY TURN

YESTERDAY TO REALLY TURN
THAT AROUND.

49:43.079 --> 49:44.112

NOT REALLY SEEN AS A NRA
KIND OF REPUBLICAN.
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS

KIND OF REPUBLICAN.
SO I'M NOT SURE THAT WAS
AVAILABLE.

50:16.159 --> 50:17.660
