JUDY WOODRUFF: Good evening.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I'm Judy Woodruff.

00:08.200 --> 00:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On the "NewsHour" tonight:
Senate Republicans make public
a revised plan to take the place

00:11.733 --> 00:13.433 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of Obamacare.

00:13.433 --> 00:17.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What's inside the bill,
and can it win enough
votes to become law?

00:17.300 --> 00:19.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Then:

00:19.366 --> 00:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: From a practical
standpoint, most people would

00:22.300 --> 00:24.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
have taken that meeting.

00:24.400 --> 00:28.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: President
Trump in France defends
his son's meeting with
a Russian government

00:30.166 --> 00:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
lawyer in the hopes of
getting opposition research
on Hillary Clinton.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And our series Inside Putin's
Russia continues with a look
at enemies of the state and how

00:40.100 --> 00:42.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Russia's leaders
responds to dissent.

00:42.133 --> 00:47.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, Open
Russia: I felt just life slowly
going out of the whole body.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I remember that distinct
feeling that, this is it.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is the end.

00:52.500 --> 00:57.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All that and more
on tonight's "PBS NewsHour."

00:59.033 --> 01:01.333 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
(BREAK)

01:01.333 --> 01:06.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: It is the
Senate Republican health
care bill version 2.0.

01:12.666 --> 01:17.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Party leaders made it public
today, but the path to passage
remained anything but clear.

01:18.866 --> 01:20.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Our Lisa Desjardins
begins our coverage.

01:20.266 --> 01:22.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:22.233 --> 01:24.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY),
Majority Leader: So, it's
time to rise to the occasion.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: A
critical moment for
health care and Congress.

01:26.800 --> 01:31.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
unveiled Senate Republicans'
second-draft bill, hoping it

01:32.966 --> 01:34.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
can win the minimum
50 votes he needs.

01:34.366 --> 01:36.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

01:36.433 --> 01:39.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MITCH MCCONNELL: The revised
draft improves on the previous
version in a number of ways,

01:39.133 --> 01:44.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
all while retaining the
fundamental goals of
providing stability and
improving affordability.

01:44.066 --> 01:46.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
What has changed?

01:46.733 --> 01:50.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
First, it keeps two Obamacare
taxes on the wealthy.

01:50.466 --> 01:55.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Second, it uses that money,
in part, to add more than over
$100 billion in new spending;

01:57.433 --> 02:01.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
$70 billion would go to insurers
to stabilize markets and bring
down out-of-pocket costs,

02:03.200 --> 02:05.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and $45 billion would
fight the opioid epidemic.

02:05.733 --> 02:10.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Medicaid, the bill still cuts
future spending significantly,
but does give states more leeway

02:12.133 --> 02:15.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to expand who is
eligible for the program.

02:15.700 --> 02:20.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But perhaps the biggest change
is the addition of a proposal
by Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

02:22.733 --> 02:26.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The so-called Cruz amendment
would let insurers mostly opt
out of all Affordable Care Act

02:26.966 --> 02:29.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
requirements.

02:29.066 --> 02:32.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They could potentially
offer cheaper bare-bones
plans, as long as they
offer a few plans that

02:34.100 --> 02:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
do meet Obamacare standards.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the same time,
other Republicans are
crafting their own ideas.

02:39.866 --> 02:41.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), South
Carolina: Well, you know.

02:43.433 --> 02:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to support Mitch's
effort with his new plan,
but we want an alternative,

02:45.500 --> 02:47.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and we're going to see
which one can get 50 votes.

02:47.566 --> 02:48.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We're not undercutting Mitch.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
He's not undercutting us.

02:50.833 --> 02:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Senators
Lindsey Graham of South Carolina
and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana

02:54.400 --> 02:58.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
say their amendment would send
more money directly to states.

02:58.300 --> 03:00.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
It's not clear how
much support that has.

03:00.900 --> 03:01.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
As for Democrats:

03:01.900 --> 03:03.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY), Minority
Leader: It appears that
little has changed at the core

03:05.633 --> 03:07.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of the bill.

03:07.633 --> 03:10.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Minority Leader
Chuck Schumer says Republicans
will still have a problem

03:10.966 --> 03:13.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
getting some key members of
their own party on board.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:15.666 --> 03:18.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHUCK SCHUMER: Moderate
Republicans looking at this bill
should be able to see that the

03:18.633 --> 03:23.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
incredibly modest change to
the tax provisions, the small
pot of funding for opioid abuse

03:25.600 --> 03:30.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
treatment, these other tweaks
around the edges are like a
drop in the bucket, compared to

03:31.966 --> 03:36.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
what the bill does to Medicaid,
to seniors, to Americans
with preexisting conditions.

03:38.766 --> 03:42.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: All sides
are now waiting for a pivotal
report, the analysis of the

03:42.633 --> 03:45.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
bill by the nonpartisan
Congressional Budget Office.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Especially waiting is Wisconsin
Senator Ron Johnson, a key vote.

03:48.133 --> 03:49.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
SEN.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
RON JOHNSON (R), Wisconsin:
Show me your math.

03:51.466 --> 03:53.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Show me what the
first baseline was.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Show me what the policy
results in terms of spending.

03:56.566 --> 04:00.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: Republicans
have not yet announced
when they will hold a vote.

04:00.633 --> 04:03.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Leaders had hoped for next week.

04:03.133 --> 04:07.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And of the 52 Senate
Republicans, we already
know that two of them
are no-votes on this

04:07.666 --> 04:09.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
latest draft.

04:09.133 --> 04:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's Susan Collins of Maine
and Rand Paul of Kentucky.

04:11.733 --> 04:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Judy, of course, that means
Mitch McConnell cannot lose
any more Republicans, and there

04:15.933 --> 04:17.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
are many on the fence.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Wow.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
So, Lisa, thank you.

04:19.466 --> 04:21.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And, of course, stay here.

04:21.466 --> 04:24.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're going to bring in Julie
Rovner, who we know well,
chief correspondent, Washington

04:24.966 --> 04:28.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
correspondent, for Kaiser
Health News, joining us too.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm going to start
with you, Julie.

04:30.466 --> 04:34.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, there have been some
changes, as Lisa just reported,
to Medicaid, a few, but not

04:36.033 --> 04:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
enough to satisfy
these moderates.

04:37.933 --> 04:39.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
What exactly did they do?

04:39.366 --> 04:40.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER, Kaiser
Health News: That's right.

04:40.766 --> 04:42.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The moderates have been
unhappy with the Medicaid cuts.

04:42.833 --> 04:47.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senator Susan Collins, who, as
we just heard, is already a no,
came out and said, the changes

04:47.500 --> 04:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
that they would make to
Medicaid go beyond repealing
the Affordable Care Act.

04:50.933 --> 04:55.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Medicaid was expanded in the
Affordable Care Act, but these
changes would actually cap

04:55.033 --> 04:58.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the program, something
Republicans have been trying
to do since the 1980s.

04:58.400 --> 05:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's for the conservatives.

05:00.333 --> 05:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Moderates are still unhappy.

05:02.466 --> 05:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As Lisa pointed out, there
is a little bit more money
to deal with opioid abuse.

05:05.966 --> 05:08.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They can get out of
the caps if there's a
public health emergency.

05:08.833 --> 05:11.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But those are pretty
much all the changes
that they have made here.

05:11.100 --> 05:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And how is
all this going over, Lisa?

05:12.900 --> 05:14.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

05:14.266 --> 05:16.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of big
question marks on Capitol Hill.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that you have got
the same question marks
on the right and the left.

05:19.566 --> 05:24.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
They tried to bring in
moderates, and including
giving them the ability
to increase -- the

05:25.966 --> 05:28.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
states could increase who
can be under Medicaid.

05:28.033 --> 05:30.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there's not as much money
to do it, so you would have
to make a choice between the

05:30.800 --> 05:35.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
number of people you could cover
under Medicaid and how much you
would give them in benefits.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It doesn't really address
questions of the overall need
for health care some of these

05:40.066 --> 05:42.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
moderates have.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.866 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Now,
Julie, we heard in Lisa's
report the reference to
what Senator Ted Cruz

05:45.866 --> 05:49.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has wanted, has to do with
giving states more options.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Describe exactly
what that involves.

05:52.366 --> 05:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: Well,
Senator Cruz and a number
of the conservatives
in the House too have

05:54.400 --> 05:57.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
complained that one of
the biggest problems
with the Affordable
Care Act is that people

05:57.433 --> 06:02.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
who buy their own insurance are
finding themselves paying much
more, more both in premiums and

06:02.100 --> 06:03.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
in out-of-pocket spending.

06:03.233 --> 06:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And he wants to help people.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But basically the way he would
do it is, he would say, for
healthy people, if you want

06:07.700 --> 06:12.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
to buy fewer benefits,
you can do that, and you
would get less coverage.

06:12.266 --> 06:15.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that, in fact, is what
they would do in this bill.

06:15.633 --> 06:19.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The problem, according to the
insurance industry and a lot of
others who oppose it, is that

06:19.733 --> 06:23.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
it would make coverage for sick
people pretty much unaffordable.

06:23.400 --> 06:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It would leave only sick
people in those plans that
offer all the benefits.

06:28.200 --> 06:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
For the people who are lucky
enough to get tax credits, and
they have lowered the threshold,

06:32.433 --> 06:35.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
those people would be mostly
protected from those increases.

06:35.700 --> 06:40.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But people who are buying their
own insurance and make too much
money to get those tax credits

06:40.566 --> 06:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
would bear the brunt of those
very much higher premiums.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So that's a big worry about
how this might play out.

06:46.700 --> 06:50.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: So, Lisa, and
the leadership was making
this gesture in Senator Cruz's

06:50.833 --> 06:51.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
direction.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How is it going over?

06:53.900 --> 06:55.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: These were
intense negotiations to
put this in the bill today.

06:55.933 --> 07:00.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But, Judy, if you actually read
the bill online, the entire
Cruz amendment is in brackets.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Literally, it is in brackets.

07:02.466 --> 07:05.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Republican leadership
confirmed that means
it's not final.

07:05.666 --> 07:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It could still be taken out.

07:06.866 --> 07:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It could still be revised.

07:08.933 --> 07:12.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And one other tricky piece of
choreography with all of this,
multiple sources have told

07:12.133 --> 07:17.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
me that they are going to get a
score from not CBO -- just from
CBO, but also the Department

07:18.000 --> 07:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of Health and Human Services.

07:19.633 --> 07:22.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
which is a very
unusual step on this.

07:22.166 --> 07:25.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are going to see what
the Department of Health and
Human Services think the Cruz

07:25.000 --> 07:26.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
amendment will mean.

07:26.733 --> 07:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
And all of this is kind
of adding new questions
to the process as well.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Presumably
not knowing what the
department is going to say.

07:32.833 --> 07:34.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Is that right?

07:34.733 --> 07:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Or do they assume the department
is going to come in and
say this is a good thing?

07:36.266 --> 07:37.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS:
That, we don't know.

07:37.933 --> 07:39.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
We know there have
been conversations
for weeks with CBO.

07:39.766 --> 07:42.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CBO has known the general
outlines of these bills.

07:42.533 --> 07:45.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Have they had those
conversations with HHS as well?

07:45.066 --> 07:46.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
I don't know.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Lisa, I
want to stay with you.

07:48.366 --> 07:52.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have been following this
day after day after day since
the Senate went home for recess.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
They have now come back.

07:54.866 --> 07:57.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
What is the political calculus
on the part of the Republican
leadership in the Senate?

07:57.500 --> 08:01.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LISA DESJARDINS: I think it
comes down to one fact, that
they feel they campaigned on

08:01.266 --> 08:06.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
this and that they have to at
least give it their greatest
try or have to show themselves

08:07.133 --> 08:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
as trying as hard as possible.

08:09.100 --> 08:11.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Right now, it does look like
it's going to be very difficult
to get the votes for this

08:11.133 --> 08:15.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to pass, but it also looks
like they will hold that vote,
even if it fails, to show

08:15.933 --> 08:19.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
their voters, we tried and
this is as far as we could get.

08:19.233 --> 08:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think there is pressure from
both conservatives an moderates
to go both different directions.

08:23.466 --> 08:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that's what making
this goal of reforming and
replacing Obamacare impossible.

08:27.500 --> 08:29.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Julie -- excuse me.

08:29.533 --> 08:32.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Julie, you have done your
own share of reporting
on this for a long time.

08:32.233 --> 08:34.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What are you seeing
as to where this goes?

08:34.233 --> 08:37.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIE ROVNER: I see exactly
what Lisa said, that they're
caught between this promise that

08:37.900 --> 08:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they made to repeal and replace
the Affordable Care Act and
their ability to do it, which

08:42.400 --> 08:45.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
is difficult to find consensus
within their own conference.

08:45.833 --> 08:49.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I think they're going
to sort of run out the
string as much as they can.

08:49.400 --> 08:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The bigger problem is, even if
they get something through the
Senate, then it will have to go

08:52.233 --> 08:54.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
back to the House.

08:54.300 --> 08:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So whether you could actually
get something through both
chambers in any kind of timely

08:57.000 --> 08:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
way remains a big open question.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And then we
heard, Lisa, the president
saying that he would be angry if

09:03.200 --> 09:04.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the Senate doesn't
get this done.

09:04.300 --> 09:06.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: Right.

09:06.400 --> 09:09.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And to be honest, sources I talk
to, Republicans, aren't sure the
president has helped-, because

09:09.333 --> 09:13.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
as much as he's behind
the scenes sometimes
encouraged them, when
he's gone and criticized

09:13.966 --> 09:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the House bill later on, for
example, as being mean, they're
worried that if they join forces

09:20.333 --> 09:22.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
with him, that later he might
say something different.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think, overall, it's
important to just remember the
broad contours of this bill.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
There are a lot of
details, a lot of changes.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But as much as it deals with
the Affordable Care Act, this
bill in its heart is also a

09:30.400 --> 09:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Medicaid reform bill.

09:32.033 --> 09:35.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
That was something they
didn't have to add to
this, but they did.

09:35.433 --> 09:38.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And in doing that, they lost
a lot of moderate votes.

09:38.066 --> 09:41.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
They're keeping with
that because Republicans
feel like it's important,
but that was a big

09:41.666 --> 09:44.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
gamble that they took
in actually putting two
bills together here.

09:44.966 --> 09:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: All right, my
producer is trying to tell
me something about senators.

09:48.066 --> 09:50.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Maybe there is new
some information?

09:50.300 --> 09:51.533 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

09:51.533 --> 09:52.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: ...
watch, particularly.

09:52.766 --> 09:54.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
LISA DESJARDINS: I
think that's right.

09:54.266 --> 09:55.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We need to watch a lot of
key senators this week.

09:55.833 --> 09:57.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Let's look at five very quickly.

09:57.400 --> 09:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
That's Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
We talked to him today.

10:00.700 --> 10:03.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Mike Lee of Utah, he's not
happy with the Cruz amendment
as written, even though was

10:03.766 --> 10:05.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
one of its authors
at the beginning.

10:05.200 --> 10:06.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Shelley Moore Capito
of West Virginia.

10:06.966 --> 10:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Dean Heller of Nevada,
he's interesting.

10:08.700 --> 10:12.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His governor today said
he has great concerns
about the bill as it is.

10:12.566 --> 10:17.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, Lisa Murkowski
of Alaska, she had said she
didn't like where this is

10:17.366 --> 10:18.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
going.

10:18.866 --> 10:20.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And we're waiting to hear
from all five of those.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They can't lose
any one of those.

10:21.466 --> 10:23.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that's just the beginning
lineup of questions.

10:23.533 --> 10:27.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: I know the two of
you are going to keep monitoring
it every minute of every

10:27.366 --> 10:29.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
day until we know
what the answer is.

10:29.966 --> 10:31.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Lisa Desjardins, Julie
Rovner, thank you both.

10:31.933 --> 10:33.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JULIE ROVNER: Thank you.

10:33.933 --> 10:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And in the day's
other news: President Trump
held talks in Paris with the

10:40.866 --> 10:44.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
president of France, but he
faced questions about his son's
meeting with a Russian lawyer

10:44.933 --> 10:49.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
last summer aimed at
getting information
harmful to Hillary Clinton.

10:49.666 --> 10:54.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a joint news conference, Mr.
Trump dismissed criticism of
the meeting, and said -- quote

10:54.200 --> 10:56.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
- - "It's called
opposition research."

10:56.033 --> 10:59.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We will have a full report
after the news summary.

10:59.600 --> 11:04.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In China, political dissident
and Nobel Peace Prize winner
Liu Xiaobo died today of liver

11:05.400 --> 11:07.466 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
cancer.

11:07.466 --> 11:11.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He had been released
from a state prison last
month and hospitalized,
but was barred from

11:12.266 --> 11:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
going abroad for treatment.

11:14.766 --> 11:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Liu was one of the Chinese
government's most vocal
opponents, and spent
decades campaigning

11:19.133 --> 11:20.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
for greater human rights.

11:20.633 --> 11:24.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
He was imprisoned in
2009 for subversion.

11:24.133 --> 11:26.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
His death drew widespread
criticism of Beijing.

11:26.966 --> 11:30.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
SALIL SHETTY, Secretary-General,
Amnesty International: I
think it's outrageous for
the Chinese government

11:30.233 --> 11:33.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to weave the fiction that
Liu Xiaobo was a criminal.

11:33.633 --> 11:38.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's very clear that, thanks
to Liu Xiaobo, millions of
people, not just in China, but

11:40.533 --> 11:44.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
across the world, have been
inspired to stand up for freedom
and justice in the face of

11:45.400 --> 11:47.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
oppression.

11:47.500 --> 11:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson urged
China to release Liu's wife,

11:52.400 --> 11:54.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
who is under house arrest.

11:54.466 --> 11:58.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And the White House said
President Trump was deeply
saddened by the news.

11:58.233 --> 12:01.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Liu Xiaobo was 61 years old.

12:01.733 --> 12:06.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Former President Jimmy
Carter was hospitalized for
dehydration today in Canada.

12:06.433 --> 12:08.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Mr. Carter is 92.

12:08.533 --> 12:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Habitat for Humanity said he
had been working in the sun
building homes for the needy in

12:14.266 --> 12:16.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Winnipeg, Manitoba.

12:16.300 --> 12:19.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The organization said the
former president told them he
is OK, and he urged the crew

12:19.633 --> 12:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to keep building.

12:22.000 --> 12:27.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The number-three Republican in
the U.S. House, Steve Scalise,
has had another round of surgery

12:28.066 --> 12:30.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
after being shot last month.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The Louisiana Republican
was seriously wounded
when a gunman attacked
a congressional baseball

12:34.966 --> 12:36.833 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
practice.

12:36.833 --> 12:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Hospital officials in
Washington say the latest
surgery was to treat infection.

12:43.166 --> 12:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The U.S. Justice Department
today has charged more than 400
people with opioid scams and

12:47.066 --> 12:48.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
health care fraud.

12:48.600 --> 12:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The alleged schemes totaled
$1.3 billion in false billing.

12:53.333 --> 12:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Attorney General Jeff Sessions
called it the largest health
care fraud takedown operation

12:59.100 --> 13:01.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
in American history.

13:01.233 --> 13:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Six teenage girls from
Afghanistan will be allowed into
the U.S., after all, to take

13:07.100 --> 13:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
part in a robotics competition.

13:09.100 --> 13:13.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The team had twice been denied
visas, but the White House
says President Trump intervened

13:14.400 --> 13:16.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to reverse that decision.

13:16.366 --> 13:20.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Today, the girls flew to the
capital city of Kabul from
Western Afghanistan to get their

13:20.800 --> 13:22.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
travel documents.

13:22.333 --> 13:24.766 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They said they are excited
to finally be on the way.

13:24.766 --> 13:28.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
FATEMAH QADERYAN, Robotics
Competitor (through translator):
We were disappointed when the

13:28.166 --> 13:33.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Americans made a difference
between Afghanistan
and other countries on
not issuing visas to

13:33.033 --> 13:34.533 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
us.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
At that time, we lost hope
and we were feeling sad.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
But now we are very
happy that they have
given us a chance to go.

13:39.166 --> 13:44.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: U.S. officials
have not said why the team
was previously denied entry.

Afghanistan is not one

president's travel ban list.

13:49.533 --> 13:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Washington, the Congressional
Budget Office said today that
the president's budget and

13:53.333 --> 13:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spending plan for the coming
year falls far short of what
the White House promised.

14:00.433 --> 14:03.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Instead of creating a small
surplus, the CBO reports that
there would still be a deficit

14:03.566 --> 14:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of some $720 billion
at the end of 10 years.

14:07.900 --> 14:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
It says the budget
proposal relies on economic
growth projections that
are far too optimistic.

14:14.933 --> 14:19.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Democrats and Republicans in
Congress have reached initial
agreement on expanding college

14:19.333 --> 14:21.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
aid for veterans.

14:21.033 --> 14:24.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It aims to fill coverage
gaps in benefits that
were enacted after 9/11.

14:24.733 --> 14:29.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The new proposal would lift a
15-year time limit for vets to
tap into education benefits.

14:32.100 --> 14:37.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It also adds more money for
thousands of members of the
National Guard and Reserve.

The trustees of the U.S.
government trust fund that
pays Medicare bills say that it

14:43.166 --> 14:45.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
will go broke in 2029.

14:45.233 --> 14:48.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that is one year later
than last year's forecast.

14:48.466 --> 14:53.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
They also estimated that
Social Security will
be depleted by 2034.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is the same as
last year's prediction.

On Wall Street today, the Dow

The Nasdaq rose 13, and
the S&amp;P 500 added four.

15:08.933 --> 15:13.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And American tennis player
Venus Williams is now the oldest
player to reach a Wimbledon

15:14.200 --> 15:16.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
final in more than 20 years.

15:16.166 --> 15:21.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the semifinals today,
Williams, at the age of 37, made
quick work today of Britain's

Johanna Konta, who's 26.

On Saturday, Williams
goes for her sixth
Wimbledon championship.

Still to come on the "NewsHour":
Trump abroad - - questions
about his son's meeting with

15:34.400 --> 15:39.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
a Russian lawyer follow
the president to Paris;
Inside Putin's Russia,
a look at the fate

15:41.400 --> 15:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
of those who stand up
to Vladimir Putin; the
wisdom of finance --
what Hollywood and Jane

15:47.900 --> 15:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Austen can teach us about
economic risk; and much more.

16:02.933 --> 16:07.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
President Trump arrived in Paris
today for talks with French
President Emmanuel Macron,

16:07.666 --> 16:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
with the aim of strengthening
the alliance between
the two countries.

16:11.266 --> 16:16.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But the visit was at least
partly overshadowed by questions
that continues to dog President

16:18.100 --> 16:21.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Trump, whether his presidential
campaign coordinated with
the Russian government.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
John Yang has our report.

16:24.366 --> 16:28.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Even amid
the splendor of Paris,
President Trump could
not escape the firestorm

16:31.133 --> 16:33.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
over his son's meeting
with a Russian lawyer.

16:33.500 --> 16:38.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At a news conference with French
President Emmanuel Macron,
Mr. Trump defended Donald

16:39.900 --> 16:43.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Trump Jr. as a wonderful young
man who did nothing wrong.

16:43.000 --> 16:46.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP, President of the
United States: I think, from
a practical standpoint, most

16:46.133 --> 16:48.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
people would have
taken that meeting.

16:48.700 --> 16:51.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's called opposition
research, or even research
into your opponent.

16:51.933 --> 16:56.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have had many people -- I
have only been in politics
for two years, but I have had

16:56.633 --> 17:01.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
many people call up, oh, gee, we
have information on this factor
or this person or, frankly,

17:04.433 --> 17:05.566 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Hillary.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's very standard
in politics.

17:07.600 --> 17:10.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The president said
the Russian lawyer, Natalia
Veselnitskaya, had visited

17:10.900 --> 17:15.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Congress and he suggested her
U.S. visa had been approved by
Obama Attorney General Loretta

17:16.766 --> 17:18.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Lynch, not the State Department.

17:18.933 --> 17:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Late today, Lynch said she
had nothing to do with it.

17:21.800 --> 17:26.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
On Air Force One on the way to
Paris, Mr. Trump told reporters
that the Russia investigation

17:27.533 --> 17:30.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
was only helping him.

17:30.000 --> 17:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
"It's making Trump stronger,
because my people and
the people that support
me, who are incredible

17:35.633 --> 17:39.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
people, those people are angry
because they feel it's being
unfair and a witch-hunt."

17:39.166 --> 17:43.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At the news conference, a French
reporter asked the president
about his often-repeated

17:43.066 --> 17:48.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
campaign anecdote about a friend
who had told Mr. Trump that
the threat of Islamic terrorism

17:48.800 --> 17:50.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
had ruined Paris.

17:50.033 --> 17:51.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
DONALD TRUMP: I see
him like a month ago.

17:51.666 --> 17:53.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
How was Paris this summer?

17:53.000 --> 17:54.000 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
What?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't go to Paris.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Are you kidding me?

17:56.000 --> 17:57.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
It's no longer Paris.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JOHN YANG: Today, he turned
it around to flatter his host.

18:00.733 --> 18:02.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP: You know what?

18:02.400 --> 18:05.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's going to be just
fine, because you have
a great president.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have somebody who's going
to run this country right.

18:07.400 --> 18:12.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, I really have a feeling that
you're going have a very, very
peaceful and beautiful Paris.

18:16.733 --> 18:18.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And I'm coming back.

18:18.200 --> 18:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You better do a
good job, please.

18:20.466 --> 18:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Otherwise, you're going
to make me look very bad.

18:23.366 --> 18:28.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JOHN YANG: The two leaders
said they discussed Syria and
the fight against terrorism.

18:28.200 --> 18:32.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
Mr. Macron said Mr. Trump's
decision to withdraw
from the Paris climate
accord wouldn't affect

18:32.933 --> 18:34.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their relationship.

18:34.800 --> 18:38.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Bloomberg News White House
correspondent Toluse Olorunnipa
is covering the trip.

18:38.233 --> 18:41.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TOLUSE OLORUNNIPA, Bloomberg
News: They see the world in
very different ways, but they

18:41.500 --> 18:46.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have come to realize that
they can benefit from having a
positive relationship with one

18:46.233 --> 18:48.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
another, and that's what
we saw on display today.

18:48.433 --> 18:53.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JOHN YANG: Indeed, the
body language today
was a marked difference
from their first awkward

18:55.333 --> 18:58.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
encounter in May, and
was capped tonight with
dinner at the Eiffel Tower.

19:00.666 --> 19:03.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
After watching Bastille Day
celebrations in Paris tomorrow,
Mr. Trump heads back to the

19:03.800 --> 19:08.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
United States, and more
repercussions from his
son's Russia meeting.

19:08.700 --> 19:12.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Senate Judiciary Committee
Chairman Chuck Grassley said
he wants Donald Trump Jr. to

19:12.900 --> 19:17.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
testify in open session
as soon as next week.

19:17.033 --> 19:19.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
For the "PBS NewsHour,"
I'm John Yang.

19:19.433 --> 19:24.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: As we just heard,
the president defended his older
son's meeting with a Russian

19:24.400 --> 19:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
lawyer last year, saying
that it was standard
opposition research.

19:28.800 --> 19:31.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But some have
questioned that premise.

19:31.133 --> 19:35.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
To discuss all this,
we are joined now by
two campaign veterans.

19:35.033 --> 19:39.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tim Miller was the former
communications director for Jeb
Bush's presidential campaign.

19:39.833 --> 19:44.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is also co-founder of
the Republican opposition
research group America Rising.

19:46.866 --> 19:51.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And Christina Reynolds, she
was the deputy communications
director for Hillary Clinton's

19:53.333 --> 19:56.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
2016 presidential campaign,
and she's now the senior vice
president for Global Strategy

19:57.566 --> 20:00.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Group, a Democratic
research firm.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And we welcome both of
you to the "NewsHour."

20:01.933 --> 20:03.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Christina, I'm going
to start with you.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Tell our audience, what
is opposition research?

20:05.966 --> 20:07.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS, Former
Hillary Clinton Campaign Deputy
Communications Director: Well,

20:07.500 --> 20:09.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
when I started, we used to call
it quotes, votes and anecdotes.

20:09.600 --> 20:13.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is gathering public
information to tell a
story about your opponent.

20:13.666 --> 20:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, we look at public sources.

20:15.666 --> 20:20.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We look at everything from
votes to tax records to personal
stories that you can find out

20:21.100 --> 20:22.600 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
about someone.

20:22.600 --> 20:24.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Miller,
what would you add to that?

20:24.533 --> 20:25.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MILLER, Former Jeb Bush
Campaign Communications
Director: I think that's right.

20:25.666 --> 20:27.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I call it full
information awareness.

20:27.666 --> 20:31.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You want to know everything
you can about your opponent,
everything they have ever said,

20:31.533 --> 20:35.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
any way they have ever made
money, any way they have ever
spent money, and so that you

20:35.900 --> 20:39.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
can use it to your advantage
in the campaign and so voters
know their entire record.

20:39.733 --> 20:43.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And, Christina
Reynolds, is it anything goes?

20:43.800 --> 20:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Anything about their medical
records, their personal life?

20:46.300 --> 20:48.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: No.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I mean, first and foremost,
you have to -- we used to have
a rule that said, if you can

20:50.700 --> 20:53.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
cite it, you can write it.

20:53.233 --> 20:56.966 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You need a publicly
available source for
something to be credible
in the news, for something

20:57.733 --> 20:59.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to be credible in ads.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, second of all, if you
go into things like medical
records and things like that,

21:03.433 --> 21:06.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
then you start getting into
worrying about blowback
for your own candidate.

21:06.233 --> 21:07.400 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
So, it's not anything goes.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
You have to be careful.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
(CROSSTALK)

21:09.633 --> 21:11.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: What
do you mean blowback?

21:11.700 --> 21:14.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: I mean,
at some point, there's a risk
that the actual gathering of

21:14.766 --> 21:18.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
the information may be
considered worse then
the public -- than
the information that's

21:18.900 --> 21:21.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
found, if it's considered
dirty tricks, so to speak.

21:21.733 --> 21:26.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Miller,
are there lines drawn around
what's considered acceptable

21:26.266 --> 21:28.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opposition research or not?

21:28.066 --> 21:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM MILLER: Of course there are.

21:30.066 --> 21:34.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We started an opposition
research firm America Rising
that has been very successful.

21:34.400 --> 21:39.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And -- but what try to do is
ensure that we stay inside
these lines, both legal lines

21:40.566 --> 21:42.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and ethical -- and
ethical boundaries.

21:42.700 --> 21:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think both of those are
in play here with regards to
the president's son's meeting.

21:48.700 --> 21:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
It's like Christina said.

21:50.800 --> 21:55.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You saw this with the Ted Cruz
campaign in Iowa, that they
had blowback when they were

21:57.333 --> 21:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
spreading information that Ben
Carson was going to drop out
of the race, when that wasn't

21:59.200 --> 22:01.266 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
true.

22:01.266 --> 22:04.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to be careful that
your opposition research is
correct, first and foremost, but

22:04.166 --> 22:06.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
also within legal
and ethical bounds.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And that's what I
want to pursue with both of you.

22:08.566 --> 22:13.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
What is inside and what
is outside the bounds
of what you can do?

22:15.566 --> 22:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And, of course, we're asking
you all this because of what
happened with regard to Donald

22:18.166 --> 22:22.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Trump Jr., the meeting
he took with a Russian
- - representative of
the Russian government.

22:22.766 --> 22:24.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: Sure.

22:24.866 --> 22:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Well, I can tell you, in
my experience in research,
what he did is not normal.

22:27.600 --> 22:32.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think that what's inside
the bounds is things that
are publicly available.

22:34.066 --> 22:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You do a lot of Freedom
of Information Act
records requests.

22:36.800 --> 22:41.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You certainly talk to people,
but you do so with people that
you know and trust are giving

22:43.400 --> 22:46.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
you solid information
and information that you
can then go and prove.

22:46.400 --> 22:51.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
And you certainly don't
do something with a
hostile government,
you know, being on your

22:52.933 --> 22:54.966 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
side.

22:54.966 --> 22:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, the best example of
this is when Al Gore's campaign
got a debate book FedExed

23:00.233 --> 23:02.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
to them, a George
Bush debate book.

23:02.266 --> 23:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The first thing they did was
call the FBI, because you
wonder, are you being set up?

23:05.833 --> 23:10.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You wonder, is this something
that's valid, that's real?

23:10.333 --> 23:13.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
That's something that you
don't take every meeting.

23:13.166 --> 23:15.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
People call with tips.

23:15.166 --> 23:18.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You make sure that you
trust the veracity of the
information and the source.

23:18.266 --> 23:23.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Tim Miller, had
you ever, before this instance,
heard of a time when someone

23:23.100 --> 23:26.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
was offered information by a
foreign hostile government?

23:26.433 --> 23:31.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MILLER: Well, I will tell
you, almost to the question,
I -- like President Trump,

23:33.466 --> 23:37.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
have been called by anonymous
people, friends of friends with
information about him, frankly,

23:39.300 --> 23:42.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and about Hillary Clinton when
I was working for Jeb Bush.

23:42.600 --> 23:45.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you have to make a
decision about whether
this is a credible person.

23:45.700 --> 23:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You have to talk to lawyers
to make sure, if you have
the conversation, it's within

23:49.733 --> 23:51.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
legal bounds.

23:51.700 --> 23:55.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Now, those conversations,
while maybe some would consider
to be a little bit sketchy,

23:57.866 --> 24:01.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
pale in comparison to the idea
of getting a call from somebody
who explicitly says they're

24:02.100 --> 24:03.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
here from the
Russian government.

24:03.500 --> 24:05.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is not just a
foreign government, Judy.

24:05.133 --> 24:07.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
It wasn't Switzerland who
had called Donald Trump Jr.

24:07.433 --> 24:09.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

24:09.966 --> 24:12.166 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
TIM MILLER: It was a
country that is out there
to undermine our interests
on the world stage.

24:12.166 --> 24:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's so far beyond the pale,
that it's kind of almost silly
to compare it to some of these

24:16.933 --> 24:20.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
other gray area opposition
research efforts, because
there is nothing gray about it.

24:20.766 --> 24:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Christina, were
you ever aware of being offered
or hear of anybody in a campaign

24:25.333 --> 24:27.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
being offered something
from a foreign hostile...

24:27.900 --> 24:28.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: From
a foreign government?

24:28.900 --> 24:30.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right.

24:30.333 --> 24:32.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS:
That's an easy answer: No.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And so, when
a question arises about what
you're -- whether you're being

24:35.300 --> 24:39.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
offered or what someone's trying
to tell you, if there is any
question about it, what do

24:39.933 --> 24:41.933 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
you do?

24:41.933 --> 24:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: I think,
as Tim mentioned, sometimes,
you talk to lawyers.

24:44.733 --> 24:49.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You think about, will I be
able to give this to a reporter
and know that it's true?

24:51.666 --> 24:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Would I have my candidate
say it out loud and
feel confident in that?

24:55.200 --> 24:59.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
You think through those
things, and I think you
set a really high bar.

24:59.033 --> 25:02.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
If we learned anything from the
Donald Trump's election, from
the past campaign and Trump's

25:02.533 --> 25:07.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
election, it's that no one
story can kill a campaign, but
you don't want to be the one

25:08.966 --> 25:11.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
that is -- you know, that is
seen as playing dirty tricks.

25:11.933 --> 25:16.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Are people
-- I know every campaign is
different, Tim Miller, in the

25:18.133 --> 25:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
way it's organized, the
hierarchy and so forth.

25:20.433 --> 25:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But are there rules that are
shared, that are known by people
in modern American politics

25:26.366 --> 25:29.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
about what's OK and what isn't?

25:29.233 --> 25:31.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
You just count on
the lawyers you hire?

25:31.500 --> 25:36.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I know every campaign
has lawyers to tell you
that, or how does that work?

25:36.333 --> 25:40.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
TIM MILLER: Yes, look, I
think that there are norms
within opposition research.

25:40.500 --> 25:42.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We also run a candidate
tracking organization.

25:42.633 --> 25:47.633 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It's the guys that -- and gals
that follow around candidates
with a video camera to get

25:48.500 --> 25:50.033 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
whatever they say on the record.

25:50.033 --> 25:52.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
And there are rules.

25:52.633 --> 25:56.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
We work with a Democratic
opposition research firm,
you know, and we would
have an off-the-record

25:58.066 --> 26:02.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
conversation to kind of set
boundaries, you know, that we
weren't going to go videotape

26:02.600 --> 26:04.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
their family dinner, right?

26:04.533 --> 26:09.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You're not going to go
dumpster-diving in there in the
trash can outside their house.

26:11.300 --> 26:14.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Like I said, there are going to
be areas where there are some
-- where there are gray areas.

26:14.833 --> 26:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Opposition research is not
all just fun and games.

26:18.300 --> 26:22.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's serious business,
especially running
for high office.

26:22.266 --> 26:27.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But there are legal lines and
then there are also just decency
boundaries, you know, like

26:28.366 --> 26:30.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
the example I mentioned
about the family.

26:30.466 --> 26:34.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Right, but even
if -- Christina, even if the
campaign says, we're not going

26:36.266 --> 26:39.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
to do this, there are other
tabloids and others out there
who may be engaging in this kind

26:40.133 --> 26:41.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of research.

26:41.066 --> 26:43.133 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: Sure.

26:43.133 --> 26:46.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And I think one thing -- Tim
will probably back me up on
this -- one thing that is true

26:46.200 --> 26:49.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
of all researchers
is, we all see black
helicopters a little bit.

26:49.933 --> 26:51.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We are all just a
little bit paranoid.

26:51.833 --> 26:54.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
And you worry about a setup.

26:54.500 --> 26:58.700 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You worry that just the
giving of that information
may be more interesting
news than the information

27:00.200 --> 27:01.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
itself.

27:01.666 --> 27:05.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And so you use your best
judgment, as Tim mentioned.

27:05.200 --> 27:09.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You know, you use your lawyers
and you use your best judgment,
and you make sure that

27:09.766 --> 27:11.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
you don't do anything that's
going to damage the campaign.

27:11.533 --> 27:13.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Experience counts.

27:13.666 --> 27:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
TIM MILLER: You go back
to that '08 campaign
with Hillary Clinton and
Obama, Hillary Clinton's

27:17.366 --> 27:22.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
oppo research on Obama, I think
-- Christina would know better
-- backfired more than it

27:22.100 --> 27:27.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
helped, because people didn't
want there to be, within a
family, intraparty squabbles

27:28.666 --> 27:29.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that were that personal.

27:29.933 --> 27:33.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And so you have to be
careful about that.

27:33.000 --> 27:37.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are electoral implications
to consider, in addition to
the legal and ethical ones.

27:37.233 --> 27:41.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, it is --
it's a subject that doesn't
get a lot of attention, but,

27:41.700 --> 27:44.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
right now, everybody
is asking questions.

27:44.033 --> 27:47.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Tim Miller, Christina
Reynolds, we thank you both.

27:47.333 --> 27:52.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
CHRISTINA REYNOLDS: Thank you.

27:53.200 --> 27:57.866 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
TIM MILLER: Thanks, Judy.

27:59.800 --> 28:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: We return to our
series Inside Putin's Russia
-- tonight, the fate of some

28:05.766 --> 28:07.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
of the Kremlin's opponents.

28:07.933 --> 28:12.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
According to one study, in the
past three years, 38 prominent
Russians have been murdered

28:13.666 --> 28:15.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
or died suspiciously.

28:15.666 --> 28:20.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The high mortality rate
among some Russian critics
has a long history.

28:20.266 --> 28:25.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But critics say it is emblematic
of how President Vladimir
Putin runs today's Russia.

28:27.333 --> 28:30.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Special correspondent Nick
Schifrin and producer Zach
Fannin report from Moscow.

28:30.833 --> 28:35.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In today's
Russia, there are consequences
to criticizing the state.

28:37.433 --> 28:40.733 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Police tell protesters their
rally isn't sanctioned.

28:40.733 --> 28:44.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They are asking President
Vladimir Putin not to
run for reelection.

28:44.733 --> 28:48.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This demonstration is
sponsored by the opposition
group Open Russia.

28:48.133 --> 28:52.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In Saint Petersburg, and across
the country, police arrested
more than 100 protesters.

28:52.833 --> 28:56.266 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA, Open
Russia: These democratic
opposition activists
are being arrested and

28:56.266 --> 28:58.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
given lengthy prison sentences.

28:58.266 --> 29:01.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It is members of the democratic
opposition who are being
forced into exile, or harassed,

29:01.900 --> 29:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
or attacked, or murdered.

29:04.233 --> 29:07.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN:
Thirty-five--year-old
Vladimir Kara-Murza is Open
Russia's vice chairman.

29:07.233 --> 29:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He is an outspoken activist,
demonstrating against Putin
and organizing protests.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
We first sat down with
him late last year.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: We
believe in the rule of law.

29:16.200 --> 29:18.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We believe in human rights.

29:18.333 --> 29:21.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
We believe that Russia
should enjoy the same
democratic institutions
that the rest of Europe

29:21.333 --> 29:23.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
enjoys.

29:23.366 --> 29:25.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: To try and create
those democratic institutions,
he teamed up with the man he

29:25.333 --> 29:29.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
calls his mentor, Boris Nemtsov,
a former deputy prime minister
who became the country's

29:29.933 --> 29:31.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
leading dissident.

29:31.966 --> 29:35.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The two traveled to Washington
to highlight the mysterious
death of Sergei Magnitsky,

29:35.033 --> 29:38.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a lawyer who exposed corruption
among senior officials.

29:38.900 --> 29:42.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Nemtsov and Kara-Murza
convinced the U.S. Congress to
freeze the assets of Russians

29:42.900 --> 29:45.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
believed connected
to Magnitsky's death.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.633 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA:
These people in the
current Russian regime who
rule like to keep their

29:48.633 --> 29:50.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
money, their assets in the West.

29:50.566 --> 29:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They want to
vacation in the West.

29:51.766 --> 29:54.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They send their kids
to schools to the West.

29:54.233 --> 29:58.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And this personal accountability
may well be the only thing
that will make them think

29:58.933 --> 30:01.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
twice.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: A little more
than two years later, Nemtsov
was assassinated a few hundred

30:03.433 --> 30:05.000 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
feet from the Kremlin's walls.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.900 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
His death was
brazen and shocking.

30:07.900 --> 30:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is the spot where
Boris Nemtsov was killed.

30:09.966 --> 30:14.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And you can see the corner of
the Kremlin, right there, just
a few hundreds yards away,

30:14.100 --> 30:18.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
and you can see the memorial
for him that's on this bridge.

30:18.166 --> 30:21.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Today in Moscow, a court
sentenced five people
in Nemtsov's murder.

30:21.866 --> 30:26.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Whether or not they were the
masterminds, they permanently
silenced Nemtsov's outspoken

30:26.033 --> 30:27.500 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
criticism.

30:27.500 --> 30:30.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Kara-Murza believes someone
used poison to silence him too.

30:30.066 --> 30:34.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: And I
started suddenly feeling really,
really sick, and within a

30:34.000 --> 30:39.000 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
space of 15 to 20 minutes, I
went from feeling completely
normal, like I am now, to having

30:40.600 --> 30:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a really rapid heart rate,
sweating, palpitation.

30:43.233 --> 30:45.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I started vomiting, and then
I just lost consciousness.

30:45.533 --> 30:47.233 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Kidneys, I think went first.

30:47.233 --> 30:51.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Then it was the heart,
the lungs, the stomach,
the liver, everything.

30:52.666 --> 30:55.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Everything just shut down.

30:55.200 --> 30:58.533 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
So I have no doubt that
this was a deliberate
attempt to murder, based
on my political activities,

31:00.100 --> 31:02.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
motivated by my activities
in the Russian opposition.

31:02.000 --> 31:06.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: There are
people who are working as
opposition who are not targeted.

31:08.033 --> 31:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
What is the line that
you apparently crossed?

31:10.400 --> 31:14.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: There's
the clear line between just
saying things that are against

31:14.366 --> 31:18.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the regime, and it's a totally
different thing to go after
their own personal interests,

31:18.966 --> 31:20.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
after their pockets.

31:20.466 --> 31:23.366 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The history of
assassination goes back decades.

31:23.366 --> 31:26.633 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
In 1940, Leon Trotsky was
killed with an ice axe.

31:26.633 --> 31:30.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2006, crusading
Russian journalist Anna
Politkovskaya was murdered.

31:30.933 --> 31:35.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And in 2014, Alexander
Litvinenko, a former
intelligence agent who
accused Putin of ordering

31:37.400 --> 31:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Politkovskaya's death, was
killed by radioactive tea.

31:40.133 --> 31:44.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Denis Voronenkov was a pro-Putin
lawmaker who defected to
Ukraine and became a Putin

31:44.766 --> 31:46.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
critic.

31:46.833 --> 31:49.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In March, he was walking down
the street in Kiev when a
gunman shot him three times.

31:49.500 --> 31:52.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
His body bled out on
the sidewalk in the
middle of the day.

31:52.733 --> 31:54.766 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Maria Maksakova is his widow.

31:54.766 --> 31:58.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MARIA MAKSAKOVA, Widow of Denis
Voronenkov: I was dreaming
about my first spring in Kiev

31:58.333 --> 31:59.766 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
with Denis.

31:59.766 --> 32:02.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I was dreaming so desperately.

32:02.266 --> 32:07.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
At first, I thought it's better
not to be born at all when
you lose something like that.

32:08.900 --> 32:11.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Maksakova
lives in Kiev, where she
is raising their son.

32:11.233 --> 32:15.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
In Moscow, she and Voronenkov
were both lawmakers
allied with Putin, and
they enjoyed the spoils

32:15.033 --> 32:17.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
that come from power.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.900 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But he'd also been an
investigator who uncovered
corruption in the Russian
intelligence agency,

32:20.900 --> 32:22.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
the FSB.

32:22.100 --> 32:23.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Who do you think
killed your husband?

32:23.366 --> 32:26.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
MARIA MAKSAKOVA: He
had certain enemies.

32:26.266 --> 32:28.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And these enemies
are in the FSB.

32:28.800 --> 32:33.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The anti-corruption teams that
he would investigate from here,
that is loss of money and loss

32:38.666 --> 32:43.566 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
of influence, loss of
everything, positions.

32:43.566 --> 32:45.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And that was something that
they would not let him do.

32:45.933 --> 32:48.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Russia calls
her claim a fabrication.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
But his death fits a pattern.

32:50.966 --> 32:54.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
A once-loyal family member
becomes an outspoken
opponent and ends up dead.

32:54.166 --> 32:57.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN, Author/Activist:
A mafia family, you can be born
into, you can be adopted into

32:57.366 --> 32:58.366 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
it.

32:58.366 --> 33:00.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You can't leave it voluntarily.

33:00.466 --> 33:03.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
People who have tried to leave
the Putin family voluntarily
have not fared very well.

33:03.900 --> 33:08.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Masha Gessen is a
Russian journalist, author, and
prolific anti-Putin activist.

33:08.866 --> 33:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You have been dubbed by
some an enemy of the state.

33:12.966 --> 33:14.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Are you an enemy of the state?

33:14.666 --> 33:16.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MASHA GESSEN: Well, I
am certainly an enemy
of the mafia state.

33:16.433 --> 33:17.666 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Absolutely, yes.

33:17.666 --> 33:20.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
I'm not an enemy of
the Russian state.

33:20.066 --> 33:23.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Gessen
was the first journalist
blacklisted by Putin's Kremlin.

33:23.733 --> 33:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She's also been targeted
because she's a lesbian who's
raising adopted children.

33:27.033 --> 33:31.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
WOMAN (through translator):
He was born by a woman I don't
know and first met when he

33:31.766 --> 33:33.866 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
was 2.

33:33.866 --> 33:37.733 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: In 2013,
she helped lead a video
campaign criticizing
an anti-gay propaganda

33:37.733 --> 33:39.766 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
law.

33:39.766 --> 33:43.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It helped condone homophobia
and attacks on gay Russians, and
Gessen argues the law explains

33:43.366 --> 33:45.466 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
how Putin rules.

33:45.466 --> 33:49.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: The autocrat
needs everybody out in the
street with flags aloft.

33:50.566 --> 33:52.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is primarily the
need for mobilization.

33:52.233 --> 33:55.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
To have mobilization,
you need to have enemies.

33:55.300 --> 34:00.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
You can have LGBT people as
enemies today, and then you
can have Americans tomorrow,

34:00.333 --> 34:04.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and keep the LGBT people in
your back pocket and then pull
them out when you need them

34:04.333 --> 34:06.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
again.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And Gessen says
above it all is a boss served
by loyal lieutenants, who

34:08.800 --> 34:11.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
don't need explicit
instructions to launch attacks.

34:11.233 --> 34:16.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MASHA GESSEN: The patriarch
of the family will say, do I
always have to tell you what

34:16.700 --> 34:18.233 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
to do?

34:18.233 --> 34:20.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Like, don't you know what
the right thing to do is?

34:20.000 --> 34:22.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Does the Kremlin
kill its political enemies?

34:22.133 --> 34:23.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
SERGEY MARKOV, Russian
National Strategic Council:
One hundred percent sure not.

34:23.966 --> 34:26.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: The Kremlin
declined our interview request.

34:26.400 --> 34:31.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
But Sergey Markov, a
member of Putin's party
and Russia's National
Strategic Council, reflects

34:33.533 --> 34:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
the Kremlin's defense,
counterpunch and embrace
conspiracy theories, starting
with the assassinated

34:36.233 --> 34:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
opposition leader Boris Nemtsov.

34:37.933 --> 34:40.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SERGEY MARKOV: Who
organized his killing?

34:40.200 --> 34:45.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I strongly believe that it's
terrorist organization SBU,
intelligence service of Ukraine.

34:47.033 --> 34:49.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Ukraine
killed Boris Nemtsov?

34:49.000 --> 34:51.666 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SERGEY MARKOV: Not Ukraine.

34:51.666 --> 34:56.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Ukraine is country run by
terrorists, but terrorists who
captured Ukraine, they killed

34:58.233 --> 34:59.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Boris Nemtsov.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: But
it's more than Nemtsov.

35:00.300 --> 35:01.500 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Right?

35:01.500 --> 35:02.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Vladimir Kara-Murza has
been poisoned twice.

35:02.633 --> 35:05.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Anna Politkovskaya was killed.

35:05.300 --> 35:08.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
There are a lot of people
who have criticized the
Kremlin who end up dead.

35:08.033 --> 35:10.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
SERGEY MARKOV: First
of all, not too much.

35:10.033 --> 35:14.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
This atmosphere of
killing people exists,
but this atmosphere
had been created not by

35:17.066 --> 35:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Vladimir Putin, but by Western
countries against Russia.

35:21.500 --> 35:25.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: For the people
Putin targets, that argument
is an attempt to distract.

35:25.733 --> 35:28.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKHAIL KASYANOV, Former
Russian Prime Minister:
Russia surrounded by enemies.

35:28.700 --> 35:32.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We should support even
stronger than before our
leader, et cetera, et cetera.

35:32.700 --> 35:36.266 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
This is standard propaganda
for any authoritarian regime.

35:36.266 --> 35:39.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Mikhail
Kasyanov was Putin's
first prime minister.

35:39.200 --> 35:43.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In the early 2000s, the two
worked together to pass much
needed economic reforms.

35:43.933 --> 35:48.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In 2004, Putin fired him, and
Kasyanov became an outspoken
opposition politician, appearing

35:50.133 --> 35:52.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
alongside Boris Nemtsov
and Vladimir Kara-Murza.

35:52.866 --> 35:57.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Last year, a prominent Putin
ally posted a video of him
and Kara-Murza in crosshairs.

35:57.233 --> 36:00.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
But not all of the Kremlin's
enemies end up dead.

36:00.133 --> 36:01.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Some end up humiliated.

36:01.933 --> 36:03.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How did they target you?

36:03.433 --> 36:05.466 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
MIKHAIL KASYANOV: On television.

36:05.466 --> 36:08.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They're blackmailing me and
just creating dirty stories,
et cetera, et cetera.

36:08.800 --> 36:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Five
months before 2015
elections, state television
broadcast Kasyanov having

36:13.600 --> 36:15.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
sex with his assistant.

36:15.366 --> 36:17.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The video helped
fracture his party.

36:17.433 --> 36:21.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKHAIL KASYANOV: They will
try to destroy publicly, to
destroy morally and reputation

36:23.466 --> 36:24.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
of all of us.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they're doing this
quite successfully.

36:26.333 --> 36:28.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And they will
continue doing this.

36:28.166 --> 36:30.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And
is there anything you
can do to stop them?

36:30.966 --> 36:33.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIKHAIL KASYANOV: We
cannot do anything because
we have no protection.

36:33.900 --> 36:36.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: We have
no free and fair elections.

36:36.233 --> 36:38.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We have censorship in the media.

36:38.166 --> 36:40.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have political prisoners,
more than 100 political
prisoners now in Russia, today.

36:40.900 --> 36:44.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: One year after
he nearly died from poisoning,
Kara-Murza got better, and

36:44.866 --> 36:46.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
restarted his work.

36:46.866 --> 36:50.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
In February, he was a few
hours away from boarding a
plane to Washington, where his

36:50.233 --> 36:54.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
family lives for their
safety, when he says he
was poisoned a second time.

36:54.066 --> 36:57.000 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We sat down with him and
his wife, Evgenia, in march.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA:
And I couldn't breathe.

36:59.233 --> 37:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And at this stage, when you
are lying there, trying to gasp
for air, you know, I felt just

37:05.400 --> 37:10.400 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
life slowly going out
of the whole body.

37:11.833 --> 37:13.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
And I remember that distinct
feeling that, this is it.

37:13.600 --> 37:14.633 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
This is the end.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Now I'm going to die.

37:16.866 --> 37:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The only thing I was able to
do, I called my wife, Evgenia,
who was here in the United

37:22.333 --> 37:24.400 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
States.

37:24.400 --> 37:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
EVGENIA KARA-MURZA, Wife
of Vladimir Kara-Murza:
I asked them to take
him to the hospital,

37:25.833 --> 37:28.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
to the same medical team
that had treated him in 2015.

37:28.400 --> 37:33.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Had he been on the plane, had
he been alone in his apartment,
had he been somewhere with

37:35.333 --> 37:40.333 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
- - I don't know, in the streets
of Moscow - - oh, my God.

37:44.333 --> 37:49.333 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Kara-Murza
had noticed that, almost
every night, Moscow
city workers removed

37:51.833 --> 37:53.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
Boris Nemtsov's memorial.

37:53.333 --> 37:57.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
So he made a film to protect
his mentor's career and life.

37:57.033 --> 38:02.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: That
film was the most difficult
thing I ever did in my life.

38:04.033 --> 38:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The film is about the portrait
of a man who could, if not
for a quirk of fate, very well

38:07.566 --> 38:08.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
become the president of Russia.

38:08.566 --> 38:10.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Do you miss him?

38:10.566 --> 38:14.566 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
VLADIMIR KARA-MURZA: There
are no words to describe
how much I miss him.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.066 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Sorry.

38:21.066 --> 38:25.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
EVGENIA KARA-MURZA: The risks,
they do hit close to home,
closer and closer every time.

38:27.500 --> 38:32.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: Have you ever
asked him not to go back?

38:33.666 --> 38:34.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
EVGENIA KARA-MURZA:
It is terrifying.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
I'm not going to lie to you.

38:36.566 --> 38:40.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
But I want him to continue to
do what he thinks is important,
what he thinks is right.

38:44.200 --> 38:49.200 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
NICK SCHIFRIN: And her
faith allows Kara-Murza
to keep his faith that
he can change the system.

38:51.166 --> 38:55.166 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He says, after recovering, he
will go back to Russia to finish
the work that he and Nemtsov

38:55.633 --> 38:57.100 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
started.

38:57.100 --> 38:59.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
For the "PBS NewsHour," I'm
Nick Schifrin in Moscow.

38:59.200 --> 39:04.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JUDY WOODRUFF: And our week-long
series Inside Putin's Russia
continues tomorrow with a look

39:05.633 --> 39:09.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
at the relationship between
Russia and the United States.

39:22.700 --> 39:27.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When it comes to Wall Street,
many people think of money
and greed, but a professor

39:27.500 --> 39:32.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
at Harvard Business School
argues there's a lot more to
the world of finance, and he

39:32.200 --> 39:35.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
uses books and movies
to make his case.

39:35.300 --> 39:38.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
Our economics correspondent
Paul Solman has the story.

39:38.300 --> 39:42.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
It's part of our series
Making Sense, which
airs every Thursday.

39:42.233 --> 39:46.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
ACTORS: One, two, three!

39:46.066 --> 39:48.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

39:48.933 --> 39:53.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: The field
of finance, you might say
it has an image problem.

39:55.600 --> 39:59.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
Consider "The Wolf of
Wall Street," based on
a real-life character.

39:59.200 --> 40:02.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
LEONARDO DICAPRIO, Actor:
If anybody here thinks I'm
superficial or materialistic, go

40:02.866 --> 40:07.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
get a job at McDonald's,
because that's where you
(EXPLETIVE DELETED) belong.

40:08.833 --> 40:10.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

40:10.933 --> 40:15.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Investment banker
Patrick Bateman in "American
Psycho" is fictional, but not

40:16.266 --> 40:18.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
entirely implausible.

40:18.700 --> 40:22.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
CHRISTIAN BALE, Actor: I
have all the characteristics
of a human being, flesh,
blood, skin, hair,

40:23.966 --> 40:28.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
but not a single clear,
identifiable emotion, except
for greed and disgust.

40:30.266 --> 40:32.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MICHAEL DOUGLAS, Actor: I am
not a destroyer of companies.

40:32.833 --> 40:37.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Hey, finance has
had an image problem since
buyout bro Gordon Gekko graced

40:38.733 --> 40:40.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
the silver screen 30 years ago.

40:40.800 --> 40:45.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MICHAEL DOUGLAS: The point
is, ladies and gentlemen that
greed, for lack of a better

40:46.766 --> 40:48.233 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
word, is good.

40:48.233 --> 40:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: Big bank, small
bank, I like to make money.

40:50.800 --> 40:52.800 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
All right?

40:52.800 --> 40:56.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And the real
events of the 2008 financial
crisis only made matters worse.

40:57.900 --> 41:00.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTOR: That's America's
housing market.

41:00.100 --> 41:03.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: But Harvard
Business School's Mihir
Desai says there are
two faces to finance,

41:05.333 --> 41:07.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
though he readily acknowledges
the dark one to his students.

41:07.466 --> 41:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
®MD+IMD-I MIHIR DESAI,
Harvard Business School: Many

41:08.933 --> 41:12.033 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
people demonize what you do,
and it's hard to live that way.

41:12.033 --> 41:15.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And he
told me he gets why that
perception is so pervasive.

41:15.366 --> 41:20.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: When you have
real-life figures like Martin
Shkreli, who was both a hedge

41:20.200 --> 41:25.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
fund trader and then took over
a pharmaceutical company, jacked
up prices by 5000 percent,

41:27.200 --> 41:30.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
subsequently engaged in
a variety of nefarious
behavior, and very
proudly so, so it almost

41:31.933 --> 41:34.066 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
makes you feel like real
life is outpacing fiction.

41:34.066 --> 41:38.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Desai has
written a book to try
to balance the picture,
"The Wisdom of Finance."

41:38.333 --> 41:42.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: The goal in the
book is to try to demystify
finance so that the people who

41:42.933 --> 41:47.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
currently demonize it will
come to understand it, as
opposed to simply oppose it.

41:47.600 --> 41:50.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And then for the people
who are in finance, we have
to get back to the ideas.

41:50.666 --> 41:52.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
The ideas matter.

41:52.766 --> 41:56.766 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: To Professor
Desai, the big idea of finance
is illustrated by the Quincunx

41:58.800 --> 42:02.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
machine in Boston's Museum of
Science: the ability to find
order in a seemingly random,

42:03.966 --> 42:06.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
and therefore
risk-forsaken, world.

42:06.266 --> 42:11.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: This was a real
revolution in probability,
which is random things happening

42:12.766 --> 42:14.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
results in predictable patterns.

42:14.966 --> 42:19.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Balls drop,
bounce randomly left or
right as they encounter
the pins, and eventually

42:20.466 --> 42:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
hit bottom to form
a bell-shaped curve.

42:23.100 --> 42:27.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Things that seem
random actually end up resulting
in a very orderly pattern,

42:27.533 --> 42:30.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in fact, this bell-shaped
distribution or
normal distribution.

42:30.366 --> 42:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And that, of course, is the
foundation of finance, because
you observe a lot of random

42:34.500 --> 42:37.933 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
things, but it ends up
behaving in predictable ways.

42:37.933 --> 42:41.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Randomness and
its risks are everywhere.

42:41.233 --> 42:44.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Finance's job, to
try to manage them.

42:44.133 --> 42:45.733 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
Case in point?

42:45.733 --> 42:48.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The income plight of women
throughout most of history.

42:48.300 --> 42:52.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: You should consider
that it is by no means certain
that another offer of marriage

42:52.233 --> 42:54.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
may ever be made to you.

42:54.366 --> 42:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Mr. Collins, who
delivers the worst proposal
ever to Lizzy Bennet in "Pride

42:59.866 --> 43:02.000 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
and Prejudice."

43:02.000 --> 43:05.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: I am well aware that
1,000 pounds is all you may
ever be entitled to, but rest

43:07.466 --> 43:11.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
assured I shall never
reproach on that score
when we are married.

43:11.033 --> 43:14.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: You're not that
wealthy, you're not that
pretty, you have an offer on the

43:14.866 --> 43:16.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
table today from me.

43:16.233 --> 43:18.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
You would better take it.

43:18.200 --> 43:21.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's the great
economic risk faced by all
Jane Austen's Bennet girls, but

43:21.866 --> 43:23.900 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
says Desai:

43:23.900 --> 43:27.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Lizzy turns down
Mr. Collins, and the advice
of her mother, because she

43:27.400 --> 43:29.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
wants to roll the dice again.

43:29.533 --> 43:32.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Of course, that ends up
very nicely, ultimately,
with Mr. Darcy, but,
at the time, she didn't

43:32.533 --> 43:34.033 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
know.

43:34.033 --> 43:37.166 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: No, Lizzy was
lucky in love and money.

43:37.166 --> 43:39.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She accepted the risk.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
But most others didn't.

43:41.666 --> 43:45.466 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: The next day,
he gives the same proposal to
Charlotte, her friend, and she

43:45.466 --> 43:47.100 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
takes it.

43:47.100 --> 43:49.633 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ACTOR: Cousin Elizabeth,
you can see before you
the happiest of men.

43:49.633 --> 43:54.400 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Charlotte
Lucas' lot wasn't the
happiest, but better than
penury, one imagines.

43:55.833 --> 43:57.433 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: She said, I'm just
going to take the solution.

43:57.433 --> 43:59.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: In Anthony
Trollope "Phineas Finn":

43:59.466 --> 44:04.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: How nice to find
you and to find you alone.

44:06.300 --> 44:08.333 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Violet Effingham
had a very different
problem: too many suitors.

44:08.333 --> 44:11.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: And you
look very piratical
tonight, Lord Chiltern.

44:11.500 --> 44:15.866 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ACTOR: That is because you see
me by the side of all these
smug, glossy parliament men.

44:15.866 --> 44:20.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: She doesn't know
who to choose, and she says,
you know, if only I could marry

44:20.033 --> 44:21.433 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
all 10.

44:21.433 --> 44:23.466 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You know, she's the
essence of diversification.

44:23.466 --> 44:25.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Because then
you wouldn't have all
your eggs in one basket.

44:25.233 --> 44:27.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
You would have 10 different
guys, 10 different fortunes.

44:27.666 --> 44:29.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
MIHIR DESAI: Exactly.

44:29.666 --> 44:33.666 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The intuition that you
can lower risk by dividing
resources is extremely old.

44:35.633 --> 44:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That diversification idea goes
back to shipping, when you split
up your cargo across routes.

44:40.133 --> 44:43.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It goes back to agriculture,
when people would
split up their land.

44:43.233 --> 44:48.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
In Ecclesiastes, we see
the advice to invest in
seven ventures -- no,
eight ventures, because

44:49.400 --> 44:50.866 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
you never know what
disaster will happen.

44:50.866 --> 44:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: So this is
the benign face of finance.

44:54.233 --> 44:59.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
It allows you to protect against
risk by, among other things,
diversifying your investments.

45:00.566 --> 45:03.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But then there's
the dark face again.

45:03.033 --> 45:07.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When you invest, you're still
stuck with the risk of giving
your money to someone else.

45:07.733 --> 45:12.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: I gave my
money to Tim Cook, who runs
Apple, and I own one share.

45:12.500 --> 45:13.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
Here's the problem.

45:13.500 --> 45:15.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I can't watch Tim Cook.

45:15.500 --> 45:18.366 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So the underlying problem
becomes, well, wait a second,
how do I monitor that guy?

45:18.366 --> 45:19.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
How do I watch that guy?

45:19.800 --> 45:21.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
How do I make sure he's
doing the right thing for me?

45:21.233 --> 45:23.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: This is the
principal-agent problem.

45:23.100 --> 45:27.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
The principal is the
shareholder, who has the wealth.

45:27.866 --> 45:30.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The agent is the manager
entrusted with it.

45:30.033 --> 45:34.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: If you only know
what I went through for you.

45:34.500 --> 45:39.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: And principals
and agents can have conflicting
interests, in the case of

45:40.833 --> 45:43.600 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
"The Producers,"
extremely conflicting.

45:43.600 --> 45:48.433 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
GENE WILDER, Actor:
It's absolutely amazing
that, under the right
circumstances, a producer

45:48.433 --> 45:50.800 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
could make more money with a
flop than he could with a hit.

45:50.800 --> 45:55.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: The essence of "The
Producers" is that these two
folks, Bialystock and Bloom,

45:57.766 --> 45:59.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
want to rip off a bunch of
investors, and by creating a
flop, the investors won't want

45:59.933 --> 46:01.500 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
their money back.

46:01.500 --> 46:04.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
They raised 25000 percent
of what they actually need.

46:04.100 --> 46:09.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
They create this -- what they
think is going to be a flop,
"Springtime For Hitler," and,

46:10.666 --> 46:15.666 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
of course, it becomes a
hit, and they go to jail.

46:17.933 --> 46:20.433 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
These investors trusted
Bialystock and Bloom.

46:20.433 --> 46:22.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They couldn't
actually monitor them.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
They turned out to be bad eggs.

46:23.800 --> 46:25.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That is the problem
with capital markets.

46:25.833 --> 46:29.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That is the problem with me
giving money to people and not
knowing what they end up doing.

46:29.033 --> 46:34.033 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: But, of course,
for every Bialystock,
there's a Buffett, for
every Bernie Madoff,

46:36.033 --> 46:40.133 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
1,000 honest brokers,
because there have always
been two faces of finance.

46:41.566 --> 46:43.900 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: This is actually
my favorite book about finance.

46:43.900 --> 46:45.133 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
It's from 1688.

46:45.133 --> 46:47.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: Yes, a
good year for finance.

46:47.300 --> 46:51.200 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: And it was
"Confusion de Confusiones."

46:51.200 --> 46:56.200 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
He basically describes finance
as the most noble profession,
as well as the most notorious

46:58.133 --> 47:00.166 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
profession.

47:00.166 --> 47:02.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I think we have lost sense
of the nobility part that he
describes, and we tend to focus

47:02.933 --> 47:05.066 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
on the negative.

47:05.066 --> 47:08.933 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: Desai, wanting
to accentuate the positive,
uses an exemplar of finance

47:10.333 --> 47:12.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
from Willa Cather's 19th
century novel, "O Pioneers!"

47:12.966 --> 47:17.933 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Alexandra
Bergson is this wonderful
character who is a farmer,
who starts by basically

47:19.400 --> 47:21.500 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
doing a leveraged buyout of
farms near where she lives.

47:21.500 --> 47:23.166 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: She borrows
money in order to buy.

47:23.166 --> 47:25.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
MIHIR DESAI: She borrows
a bunch of money to
buy all of these farms.

47:25.266 --> 47:27.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
ACTRESS: Now, I
have figured it out.

47:27.233 --> 47:29.866 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We sell most of the cattle e
and the corn we have left over.

47:29.866 --> 47:31.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We buy the Lindstrom place.

47:31.933 --> 47:36.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Then we take out two loans
on our half-section and
buy Peter Crow's place.

47:36.033 --> 47:40.766 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
MIHIR DESAI: She ends up
engaging in transactions
that would be in any
finance textbook.

47:40.766 --> 47:43.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
But she never loses
sight of who she is.

47:43.100 --> 47:47.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She never behaves in ways that
would suggest that she thinks
everything is due to her skill,

47:47.300 --> 47:48.833 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
as opposed to luck.

47:48.833 --> 47:51.400 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
She's very conscious of and
very humble of her outcome.

47:51.400 --> 47:54.233 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTOR: You have worked wonders
with this land, Alexandra.

47:54.233 --> 47:57.300 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
ACTRESS: Oh, we hadn't any of
us much to do with it, Carl.

47:57.300 --> 47:59.333 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
The land did it.

47:59.333 --> 48:03.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: We really need good
stories about finance, because
good stories will guide good

48:03.733 --> 48:05.200 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
behavior.

48:05.200 --> 48:07.566 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
PAUL SOLMAN: It's a lesson Desai
tries to teach his students.

48:07.566 --> 48:11.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
MIHIR DESAI: Pick your stories
carefully, because you will
live your life by these stories.

48:11.733 --> 48:13.466 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Some of you might
pick Gordon Gekko.

48:13.466 --> 48:15.266 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
I don't recommend it.

48:15.266 --> 48:17.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Alexandra Bergson is
a fantastic model.

48:17.366 --> 48:21.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
PAUL SOLMAN: For the
"PBS NewsHour," this is
economics correspondent
Paul Solman reporting

48:21.233 --> 48:23.366 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
from Boston.

48:23.366 --> 48:27.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
JUDY WOODRUFF: Who knew
by watching all these
films that you could get
great economic advice?

48:29.300 --> 48:32.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So, while writing his book,
Professor Desai says he was
surprised to discover how many

48:33.966 --> 48:37.533 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
great writers, painters
and musicians also
held jobs in finance.

48:39.833 --> 48:42.800 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
You can test your own knowledge
of these entrepreneurial
artists with our online
quiz at PBS.org/NewsHour.

48:43.266 --> 48:47.833 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
Now to

48:54.333 --> 48:59.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
another in our Brief
But Spectacular series,
where we ask people to
describe their passions.

49:01.300 --> 49:04.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Tonight, we hear from
British activist and
attorney Alexander McLean.

49:04.233 --> 49:09.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
He is the founder of the
Ugandan-based African
Prisons Project, which
seeks to improve the

49:10.333 --> 49:12.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
lives of people
imprisoned in Africa.

49:12.333 --> 49:14.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
ALEXANDER MCLEAN, Founder,
African Prisons Project: I
think that, with any of us, if

49:14.433 --> 49:18.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
the world knew the thing about
us we are most ashamed of,
and that's all that they knew,

49:18.300 --> 49:22.600 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and that's all that they were
interested in, society would
lose out, because each of us

49:22.600 --> 49:27.600 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
has much more to offer than
the worst thing we have done.

49:31.400 --> 49:36.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have been working in prisons
in Uganda since I was 18,
spending a lot of time on death

49:38.233 --> 49:40.833 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
row, growing up with many
of the death row inmates.

49:40.833 --> 49:43.366 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
They have become
like family to me.

49:43.366 --> 49:47.700 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
I have spent time in about 130
prisons all over the world.

49:47.700 --> 49:52.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I have seen that they're filled
with people who are poor and
not educated, and not connected.

49:54.566 --> 49:58.833 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
When I was 19, I first
visited the women's prison
in Kampala, Uganda's capital.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.133 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
That's where many women
were on death row.

50:03.133 --> 50:06.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
Often, they were there
for killing a husband.

50:06.100 --> 50:09.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Uganda has some of the highest
rates of domestic violence in
the world, and, sometimes, when

50:09.533 --> 50:14.133 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
a woman fights back, she will
find herself on death row.

50:14.133 --> 50:17.500 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
That time I met Susan, she
was sentenced to death for
killing her husband when she was

50:17.500 --> 50:19.166 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
21.

50:19.166 --> 50:22.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
She shared her cell
designed for one person
with three other women.

50:22.233 --> 50:24.066 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She started a
school on death row.

50:24.066 --> 50:25.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
She established a choir.

50:25.333 --> 50:27.333 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She was a lead in
the prison church.

50:27.333 --> 50:32.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
I saw that Susan was
transforming her community
from the inside out.

50:32.066 --> 50:36.533 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The African Prisons Project got
her admitted into the University
of London in 2011 to study

50:36.533 --> 50:41.066 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
for a law degree by
correspondence, as Nelson
Mandela had done from
prison in South Africa.

50:41.066 --> 50:45.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
So,Susan was one of the
University of London's best
students in human rights law.

50:45.100 --> 50:49.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She established a legal aid
clinic in her prison, helping
scores of her fellow inmates

50:49.700 --> 50:51.733 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
to be released from prison.

50:51.733 --> 50:55.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She led a case, Susan Kigula
and 417 others, where all of
the death row inmates in Uganda

50:57.900 --> 51:00.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
challenged the mandatory
death sentence for
murder and armed robbery.

51:00.966 --> 51:05.966 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
As a result of this case,
Susan and hundreds of others
were released from death row.

51:07.100 --> 51:09.300 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
She's now completed
her law degree.

51:09.300 --> 51:12.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Uganda's most senior
judge invited her to apply
to join the judiciary.

51:12.233 --> 51:17.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
She said: I won't, and now I'm
going to train women in prison
in the law, so they can use

51:18.566 --> 51:20.533 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the law to protect their
families and their communities.

51:20.533 --> 51:25.433 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're in the process of
establishing the world's first
prison-based law college.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We're then going to establish a
prison-based law firm, through
which they provide services

51:29.700 --> 51:31.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to their peers.

51:31.700 --> 51:34.800 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
We have seen about 3,000 people
released from prison in Uganda
and Kenya, having accessed

51:34.800 --> 51:38.000 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
legal services from
prisoners and prison
staff we have trained.

51:38.000 --> 51:42.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
The law is seen as
a profession for the
privileged, for the elite.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.300 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
We want to change that thinking.

51:44.300 --> 51:48.100 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
We recognize that, actually, the
law is here to serve all of us.

We want to see people getting
out of prison, becoming lawyers
and judges, and politicians,

51:55.066 --> 51:58.733 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
and legal academics, and
business leaders, going from the
margins of society to the center

51:58.733 --> 52:00.666 align:left position:37.5%,start line:93.33% size:62.5%
of it.

My name is Alexander McLean.

52:02.700 --> 52:07.700 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
This is my Brief But Spectacular
take on the power of the law
in the hands of the poor.

JUDY WOODRUFF: And you

Spectacular videos on our Web

52:17.900 --> 52:21.400 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
And now to a "NewsHour" shares,
something that caught our
eye, that might be of interest

52:21.400 --> 52:23.400 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
to you, too.

52:23.400 --> 52:27.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Navy teams around the globe
are often called in to
assist in rescue efforts.

52:27.033 --> 52:32.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
But, this week, one
maritime mission in the
Indian Ocean helped a
unique creature in need.

52:33.700 --> 52:36.033 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
The "NewsHour"'s Julia
Griffin explains.

52:36.033 --> 52:41.033 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
JULIA GRIFFIN: It was a routine
patrol for a Sri Lankan naval
team Tuesday morning, when

52:43.033 --> 52:46.300 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
they spotted something unusual
bobbing among the ocean waves,
not a bird or a boat, but

52:48.200 --> 52:52.900 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
rather a fully grown Asian
elephant, struggling to stay
afloat nearly 10 miles offshore.

52:54.900 --> 52:59.100 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Elephants are some of the
best swimmers of land mammals,
thanks to buoyant bodies and

53:01.166 --> 53:04.200 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
trunks that can be
used as snorkels, but
this pachyderm appeared
fatigued and distressed.

53:06.233 --> 53:09.666 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
Officials believe the
animal had been trying
to cross the Kokkilai
Lagoon off the country's

53:09.666 --> 53:13.700 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
northeast coast when it
was swept out to sea.

53:13.700 --> 53:18.233 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Deciding to intervene, the
Navy and Department of Wildlife
dispatched additional teams to

53:18.233 --> 53:21.966 align:left position:0%,start line:86.67% size:100%
the area, initiating a
mammoth-sized rescue effort.

53:21.966 --> 53:26.966 align:left position:12.5%,start line:73.33% size:87.5%
The divers plunged
into the salty water to
soothe the elephant and
loop a tow rope around

53:27.633 --> 53:29.700 align:left position:25%,start line:93.33% size:75%
its body.

53:29.700 --> 53:34.266 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
Over the next 12 hours, they
gently towed Jumbo, as it was
affectionately dubbed, back

53:34.266 --> 53:36.800 align:left position:12.5%,start line:93.33% size:87.5%
to the Sri Lankan coast.

53:36.800 --> 53:41.766 align:left position:0%,start line:73.33% size:100%
And as day turned to
night, rescue teams
reached their destination,
releasing Jumbo exhausted

53:42.900 --> 53:45.100 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
but alive into
the shallow water.

JUDY WOODRUFF: What
a happy ending.

53:50.533 --> 53:53.233 align:left position:12.5%,start line:86.67% size:87.5%
And who knew that
elephants could swim?

On the "NewsHour" online right
now: "NewsHour" producer David
Coles was working as a bartender

54:00.233 --> 54:04.066 align:left position:0%,start line:80% size:100%
in Greenwich Village on July 13,
1977, when a massive electrical
blackout struck New York

54:06.233 --> 54:09.166 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
City and lasted 25 hours.

54:09.166 --> 54:12.933 align:left position:12.5%,start line:80% size:87.5%
On the 40th anniversary,
Dave shares his memories
of those two days.
