THEY ARE NOT BLAMING TRUMP.

08:48.833 --> 08:50.933 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

SAY IN CONGRESS, "THIS RUSSIA

09:25.233 --> 09:26.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED TO CLINTON.

09:26.533 --> 09:27.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
WHEN HIS HEALTH CARE PLAN

09:27.700 --> 09:29.100 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%

09:30.466 --> 09:32.333 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
ONCE AGAIN, AND THIS ONE, I

09:32.333 --> 09:33.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THINK, IS REALLY SOMETHING WE'VE

09:33.966 --> 09:36.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
NEVER SEEN BEFORE, BECAUSE

09:36.200 --> 09:37.800 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
DONALD TRUMP IS NOT SEEN AS A

09:37.800 --> 09:40.633 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
LEGISLATIVE MASTER, NOT KEEN ON

09:40.633 --> 09:41.966 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE DETAILS, IN FACT WE'VE HAD

09:41.966 --> 09:44.200 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
REPUBLICANS IN MEDIA KIND OF

09:44.200 --> 09:45.500 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
POLITE IN SAYING HE DOESN'T

09:45.500 --> 09:47.266 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
KNOW MUCH OR CARE MUCH WHAT'S

09:47.266 --> 09:48.366 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
IN THE BILL.

09:48.366 --> 09:49.433 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
HE HAS SAID GIVE ME SOMETHING

09:49.433 --> 09:50.700 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
AND I'LL SIGN IT.

09:50.700 --> 09:52.533 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
SO IF IT WERE TO FAIL, WHO DO

09:52.533 --> 09:54.566 align:left position:0%,start line:93.33% size:100%
THE TRUMP FOLKS BLAME?
